Plato adhered to this idea and it was an important component of most Neoplatonic systems:\n\nTherefore, we may consequently state that: this world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.\n\nThe Stoics believed it to be the only vital force in the universe. Similar concepts also hold in systems of eastern philosophy in the Brahman-Atman of Hinduism, the Buddha-Nature in Mahayana Buddhism, and in the School of Yin-Yang, Taoism, and Neo-Confucianism as \"qi\".\n\nOther resemblances can be found in the thoughts of hermetic philosophers like Paracelsus, and by Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, Friedrich Schelling and in Hegel's \"Geist\" (\"Spirit\"/\"Mind\"). Ralph Waldo Emerson published \"The Over-Soul\" in 1841, which was influenced by the Hindu conception of a \"universal soul\". There are also similarities with ideas developed since the 1960s by Gaia theorists such as James Lovelock.\n\nIn Jewish mysticism, a parallel concept is that of \"Chokhmah Ila'ah,\" the all-encompassing \"Supernal Wisdom\" that transcends, orders and vitalizes all of creation. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov states that this sublime wisdom may be apprehended (or perhaps \"channeled\") by a perfect tzaddik (holy man). Thus, the tzaddik attains \"cosmic consciousness\" and thus is empowered to mitigate all division and conflict within creation.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Baalbek, Ottoman Syria (present-day Lebanon) but immigrated in his childhood to Safavid Iran with the rest of his family. He was one of the earliest astronomers in the Islamic world to suggest the possibility of the Earth's movement prior to the spread of the Copernican theory. He is considered one of the main co-founders of Isfahan School of Islamic Philosophy. In later years he became one of the teachers of Mulla Sadra.\n\nHe wrote over 100 treatises and books in different topics, in Arabic and Persian. A number of architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources. These may have included the Naqsh-e Jahan Square and Charbagh Avenue in Isfahan. He is buried in Imam Reza's shrine in Mashad in Iran.\n\nShaykh Baha' al-Din (also spelled Baha'uddin) Muhammad ibn Husayn al-'Amili was born near Baalbek, in Ottoman Syria (present-day Lebanon) in 1547. After the execution of al-Shahid al-Tani in 1558, his father's mentor, he and his family moved to the neighboring Safavid Empire; first to Isfahan, and from there to Qazvin, the then Iranian royal capital. At the time, the Safavid realm was ruled by king Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576). Tahmasp I appointed Shaykh Bahāʾī's father to serve as \"Shaykh al-Islām\" in several important Safavid cities in order to propagate Twelver Shi'ism amongst the population.\n\nShaykh Bahāʾī completed his studies in Isfahan. Having intended to travel to Mecca in 1570, he visited many Islamic countries including Iraq, Syria and Egypt and after spending four years there, he returned to Iran.\n\nShaykh Baha' al-Din died in 1621 in Isfahan. His body was buried in Mashhad according to his will.\n\nThe exact dates of his birth and death are different on his grave stone and on the ceramic of the walls of the room where he is buried in. \n\nDate of birth:\n\nDate of death:\n\nThe dates on the wall contain day, month and year, while the dates on the grave stone only contain month and year. The ceramics of the wall are made in 1945. It seems that at that time a research is performed about the exact dates, and, therefore, the information about the day is added to the dates.\n\nAccording to Bahá'í scholar ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávari, Shaykh Baha' al-Din adopted the pen name (\"takhallus\") 'Baha' after being inspired by words of Shi'a Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (the fifth Imam) and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (the sixth Imam), who had stated that the Greatest Name of God was included in either Du'ay-i-Sahar or Du'ay-i-Umm-i-Davud. In the first verse of the Du'ay-i-Sahar, a dawn prayer for the Ramadan, the name \"Bahá\" appears four times: \"Allahumma inni as 'aluka min Bahá' ika bi Abháh va kulla Bahá' ika Bahí\".\nHis descendants now live in all over Iran with a major concentration on Isfahan city. The family name of his new generation is \"Jabalameli\" or \"Jabal Ameli\" which attributes them to their origin land, which was Jabal Amel. They benefit from an elite reputation in theology, science and medicine.\n\nHis interest in the sciences is also apparent by some of his works and treaties, although many of his astronomical treatises are yet to be studied. He probably have written 17 tracts and books on astronomy and related subjects. The following are some his works in astronomy:\n\n\nShaykh Baha' al-Din's fame was due to his excellent command of mathematics, architecture and geometry. A number or architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources.\n\nShaykh Baha' al-Din is also attributed with architectural planning of the city of Isfahan during the Safavid era. He was the architect of Isfahan's Imam Square, Imam Mosque and Hessar Najaf. He also made a sun clock to the west of the Imam Mosque. There is also no doubt about his mastery of topography. The best instance of this is the directing of the water of the Zayandeh River to different areas of Isfahan. He designed a canal called Zarrin Kamar in Isfahan which is one of Iran's greatest canals. He also determined the direction of Qiblah (prayer direction) from the Naghsh-e-Jahan Square.\n\nHe also designed and constructed a furnace for a public bathroom, which still exists in Isfahan, known as \"Sheikh Bahaei's bathroom\". It is said that the furnace was warmed by a single candle, which was placed in an enclosure; and that the candle burned for a long time, warming the bath's water. It is also said that according to his own instructions, the candle's fire would be put out if the enclosure was ever opened. It is believed that this happened during the restoration and repair of the building and it was not possible to make the system work again. In fact, Sheikh Bahaei used the flammable gases that were naturally produced in a nearby cesspool for heating the bath's water. Recently in 1969-70 the bathroom heating system was excavated and some series of underground pipe lines made of sun dried clay were discovered. Even though there are many theories about the working of this heating system, it was concluded recently that he knew about biogas and the network was to guide toilet wells which were common to Iranian's houses and mosques.\n\nIt is said that he also designed the Manar Jonban (shaking minaret), which still exists in Isfahan; but this edifice was built in the fourteenth century during the Il-khanid period on the tomb of Amu Abdollah, a pious sheikh who died in that century.\n\nThe High Council of Cultural Revolution in Iran designated April 23 as the National Architect Day, marking the birth anniversary of Sheikh Bahaei.\n\nIn the Twelver tradition, Shaykh Bahai is regarded as a leading scholar of his age and a mujaddid of the seventeenth century. His erudition won him the admiration of Shah Abbas, and he was appointed the Sheikh ul-Islam of Isfahan after the death of the previous incumbent. He composed works on tafsir, hadith, grammar and fiqh (jurisprudence).\n\nShaykh Baha' al-Din was also an adept of mysticism. He had a distinct Sufi leaning for which he was criticized by Mohammad Baqer Majlesi. During his travels he dressed like a Dervish and frequented Sufi circles. He also appears in the chain of both the Nurbakhshi and Ni'matullāhī Sufi orders. In the work called \"Resāla fi’l-waḥda al-wojūdīya\" (Exposition of the concept of Wahdat al-Wujud (Unity of Existences), he states that the Sufis are the true believers, calls for an unbiased assessment of their utterances, and refers to his own mystical experiences. His Persian poetry is also replete with mystical allusions and symbols. At the same time, Shaykh Baha' al-Din calls for strict adherence to the Sharia as a prerequisite for embarking on the Tariqah and did not hold a high view of antinomian mysticism.\n\nShaykh Baha' al-Din contributed numerous works in philosophy, logic, astronomy and mathematics. His works include over 100 articles, epistles and books. Shaykh Baha' al-Din also composed poems in Persian. His outstanding works in the Persian language are \"Jāmi’-i Abbāsī\" and two masnavis (rhymed couplets) by the names of \"Shīr u Shakar\" (\"Milk and Sugar\") and \"Nān u Halwā\" (\"Bread and Halva\").\n\nHis other important work is the \"Kashkūl\", which includes stories, news, scientific topics, Persian and Arabic proverbs.\n\nHis also wrote \"Khulāṣat al‐ḥisāb\" (, lit. \"Essentials of arithmetic\"), an Arabic textbook that became popular throughout the Islamic world from Egypt to India until the 19th century. It was translated into German in Berlin by G. H. F. Nesselmann and published in 1843. A French translation appeared later 1854.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "359983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359983", "title": "Bhakti yoga", "text": "Bhakti yoga\n\nBhakti yoga, also called Bhakti marga (literally the path of \"Bhakti\"), is a spiritual path or spiritual practice within Hinduism focused on loving devotion towards a personal god. It is one of the paths in the spiritual practices of Hindus, others being Jnana yoga and Karma yoga. The tradition has ancient roots. Bhakti is mentioned in the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" where it simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor. \"Bhakti yoga\" as one of three spiritual paths for salvation is discussed in depth by the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\nThe personal god varies with the devotee. It may include a god or goddess such as Ganesha, Krishna, Radha, Rama, Sita, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Shiva, Parvati, Durga among others.\n\nThe \"Bhakti marga\" involving these deities grew with the \"Bhakti Movement\", starting about the mid-1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in South India. The movement was led by the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE. Bhakti marga is a part of the religious practice in Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism.\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"bhakti\" is derived from the root \"bhaj\", which means \"divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to\". The word also means \"attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation\".\n\nThe term \"yoga\" literally means \"union, yoke\", and in this context connotes a path or practice for \"salvation, liberation\". The \"yoga\" referred to here is the \"joining together, union\" of one's \"Atman\" (true self) with the concept of \"Brahman\" (true Reality).\n\nAccording to Samrat Kumar, bhakti yoga is an Indian tradition of \"divine love mysticism\", a spiritual path \"synonymous for an intimate understanding of oneness and harmony of the eternal individual with the Divine (the universal Being) and all creatures, a constant delight\".\n\nBhakti yoga is one of three \"yoga\" taught in \"Bhagavad Gita\". \"Bhakti yoga\" is, according to Peter Bishop, a devotee's loving devotion to a personal god as the path for spirituality. The other two paths are \"jnana yoga\", the path of wisdom where the Hindu pursues knowledge and introspective self-understanding as spiritual practice, while \"karma yoga\" is path of virtuous action (karma) neither expecting a reward nor consequences for doing the right thing, or \"nishkama karma\". Later, new movements within Hinduism added raja yoga as the fourth spiritual path, but this is not universally accepted as distinct to other three.\n\nThe \"Bhagavata Purana\" is a popular and influential text in the Vaishnavism traditions, and it discusses Ishvara pranidhana (devotion to a personal god). The Sanskrit text presents various modes of bhakti specifically to incarnations of Vishnu, particularly in terms of \"Narayana, Krishna\". According to Edwin Bryant, and other scholars, the Bhakti yoga taught in this text is inspired by \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\" and \"Bhagavad Gita\", and they focus on \"the ultimate truths of the individual self and its loving relationship with a personal god\". The presentation in the \"Bhagavata Purana\" is not in abstract terms, but through \"charming and delightful tales that capture the heart and mind\", the goal of Bhakti yoga, states Bryant.\n\nHinduism, in its scriptures such as chapter 7 of the \"Bhagavad Gita\", recognizes four kinds of devotees who practice Bhakti yoga. Some practice it because they are hard pressed or stressed by anxiety or their life's circumstances and see Bhakti yoga as a form of relief. The second type practice Bhakti yoga to learn about god out of curiosity and intellectual intrigue. The third type seek rewards in this or in afterlife through their Bhakti yoga. The fourth are those who love god driven by pure love, knowing and seeking nothing beyond that experience of love union.\nAccording to these Hindu texts, the highest spiritual level is the fourth, those who are devoted because of their knowledge of love. The \"Bhagavad Gita\" states that all four types of Bhakti yogi are noble because their pursuit of Bhakti yoga sooner or later starts the journey on the path of spirituality, it keeps one away from negativity and evil karma, it causes spiritual transformation towards the goal of Bhakti yoga, to \"know god as the essence within themselves and their true self always with god\".\n\nMajor traditions include the Shaiva who focus on Shiva theology; the Vaishnava who worship Vishnu or his avatars such as Krishna and Rama; and the Shakta who focus on goddess, also called \"Devi\" such as Durga, Kali, Lakshmi and Parvati. These are all considered as manifestations or aspects of the same metaphysical reality called Brahman in Hinduism.\n\nPanchayatana puja is a form of bhakti found in the Smarta tradition of Hinduism. It consists of the simultaneous worship of multiple deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata such as Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee's preference.\n\nPhilosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images (murti) are icons of \"saguna\" Brahman, a means to thinking about the abstract Ultimate Reality called \"nirguna\" Brahman. The five or six icons are seen by Smartas as multiple representations of the one Saguna Brahman (i.e., a personal God with form), rather than as distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman – as \"That art Thou\".\n\nThe Śaivasiddhānta tradition favors Bhakti yoga, emphasizing loving devotion to Shiva. Its theology presents three universal realities: the \"pashu\" (individual soul), the \"pati\" (lord, Shiva), and the \"pasha\" (soul's bondage) through ignorance, karma and maya. The tradition teaches ethical living, service to the community and through one's work, loving worship, yoga practice and discipline, continuous learning and self-knowledge as means for liberating the individual soul from bondage.\n\nThe historic Shaiva Siddhanta literature is an enormous body of texts. The Shaiva Siddhanta practices have focussed on abstract ideas of spirituality, worship and loving devotion to Shiva as SadaShiva, and taught the authority of the Vedas and Shaiva Agamas.\n\nBhakti of goddess is another significant tradition, one found in Shaktism. The theology of oneness and unity of \"the divine Goddess and the devotee\", their eternal fearless love for each other is a theme found in \"Devi Gita\", a text embedded inside the \"Devi-Bhagavata Purana\". The specific Bhakti yoga practices amongst Shakta are similar to those in other traditions of Hinduism. The Shakta devotion is common in eastern states of India, particularly West Bengal. The personal god here varies, and includes Durga, Tara Ma (Buddhist influence), Kali and to a lesser extent Saraswati, Lakshmi, Bharat Mata (land goddess), according to June McDaniel.\n\nThe Bhakti yoga tradition has been historically most associated with Vaishnavism. The personal god here is Vishnu or one of his avatars. In many regions, the loving devotion is either to Vishnu-Lakshmi (god-goddess) together, or through Lakshmi who is considered as the shakti of Vishnu. The specific \"avatar\" varies by the devotee and region, but the most common are Krishna and Rama.\n\nIn the Krishna-oriented traditions of Vaishnavism, the \"Chaitanya Charitamrita\" by Krishnadasa Kaviraja interprets the section 7.5.23-24 of \"Bhagavata Purana\" to teach nine types of \"bhakti\" sadhana, in the words of Prahlada. David Haberman translates them as follows:\n\nThese nine principles of devotional service were incorporated by Rupa Goswami linked to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as integral to spiritual practice focussed on Krishna.\n\nA movement led by Meher Baba states that \"out of a number of practices which lead to the ultimate goal of humanity – God-Realisation – \"Bhakti Yoga\" is one of the most important. Almost the whole of humanity is concerned with \"Bhakti Yoga\", which, in simple words, means the art of worship. But it must be understood in all its true aspects, and not merely in a narrow and shallow sense, in which the term is commonly used and interpreted. The profound worship based on the high ideals of philosophy and spirituality, prompted by divine love, doubtless constitutes true \"Bhakti Yoga\"\".\n\n\n"}

The statement was designed to defend the position of biblical inerrancy against a perceived trend toward liberal conceptions of Scripture.\n\nThe subsequent November 1982 Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics recognised the need to add a hermeneutical framework to the Statement.\n\nFinally the December 1986 conference adopted the Chicago Statement on Biblical Application.\n\nThe Inerrancy Statement elaborates on various details in articles formed as couplets of \"We affirm...\" and \"We deny...\". Under the statement, inerrancy applies only to the \"original manuscripts\" (which no longer exist, but which can be inferred on the basis of extant copies), not to the copies or translations themselves. In the Statement, inerrancy does \"not\" refer to a blind literal interpretation, and that \"history must be treated as history, poetry as poetry, hyperbole and metaphor as hyperbole and metaphor, generalization and approximation as what they are, and so forth.\" It also makes it clear that the signers deny \"that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood.\"\n\nSignatories to the statement came from a variety of evangelical Christian denominations, and included Robert Preus, James Montgomery Boice, Kenneth Kantzer, J. I. Packer, Francis Schaeffer, R. C. Sproul and John F. MacArthur.\n\nThe Hermeneutics Statement recognised that \"the values of a commitment [to inerrancy] are only as real as one's understanding of the meaning of Scripture\". It particularly aimed to address \"the meaning of the 'grammatico-historical exegesis' mentioned in Article XIII\".\n\nThe foci of the summit on Biblical Application were \"the Trinitarian foundations that must give shape to all the church's life and witness, and then on a number of community concerns that come under the heading of Christian social ethics. These themes were chosen partly for their intrinsic importance and partly because there is need to dispel doubts as to whether Bible believers can ever agree on how to respond to them. ... [It] offers a high degree of consensus as to how a trusted Bible directs prayer, planning and action in today's drifting society.\"\n\nLeading inerrantists regard the Chicago Statement as a very thorough statement of what they mean by \"inerrancy\".\n\nThe Statement has been compared to the Second Vatican Council Decree \"Dei verbum\" in addressing issues of the historical critical method and affirming inerrancy.\n\nOld Testament theologian Peter Enns, himself an evangelical scholar, highlights a significant weakness underlying the framing of the Statements: \"Much of what burdens CSBI can be summed up as failing to reflect adequately on the nature of inspiration. The irony is clear. In their efforts to protect biblical authority, the framers define inspiration in a way that does not account well for how the Bible actually behaves.\"\n\nTheologian Roger Olson recognised the political elements of the statements: \"In all such efforts, projects, there is a perceived 'enemy' to be excluded.\" He adds: \"When I look at the Chicago Statement on inerrancy and its signatories I believe it is more a political (in the broad sense) statement than a clear, precise, statement of perfect agreement among the signatories. In other words, what was really going on there... was driven by a shared concern to establish and patrol 'evangelical boundaries'.\"\n\nThe Hermeneutics statement was received negatively by scientists of Christian persuasion; it specifically came out against what it called \"evolutionism\":\n\nThe Biblical Application statement was also forthright in its denial of evolutionary thought: \"Mainstream Protestantism ... provides a cautionary tale in this regard, for it has erred in a radical way by acquiring the habit of regularly relativizing biblical teaching to current secular fashion, whether rationalist, historicist, evolutionist, existentialist, Marxist, or whatever. But this is to forget how sin darkens and misdirects the human intellect...\" and \"for our secular society insists on judging itself, not by the revelation of the Creator that the Bible sets forth, but by evolutionary, permissive, materialistic, hedonistic, and this-worldly\nyardsticks...\".\n\nThe Statements' rejection of the scientific consensus about evolution has been strongly criticised by thinkers within the evangelical community itself, such as by John Oakes: \"the important Chicago Inerrancy statements simply miss the target when addressing the relationship between science and the bible. ... [D]iscussions on science and the bible touch upon very important and profound theological issues, which require some amount of expounding, but none was given. The statements supply a surprisingly large number of articles and other declarations that insist that all the bible is literal, historical truth, including Genesis. Those articles, combined with Geisler's commentary to those articles, reveal contradictions, inconsistencies, and a healthy dose of lazy theology.\"\n\n"}

According to ethical calculus, the most ethical course of action in a situation is an absolute, but rather than being based on a static ethical code, the ethical code itself is a function of circumstances. The optimal ethic is the best possible course of action taken by an individual with the given limitations. \n\nWhile ethical calculus is, in some ways, similar to moral relativism, the former finds its grounds in the circumstance while the latter depends on social and cultural context for moral judgment. Ethical calculus would most accurately be regarded as a form of dynamic moral absolutism.\n\nFrancis Hutcheson devoted a section of his 1725 work \"Inquiry into the Original of our ideas and Beauty and Virtue\" to \"an attempt to introduce a Mathematical Calculation in subjects of Morality\".

Since then she has continued work as a senior research fellow of the college, pursuing her own particular interests in ethics.\n\nTaylor was born in 1927 and grew up in Berlin. Her early education was disturbed by the war and at the conclusion of hostilities she and her family found themselves in the British sector of the occupied city. She worked for a while with the Red Cross but ultimately was able to travel to England in 1947 to join a relative already in the country. She then worked part-time whilst also studying and then was successful in gaining a place at St Anne’s in 1952 to read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE). She went on to study for the BPhil in philosophy, which she completed in 1957.\n\nOn completing her BPhil, Taylor started her teaching career as a lecturer in philosophy at St Anne’s, working alongside Iris Murdoch, who had been a fellow of the college since 1948. Following a spell in Australia teaching at Canberra University College, on her return to England she rejoined the college as a lecturer in 1962 and became a fellow of the college in 1964.

Drawing from this observation, Girard described directly this operator from the proof and has given a formula, the so-called \"execution formula\", encoding the process of cut elimination at the level of operators.\n\nOne of the first significant applications of GoI was a better analysis of Lamping's algorithm for optimal reduction for the lambda calculus.

As the Middle Ages began, the monastic traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.\n\nThe progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk who died late in the 12th century. Guigo II's book \"The Ladder of Monks\" is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition. \n\nIn Eastern Christianity, the monastic traditions of \"constant prayer\" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and Evagrius Pontikos established the practice of hesychasm and influenced John Climacus' book The Ladder of Divine Ascent by the 7th century. These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century.\n\nFrom the 18th century some components of meditation began to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity. However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century. In 1965 one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution \"Dei verbum\" (Latin for \"Word of God\") emphasized the use of Lectio divina and on the 40th anniversary of \"Dei verbum\" in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.\n\nThe history and origins of Christian meditation have been intertwined with that of monastic life, both in the East and the West. By the 4th century, groups of Christians, who came to be called the Desert Fathers, had sought God in the deserts of Palestine and Egypt, and began to become an early model of monastic Christian life. The tradition of a Christian life of \"constant prayer\" in a monastic setting began in this period. I\n\nIn the 5th century, John Cassian described their life as prayerful and shaped by contemplation of God and Evagrius Ponticus wrote extensively on pure prayer and the Sayings of the Desert Fathers appeared thereafter. The \"prayer of fire\" that emerged in this period, was said to have been driven by the love for God, which was to shape a life of meditation and contemplation in the East. However, these \"desert meditations\" are not equivalent to the modern methods of reflection and meditation. The desert monks gathered to hear scripture recited in public, and would then recite those words privately in their cells. For them meditation was a memorization and recitation of scripture, primarily as a verbal exercise.\n\nBy the end of the 4th century, Martin of Tours had introduced monasticism to the West and the western monastic traditions began to take shape. By the 6th century, the Rule of Saint Benedict included three elements: public prayer, manual labor and lectio divina. The emergence of the Christian monastic tradition included the development of an austere and secluded lifestyle and practices that were intended to help meditation by freeing the mind from worldly matters, e.g. in his Rule for monastic life, Gregory the Great developed 12 steps towards asceticism based on abstinence and mortification of the flesh and search for humility. In order to avoid worldly contamination by seculars (i.e. not monks or clergy) the Rule of Saint Benedict forbade a monk from eating with them unless the monk was so far away that he could not return to the monastery that day. \nThe Rule of Saint Benedict (chapter #48) stipulated specific times and manners for \"Lectio Divina\" - a meditative reading of Scripture. Due to its specific blending of spirituality with moderation and balance, the Benedictine Rule became widely used by the 10th century, and became the de facto standard for Western monastic life in the Middle Ages.\n\nAfter the 10th century, during the Byzantine Empire, the traditions of the Desert Fathers led to a style of life and prayer in the Eastern Church called hesychasm, developed particularly on Mount Athos in Greece. St. Gregory of Sinai is generally considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer in early 14th century. Although controversies appeared thereafter between Barlam and St. Gregory Palamas, hesychasm was eventually well established within Eastern Christianity, but never made significant inroads in the West. While hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.\n\nThe practice of prayer had undergone very little change in the West from its origins until the 11th century, at which point a major change took place via the introduction of methods of meditation. Monasticism played a key role in bringing about this change, first to establish basic concepts about the forms of prayer, then introduce meditation and finally to emphasize that monastic prayer is inseparable from a specific \"way of life\". \n\nFrom the end of the 11th century two specific genres of literature for prayer appeared. The first was extensions of Augustinan forms of addressing God or oneself (e.g. his confessions or the Soliloquies). The \"Meditations of St. Augustine\" became a popular reading item. Saint Anselm composed \"Meditations and Prayers\" along similar lines, but it included no methodical elements and was simply a collection of material for Lectio Divina and the duration of the exercise was not specified. The second genre an example of which was Hugh of Saint Victor, tried to put more structure into meditation that was then available within the monastic tradition. Hugh wrote that there are three visions of the soul: \"thinking, meditation and contemplation\". Hugh aimed his meditations as a way towards contemplation of God.\" The approach was further developed by Guigo II whose \"Ladder of Monks\" is considered a key text in the field. This second genre lead to methodical prayer, and approaches in which the imagination holds a strong place. \n\nGuigi II (the 9th Carthusian prior) went beyond the meditations of Guigo I (the 5th prior). For Guigo II, reading scripture is an \"encounter with the word of God\", meditation is \"seeking the hidden meaning of this word\", prayer is \"turning one's heart to God\" and contemplation is when \"the mind is lifted up to God and held above itself\". Guigo II's Ladder of the Monks may well be the first description of the \"methodical prayer\" in the mystical traditions of the west. \n\nBy the 11th century Saint Anselm of Canterbury was producing meditative prayers, which however, still focused towards the monsatic traditions of Lectio Divina. Anselm began his Proslogion by calling it a \"short work on an example meditation on the meaning of faith\", and the meditations in the Proslogion are intended to lead the reader to a contemplation of God. Anselm's teachings, which greatly influenced the monastic meditation traditions of the Middle Ages were that meditation can lead to \"seeing the face of God in contemplation\".\n\nLate in the 14th century Gerard of Zutphen had built on \"Guigo's Ladder\" to write his major work \"On Spiritual Ascents\". Zutphen warned against considered meditation without reading of scripture, and taught that the reading prepares the mind, so meditation will fall into error. Similarly, he taught that meditation prepares the mind for contemplation. Zutphen's definition of meditation is generally considered the synthesis of medieval consensus on the topic of meditation:\n\nBy the 14th century, the practice of meditation in the West had become more systematic as the arrival of \"Devotio Moderna\" in Germany and the Netherlands introduced more structure into it through the writings of Geert Groote, Gerard of Zutphen and Jan Mombaer. By this time, the tradition of \"methodical prayer\" which arranged exercises day by day and week by week found significant following within the Catholic Church, as well as later Reformed communities. In the 15th century, Ignatius of Loyola developed the technique in which the meditator enters the Biblical scene, e.g. begins a conversation with Jesus on the Cross in Calvary. A similar idea had been developed by Ludolph of Saxony in his \"Vita Christi\" in 1374 in which the reader would make themselves present in the life of Jesus. \n\nDuring the 15th century, reforms of the clergy and monastic settings were undertaken by the two Venetians, Lorenzo Giustiniani and Louis Barbo. Both men considered methodical prayer and meditation as essential tools for the reforms they were undertaking. Barbo, who died in 1443, wrote a treatise on prayer titled \"Forma orationis et meditionis\" otherwise known as \"Modus meditandi\". He described three types of prayer; vocal prayer, best suited for beginners; meditation, oriented towards those who are more advanced; and contemplation as the highest form of prayer, only obtainable after the meditation stage. Based on the request of Pope Eugene IV, Barbo introduced these methods to Valladolid, Spain and by the end of the 15th century they were being used at the abbey of Montserrat. These methods then influenced Garcias de Cisneros, who in turn influenced Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nThe methods of \"methodical prayer\" as taught by the \"devotio moderna\" groups had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century. The book \"The Imitation of Christ\" which was known in Spain as \"Contemptus mundi\" became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied. Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, John of the Cross continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the 4 stages of Lectio Divina.\n\nFrom the 18th to the end of the 19th century the non-discursive components of meditation began to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity. By the middle of 19th century, the historical critical approach to biblical analysis which had started over a century earlier, and focused on determining the historicity of gospel episodes, had taken away some of the emphasis on biblical meditation outside monastic communities. However, in parallel, by the 19th century the importance of Biblical meditation had been firmly established in the Protestant spiritual tradition.\n\nThe non-discursive components or stages of meditative practice, which are often called \"contemplation\" in Western traditions, were beneficiaries of \"a positive attitude toward contemplation [that] characterized the first fifteen centuries of the Christian era.\" But \"a negative attitude has prevailed from the sixteenth century onward,\" according to Thomas Keating, a Trappist monk and a primary modern expositor of the Christian meditative method of Centering Prayer.\nKeating attributes the emergence of a negative attitude towards contemplation to several factors, including the 17th century controversy over Quietism and an increasing tendency to distinguish between \"discursive meditation if thoughts predominated; affective prayer if the emphasis was on acts of the will; and contemplation if graces infused by God were predominant... This division of the development of prayer into compartmentalized units entirely separate from one another helped to further the... notion that contemplation was an extraordinary grace reserved to the few.\"\n\nKeating states that the \"Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola\" are \"extremely important in order to understand the present state of spirituality in the Roman Catholic Church,\" but that there has been a \"tendency to reduce the \"Spiritual Exercises\" to a method of discursive meditation.\" \nThe early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival in the practice, and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century. In 1965 one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution \"Dei verbum\" (Latin for \"Word of God\") emphasized the use of Lectio divina. On the 40th anniversary of \"Dei verbum\" in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance and stated:\n\nThe 20th century has also witnessed a new focus on Biblical meditation. These may be defined as: \"the devotional practice of pondering the words of a verse or verses of Scripture with a receptive heart.\" Modern Biblical meditations may be designed to relate and connect the Biblical message to the modern world. Such Biblical meditations may correspond to specific seasons such as Lent with the meditation topic selected to interact with two or three readings of the Bible during weekdays or Sundays of Lent. The meditation sequence may begin by a summary of the Bible reading, then suggest specific ideas for meditation, then conclude with an appropriate prayer. Such meditations may also be designed not just for \"strong seasons\" such as Lent or Easter, but also for Ordinary Time. \n\nIn the 20th century methods of Christian meditations have been taught using relatively new devotions such as the Divine Mercy devotion.\n\n"}

In some sense, it is a type of hybrid dysgenesis when the growth disorder proves deleterious, making it the opposite of heterosis or hybrid vigour.\n\nHybrid growth disorders may be referred to as a growth dysplasia, especially when resulting in overgrowth, although this terminology may be confusing since the term dysplasia is commonly used to imply an impending cancer. However, a hybrid growth disorder is not caused by cancer.\n\nHybrid growth disorders are exhibited among a variety organisms, including ligers, tigons, hybrid mice, and hybrid dwarf hamsters.\n\nA study on hybrid mice which investigated the possible causes for hybrid growth disorders reveals genomic imprinting to have a major effect. Paternal imprinting may increase growth to maximize maternal resources allocated to his progeny, while maternal imprinting may suppress growth in favor of ensuring her own survival and equal allocation of resources between offspring. This suggests that the extent of a disorder depends on the combination of parental species and their respective sexes, as demonstrated by the Vrana study. The study concludes that hybrid growth disorders most commonly affect the heterozygous sex, as expected by Haldane's rule. This would also explain why hybrid growth disorders often appear to affect one sex more than the other.\n\nSimilarly, a study of hybrids between dwarf hamster species \"Phodopus campbelli\" and \"Phodopus sungorus\" suggests that gene imprinting causes abnormal interactions between growth-promoting and growth-repressing genes which regulate placental and embryonic growth.\n\n"}

{"id": "4820576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4820576", "title": "Ivan Orlov (philosopher)", "text": "Ivan Orlov (philosopher)\n\nOrlov, Ivan Efimovich (October 1 (old style) 1886 Galich, Kostroma district Russia – 1936) was a philosopher, a forerunner of relevant and other substructural logics, and an industrial chemist. The date of his death is unknown but is believed to have occurred no earlier than 1936.\n\nOrlov studied at the Natural Sciences Faculty of Moscow University. His academic career began in 1916, when he published several papers related to the method of inductive reasoning and the notion of inductive proof. For 7 years beginning 1916, he published no scientific work, presumably because of the political turmoil of the era. In the 1920s, he taught in the newly established Communist Academy, and was an officer at the Chemical Institute.\n\nIn 1923 Orlov resumed his academic activity, becoming very productive. Most of his papers were published in leading Soviet ideological journals, where he waxed polemical in the manner typical of that place and time. Orlov's work bore on the philosophy of mathematics and logic, specifically on the so-called dialectical logic, Marxist in nature. He wrote on the theory of probability, psychology, theory of music, and on chemical engineering.\n\nAnalyzing the development of the natural sciences, he sought to uncover their specific \"logic.\" According to Orlov, the laws of thought should be treated as formal rules, bounded by the laws of identity and contradiction. (When Orlov wrote this, the invention of natural deduction, the sequent calculus, and the semantic tableaux all lay in the future.) We must seek the semantic relation between antecedent and consequent. The main \"contradiction of logic\" manifests itself in the linkage of premise and corollary, and requires a logic different from the traditional one. If we insist that a corollary be a necessary condition of the premises then, according to Orlov, we necessarily arrive at a non-Aristotelian logic, dialectical in nature.\n\nOrlov proposed a logic of just this type in his work \"The Logic of Compatibility of Propositions\" published in 1928 in a Soviet mathematical journal. This paper analysed the problem of compatibility (noncompatibility) of propositions through the interpretative prism of an implication procedure. He also foresaw the translation of systems with intuitionistic negation into S4 modal logic with classical negation.\n\nOrlov's work was very little known for a long time, because his publications, all in Russian, were almost totally unknown outside of the Soviet Union. It is only with the post-World War II rise of what have come to be known as substructural logics (Restall 2000) that Orlov's pioneering role has gradually emerged. Substructural logics, a category including intuitionistic, relevant, linear logics, etc., can be obtained by restricting the natural deduction (\"structural\") rules for classical logic. For example, relevant logic does not employ the structural rule of weakening (also called the rule of monotonicity), and this rule is unlike the other structural rules (Dosen).\n\nOrlov believed in a mechanistic reduction of the laws of nature. He castigated the set theory of Georg Cantor, the theory of relativity (he believed in the existence of aether), and the heliobiology of A. Chizhevsky.\n\nAround 1928, Orlov ceased publishing logical and philosophical work, turning to industrial chemistry, specifically the production of bromine and iodine, and in translating German works on chemistry into Russian.\n\n"}

She is also co-editor of \"The Epistemology of Testimony\" and \"The Epistemology of Disagreement: New Essays.\"\n\nLackey graduated from Saint Mary's College in 1994 with a B.A. in philosophy and from the University of Chicago in 1995 with an M.A. in philosophy. In 2000, she graduated from Brown University with a Ph.D. in philosophy under the supervision of Ernest Sosa.\n\nLackey’s primary research interests lie in social epistemology. She is known for arguing against the traditional view of testimony, according to which testimony is a merely transmissive, rather than a generative, epistemic source. On this view, hearers can acquire knowledge on the basis of testimony only if the speakers themselves possess the knowledge in question and thus testimony transmits knowledge from one person to another without being able to generate knowledge in its own right. In \"Learning from Words: Testimony as a Source of Knowledge\", Lackey uses her widely discussed creationist teacher case to argue that the standard view is false and that testimony can in fact be generative. In this case, a creationist teacher rejects all of the evidence supporting evolutionary theory and thus fails to either believe or know that modern day Homo sapiens evolved from Homo erectus, but nevertheless reliably conveys this fact about Homo sapiens to her students. This shows that the teacher imparts knowledge to her students that she fails to possess herself. Lackey then advances a theory of the epistemology of testimony that focuses on the linguistic or communicative items in testimonial exchanges, such as statements and other acts of communication, rather than the internal states of speakers, such as states of knowing and believing.\n\nIn other work, Lackey argues that reasonableness, rather than knowledge, is the norm of assertion, that memory is a generative epistemic source, and that lying requires deception.\n\nLackey is also known for arguing against the claim central to virtue epistemology that knowledge should be understood in terms of the knower’s deserving credit for the truth of her belief. Lackey argues that the virtue epistemologist faces a dilemma: either the standards for deserving credit for a true belief are relatively high, or they are relatively low. If they are relatively high, then the virtue epistemologist cannot account for instances of knowledge from testimony, where the credit for the hearer’s true belief goes to the speaker. On the other hand, if the standards are relatively low, then the virtue epistemologist cannot distinguish between cases of genuine knowledge and Gettier cases where a person has a justified true belief by accident.\n\nLackey has received a number of awards, including a Charles A. Ryskamp Research Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Young Epistemologist Prize, and an Alice Kaplan Institute for the Humanities Fellowship.\n\n\nLackey is Editor-in-Chief of \"Episteme: Journal of Individual and Social Epistemology\",\nAssociate Editor of \"Philosophical Studies\", and an Epistemology Subject Editor for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nLackey was elected an At-Large Member of the Board of Officers for the American Philosophical Association in the first-ever association-wide vote for this position. Lackey will begin this three-year appointment July 1, 2014.\n\nLackey has been a guest on Philosophy Talk on the topic of disagreement, has discussed social epistemology with Alvin Goldman on Philosophy TV, and has been interviewed for .\n\n\n\n"}

He studied theology at Rostock and Bützow, and philosophy at Leipzig, where he took his doctors' degree. In 1776 he was appointed professor of moral philosophy and belles-lettres in the Joachimstal gymnasium at Berlin, and a few years later he became tutor to the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards Frederick William III.\n\nThe lessons which he gave his royal pupil in ethics and politics were published in 1798 under the title \"Fürstenspiegel\" (\"Mirror for Princes\"), and are a favourable specimen of his powers as a popular philosophical writer. In 1787 he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and in the same year he became director of the royal theatre, an office he resigned in 1794.\n\nBesides numerous dramas, some of which had a considerable success, Engel wrote several valuable books on aesthetic subjects. His \"Anfangsgründe einer Theorie der Dichtungsarten\" (\"Initial foundations for a theory of poetry types,\" 1783) showed fine taste and acute critical faculty if it lacked imagination and poetic insight. The same excellences and the same defects were apparent in his \"Ideen zu einer Mimik\" (1785), written in the form of letters.\nIt demonstrated a knowledge of human nature, and may be regarded as a kind of manual for actors.\n\nHis most popular work was \"Der Philosoph für die Welt\" (1775), which consists chiefly of dialogues on men and morals, written from the utilitarian standpoint of the philosophy of the day. His last work, a romance entitled \"Herr Lorenz Stark\" (1795), achieved a great success, by virtue of the marked individuality of its characters and its appeal to middle-class sentiment.\n\nHe wanted to make the German theatre the mirror of the national life, and he wrote several plays, but they were of little merit — \"Der dankbare Sohn\" and \"Edelknaben\" are examples.\n\nEngel's \"Sämtliche Schriften\" (\"complete writings\") were published in twelve volumes at Berlin in 1801–1806; a new edition appeared at Frankfort in 1851.\n"}

The shout is also sometimes used in the East Asian martial arts for a variety of purposes; in this context, \"katsu\" is very similar to the shout \"kiai\".\n\nThe word in Chinese means literally \"to yell\" or \"to shout\". In Japanese it has also developed the meaning of \"to browbeat\", \"to scold\", and \"hoarse\". \n\nIn the context of Chan and Zen practice, the word is not generally used in its literal meaning(s), but rather—much as with the martial arts shout of \"kiai\"—as fundamentally a means of focusing energy. When the Chan and Zen practice of the \"katsu\" first emerged in Jiangxi province in the south of Tang dynasty China in the 8th century CE, the word was pronounced roughly as /xat/, a pronunciation that is largely preserved in the Japanese \"on'yomi\" (\"Sino-Japanese\") reading of the character as , as well as in Cantonese and Southern Min Chinese.\n\nThe \"katsu\" shout, insofar as it represents a kind of verbal harshness and even violence, can be considered a part of the Mahāyāna Buddhist doctrine of \"skill-in-means\" (), which essentially teaches that even an action or practice which seems to violate Buddhist moral guidelines—in this case, the Noble Eightfold Path's injunction against \"abusive speech\"—is permissible, and even desirable, so long as it is done with the aim of ultimately putting an end to suffering and introducing others to the dharma, or teachings of Buddhism.\n\nThe most celebrated and frequent practitioner of the \"katsu\" was the Chinese master Línjì Yìxuán (?–866), and many examples of his use of the shout can be found in the \"Línjì-lù\" (臨済錄; Japanese: \"Rinzai-roku\"), or \"Record of Linji\", the collection of Linji's actions and lectures:\nThe use of the \"katsu\" stands in a tradition of antinomian methods, such as striking disciples with a stick or a fly whisk, which developed within the Mǎzǔ Dàoyī (709–788) lineage. Linji greatly developed and used the \"katsu\" technique. In one of his lectures, often termed as \"Linji's Four Shouts\" he distinguished four different categories of \"katsu\":\nThe Rinzai school continued the practice of the \"katsu\", as can be seen through the examples of the death poems of certain Rinzai priests:\n\n"}

He is an associate professor and principal research fellow within the department of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton where he specialises in the politics, philosophy and epistemology of technology. He is also a research fellow at the Web Science Trust and the conservative think-tank, the Centre for Policy Studies.\n\nIn \"Conservatism\" (2011), O'Hara developed the philosophy of 'small-c conservatism' that he originally outlined in \"After Blair\" (2005/7). He argued that conservatism must be a philosophy concerned with social change, and must be defensible using public reason. To that end, he defined conservatism as the knowledge principle plus the change principle. The knowledge principle, influenced by scepticism, states that:\n“because society and its mediating institutions are highly complex and dynamic with natures that are constantly evolving as they are co-constituted with the individuals who are their members, both data and theories about society are highly uncertain”.\n\nThe change principle adds:\n“because the current state of society is typically undervalued, and because the effects of social innovations cannot be known fully in advance, then social change (a) must always risk destroying beneficial institutions and norms and (b) cannot be guaranteed to achieve the aims for which it was implemented. It therefore follows that societies should be risk-averse with respect to social change, and the burden of proof placed on the innovator, not his or her opponents. It also follows that change, when it does come, should ideally be (a) incremental, (b) reversible where possible and (c) rigorously evaluated before the next incremental step”.\nInfluenced by Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, Michael Oakeshott and Friedrich Hayek, O'Hara distanced conservative philosophy from free-market liberalism and neo-conservatism. He also developed ideas about risk and uncertainty about the environment to sketch a type of green conservatism.\n\nOther projects have included co-authoring the script of \"Tomb Raider 4\" and an article in the \"Journal of Popular Culture\" on the film \"Carry On Cabby\"\n\n"}

The Gunzō Literary Prize, which he received at the age of 27 for an essay on Natsume Sōseki, was his first critical acclaim as a literary critic. While teaching at Hosei University, Tokyo, he wrote extensively about modernity and postmodernity with a particular focus on language, number, and money, concepts that form the subtitle of one of his central books: \"Architecture as Metaphor\".\n\nIn 1975, he was invited to Yale University to teach Japanese literature as a visiting professor, where he met Paul de Man and Fredric Jameson and began to work on formalism. Starting from a study of Natsume Sōseki, the variety of the subjects examined by Karatani became so wide that he earned the nickname \"The Thinking Machine\".\n\nKaratani collaborated with novelist Kenji Nakagami, to whom he introduced the works of Faulkner. With Nakagami, he published \"Kobayashi Hideo o koete\" (\"Overcoming Kobayashi Hideo\"). The title is an ironic reference to “Kindai no chokoku” (\"Overcoming Modernity\"), a symposium held in the summer of 1942 at Kyoto Imperial University (now Kyoto University) at which Hideo Kobayashi (whom Karatani and Nakagami did not hold in great esteem) was a participant.\n\nHe was also a regular member of ANY, the international architects' conference that was held annually for the last decade of the 20th century and that also published an architectural/philosophical series with Rizzoli under the general heading of \"Anyone\".\n\nSince 1990, Karatani has been regularly teaching at Columbia University as a visiting professor.\n\nKaratani founded the New Associationist Movement (NAM) in Japan in the summer of 2000. NAM was conceived as a counter–capitalist/nation-state association, inspired by the experiment of LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems, based on non-marketed currency). He was also the co-editor, with Akira Asada, of the Japanese quarterly journal, \"Hihyōkūkan\" (\"Critical Space\"), until it ended in 2002.\n\nIn 2006, Karatani retired from the chair of the International Center for Human Sciences at Kinki University, Osaka, where he had been teaching.\n\nKaratani has produced philosophical concepts, such as \"the will to architecture\", but the best-known of them is probably that of \"Transcritique\", which he proposed in his book \"Transcritique\", where he reads Kant through Marx and vice versa. Writing about \"Transcritique\" in the \"New Left Review\" of January–February 2004, Slavoj Žižek brought Karatani's work to greater critical attention. Žižek borrowed the concept of \"parallax view\" (which is also the title of his review) for the title of his own book.\n\nKaratani has interrogated the possibility of a (de Manian) deconstruction and engaged in a dialogue with Jacques Derrida at the Second International Conference on Humanistic Discourse, organized by the Université de Montréal. Derrida commented on Karatani's paper \"Nationalism and Ecriture\" with an emphasis on the interpretation of his own concept of écriture.\n\nIn English\n\nIn Japanese\n\n\n"}

The founder of the discipline of Visual History (or \"Histiconologia\"), he has devoted his professional life to the world of images, as well as to the direction of cultural and international institutions.\n\nGervereau has been actively engaged in the art world since the 1970s, having participated in exhibitions with several notable surrealists (Philippe Soupault, Belgian or Czech surrealists, Mirabelle Dors, Alfred Courmes, Maurice Rapin, Clovis Trouille, etc.). His artistic and cultural interests include the Dada movement, Proudhon, Charles Fourier, Guy Debord and the situationist movement. He is a member of the Collège de 'Pataphysique.\n\nIn 1977, he founded the pataphysico-situationnist review \"Aux poubelles de la Gloire\" with Guy Bodson. There were 13 issues and it finished in 1979. This was the beginning of his philosophy of relativity (\"Pour une philosophie de la relativité\", 2010) against relativism. He then built his theories about cultural ecology, evolutionism, necessity of diversity and movement (\"plurofuturo\"), of choice between past and future (\"retrofuturo\") and his struggle against those who have only one way to look at the world, inheritated from the past, and want to uniformise the entire planet (\"monoretros\").\n\nHe began then his long novel called \"L'homme planétaire\" (end of the 1970s). The middle part of this triptych was published by Sens & Tonka in 2001 with the title \"Ce livre n'est pas à lire\" (\"This Book is Not to be Read\"). It was chosen by the \"Les Inrockuptibles\" magazine and the radio channel France Culture as one of the seven best novels of the year. This book is an experiment in mixed media and local-global description in literature: the \"crossmedialism\". He will make the adaptation for manga of the third part of the tryptique with a Chinese artist Xin Ye (\"Mixplanet\", 2011).\n\nIn 1989, he built with Louis Rollinde a new artistic group with a new review in English and French: Painters of History (\"Les Peintres d'histoire\"). Exhibitions were held in Naples, Paris and Hanover. To struggle against the new maelstrom of images, he defended rarity in art and the difficulty to see with hidden images (\"La Disparition des images\", 2003). So, he combines art actions or art productions and the creation of unique pieces (\"Unik\" movement which defends rarity and magic).\n\nAfter he began to make short movies during the 1970s, he released eight movies. They are experimental documentaries belonging to the \"cinema espresso\" and were shown from 2009 to 2012 (and after). Official projections were made in January 2011 in the Reflet Médicis in Paris.\n\nHe agreed to become president of the See-socioecolo Network, founded in 2010 in Brazil and Canada (official website of the socioecolo evolutionnists). In the end of 2012 he published \"LE LOCAL-GLOBAL. Changer soi pour changer la planète\" (\"The Local-Global. Change yourself to change the Planet\") and was nicknamed for years \"Mister Local-Global\". Last but not least, in 2012, he made an artistic action in Hong Kong with the words: \"economy is a belief\". In France, he chose: \"nostalgia = cancer\". Other members act in Brazil and Canada, and in some other countries for the World Campaign \"Knowledge is beautiful\".\n\nHe creates the local-global annual meeting in Argentat sur Dordogne (France): Les Rencontres-Promenades \"Histoires de Passages...\". Cabu gave the drawing for the 1st edition (July 2015), which is his last poster, in December 2014.\n\nHe first worked in bookshops and in a bank (Crédit Agricole) to get money to live. He made the choice on October 1, 1978, to work in a museum. It had two consequences: first, to act for the transformation of the patrimonial institutions all over the world (look at the networks part in networks section); second, made the choice to base his researches on all kind of images because he discovered that 98% of the pieces in the collections interested nobody. Then, became the specialist of the World History of Images or \"Histiconologia\" (website for cultural education).\n\nHe became the curator of the Museum of Contemporary History (\"Musée d'Histoire contemporaine de la Bibliothèque de documentation internationale contemporaine\") in 1991 where he did a lot of exhibitions. In 1991, he founded the International Association of Museums of History (website of the International Association of Museums of History) and was the president for 14 years. In 1992, he founded the \"Group L'Image\" with Fabrice d'Almeida, Antoine de Baecque, Philippe Buton, Christian Delporte, Laurence Bertrand Dorléac, and David El Kenz. The review is distributed by Gallimard in France and Harvard University in the United States. There are many contributions such as his interview of Ernst Gombrich in London or Arturo Schwarz in Milan about Marcel Duchamp. International colloquiums were held (\"Où va l'histoire de l'art contemporain?\" / \"Where does the History of Contemporary Art go?\", \"Peut-on apprendre à voir?\" / \"How to learn to see?\", \"Quelle est la place des images en histoire?\" / \"What is the Place of Images in History?\" ) and websites were invented with the help of the French government or the European Commission (imagesmag.net, imageduc.net, primages.net) as CD-roms (collection [décrypter les images] |deciphere the images]). Now all these activities belong to the Institute of Images and website of cultural education.\n\nIn the Museum of Contemporary History, he works with a lot of different researchers and artists. He built comparative exhibitions (Germany and France during the 1920s, Great Britain and France during the 1960s), exhibitions about foreign countries as Yugoslav space or Russia and USSR and also exhibitions about difficult subjects concerning French history: propaganda under the Vichy Government (1991), War in Algeria (1992), history of immigration, Dreyfus Affair, Deportation, Images and colonies etc. In 2001, he became director of the Museum of Cinema-Henri Langlois in the Cinémathèque française in Paris.\n\nEvery two years, he organized world congresses with different subjects (\"How to organize a Multipolar World?\", April 2004 in Brazil). He led the EUROCLIO Network about history of Europe and heritage, helped by the European Commission from 1999 to 2003 with numerous institutions from all countries of the European Union and more. He built the Museums of Europe Network, founding the review of comparatist history \"Comparare\" with Jacques Le Goff, Eric Hobsbawm, Carlo Ginzburg, Rudolf von Thadden, Bronislaw Geremek. He wrote the book \"Vous avez dit musées? Tout savoir sur la crise culturelle\" / \"You said museums? To know everything about the cultural crisis\" (CNRS Editions).\n\nConcerning the question of images, he published a lot of books during 30 years. The general bibliography (except articles and conferences) is on: official website of Laurent Gervereau, look at \"traces\". Here are some main examples: about the method to analyse images, \"Voir, comprendre, analyser les images\" (La Découverte); with Cabu, educative comics for children, \"Le monde des images. Comprendre les images pour ne pas se faire manipuler\" (Robert Laffont); le \"Dictionnaire mondial des images\"/ \"World Dictionary of Images\" (Nouveau monde); the general history of images, \"Images, une histoire mondiale\" (Nouveau monde/CNDP); \"Un siècle de manipulations par l'image\" (Somogy Editions d'art), \"Inventer l'actualité\" (La Découverte), \"La Guerre mondiale médiatique\" (Nouveau monde), the exhibition and the book \"Les images mentent? Manipuler les images ou manipuler le public\": general website for cultural education. Some translations are done (in Portuguese and in Arabic), but there is still a lack for some important languages as English, Spanish or Chinese.\n\nGervereau is now the president of the Institut des Images and director of: general website for cultural education. In July 2013, he created on this website a monthly cultural video magazine: [decryptcult].\n\nIn 2004, he became also the director of the International Museum of Ecology: \"Musée du Vivant\" (du Vivant). He created a world network in UNESCO during the Congress of December 2005 in Te Papa Museum (New Zealand): Ecology and Sustainable Development Network. He wrote in 2011 \"Une histoire générale de l'écologie en images\" (\"A General History of Ecology in Images\", about the relations between humanity and environment from prehistory). In 2012, he organized with Christian Delporte the international colloquium \"Patrimoine de l'écologie et écologie du patrimoine\" / \"Heritage of Ecology, Ecology of Heritage\".\n\nThe historian Jacques Le Goff, who directed Annales review Annales School, wrote in the newspaper \"Le Monde\" (December 15, 2006) about the \"World Dictionary of Images\": \"President of the Institute of Images, Laurent Gervereau published a book that will be essential. He built a team to work on the question of all types of images, a team of exceptional specialists, artists or celebrated intellectuals or brilliant young researchers. We know that, after the last years of the 20th century, humanity has entered into the time of images. The sum realised by Gervereau is in the continuity of his book of method \"See, Understand, Analyse Images\" (La Découverte, first edition in 1994) and of the reflections about the new and fundamental object of the human contemporary reality, the visual, visual that he has studied through his book \"History of the Visual in the XXth Century\" (« Points histoire », Le Seuil, 2000). (...) Today, we entered with the Internet into the \"Time of accumulation\" and this book seems to be the first attempt to decode this new world of mass images in a global World.\"\n\n\nEight movies have been directed by Laurent Gervereau (1h45).

Lifespring said that more than 400,000 people participated in its trainings.\n\nThe cult, which promoted itself through books and word-of-mouth advertising, was the subject of investigative reports by the media, and was criticized by a few former staff members and participants. At least 30 lawsuits sought to hold Lifespring responsible for participants' deaths or their mental damages. The cult paid to settle some of the suits before trial and in other cases lost jury decisions.\n\nJohn Hanley Sr., Robert White, Randy Revell, and Charlene Afremow founded Lifespring in 1974. As of October 1987, Hanley owned 92.7 percent of the company. Prior to Lifespring, Hanley worked for the company Holiday Magic. He and the other founders also worked for Mind Dynamics with Werner Erhard, the founder of est, which became the basis for Landmark Education.\n\nLifespring concentrated on how people experience each other, whereas est dealt with changing the way people experience themselves. However, there were many similarities between the two.\n\nThe former Director for Corporate Affairs of Lifespring, Charles \"Raz\" Ingrasci, also worked with Erhard, promoting an est mission to the USSR and the Hunger Project. Ingrasci is now President of the Hoffman Institute which offers programs such as the Hoffman Quadrinity Process which some regard as similar to Lifespring.\n\nThough Hanley denied that Lifespring was a duplicate of est, in their 1992 book \"Perspectives on the New Age\" James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton describe the similarities as \"striking.\" They note that both Lifespring and est used \"authoritarian trainers who enforce numerous rules\", require applause after participants \"share\" in front of the group, and deemphasize reason in favor of \"feeling and action\". The authors also said that graduates of both Lifespring and est were \"fiercely loyal\", and recruited heavily for their respective groups, reducing marketing expenses to virtually zero.\n\nThe Lifespring training generally involved a three-level program starting with a \"basic\" training, an \"advanced\" breakthrough course, and a three-month \"leadership program\" which taught the students how to implement what they learned from the training into their lives. \"There is no hope\" is a fundamental theory in the course.\n\nStudies commissioned by Lifespring in the 1980s by researchers at Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSF, including Lee Ross, Morton Lieberman, and Irvin D. Yalom, found that an overwhelming majority of participants in this training called it either \"extremely valuable\" or \"valuable\" (around 90 percent). Many described the training as among the most profound experiences of their lives and said they were able to produce substantial results in their lives as a result of their participation.\nThe basic training was composed of successive sessions on Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday day and night, Sunday day and night, a Tuesday night post-training session ten days after graduation, and a post-training interview. Evening sessions began at 6:30 pm and lasted until 11:30 or 12 or later. Saturday sessions started at 10 am and lasted until approximately midnight. Sunday sessions started at 9 am and lasted until approximately 6 pm. The trainings were usually held in the convention facilities of large, easily accessible, moderate priced hotels (i.e., mid-town New York). A basic training was usually composed of 150–200 participants, while an advanced training was composed of 75-100 participants. Approximately 50 percent of advanced training graduates participated in the leadership program. Training also included alumni volunteers who served as small group leaders, several official staff, an assistant trainer, and a head trainer.\n\nThe training consisted of a series of lectures and experiential processes designed to show the participants a new manner of contending with life situations and concerns and how other possible explanations and interpretations may lead to different results. Some individuals complained that they felt harangued, embarrassed, or humiliated by the trainer during the training. A few individuals choose not to complete the training. Additionally, the trainer used many English words in a manner different from their usual meaning. \"Commitment\", for instance, was defined as \"the willingness to do whatever it takes\". \"Conclusion\" was defined as a belief. Also, words such as \"responsibility\", \"space\", \"surrender\", \"experience\", \"trust\", \"consideration\", \"unreasonable\", \"righteous\", \"totally participate\", \"from your head\", \"openness\", \"letting go\" were redefined or used so as to assign them a more specific meaning.\n\nThe book \"Evaluating a Large Group Awareness Training\" made comparisons between Lifespring and est.\n\nLifespring has been characterized as a form of \"Large Group Awareness Training\" in several sources.\n\nLawsuits were filed against Lifespring for charges ranging from involuntary servitude to wrongful death. The suits often said that the trainings placed participants under extreme psychological stress in order to elicit change. Lifespring was ordered to pay money to participants who required psychiatric hospitalization and to relatives of members who committed suicide, or otherwise died.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" published an article about the company in 1987. In it Hanley is quoted as saying, \"If a thousand people get benefit from the training, and one person is harmed, I'd can it. I have an absolute commitment for having this training work for every person who takes it.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Post,\" however, by 1987 Hanley and other Lifespring executives had known for more than a decade that some people sustained serious injuries from its training. As evidence, the \"Post\" cited:\n\n\nThe \"Post\" also reported in the same article that Hanley had been convicted of six counts of felony mail fraud in 1969, and was given a five-year suspended sentence.\n\nSoon after the conviction, Hanley joined Holiday Magic. The Wisconsin Justice Department sued him and others over a pyramid scheme involving the company. Hanley paid the state $1,750 to settle the case, but told the \"Post\" that he did so only to avoid the costs of hiring a lawyer, not because he had done anything wrong.\n\nIn 1980, a federal judge rejected Hanley's request to have the felony conviction removed from his record. His request for a presidential pardon was also denied.\n\nIn 1990 KARE-TV (Channel 11, Minneapolis-St. Paul) ran a segment called \"Mind Games?\" that Lifespring said was deceptive and sensationalized.\n\n\"The Skeptic\", a newsletter of The North Texas Skeptics, reported in 1989 on criticism from a participant and former staff volunteer who said the trainings were too stressful and disruptive, and that the program was \"an urban cult\".\n\nOne prominent critic of Lifespring is Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Mrs. Thomas said in an interview with the \"Post\" that she chose to seek counseling after her decision to stop participating in Lifespring. In order to avoid phone calls from fellow Lifespring members, urging her to remain in the course, she chose to hide in another part of the United States. One explanation for the criticisms and actions taken by roughly eight percent of all Lifespring graduates comes from clinical psychologist and Lifespring graduate Bronson Levin. Levin said, \"people who are not prepared for the intense emotional experience of Lifespring or who have hidden traumas tend to become overwhelmed as childhood memories come thundering back to them during training.\" Virginia Thomas went on to speak on panels and organized anti-cult workshops for congressional staffers in 1986 and 1988.\n\nWhile Lifespring no longer delivers training, 75 independent companies offer replicas or training employing many of the company's methods, in the United States and in nine other countries, according to Hanley. These include \"Discovery\" in Texas and in Southern California, and \"WorldWorks\", also in Southern California.\n\n\"Mastery In Transformational Training\", in Marina del Rey, is one out of five of the 75 independent companies that have established a formal relationship with John Hanley, Sr. by purchasing an official license.\n\n\"Leaders in Transformation\", also known as LIT, bases its methods on the Lifespring model.\n\n\"Choice Center\" in Las Vegas, Nevada, bases its methods on the Lifespring model.\n\n\"Gratitude Trainings in Charlotte, NC and Florida\" bases its methods on the Lifespring model.\n\n“Next Level Trainings” in Columbus, OH and also in Philadelphia, PA, bases its methods on the Lifespring model and has mentioned its influence in the trainings.\n\nPeter Pomerantsev examines a Russian version of the training program, \"Roza Mira\" (; \"The Rose of the World\"), in his 2014 book \"Nothing is True and Everything is Possible\". However, \"Roza Mira\" is largely based on the 1958 book of the same name by Daniil Andreyev, based on \"mystic visions\" he experienced while imprisoned for anti-Soviet propaganda. Another opinion is that \"Roza Mira\" training program/destructive sect is not based on Daniil Andreyev's book at all, there is nothing written in the book \"Nothing is True and Everything is Possible\" that implies any relation besides the organisers of \"Rosa Mira\" sect/program saying so, you can find it comparing information about the \"Rosa Mira\" sect/program in \"Nothing is True and Everything is Possible\" and Andreyev's book that critises sects and personality cults among other things.\n\n\n"}

The 'vital breath' (Tibetan:\"sog lung\" ) is considered the most important. It is \"the essence of life itself that animates and sustains all living beings\". Anuttarayoga Tantra practices from the Mahamudra meditation system, such as Guhyasamāja, Cakrasaṃvara and Hevajra tantras, provide various methods to penetrate the vital points of the Subtle Body. The 14th Dalai Lama summarises the practice: \"To penetrate these points means to gather there the energy-winds and the subtle minds that ride on them, basically by means of different types of absorbed concentration focused on these spots.\". Practices that work with the subtle energy winds includes tummo or 'Inner Fire', one of the Six Yogas of Naropa. In this practice, the yogin or yogini uses breathing and meditation techniques to draw the lung or subtle winds into the central channel and hold them there, traversing the body vertically.\n\nTsalung (Skt: \"nadi-vayu\"; Tib. \"rtsa rlung\"; where \"rtsa\" denotes an energetic channel) are special yogic exercises.

It analyses the connection between ideas of progress in culture generally and its application in evolutionary biology.\n\nIn this \"really big book\" (539 pages, plus notes), Michael Ruse surveys the attitude to progress throughout the history of biology, exploring the connections between the idea of progress and the belief that evolution is progressive (orthogenesis). He argues that from early nineteenth century speculation, Charles Darwin came to suggest that natural selection drove species to \"a higher stage of perfection\", jumping from relative to absolute progress. In this, Ruse argues, he was followed by many later biologists. Ruse interviews well-known evolutionary biologists such as Ernst Mayr, John Maynard Smith, Stephen Jay Gould, and E. O. Wilson, and both reports their views and gives his own opinion of how progressionist they were.\n\nThe book is illustrated with photographs of the major figures, such as Henry Fairfield Osborn and Sewall Wright, and a few drawings such as of the titanothere, an animal used by Osborn to illustrate \"orthogenetic evolution beyond the adaptive optimum\" There are a few diagrams such as William Bateson's schematic \"phylogeny\", a proposed tree of life for some invertebrate animals.\n\n\"Monad to Man\" was first published by Harvard University Press with cloth covers in 1996. They produced the first paperback edition in 2009.\n\nMakarand Paranjape, in an \"introductory essay\" for The International Society for Science and Religion, notes that Ruse was a \"key witness\" in the 1982 court case which decided that the attempt by Arkansas to ban the teaching of evolution in schools was unconstitutional. Paranjape writes that Ruse argues that evolutionary biology has been an immature science \"for much of its 150 year history\", because it has been tied to the Enlightenment's idea of progress. He suggests that Ruse is \"unapologetically, even unreflexively Euro-centric\", leaving out non-Western thinkers like Sri Aurobindo, and notes that Ruse ends by predicting that \"Progress will continue to dog evolutionary theory\" because as Ruse explains, the belief of evolutionists in scientific Progress [with a capital P] is so readily transferred into \"a belief in organic progress\".\n\nThe philosopher of science Ron Amundson, reviewing the book for \"The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science\", notes that Ruse thanks E. O. Wilson for urging him \"to write a really big book\", and quotes Peter J. Bowler as calling it \"an important book on the status of evolutionism that will almost certainly become embroiled in controversy\". Amundson observes that Ruse claims that evolutionary biology has nearly always been seen as only doubtfully a professional scientific discipline, and that Ruse's thesis is that this is because it has always been tied to \"culturally biased concepts of progress\". Whether this is actually \"bad\" is, suggests Amundson, almost irrelevant as long as biologists have thought it so, but since normative (value) judgements such as of progress cannot be derived from observation they are from a methodological point of view not part of science. All the same, he argues, Ruse is an analytic and empiricist philosopher, not at all social-constructivist. Amundson finds Ruse's handling of the morphological traditions \"less satisfactory\" than of the adaptationist, Darwinian traditions, and doubts whether Richard Owen was a social progressionist just because he was influenced by \"Naturphilosophie\". He compares Ruse unfavourably with Betty Smokovitis's \"obsessive concern with historiography\", and calls Ruse's writing style \"bluff, unselfconscious, and opinionated\" and finds Ruse sarcastic, \"scarcely a neutral observer\". On the other hand, he notes, Ruse is completely open about when he is \"sensing\" (guessing) something. Amundson concludes that Ruse has certainly shown that evolution and progress \"have been closely linked\", and his narrative of the people and ideas \"rich and compelling\", but finds Ruse's claim that biology has been shaped by biologists's embarrassment at this connection debatable.\n\nThe biologist and philosopher Michael Ghiselin notes that biologists agree that there is progress in biology and in technology, and that anatomists \"do not seem too unhappy with the idea\" of something much like that sort of progress in evolution, but that biologists have had trouble finding a theory of progress that did not lead into problems with ideology and \"bad metaphysics\". He criticises Ruse for \"politically correct\" \"academic bigotry\", disagrees with Ruse's narrative about phylogenetics, and accuses him of \"completely ignor[ing] recent work such as by Carl Woese, \"neglect[ing] data\" that contradict his thesis. Ironically, in Ghiselin's view, Ruse's own epistemological ideal for science relies on the idea of Progress.\n"}

{"id": "22884719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22884719", "title": "Philosophy of color", "text": "Philosophy of color\n\nWithin the philosophy of color, there is a dispute between color realism, the view that colors are physical properties that objects possess, and color fictionalism, a species of error theory viewing colors according to which there are no such physical properties that objects possess.\n\nOne of the topics in the philosophy of color is the problem of the ontology of color. The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind of properties colors are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation of colors, and the relationship between the representation of colors and their ontological constitution.\n\nWithin the ontology of color, there are various competing types of theories. One way of posing their relationship is in terms of whether they posit colors as sui generis properties (properties of a special kind that can't be reduced to more basic properties or constellations of such). This divides color primitivism from color reductionism. A primitivism about color is any theory that explains colors as unreducible properties. A reductionism is the opposite view, that colors are identical to or reducible to other properties. Typically a reductionist view of color explains colors as an object's disposition to cause certain effects in perceivers or the very dispositional power itself (this sort of view is often dubbed \"relationalism\", since it defines colors in terms of effects on perceivers, but it also often called simply dispositionalism - various forms of course exist). An example of a notable theorist that defends this kind of view is the philosopher Jonathan Cohen.\n\nAnother type of reductionism is color physicalism. Physicalism is the view that colors are identical to certain physical properties of objects. Most commonly the relevant properties are taken to be reflectance properties of surfaces (though there are accounts of colors apart from surface colors too). Byrne, Hilbert and Kalderon defends versions of this view. They identify colors with reflectance types.\n\nA reflectance type is a set, or type, of reflectances, and a reflectance is a surface's disposition to reflect certain percentages of light specified for each wavelength within the visible spectrum.\n\nBoth relationalism and physicalism of these kinds are so called realist theories, since apart from specifying what colors are, they maintain that colored things exist.\n\nPrimitivism may be either realist or antirealist, since primitivism simply claims that colors aren't reducible to anything else. Some primitivists further accept that, though colors are primitive properties, no real or nomologically possible objects have them. Insofar as we visually represent things as colored - on this view - we are victims of color illusions. For this reason primitivism that denies that colors are ever instantiated is called an error theory.\n\nIf color fictionalism is true, and the world has no colors, should one just stop color discourse, and all the time wear clothes that clash with each other? \"Prescriptive color fictionalism\" would say no. In \"prescriptive color fictionalism\", while color discourse is, strictly speaking, false, one should continue using it in everyday life as though color properties do exist.\n\nColor vision became an important part of contemporary analytic philosophy due to the claim by scientists like Leo Hurvich that the physical and neurological aspects of color vision had become completely understood by empirical psychologists in the 1980s. An important work on the subject was C. L. Hardin's 'Color for Philosophers,' which explained stunning empirical findings by empirical psychologists to the conclusion that colors cannot possibly be part of the physical world, but are instead purely mental features.\n\nDavid Hilbert and Alexander Byrne have devoted their careers to philosophical issues regarding color vision. Byrne and Hilbert have taken a minority position that colors are part of the physical world. Nigel J.T. Thomas provides a particularly clear presentation of the argument. The psychologist George Boeree, in the tradition of J. J. Gibson, specifically assigns color to light, and extends the idea of color realism to all sensory experience, an approach he refers to as \"quality realism\".\n\nJonathan Cohen of UCSD and Michael Tye of University of Texas have also written many essays on color vision. Cohen argues for the uncontroversial position of color relationalism with respect to semantics of color vision in Relationalist Manifesto. In The Red and the Real, Cohen argues for the position, with respect to color ontology that generalizes from his semantics to his metaphysics. Cohen's work marks the end of a vigorous debate on the topic of color that started with Hardin.\n\nMichael Tye argues, among other things, that there is only one correct way to see colors. Therefore, the colorblind and most mammals do not really have color vision because their vision differs from the vision of \"normal\" humans. Similarly, creatures with more advanced color vision, although better able to distinguish objects than people, are suffering from color illusions because their vision differs from humans. Tye advanced this particular position in an essay called \"True Blue\".\n\nPaul Churchland of UCSD has also commented extensively on the implication of color vision science on his version of reductive materialism. In the 1980s Paul Churchland's view located colors in the retina. But his more recent view locates color in spectral opponency cells deeper in the color information stream. Paul Churchland's view is similar to Byrne and Hilbert's view, but differs in that it emphasized the subjective nature of color vision and identifies subjective colors with coding vectors in neural networks.\n\nMany philosophers follow empirical psychologists in endorsing color irrealism, the view that colors are entirely mental constructs and not physical features of the world. Surprisingly, most philosophers who have extensively addressed the topic have attempted to defend color realism against the empirical psychologists who universally defend color antirealism (a.k.a. irrealism).\n\nJonathan Cohen of UCSD has edited a collection of essays on the topic of color philosophy called Color Vision and Color Science, \"Color Ontology and Color Science\".\n\n\n"}

She is also well known for her work on pornography and objectification.\n\nLangton was born in 1961 in Ludhiana, India to David Langton and his wife Valda. They were lay missionaries. She attended Hebron School, Coonoor and Ootacamund, India. In 1980 she moved to Australia and attended the University of New England. In 1981 she enrolled at the University of Sydney where she majored in philosophy. There she became interested in Kant. Her Honours thesis argued that Kant's scientific realism did not fit with his idealism. She graduated with First Class Honours in 1986. She was one of a group of women honours graduates at the time encouraged to continue their studies by applying to graduate school in the United States. In 1986 Langton moved to the United States and began graduate work at Princeton University in the philosophy department. While studying social philosophy at Princeton she became interested in the philosophical debates on free speech and pornography.\n\nIn 1990, before writing her PhD thesis, Langton moved back to Australia. From 1990-98 she was a Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in the Philosophy department of Monash University in Melbourne.\n\nLangton received her PhD in 1995 from Princeton. Her thesis advisor was Margaret Dauler Wilson; and her thesis topic was \"Kantian Humility\".\n\nIn 1998 Langton was a Fellow in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University.

{"id": "32929611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32929611", "title": "Saviour Bernard", "text": "Saviour Bernard\n\nSaviour Bernard (1724-1806) was a Maltese medical practitioner, a scientist, and a major philosopher. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were mostly philosophical psychology and physiology. Unfortunately, no portrait of Bernard has been located as yet.\n\nBernard was born at Valletta, Malta, on November 29, 1724, from French parents. His family seems to have been well-off, enough, at least, to give Bernard a good initial formation, one which was probably better than that of his peers.\n\nAt the young age of nineteen, in 1743, Bernard was sent to the south of France, at Aix-en-Provence, to study medicine and surgery at the University of Aix-en-Provence there. He graduated in June 1749, at the age of twenty-four.\n\nIt was during that same year that Bernard, then already back in Malta, published in Sicily what turned out to be his life’s major work, entitled \"Trattato Filosofico-Medico dell’Uomo\" (See below: \"Magnum opus\").\n\nIn 1752, Bernard was appointed the principal officer of public health by the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. He was also appointed medical superintendent of two major hospitals of the Knights Hospitallers, Santo Spirito, at Rabat, and Lazzaretto, on Manoel Island.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, Bernard worked hard to cure the diseased stricken by the epidemic influenza. On this occasion he is said to have showed outstanding proficiency and resourcefulness.\n\nDuring the very last years of the Knights Hospitallers’ rule, when Bernard was in his late seventies, the Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim graciously granted the aged doctor and philosopher a pension equal to his salary, something which was not normal practice in those days. In return, Bernard continued to provide his services whenever asked for as long as his health held out. He finally retired in 1801, at the age of seventy-seven, when by then the Knights Hospitallers had long been expelled from Malta.\n\nBernard died at Rabat, Malta at the age of eighty-two on March 7, 1806.\n\n\nThe book, which is composed of 111 pages, opens with a dedicatory letter and a table of contents. Then it is divided in eight chapters. In his opening letter, Bernard goes at some length to justify the significance of his work despite his relatively young age (of just twenty-four). The chapters respectively deal with (1) the nature of human beings, (2) their bodily functions, (3) their sensitive faculties, (4) their intellectual faculties, (5) the relation between their sensitive and intellectual faculties, (6) the dependence of bodily movements upon the intellect, (7) the effect of the intellect upon bodily movements, and finally (8) the nature of the ‘internal life’ of the intellect.\n\nThese are a few quotations from Bernard’s \"Trattato\":\n\nBoth of the following works contain interesting reflections which might interest philosophy. The second one especially. It is written in a curious style, its theme is rather intriguing, and the philosophical arguments brought forth are quite interesting.\n\n\nThe following three tracts, all unpublished, are not of any philosophical interest. They might, however, be interesting and valuable from a medical point of view.\n\n\nBernard lived during the turbulent times when the Knights Hospitallers were ousted from the Maltese islands by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. Despite the fact that the French, in turn, were overthrown by the Maltese, and later driven out in 1800 by the British, the Knights Hospitallers were not reinstated. Bernard lived his last years during the ‘temporary’ rule of the British.\n\nThese developments must not have been to Bernard’s liking. He was very proud of his Christian faith and also very fond of the Knights Hospitallers. To see them reduced to a nonentity must have been difficult for him to acknowledge.\n\nIn terms of his philosophical positions, Bernard must be considered to be a modern philosopher. He wrote in the pre-Kantian period of modern philosophy when two main schools of thought, namely rationalism and empiricism, opposed each other despite their common inheritance of the characteristic Cartesian prejudice of the whole of modern philosophy – viz. that what man knows directly and immediately are not things themselves but his own ‘ideas’.\n\nBernard was not a rationalist in the sense that he adopts the ‘geometrical method’ which characterised the writings of Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz. Nor is Bernard a rationalist in the sense of excluding supernatural faith. While Descartes in the \"Discourse on Method\" attempts to construct knowledge entirely on reason and not on dogma or faith, Bernard takes the existence of God for granted and accepts the immortality of the soul on the basis of faith. Bernard can be labelled a rationalist only in a very wide sense; only in so far as he highly values the rational qualities of man (bequeathed upon him by God). His emphasis on man as a rational animal, and his discourse in the preface to his \"Trattato\" concerning the spirit of his attempt to illumine the minds of men, are grounds for considering his work to be part and parcel of the enlightenment culture of the 18th century.\n\nIn any stricter (epistemological) sense of the word ‘rationalist’, Bernard should rather be considered as adhering to the opposite camp. He takes sensorial \"experience\" as the point of departure for the acquisition of knowledge. He criticises the theory of innate ideas – characteristic of the rationalist stream of thought in modern philosophy – and points out that the mind is at birth a \"tabula rasa\" or rather a blank slate awaiting ideas from experience. He thinks that ideas are derived from experience, and this is highly reminiscent of the empiricism of Locke. However, he does seem to have the greatest sympathy for Malebranche (who belongs, in the epistemological sense of the word, to the rationalist school) out of all philosophers, except on this basic issue of the origin of ‘ideas’.\n\nThere is hardly any indication whatsoever of indebtedness to Thomistic philosophy in Bernard’s work despite his repeated professions of deference to the Catholic Church. His tacit rejection, rather than explicit opposition, to the central features of the anthropology of Aquinas, notably its anti-dualism, is, however, not surprising and possibly unintended.\n\nIn academic circles, Bernard is revered more as a philosopher than as a medical doctor. This might be because his major writing, even if written in his youth, is more of a philosophical nature than anything else. It might be also due to the fact that Bernard is generally eclipsed by his more well-known contemporary, Joseph Demarco.\n\nIn any case, since 1995, when Bernard’s \"Trattato\" was presented to the public as a work worthy of philosophical consideration, more and more attention was given to the work by philosophers. Unfortunately, Claude Falzon's excellent translation of it, made in 1998, is still to be published. Falzon’s work also includes a philosophical study of Bernard’s book as an introduction. Nevertheless, further investigations would certainly be more than fitting, especially to amplify the biographical data concerning Bernard’s life, times and also his professional and academic activities.\n\n\nPhilosophy in Malta\n"}

{"id": "1491324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1491324", "title": "The Unreality of Time", "text": "The Unreality of Time\n\n\"The Unreality of Time\" is the best-known philosophical work of the Cambridge idealist J. M. E. McTaggart (1866–1925). In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, \"The Nature of Existence\".\n\nThe argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by C. D. Broad 1933 and L. O. Mink 1960). R. D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the 1st Volume of \"The Nature of Existence\" (Ingthorsson 1998 & 2016).\n\nIt is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series. Since the A- and the B- series exhaust possible conceptions of how reality can be temporal, and neither is adequate, the conclusion McTaggart reaches is that reality is not temporal at all.\n\nTo frame his argument, McTaggart initially offers a phenomenological analysis of how time appears to us in experience. Time appears, he says, in the form of events standing in temporal positions, of which there are two kinds. On the one hand events are earlier than and later than each other, and on the other hand they are future, present, and past, and continually changing their position in terms of futurity, presentness, and pastness. The two kinds of temporal positions each represent events in time as standing in a certain order which McTaggart chooses to call the A-series and the B-series. The A-series represents the series of positions determined as future, present, and past, and which continuously pass from the distant future towards the present, and through the present into the remote past. The B-series represents the series of positions determined as earlier than or later than each other. The determinations of the B-series hold between the events in time, and never change. If an event ever is earlier or later than some other event, then their respective position in time never changes. The determinations of the A-series must hold to something outside of time, something that does not itself change its position in time, but in relation to which the events in time pass from being future, present, and past. Surprisingly, McTaggart does not suggest the present, or NOW, as this something whose position in time is fixed and unchanging. He just says that it will be difficult to identify any such entity (seeing as it is outside time). Broad explains that McTaggart believed that the difficulty of identifying this entity was serious enough in its own right to be persuaded that time is unreal, but thinks that the contradiction of the A-series is still more convincing, wherefore he leaves this particular difficulty aside.\n\nMcTaggart argues that the conception of time as only forming a B-series is inadequate because the B-series does not change, and change is of the essence of time. If any conception of reality represents it as changeless, then this is a conception of an atemporal reality. The B-series does not change because earlier-later relationships never change (e.g. the year 2010 is always later than 2000). The events that form a B-series must therefore also form an A-series in order to count as being in time, i.e. they must pass from future to present, and from present to past, in order to change.\n\nIt should be noted that the A- and B-series are not mutually exclusive. If events form an A-series they automatically also form a B-series (anything in the present is earlier than anything in the future, and later than everything past). The question is not therefore whether time forms an A- or a B-series; the question is whether time forms both an A- and a B-series, or only a B-series.\n\nThe proponents of the B-view of time typically respond by arguing that even if events do not change their positions in the B-series, it does not follow that there can be no change in the B-series. This conclusion only follows if it is assumed that events are the only entities that can change. There can be change in the B-series in the form of objects bearing different properties at different times (Braithwaite 1928; Gotshalk 1930; Marhenke 1935; Smart 1949; Mellor 1981 & 98; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1991; Dyke 2002).\n\nThe suggestion that the B-view of time can escape the problem by appealing to particulars that endure through time and have different properties at different times is controversial in its own right, but it is generally assumed that this is a controversy that has nothing to do with McTaggart. Instead it is treated as a separate issue, the question of whether things can endure in B-time. However, as Ingthorsson has argued, McTaggart does discuss variation in the properties of persistent entities in the 1st Volume of The Nature of Existence, and there comes to the conclusion that variation in the properties of things between times is not change but mere variation between the temporal parts of things (Ingthorsson 2001).\n\nAttacking the A-series, McTaggart argues that any event in the A-series is past, present, \"and\" future, which is contradictory in that each of those properties excludes the other two. McTaggart admits that the contradictory nature of the A-series may not be obvious, because it would appear that events never are simultaneously future, present, and past, but only successively so. However, there is a contradiction, he insists, because any attempt to explain why they are future, present, and past, \"at different times\" is (i) \"circular\" because we would need to describe the successive order of those \"different times\" again by invoking the determinations of being future, present \"or\" past, and (ii) this in turn will inevitably lead to a \"vicious infinite regress\". The vicious infinite regress arises, because to explain why the second appeal to future, present, and past, doesn't lead again to the same difficulty all over, we need to explain that they in turn apply successively and thus we must again explain that succession by appeal to future, present, and past, and there is no end to such an explanation. It is the validity of the argument in favour of a vicious infinite regress that has received the most attention in 20th Century philosophy of time.\n\nIn the later version of the argument, in \"The Nature of Existence\", McTaggart no longer advances the circularity objection. This is, arguably, because by then he has come to treat tense as a simple and indefinable notion, and thus cannot argue that the terms need to be explained at all in order to be applied. He now instead argues that even if it is admitted that they are simple and indefinable, and thus can be applied without further analysis, they still lead to contradiction.\n\nPhilosophers who favour the B-view of time tend to find McTaggart's argument against the A-series to demonstrate conclusively that tense involves a contradiction. On the other hand, philosophers who favour the A-view of time struggle to see why the argument should be considered to have any force. Two of the most commonly invoked objections are, first, that McTaggart is mistaken about the phenomenology of time; that he is claiming to see a contradiction in the appearance of time, where none is apparent. Second, that McTaggart is mistaken about the semantics of tensed discourse. The idea here is that claims like \"\"M\" is present, has been future, and will be past\" can only imply a contradiction if it is interpreted as saying that \"M\" is all at once future in the past, present in the present, and also past in the future. This reading, it is argued, is absurd because \"has been\" and \"will be\" indicate that we are not talking about how \"M\" currently \"is\", but instead of how \"M\" once was, but is no longer, and how it will be, but is not yet. Hence it is wrong to think of the expression as an attribution to \"M\" of futurity, presentness, and pastness, all at once (Marhenke 1935; Broad 1938; Mink 1960; Prior 1967; Christensen 1974; Lloyd 1977; Lowe 1987).\n\nIngthorsson has argued that the reason for this incommensurability between the proponents of the A- and B-views is found in the prevailing view that McTaggart's argument is a stand-alone argument. If it is read in that way, the proponents of each view will understand the argument against the background of their respective views of time, and come to incompatible conclusions (1998 & 2016). Indeed, on closer scrutiny it will be found that McTaggart explicitly claims that in \"The Unreality of Time\" he is inquiring whether reality can have the characteristics it appears to have in experience (notably being temporal and material) given his earlier conclusions about what reality must really be like in Absolute Reality. In the introduction to the 2nd Volume of \"The Nature of Existence\", he says: Starting from our conclusions \"as to the general nature of the existent, as reached in the earlier Books,\" we shall have to ask, firstly which of these characteristics can really be possessed by what is existent, and which of them, in spite of the \"primâ facie\" appearance to the contrary, cannot be possessed by anything existent (1927: sect. 295).And he continues:It will be possible to show that, \"having regard to the general nature of the existent as previously determined\", certain characteristics, that we consider here for the first time, cannot be true of the existent (1927: sect. 298).As Ingthorsson notes, the most central result of McTaggart's earlier inquiry into the general nature of the existent in Absolute Reality, an inquiry McTaggart claims is based entirely on a priori arguments (i.e. such as do not rely on any empirical observations), is that existence and reality coincide and have no degrees: either something exists and thus is real, or it does not. It immediately follows that for the future and past to be real, they must exist. This is why he interprets the statement \"\"M\" is present, has been future, and will be past\" as a statement about \"M\" existing in the present bearing the property of being present, and existing in the past bearing the property of being future, and existing in the future bearing the property of being past. This interpretation of the expression, if correct, does say that \"M\" is future, present, and past, which is contradictory. However, since it starts from the premise that the future and past can only be real by existing, then it remains to show that this is what the A-view of time assumes.\n\nHaving come to the conclusion that reality can neither form an A- nor a B-series, despite appearances to the contrary, then McTaggart finds it necessary to explain what the world is really like such that it appears to be different from what it appears to be. Here is where the C-series comes into play. McTaggart does not say much about the C-series in the original journal article, but in \"The Nature of Existence\" he devotes six whole chapters to discuss it (1927: Chs. 44–9).\n\nThe C-series is rarely given much attention. When it is mentioned, it is described as \"an expression synonymous with 'B-series' when the latter is shorn of its temporal connotations\" (Shorter 1986: 226). There is a grain of truth in this, but there is more to the C-series than this. Stripping the temporal features from the B-series only gives what the C- and B-series have \"minimally in common\", notably the constituents of the series and the formal characteristics of being linear, asymmetric, and transitive. However, the C-series has features that the B-series does not have. The constituents of the C-series are \"mental\" states (a consequence of McTaggart's argument in Ch. 34 of \"The Nature of Existence\" that reality cannot really be material), which are related to each other on the basis of their conceptual content in terms of being \"included in\" and \"inclusive of\" (1927: sect. 566 & Ch. 60). These atemporal relations are meant to provide what the earlier/later than relation cannot, notably explain why an illusion of change and temporal succession can arise in an atemporal reality.\n\nMcTaggart's argument has had an enormous influence on the philosophy of time. His phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time has been accepted as good and true even by those who firmly deny the end conclusion that time is unreal. For instance, J. S. Findlay (1940) and A. Prior (1967) took McTaggart's phenomenological analysis as their point of departure in the development of modern tense logic.\n\nMcTaggart's characterisation of the appearance of time in terms of the A- and B-series served to sharpen the contrast between the two emerging and rival views of time that we now know as the A- and B-views of time. The assumption is that the A-view, in accepting the reality of tense, represent time as being like an A-series, and that the B-view, in rejecting the reality of tense, represent time as being like a B-series.\n\nThe two objections that McTaggart develops against the conception of time as forming an A- and a B-series are still the two main objections with which the A- and B-views of time struggle. Is the A-view contradictory, and is the B-view able to incorporate an account of change.\n\nThe controversy about McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time continues unabated (see, for instance, Smith 2011; Cameron 2015; Mozersky 2015; Ingthorsson 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It started in the 1960s and 1970s when Episcopalians and Lutherans, and Tres Dias offered Cursillo. In 1978, The Upper Room of the General Board of Discipleship of the United Methodist Church trademarked Emmaus and tried to make the Roman Catholic program into a primarily Protestant version.\n\nIn the Catholic Church Emmaus began for women in 1978, with the approval of the Archdiocese of Miami. It was developed and conducted by a team of laywomen from St. Louis Church in Kendall (Miami). Father David G. Russell, who was pastor at that time, saw the need for, and envisioned, a parish-based retreat that enabled lay women to minister to lay women. He approached the secretariat of the Cursillo movement and asked if they would allow a parish-based Cursillo to be held at St. Louis. This request was denied. Since there was no other retreat of this type available at that time, Father Russell asked the Directress of Religious Education, Myrna Gallagher, to form a team and develop one. After intense prayer and much thought, it was established that the theme of the retreat would be based on the Scripture passage found in the Gospel of Luke 24:13-35, the Emmaus Reading.\n\nIn early 1985 Larry Barfield and Jim Loretta from St. Louis Catholic Church, along with Fr. Jim Fetcher, were discussing what kind of ministry would be good for men within the church. Catholic Cursillo offered a wonderful retreat for Catholics already on a journey, but there was nothing for Catholic men who were struggling with their walk. The present men's club was not very active whereas the Hard Hat Ministry was very active, but not very spiritual in its goals. The group's consensus was that a ministry that would reach into the heart of the Parish and pull out those men who \"came to church\" but were \"not involved\". From this discussion, a team was formed and the first Men's Emmaus was held at the Dominican Retreat House. Eventually, one of the candidates from a previous weekend called to say they would like to have the same retreat at St. Brendan’s Catholic Church. Larry Barfield from St. Louis went to St. Brendan’s and put on the first \"not at St. Louis\" Men's Emmaus weekend, held at the youth center next to Mercy Hospital in Coconut Grove. Thereafter an event was held at St. John Neumann Catholic Church, and the program expanded thenceforth. Since that time in 1986, Christian Emmaus retreats have spread throughout the entire United States, every country in Central and South America, Trinidad, Dominican Republic, and even to Shanghai, China. A retreat was even held underground in Cuba 2012.\n\nEmmaus Retreats are different from the Catholic Cursillo. Cursillo aims to form \"Catholic leaders\" from those Catholics already on a walk with the Lord. Emmaus reaches out to all Christians who are members of church. Participants are encouraged to find ways to live out their individual call to discipleship in their home, church, and community. Today Emmaus retreats are held worldwide.\n\nThe name of the movement comes from the Gospel of Luke 24:13-53 (King James Version).\n\nIn this passage, a follower of Jesus of Nazareth named Cleopas, also identified as Simon, and another unnamed traveler leave Jerusalem for the town of Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection. On the journey the two travelers encounter an unnamed man who asks about the happenings over the past few days in Jerusalem concerning Jesus of Nazareth. Cleopas and his companion describe the events of that week. They tell about Jesus' trial, crucifixion, and burial. They also share that some of the women who followed Jesus discovered the tomb in which Jesus was buried empty. The unnamed man then proceeds to explain the writings of the prophet Moses concerning God's Messiah or Christ.\n\nWhen the three travelers reach Emmaus, they share a meal. During the blessings of the meal, it is revealed to Cleopas and his companion that the unnamed man who accompanied them is none other than Jesus whom God has raised from the dead. In that moment of recognition, Jesus disappears from their presence. Cleopas and his companion immediately return to Jerusalem to tell the other followers of Jesus that he has appeared to Simon in his resurrected, glorified body.\n\nLuke also records that the moment of recognition of the resurrected Jesus was in the blessing and breaking of bread, a reference to the Passover seder Jesus shared with his disciples commonly known as the Last Supper. Also, it is a reference to the Christian sacrament or ordinance or act of worship known among different branches of Christianity as Eucharist or Holy Communion or Lord's Supper.\n\n"}
{"id": "1619933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1619933", "title": "Woodblock printing", "text": "Woodblock printing\n\nWoodblock printing (or block printing) is a technique for printing text, images or patterns used widely throughout East Asia and originating in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 AD. Woodblock printing existed in Tang China during the 7th century AD and remained the most common East Asian method of printing books and other texts, as well as images, until the 19th century. \"Ukiyo-e\" is the best known type of Japanese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique for printing images on paper are covered by the art term woodcut, except for the block-books produced mainly in the 15th century in India.\n\nPrior to the invention of woodblock printing, seals and stamps were used for making impressions. The oldest of these seals came from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The use of round \"cylinder seals\" for rolling an impress onto clay tablets goes back to early Mesopotamian civilization before 3000 BC, where they are the most common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. A few much larger brick (e.g. 13×13 cm) stamps for marking clay bricks survive from Akkad from around 2270 BC. There are also Roman lead pipe inscriptions of some length that were stamped, and amulet MS 5236 may be a unique surviving gold foil sheet stamped with an amulet text in the 6th century BC. However none of these used ink, which is necessary for printing (on a proper definition), but stamped marks into relatively soft materials. In both China and Egypt, the use of small stamps for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In Europe and India, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus; this was probably also the case in China. The process is essentially the same—in Europe special presentation impressions of prints were often printed on silk until at least the 17th century.\n\nThe wood block is carefully prepared as a relief pattern, which means the areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife, chisel, or sandpaper leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block was cut along the grain of the wood. It is necessary only to ink the block and bring it into firm and even contact with the paper or cloth to achieve an acceptable print. The content would of course print \"in reverse\" or mirror-image, a further complication when text was involved. The art of carving the woodcut is technically known as \"xylography\", though the term is rarely used in English.\n\nFor colour printing, multiple blocks are used, each for one colour, although overprinting two colours may produce further colours on the print. Multiple colours can be printed by keying the paper to a frame around the woodblocks.\n\nThere are three methods of printing to consider:\n\n\nIn addition, \"jia xie\" is a method for dyeing textiles (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th-6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.\n\nThe earliest woodblock printing known is in colour—Chinese silk from the Han dynasty printed in three colours.\nOn paper, European woodcut prints with coloured blocks were invented in Germany in 1508 and are known as chiaroscuro woodcuts.\n\nColour is very common in Asian woodblock printing on paper; in China the first known example is a Diamond sutra of 1341, printed in black and red at the Zifu Temple in modern-day Hubei province. The earliest dated book printed in more than 2 colours is \"Chengshi moyuan\" (), a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606 and the technique reached its height in books on art published in the first half of the 17th century. Notable examples are the Hu Zhengyan's \"Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio\" of 1633, and the \"Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual\" published in 1679 and 1701.\n\nIn Japan, a multi-colour technique called \"nishiki-e\" (\"brocade pictures\") spread more widely, and was used for prints from the 1760s on. Japanese woodcut became a major artistic form, although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting.\n\nIn both Europe and Japan, book illustrations were normally printed in black ink only, and colour reserved for individual artistic prints. In China, the reverse was true, and colour printing was used mainly in books on art and erotica.\n\nThe earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from China and are of silk, printed with flowers in three colours from the Han dynasty (before AD 220). It is clear that woodblock printing developed in Asia several centuries before Europe. The Chinese were the first to use the process to print solid text, and equally that, much later, in Europe the printing of images on cloth developed into the printing of images on paper (woodcuts). It is also now established that the use in Europe of the same process to print substantial amounts of text together with images in block-books only, came about four hundred years after the development of movable type by Bi Sheng (990–1051) during the Northern Song Dynasty of China, .\n\nIn China, an alternative to woodblock printing was a system of reprography since the Han Dynasty using carved stone steles to reproduce pages of text. The three necessary components for woodblock printing are the wood block, which carries the design cut in relief; dye or ink, which had been widely used in the ancient world; and either cloth or paper, which was first developed in China, around the 3rd century BC or 2nd century BC. Woodblock printing on papyrus seems never to have been practised, although it would be possible.\n\nA few specimen of wood block printing, possibly called \"tarsh\" in Arabic, have been excavated from a 10th-century context in Arabic Egypt. They were mostly used for prayers and amulets. The technique may be spread from China or an independent invention, but had very little impact and virtually disappeared at the end of the 14th century. In India the main importance of the technique has always been as a method of printing textiles, which has been a large industry since at least the 10th century. Large quantities of printed Indian silk and cotton were exported to Europe throughout the Modern period.\n\nBecause Chinese has a character set running into the thousands, woodblock printing suits it better than movable type to the extent that characters only need to be created as they occur in the text. Although the Chinese had invented a form of movable type with baked clay in the 11th century, and metal movable type was invented in Korea in the 13th century, woodblocks continued to be preferred owing to the formidable challenges of typesetting Chinese text with its 40,000 or more characters. Also, the objective of printing in the East may have been more focused on standardization of ritual text (such as the Buddhist canon Tripitaka, requiring 80,000 woodblocks), and the purity of validated woodblocks could be maintained for centuries. When there was a need for the reproduction of a text, the original block could simply be brought out again, while moveable type necessitated error-prone composition of distinct \"editions\".\n\nIn China, Korea, and Japan, the state involved itself in printing at a relatively early stage; initially only the government had the resources to finance the carving of the blocks for long works. The difference between East Asian woodblock printing and the Western printing press had major implications for the development of book culture and book markets in East Asia and Europe.\n\nWoodblock printing in China is strongly associated with Buddhism, which encouraged the spread of charms and sutras. In the Tang Dynasty, a Chinese writer named Fenzhi first mentioned in his book \"Yuan Xian San Ji\" that the woodblock was used to print Buddhist scriptures during the Zhenguan years (AD 627~649).\n\nThe oldest existing print done with wood-blocks was discovered in 1974 in an excavation in Xi'an (the capital of Tang-Dynasty China, then called Chang'an), Shaanxi, China, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them. It is a \"dharani\" sutra printed on hemp paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang Dynasty has also been found, the \"Saddharma pundarika\" sutra printed from 690 to 699.\n\nAn early example of woodblock printing on paper is The Great Dharani Sutra that is dated between AD 704 and 751. It was found at Bulguksa, South Korea in 1966. Its Buddhist text was printed on a mulberry paper scroll in the early Korean Kingdom of Unified Silla. Another version of the Dharani sutra, printed in Japan around AD 770, is also frequently cited as an example of early printing. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by Empress Shōtoku. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the \"Hyakumantō Darani\" (百万塔陀羅尼, \"1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani\").\n\nThe world's earliest dated (AD 868) printed book is a Chinese scroll about sixteen feet long containing the text of the Diamond Sutra. It was found in 1907 by the archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, and is currently in the possession of the British Library. The book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing. The colophon, at the inner end, reads: \"Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]\".\n\nIn late 10th century China the complete Buddhist canon Tripitaka of 130,000 pages was printed with blocks, which took between 1080 and 1102, and many other very long works were printed. Early books were on scrolls, but other book formats were developed. First came the \"Jingzhe zhuang\" or \"sutra binding\", a scroll folded concertina-wise, which avoided the need to unroll half a scroll to see a passage in the middle. About AD 1000 \"butterfly binding\" was developed; two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a codex with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the bindings were sewn rather than pasted. Only relatively small volumes (\"juan 卷\") were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a \"tao\", with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 \"juan\" in 595 \"tao\".\n\nThe earliest known woodblock printing dates from 764-770, when Empress Shotoku commissioned one million small wooden pagodas containing short printed scrolls—typically —to be distributed to temples. Apart from the production of Buddhist texts, which became widespread from the 11th century in Japan, the process was only adopted in Japan for secular books surprisingly late, and a Chinese-Japanese dictionary of 1590 is the earliest known example.\n\nThough the Jesuits operated a movable type printing-press in Nagasaki, printing equipment which Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army seized from Korea in 1593 had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, Tokugawa Ieyasu, even before becoming \"shōgun\", effected the creation of the first native movable type, using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.\n\nAn edition of the Confucian \"Analects\" was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of Emperor Go-Yōzei. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the running script style of Japanese writing would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.\n\nThe technology quickly gained popularity among publishers, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. As a result, Japan began to see something of literary mass production and increasing literacy. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, \"kibyōshi\" (satirical novels), \"sharebon\" (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the \"jōruri\" (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the \"jōruri\" theatre scripts, a particular style of writing would come to be the standard for that genre; in other words, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.\n\nThe technique is found through South and Central Asia, and in the Byzantine world for cloth, and by AD 1000 examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in Islamic Egypt. Printing onto cloth had spread much earlier, and was common in Europe by 1300. \"In the 13th century the Chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to Europe\", soon after paper became available in Europe. The print in woodcut, later joined by engraving, quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as playing cards and other uses.\n\nMany early Chinese examples, such as the Diamond Sutra (above) contain images, mostly Buddhist, that are often elaborate. Later, some notable artists designed woodblock images for books, but the separate artistic print did not develop in China as it did in Europe and Japan. Apart from devotional images, mainly Buddhist, few \"single-leaf\" Chinese prints were made until the 19th century.\n\nBlock-books, where both text and images are cut on a single block for a whole page, appeared in Europe in the mid-15th century. As they were almost always undated and without statement of printer or place of printing, determining their dates of printing has been an extremely difficult task. Allan H. Stevenson, by comparing the watermarks in the paper used in blockbooks with watermarks in dated documents, concluded that the \"heyday\" of blockbooks was the 1460s, but that at least one dated from about 1451. Block books printed in the 1470s were often of cheaper quality, as a cheaper alternative to books printed by printing press. Block books continued to be printed sporadically up through the end of the 15th century.\n\nThe most famous block-books are the Speculum Humanae Salvationis and the Ars moriendi, though in this the images and text are on different pages, but all block-cut. The Biblia pauperum, a Biblical picture-book, was the next most common title, and the great majority of block-books were popular devotional works. All block-books are fairly short at less than fifty pages. While in Europe movable metal type soon became cheap enough to replace woodblock printing for the reproduction of text, woodcuts remained a major way to reproduce images in illustrated works of early modern European printing. (\"See also:\" Old master print.)\n\nMost block-books before about 1480 were printed on only one side of the paper — if they were printed by rubbing it would be difficult to print on both sides without damaging the first one to be printed. Many were printed with two pages per sheet, producing a book with opening of two printed pages, followed by openings with two blank pages (as earlier in China). The blank pages were then glued together to produce a book looking like a type-printed one. Where both sides of a sheet have been printed, it is presumed a printing-press was used.\n\nThe method was also used extensively for printing playing cards.\n\nIn East Asia, woodblock printing proved to be more enduring than in Europe, continuing well into the 19th century as the major form of printing texts, especially in China, even after the introduction of the European printing press.\n\nIn countries using Arabic, Turkish and similar scripts, works, especially the Qur'an were sometimes printed by lithography in the 19th century, as the links between the characters require compromises when movable type is used which were considered inappropriate for sacred texts.\n\nNianhua were a form of coloured woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the Chinese New Year.\n\nDr. Henry, in his \"Notes on the Economic Botany of China,\" refers to your wish to obtain specimens of the woods used in China for printing blocks. The name which the neighbouring city of Wuchang enjoys for the excellence of its printing work has led me to inquire into the woods used there, and I am sending you specimens of them by parcel post. The wood which is considered the best is the Veng li mu, which has been identified as the Pyrus betulcefolia, Bunge., and which grows in this Province. Slabs of this wood 1 ft. x 6 ins. x 1^ in. cost 150 cash, or about 5½.d. A cheaper wood generally used for printing proclamations is the tu chung mu. Eucommia ulmoides, Oliv., has been determined to be the tu chung mu. The tu chung here used is a native of this Province. A wood used in Kiangsu is the yin hsing mu, which is one of the names of the Salisburia adiantifolia. Boxwood, huang yang mu, is obtained from Szechuen, but only in small pieces, which are mainly used for cutting the stamps used for private seals on letters and documents. <br>\n\nIn the third volume of the Japanese work, the \"So Mokn Sei Fu,\" a drawing is given of the huang yang, together with a quotation from the Chinese Materia Medica, which speaks of the tree as growing an inch a year, except in these years which have an intercalary moon, when it grows backwards. From this it would appear to be a slow growing tree.\n\nW. R. Carles, Esq., to Royal Gardens, Kew, dated Her Majesty's Consulate, Hankow, July 25, 1896.\n\nBlock printing has also been extensively used for decorative purposes such as fabrics, leathers and wallpaper. This is easiest with repetitive patterns composed of one or a small number of motifs that are small to medium in size (due to the difficulty of carving and handling larger blocks). For a multi-colour pattern, each colour element is carved as a separate block and individually inked and applied. Block printing was the standard method of producing wallpaper until the early 20th century, and is still used by a few traditionalist firms. It also remains in use for making cloth, mostly in small artisanal settings, for example in India.\n\nWilliam Morris was one artist who used woodblock printing to produce patterned wallpaper and textiles during the late 19th century. Examples of Morris' work are housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The museum also holds a number of Morris' original woodblocks, which are still in limited use.\n\n\n"}

It is commonly called a form of Qigong, despite the differences from other Qigong methods in Zhan zhuang's orientation.\n\nThe original Zhan zhuang were health methods used by Daoists; in recent centuries, martial artists who already had static standing methods combined these with the internal mechanics of Zhan zhuang to create a superior exercise. The goal of Zhan zhuang in martial arts has always been to develop a martially capable body structure, but nowadays most practitioners have again returned to a health-preservation orientation in their training, and few teach Zhan Zhuang as a martial method.\n\nThe word \"Zhan zhuang\" is the modern term; it was coined by Wang Xiangzhai. Wang, a student of Xing Yi Quan, created a method of Kung Fu-based entirely upon Zhan zhuang, known as Yiquan, \"Intent Fist.\" Yiquan's method of study is Zhan zhuang plus movements that continue the feeling of the Standing Post in action.\n\nThe most common Zhan zhuang method is known as \"Hún Yuán\" (浑圆, \"Completely Round,\" \"Round Smoothness\") or \"Chēng Bào\" (撑抱, \"Tree Hugging\" stance). This posture is entirely Daoist in its origins, has many variations, and is the main training posture in all branches of Yiquan. This practice has recently also become common practice in Taiji and Qigong schools. In Xing Yi Quan, the practice of \"Sān Tǐ Shì\" (三體勢 / 三体势, \"Heaven, Earth, and Man\") has been a root practice for centuries.\n\nThose unfamiliar with Zhan zhuang can experience severe muscle fatigue and subsequent trembling at first. Later, once sufficient stamina and strength have been developed, the practitioner can use Zhan zhuang to work on developing the sensation of \"opposing forces,\" as well as one's central equilibrium and sensitivity to specific areas of tension in the body.\n\nZhan Zhuang has a strong connection with Traditional Chinese Medicine. Some schools use the practice as a way of removing blockages in Qi flow. This blockage removal occurs because Zhan zhuang, when correctly practiced, has a normalizing effect on the body. Any habitual tension or tissue shortening (or lengthening) is normalized by the practice, and the body regains its natural ability to function optimally. It is thought that a normalized body will be less prone to muscular-skeletal medical conditions, and it is also believed that Zhan zhuang, when practiced for developing relaxed postures, will lead to a beneficial calming effect. The Dan Tian is also involved in the practice of Zhan zhuang.\n\nThe amount of time spent practicing Zhan zhuang varies between styles and schools; one may spend anywhere from two minutes to two hours standing in one posture.\n\nMany styles, especially the internal styles, combine Post Standing with Qigong training and other coordinated-body methods to develop whole-body coordination for martial purposes. The martial practice is thought to strengthen the body's Central Nervous System and develop the coordination required for effective martial performance. In Yiquan, a clear distinction is made between \"health\" postures and \"martially oriented\" postures. In Bagua Zhang's circle-walking practice, the upper body is held as a Zhan zhuang posture, while the lower body is more dynamic.\n\n\n\n"}
