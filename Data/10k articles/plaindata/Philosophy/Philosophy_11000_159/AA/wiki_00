{"id": "601219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601219", "title": "Antoun Saadeh", "text": "Antoun Saadeh\n\nAntoun Saadeh (; 1 March 1904 – 8 July 1949) was a Lebanese philosopher, writer and politician who founded the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.\n\nSaadeh was born in 1904 in Dhour El Choueir, Mount Lebanon. He was the son of a Lebanese Christian Orthodox physician, Khalil Saadeh and Naifa Nassir Khneisser. His father was himself a Syrian nationalist as well as democracy advocate, and also an intellectual and author, who has been described as \"a prolific writer and polymath, whose works span the fields of politics, literature, journalism, novel-writing, and translation\". Antoun Saadeh completed his elementary education in his birth town and continued his studies at the Lycée des Frères in Cairo and came back to Lebanon at the death of his mother. In the later part of 1919, Saadeh emigrated to the United States, where he resided for approximately one year with his uncle in Springer, New Mexico and worked at a local train station. In February 1921, he moved to Brazil with his father who was a prominent Arabic-language journalist. In 1924, Saadeh founded a secret society which aimed at the unification of \"Natural Syria\". This society was dissolved the following year. \"Natural Syria\", according to Saadeh, included the Levant, Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and parts of Southern Turkey. His concept of Syria included all religious, ethnic and linguistic groups living in this region. During his time spent in Brazil, Saadeh learned German and Russian. Ultimately, he became a polyglot fluent in seven languages : Arabic, English, Portuguese, French, German, Spanish and Russian.\n\nIn July 1930, he returned to Lebanon. In 1931, he wrote \"A Love Tragedy\" which was first published with his \"Story of the Holiday of Our Lady of Sidnaya\" in Beirut in 1933. Also, in 1931, Saadeh worked at the daily newspaper \"Al-Ayyam\", then in 1932 he taught German at the American University of Beirut. In 1933, he continued to publish pamphlets in the Al-Majalia magazine in Beirut.\n\nOn 16 November 1932, Saadeh secretly founded the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Three years later, on 16 November 1935, the existence of the party was proclaimed, and Saadeh was arrested and sentenced to six years imprisonment. During his confinement, he wrote his first book, \"The Rise of Nations\". He was released from prison early, but was once again detained in June 1936 where he wrote another book, \"Principles Explained\". In November of the same year, he was released from prison, but in March 1937, he was arrested again. During the time he spent in prison, he wrote his third book, \"The Rise of the Syrian Nation\", but his manuscript was confiscated and the authorities refused to return it to him.\n\nHe was released from prison in late May 1937. In November 1937, Saadeh founded the newspaper \"Al-Nahdhah\". Saadeh led the party until 1938 then, for the second time, he left the country in order to establish party branches in the Lebanese emigration countries. Saadeh went to Brazil and founded the newspaper \"New Syria\". Soon afterwards he was arrested by the French colonial authorities and spent two months in prison. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Saadeh moved to Argentina, where he remained until 1947. In Argentina, Saadeh continued his activities. He founded Al-Zawba'a (The storm) newspaper and wrote \"The Struggle of the Intellect in Syrian Literature\", which was printed in Buenos Aires. In 1943, Saadeh married Juliette Al-Mir and had three daughters with her. The French colonial court sentenced him \"in absentia\" to twenty years of imprisonment.\n\nSaadeh returned to Lebanon on 2 March 1947, following the country's independence from France. After his return, he made a revolutionary speech, upon which the authorities issued an arrest warrant which was in force for seven months and then withdrawn. In Lebanon, Saadeh founded the newspaper \"Al-Jil Al-Jadid\". On 4 July 1949, the party declared a revolution in Lebanon in retaliation for a series of violent provocations staged by the government of Lebanon against party members. The revolt was suppressed and Saadeh traveled to Damascus to meet with Husni al-Za'im, the President of Syria at the time, who had previously agreed to support him. However, he was handed over by el-Zai'm to the Lebanese authorities. Saadeh and many of his followers were judged by a Lebanese military court, and were executed, Saadeh himself by a firing squad. The capture, trial and execution happened in less than 48 hours. Saadeh's execution took place at dawn of 8 July 1949. According to Adel Beshara, it was and still is the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender.\n\nHis party continued to be active after his death. The President of Lebanon Camille Chamoun was supported by Saadeh's party during the 1958 Lebanon crisis. In 1961, the SSNP attempted a coup d'état against President Fuad Shihab, which ended in failure. During the 1960s, party leaders were arrested and eventually the party splintered into separate factions.\n\nThe SSNP \"Zawbaa\" (Vortex, Tempest) is a glyph combining the Muslim crescent and the Christian cross, derived from Mesopotamian art, and it symbolizes the blood shed by the martyrs which makes the wheel of history whirl forward, dissipating the surrounding darkness (representing sectarianism and Ottoman occupation and the colonial oppression which followed). Within the party, Saadeh gained a cult of personality and advocated a totalitarian system of government, at the same time glorifying the pre-Christian past of the Syrian people. Saadeh was named the party leader for life. However, according to Haytham, Saadeh stated that European fascism didn't influence him. Haytham claims that Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist ideology aimed at opposite ends; in contrast to National Socialism, Social Nationalism bases itself on a dynamic social entity (which is composed of many elements, from religion to language, culture, history, need, and mainly human interaction) defining its national identity and not the imposition of one ideal identity (e.g. blond hair, blue eyes) on the many factions.\n\nSaadeh emphasized the role of philosophy and social science in the development of his social ideology. He viewed social nationalism, his version of nationalism, as a tool to transform traditional society into a dynamic and progressive one. He also opposed colonization that broke up Greater Syria into sub-states. Secularization played an important role in his ideology. Secularization is taken by him beyond the socio-political aspects of the question into its philosophical dimensions.\n\nSaadeh rejected Arab Nationalism (the idea that the speakers of the Arabic language form a single, unified nation), and argued instead for the creation of the state of United Syrian Nation or Natural Syria, encompassing the Fertile Crescent, making up a Syrian homeland that \"extends from the Taurus range in the northwest and the Zagros mountains in the northeast to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the south and includes the Sinai peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba, and from the Syrian Sea in the west, including the island of Cyprus, to the arch of the Arabian Desert and the Persian Gulf in the east.\" (Kader, H. A.).\n\nSaadeh rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation, and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He was thus a strong opponent of both Arab nationalism and Pan-Islamism. He argued that Syria was historically, culturally, and geographically distinct from the rest of the Arab world, which he divided into four parts. He traced Syrian history as a distinct entity back to the Phoenicians, Canaanites, Assyrians, Babylonians etc. and argued that Syrianism transcended religious distinctions.\n\nThese claims of alleged National Socialist and Fascist ideology of his party were denied by Saadeh himself. During a 1935 speech, Saadeh said: \"I want to use this opportunity to say that the system of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is neither a Hitlerite nor a Fascist one, but a pure social nationalist one. It is not based on useless imitation, but is instead the result of an authentic invention – which is a virtue of our people\".\n\nSaadeh had an holistic notion of science, as \"knowledge is that it revolves around interaction of the self with the surrounding physical conditions\" and was against epistemological reductionism, considering that \"the self plays an active role in creating the conditions that transform things into objects of knowledge. This self, as a social self, is the product of several dynamics – mind, intuition, the practical and the existential. It does not depend on one factor and exclude the others.\" His whole thought was a refutation of the \"individualist doctrine, whether in its sociological or methodological orientations\". For him, man was a totality by himself as much as in connection with his immediate surrounding, a social being but with its own dignity, which brings him closer to the personalism of someone like Nikolai Berdyaev, and in his vision, the society's main role was to shape the individual being-as-relation through the Khaldunian notion of assabiya (solidarity), which, through some common features (geography, language, culture, ...) brings out the best in him, but without oppressing his individual liberties nor negligible either the spiritual or the material aspect, like he witnessed in contemporary ideologies such as communism, fascism or national-socialism. Thus, \"the concept of man-society is the axis of Sa'adeh’s theory of human existence. What is meant by this concept is that existence at a human level and existence at a social level are not independent phenomena ; rather, they are one phenomenon, two aspects of the same social essence.\" \n\nHe had a regionalist vision of nationalism because he gave some utmost importance to geography : even if he was not an utmost environmental determinist, he thought that a man's relation with his milieu involves a certain way of acting, because of the different climate, fauna or flora ; men will manage their resources differently whether they're in mountains or desert, which will also have consequences on their interactions with foreign groups (over the control of the same resources and so on). Thus the notion of homeland was dear to him. On racialism - which was associated with nationalism in many European ideologies -, \"he argued that, contrary to common belief, race is a purely physical concept that has nothing to do with the psychological or social differences between human communities. People differ among themselves by their physical features – that is, colour, height, appearance – and are accordingly divided into races. Nationalism, however, cannot be founded on this reality. Every nation is made up of diverse racial groups, and none of them is the product of one race or one specific tribe.\" \n\nContrarily to Zaki al-Arsuzi and other Arab nationalists who were influenced by European thinkers' vision of race and language - notably Fichte -, Saadeh thus developed his own vision, more inclusive and synthetic. It's a \"dynamic theory of nationalism for the whole society based on union in life and the socio-economic cycle (...) not deterministic. Land and people are two important ingredients of the nation but are not the nation themselves (...) is a civilizing theory because it recognizes the necessity and inevitability of interaction between nations (...) the interaction process has two poles: the first, economic possibilities\nof the environment; and the second, society’s ability to benefit from such possibilities (...) interaction takes place on two levels: horizontally, which determines the extent and character of regional interaction; and, vertically,\nbetween man and land, out of which a horizontal interaction may or may not occur (...) unlike Marxism, which reduced the economic question to one of class and considered the national question synonymous with the\nbourgeoisie, the concept of the socio-economic cycle is basically a societal concept (...) the mind is a primary factor in human progress. It is a liberating force and a complex entity that should not be viewed from just one\nangle. For Sa'adeh, the mind represents the liberation of human energy and its incorporation into the process of socio-economic interaction.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "164556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164556", "title": "Archon", "text": "Archon\n\nArchon (, \"árchon\", ἄρχοντες, \"árchontes\") is a Greek word that means \"ruler\", frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem αρχ-, meaning \"to rule\", derived from the same root as \"monarch\" and \"hierarchy\".\n\nIn the early literary period of ancient Greece the chief magistrates of various Greek city states were called \"Archon\". The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging from \"club leader\" to \"master of the tables\" at \"syssitia\" to \"Roman governor\". In Roman terms, \"archontes\" ruled by \"imperium\", whereas \"basileis\" (\"kings\") had \"auctoritas\".\n\nIn Athens a system of three concurrent Archons evolved, the three office holders being known as the \"Archon Eponymos\", the \"Polemarch\", and the \"Archon Basileus\". According to Aristotle's \"Constitution of the Athenians\", the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period the Archon Eponymos was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archon Eponymos. (Many ancient calendar systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as \"strategoi\". The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The Archon Eponymos remained the titular head of state under democracy, though of much reduced political importance. The Archons were assisted by \"junior Archons\", called \"Thesmothetes\". After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the Areopagus, though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.\n\nUnder the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed choregai (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays. Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus. The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the \"protagonist\"), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the \"archon eponymos\". The \"archon eponymos\" remained the titular head of state under democracy, though of much reduced political importance.\n\nByzantine historians usually described foreign rulers as \"archontes\". The rulers of the Bulgars themselves, along with their own titles, often bear the title \"archon placed by God\" in inscriptions in Greek.\n\nInside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the \"themata\": Dalmatia, Cephalonia, Crete and Cyprus. \"Archontes\" were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous Slavic-inhabited areas (\"sclaviniae\") under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, \"archontes\" are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an archontia (). The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the mint (), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.\n\nThe title of megas archon (\"grand archon\") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as \"grand prince\". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the Palaiologan period, but did not have any specific functions.\n\nFrom time to time, laity of the Orthodox Church in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople have been granted the title of \"Archon\" to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to St Andrew. This \"Archon\" status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary. See http://www.archons.org/ .\n\nAn Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the Orthodox Church (at large).\n\nIt is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the Orthodox Church faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with human rights and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.\n\nAs it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.\n\n\"Archon\" is also used in Modern Greek colloquially, as \"άρχοντας\" (\"archontas)\" to someone that holds a form of status, or power \n\nThe term is used within the Arab-speaking Copts in church parlance as a title for a leading member of the laity.\n\nVarious fraternities and sororities use the title of archon or variations on it.\n\nSome Gnostic sects used this term for demons associated with the planetspheres.\n\n"}

The word \"bhavana\" normally appears in conjunction with another word forming a compound phrase such as \"citta-bhavana\" (the development or cultivation of the heart/mind) or \"metta-bhavana\" (the development/cultivation of lovingkindness). When used on its own \"bhavana\" signifies contemplation and 'spiritual cultivation' generally.\n\n\"Bhavana\" derives from the word \"Bhava\" meaning \"becoming\" or the subjective process of arousing mental states.\n\nTo explain the cultural context of the historical Buddha's employment of the term, Glenn Wallis emphasizes \"bhavana\"'s sense of cultivation. He writes that a farmer performs \"bhavana\" when he or she prepares soil and plants a seed. Wallis infers the Buddha's intention with this term by emphasizing the terrain and focus on farming in northern India at the time in the following passage:\nIn the Pali Canon \"bhāvanā\" is often found in a compound phrase indicating personal, intentional effort over time with respect to the development of that particular faculty. For instance, in the Pali Canon and post-canonical literature one can find the following compounds:\n\nIn addition, in the Canon, the development (\"bhāvanā\") of \"samatha-vipassana\" is lauded. Subsequently, Theravada teachers have made use of the following compounds:\n\nThe word bhavana is sometimes translated into English as 'meditation' so that, for example, metta-bhavana may be translated as 'the meditation on loving-kindness'. Meditation is properly called \"dhyana\" (Sanskrit; Pali: \"jhāna\"), as practiced in \"samādhi\", the 8th limb of the eightfold path.\n\nIn Jainism, \"bhāvana\" refers to \"right conception or notion\" or \"the moral of a fable.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29399372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29399372", "title": "Dhyāna in Buddhism", "text": "Dhyāna in Buddhism\n\nIn the oldest texts of Buddhism, Dhyāna (Sanskrit) or Jhāna (Pali) is a series of cultivated states of mind, commonly translated as meditation, which lead to a \"state of perfect equanimity and awareness (\"upekkhii-sati-piirisuddhl\").\" \"Dhyana\" may have been the core practice of pre-sectarian Buddhism, in combination with several related practices which together lead to calm and detachment, and are fully realized with th practice of \"dhyana\".\n\nIn the later commentarial tradition, which has survived in present-day Theravada, \"dhyana\" is equated with \"concentration,\" a state of one-pointed absorption in which there is a diminished awareness of the surroundings. In the contemporary Theravada-based \"Vipassana\"-movement, this absorbed state of mind is regarded as unnecessary and even non-beneficial for awakening, which has to be reached by mindfullness of the body and \"vipassana\" (insight into impermanence). Since the 1980s, scholars and practitioners have started to question this equation, arguing for a more comprehensive and integrated understanding and approach, based on the oldest descriptions of \"dhyana\" in the suttas.\n\nIn \"Chan\" and \"Zen\", the Chinese and Japanese renderings of \"dhyana\", \"dhyana\" is the central practice, which is ultimately based on Sarvastivada meditation practices, and has been transmitted since the beginning of the Common Era.\n\n\"Dhayana\" is commonly translated as meditation, and is often equated with \"concentration,\" though meditation may refer to a wider scala of exercises for bhavana, development. \"Dhyana\" can also mean \"attention, thought, reflction.\" According to Buddhaghosa, the term \"jhana\" (Skt. dhyana) is derived from the verb \"jhayati\", \"to think or meditate,\" while the verb \"jhapeti\", \"to burn up,\" explicates its function, namely burning-up opposing states, burning-up or destroying \"the mental defilements preventing [...] the development of serenity and insight.\"\n\nThe Pāli canon describes four progressive states of \"jhāna\" called \"rūpa jhāna\" (\"form \"jhana\"\"), and four additional meditative states called \"arūpa\" (\"without form\").\n\nMeditation and contemplation are preceded by several practices, which are fully realized with the practice of \"dhyana\". As described in the Noble Eightfold Path, right view leads to leaving the household life and becoming a wandering monk. \"Sila\" (morality) comprises the rules for right conduct. Right effort, c.q. the four right efforts, aim to prevent the arising of unwholesome states, and to generate wholesome states. This includes \"indriya samvara\" (sense restraint), controlling the response to sensual perceptions, not giving in to lust and aversion but simply noticing the objects of perception as they appear. Right effort and mindfulness calm the mind-body complex, releasing unwholesome states and habitual patterns, and encouraging the development of wholesome states and non-automatic responses. By following these cumulative steps and practices, the mind becomes set, almost naturally, for the practice of \"dhyana\". The practice of \"dhyana\" reinforces the development of wholesome states, leading to \"upekkha\" (equanimity) and mindfulness.\n\nThe practice of \"dhyana\" is aided by \"anapanasati\", mindfulness of breathing. The Suttapitaka and the Agamas describe four stages of \"rupa jhāna\". \"Rupa\" refers to the material realm, in a neutral stance, as different form the \"kama\" realm (lust, desire) and the \"arupa\"-realm (non-material realm). Each jhāna is characterised by a set of qualities which are present in that jhana.\n\n\nWhile the jhana's are often understood as deepening states of concentration, due to its description as such in the \"Abhidhamma\", and the \"Visuddhimagga\", since the 1980s scholars and modern Theravadins have started to question this understanding. \n\nRoderick S. Bucknell notes that \"vitarka\" and \"vicara\" may refer to \"probably nothing other than the normal process of discursive thought, the familiar but usually unnoticed stream of mental imagery and verbalization.\" Bucknell further nothes that \"[t]hese conclusions conflict with the widespread conception of the first jhana as a state of deep concentration.\" \n\nAccording to Stuart-Fox, the Abhidhamma separated \"vitarka\" from \"vicara\", and \"ekagatta\" (onepointednes) was added to the description first \"dhyana\" to give an equal number of five hindrances and five anti-dotes. The commentarial tradition regards the qulities of the first \"dhyana\" to be antidotes to the five hindrances, and \"ekagatta\" may have been added to the first \"dhyana\" to give exactly five anti-dotes for the five hindrances. Stuart-Fox further notes that \"vitarka\", being discursive thought, will do very little as an anti-dote for sloth and torpor, reflecting the inconsistencies which were introduced by the scholastics.\n\nVetter, Gombrich and Wynne note that the first and second \"jhana\" represent the onset of \"dhyana\" due to withdrawal and right effort c.q. the four right efforts, followed by concentration, whereas the third and fourth \"jhana\" combine concentration with mindfulness. Polak, elaborating on Vetter, notes that the onset of the first \"dhyana\" is described as a quite natural process, due to the preceding efforts to restrain the senses and the nurturing of wholesome states. Regarding \"samadhi\" as the eight step of the Noble Eightfold Path, Vetter notes that \"samadhi\" consists of the four stages of dhyana meditation, but\nAccording to Richard Gombrich, the sequence of the four \"rupa-jhanas\" describes two different cognitive states: \"I know this is controversial, but it seems to me that the third and fourth jhanas are thus quite unlike the second.\" Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second \"jhana\" denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth \"jhana\" one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to it. According to Gombrich, \"the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element.\n\nGethin, followed by Polak and Arbel, further notes that there is a \"definite affinity\" between the four \"jhanas\" and the \"bojjhaṅgā\", the seven factors of awakening. According to Gethin, the early Buddhist texts have \"a broadly consistent vision\" regarding meditation practice. Various practices lead to the development of the factors of awakening, which are not only the means to, but also the constituents of awakening. According to Gethin, \"satipatthana\" and \"anapanasati\" are related to a formula that summarizes the Buddhist path to awakening as \"abandoning the hindrances, establishing [...] mindfulness, and developing the seven factors of awakening.\" This results in a \"heightened awareness,\" \"overcoming distracting and disturbing emotions,\" which are not particular elements of the path to awakening, but rather common disturbing and distracting emotions. Gethin further states that \"the exegetical literature is essentially true to the vision of meditation presented in the Nikayas,\" applying the \"perfect mindfulness, stillness and lucidity\" of the \"jhanas\" to the contemplation of \"reality,\" of the way things really are, as temporary and ever-changing. It is in this sense that \"the \"jhana\" state has the transcendent, transforming quality of awakening.\" \n\n\"Upekkhā\", equanimity, which is perfected in the fourth \"dhyana\", is one of the four \"Brahma-vihara\". While the commentarial tradition downplayed the importance of the \"Brahma-vihara\", Gombrich notes that the Buddhist usage of the \"brahma-vihāra\" originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to \"living with Brahman\" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as \"living with Brahman\" by rebirth in the Brahma-world. According to Gombrich, \"the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.\n\nAlexander Wynne states that the \"dhyana\"-scheme is poorly understood. According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as \"sati\", \"sampajāno\", and \"upekkhā\", are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states, whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects:\nThanissaro Bhikkhu, a western teacher in the Thai Forest Tradition, argues that the \"Visuddhimagga\" deviates from the Pali Canon in its description of the jhanas, and warns against the development of strong states of concentration. Arbel describes the fourth \"jhana\" as \"non-reactive and lucid awareness,\" not as astate of deep concentration.\n\nGrouped into the \"jhana\"-scheme are four meditative states, referred to in the early texts as \"aruppas\". These are also referred to in commentarial literature as immaterial/formless \"jhānas\" (\"arūpajhānas\"), also translated as The Formless Dimensions, in distinction from the first four \"jhānas\" (\"rūpa jhānas\"). In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word \"jhāna\" is never explicitly used to denote them, they are instead referred to as \"āyatana\". However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four \"jhānas\" (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jhānas. The immaterial are related to, or derived from, yogic meditation, while the \"jhanas\" proper are related to the cultivation of the mind. The state of complete dwelling in emptiness is reached when the eighth \"jhāna\" is transcended.\n\nThe four \"arupas\" are:\n\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the Noble Eightfold Path. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\nBeyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception lies a state called Nirodha Samapatti, the \"cessation of perception, feelings and consciousness\".\nOnly in commentarial and scholarly literature this sometimes is called the \"ninth jhāna\".\n\nThe time of the Buddha saw the rise of the śramaṇa movement, ascetic practitioners with a body of shared teachings and practices. The strict delineation of this movement into Jainism, Buddhism and brahmanical/Upanishadic traditions is a later development.\n\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the practice of the four dhyanas may have been an original contribution by Gautama Buddha to the religious practices of ancient India in response to the ascetic practices of the Jains. Kalupahana argues that the Buddha \"reverted to the meditational practices\" he had learned from Ārāḍa Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta. Wynne argues that Ārāḍa Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta were Brahmanical teachers, and that the attainment of the formless meditative absorption was incorporated from Brahmanical practices. These practices were paired to mindfulness and insight, and given a new interpretation. The stratification of particular \"samādhi\" experiences into the four \"jhānas\" seems to be a Buddhist innovation. It was then borrowed and presented in an incomplete form in the \"Mokṣadharma\", a part of the \"Mahābhārata\".\n\nThomas William Rhys Davids and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term samadhi is not found in any pre-Buddhist text but is first mentioned in the \"Tipiṭaka\". It was later incorporated into later texts such as the Maitrayaniya Upanishad. But according to Matsumoto, \"the terms dhyana and samahita (entering samadhi) appear already in Upanishadic texts that predate the origins of Buddhism\".\n\nThe \"Mahasaccaka Sutta\", \"Majjhima Nikaya\" 36, narrates the story of the Buddha's awakening. According to this story, he learned two kinds of meditation, which did not lead to enlightenment. He then underwent harsh ascetic practices with which he eventually also became disillusioned. The Buddha then recalled a meditative state he entered by chance as a child:\nOriginally the practice of dhyana itself may have constituted the core liberating practice of early Buddhism, since in this state all \"pleasure and pain\" had waned. According to Vetter, \nAlexander Wynne attempted to find parallels in Brahmanical texts to the meditative goals the two teachers claimed to have taught, drawing especially on some of the Upanishads and the Mokshadharma chapter of the Mahabharata.\n\nThe suttas describe how the Buddha learned meditative practices from two teachers, Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama. Alex Wynne argues that Uddaka Ramaputta belonged to the pre-Buddhist tradition portrayed by the Buddhist and Brahmanic sources, in which the philosophical formulations of the early Upanishads were accepted, and the meditative state of \"neither perception nor non-perception\" was equated with the self. Wynne further argues that the goal of Alara Kalama was a Brahminical concept. Evidence in the \"Chandogya Upanishad\" and the \"Taittiriya Upanishad\" suggests that a different early Brahminic philosophical tradition held the view that the unmanifest state of Brahman was a form of non-existence. According to Wynne it thus seems likely that both element and formless meditation was learned by the Buddha from his two teachers, and adapted by him to his own system.\n\nIt appears that in early Brahminic yoga, the formless spheres were attained following element meditation. This is also taught as an option in the early Buddhist texts. The primary method taught to achieve the formless attainment in early Buddhist scriptures, on the other hand, is to proceed to the sphere of infinite space following the fourth \"jhāna\".\n\nWynne claimed that Brahminic passages on meditation suggest that the most basic presupposition of early Brahmanical yoga is that the creation of the world must be reversed, through a series of meditative states, by the yogin who seeks the realization of the self. These states were given doctrinal background in early Brahminic cosmologies, which classified the world into successively coarser strata. One such stratification is found at TU II.1 and Mbh XII.195, and proceeds as follows: self, space, wind, fire, water, earth. Mbh XII.224 gives alternatively: Brahman, mind, space, wind, fire, water, earth.\n\nIn Brahmanical thought, the meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos. There is no similar theoretical background to element meditation in the early Buddhist texts, where the elements appear simply as suitable objects of meditation. It is likely that the Brahmanic practices of element-meditation were borrowed and adapted by early Buddhists, with the original Brahmanic ideology of the practices being discarded in the process.\n\nOn this point, it is thought that the uses of the elements in early Buddhist literature have in general very little connection to Brahmanical thought; in most places they occur in teachings where they form the objects of a detailed contemplation of the human being. The aim of these contemplations seems to have been to bring about the correct understanding that the various perceived aspects of a human being, when taken together, nevertheless do not comprise a 'self'. Moreover, the self is conceptualized in terms similar to both \"nothingness\" and \"neither perception nor non-perception\" at different places in early Upanishadic literature.\n\nThe latter corresponds to Yajnavalkya’s definition of the self in his famous dialogue with Maitreyi in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" and the definition given in the post-Buddhist \"Mandukya Upanishad\". This is mentioned as a claim of non-Buddhist ascetics and Brahmins in the \"Pañcattaya Sutta\" (Majjhima Nikaya 102.2). In the same dialogue in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", Yajnavalkya draws the conclusions that the self that is neither perceptive nor non-perceptive is a state of consciousness without object. The early Buddhist evidence suggests much the same thing for the state of \"neither perception nor non-perception\". It is a state without an object of awareness, that is not devoid of awareness. The state following it in the Buddhist scheme, the \"cessation of perception and sensation\", is devoid not only of objectivity, but of subjectivity as well.\n\nThe Brahmanical texts cited by Wynne assumed their final form long after the Buddha's lifetime. The Mokshadharma postdates him.\n\nThe Buddhist tradition has incorporated two traditions regarding the use of jhana. There is a tradition that stresses attaining insight (bodhi, prajna, kensho) as the means to awakening and liberation. But the Buddhist tradition has also incorporated the yogic tradition, as reflected in the use of jhana, which is rejected in other sutras as not resulting in the final result of liberation. One solution to this contradiction is the conjunctive use of vipassana and samatha.\n\nSchmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36. Schmithausen discerns three possible roads to liberation as described in the suttas, to which Vetter adds a fourth possibility, while the attainment of Nirodha-Samapatti may constitute a fifth possibility:\n\nAccording to the Theravada-tradition, the meditator uses the \"jhāna\" state to bring the mind to rest, and to strengthen and sharpen the mind, in order to investigate the true nature of phenomena (\"dhamma\") and to gain insight into impermanence, suffering and not-self. According to the Theravada-tradition, the arahant is aware that the \"jhanas\" are ultimately unsatisfactory, realizing that the meditative attainments are also anicca, impermanent.\n\nIn the \"Mahasaccaka Sutta\" (\"Majjhima Nikaya\" 36), which narrates the story of the Buddha's awakening, \"dhyana\" is followed by insight into the four noble truths. The mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\" is probably a later addition. Vetter notes that such insight is not possible in a state of dhyana, when interpreted as concentration, since discursive thinking is eliminated in such a state. He also notes that the emphasis on \"liberating insight\" developed only after the four noble truths were introduced as an expression of what this \"liberating insight\" constituted. In time, other expressions took over this function, such as pratītyasamutpāda and the emptiness of the self.\n\nThis scheme is rejected by scholars as a later development, since the \"arupas\" are akin to non-Buddhist practices, and rejected alsewhere in the canon.\n\nThe emphasis on \"liberating insight\" alone seems to be a later development, in response to developments in Indian religious thought, which saw \"liberating insight\" as essential to liberation. This may also have been due to an over-literal interpretation by later scholastics of the terminology used by the Buddha, and to the problems involved with the practice of \"dhyana\", and the need to develop an easier method.\n\nContemporary scholars have discerned a broader application of \"jhana\" in historical Buddhist practice. According to Alexander Wynne, the ultimate aim of \"dhyana\" was the attainment of insight, and the application of the meditative state to the practice of mindfulness. According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects. According to Frauwallner, this may have been the Buddha's original idea. According to Wynne, this stress on mindfulness may have led to the intellectualism which favoured insight over the practice of \"dhyana\".\n\nBoth Schmithausen and Bronkhorst note that the attainment of insight, which is a cognitive activity, can't be possible in a state wherein all cognitive acitivy has ceased. According to Vetter, the practice of Rupa Jhana itself may have constituted the core practice of early Buddhism, with practices such as sila and mindfulness aiding to its development. It is the \"middle way\" between self-mortification, ascribed by Bronkhorst to Jainism, and indulgence in sensual pleasure. Vetter emphasizes that dhyana is a form of non-sensual happiness. The eightfold path can be seen as a path of preparation which leads to the practice of samadhi.\n\nAccording to some texts, after progressing through the eight jhanas \"and\" the stage of Nirodha-Samapatti, a person is liberated. According to some traditions someone attaining the state of Nirodha-Samapatti is an \"anagami\" or an \"arahant\". In the Anupadda sutra, the Buddha narrates that Sariputta became an arahant upon reaching it.\n\nBuddhagosa's \"Visuddhimagga\" considers \"jhana\" to be an exercise in concentration-meditation. His views, together with the \"Satipatthana Sutta\", inspired the development, in the 19th and 20th century, of new meditation techniques which gained a great popularity among lay audiences in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nAccording to Henepola Gunaratana, the term \"jhana\" is closely connected with \"samadhi\", which is generally rendered as \"concentration\". The word \"samadhi\" is almost interchangeable with the word \"samatha\", serenity. According to Gunaratana, in the widest sense the word samadhi is being used for the practices which lead to the development of serenity. In this sense, samadhi and jhana are close in meaning. Nevertheless, they are not exactly identical, since \"certain differences in their suggested and contextual meanings prevent unqualified identification of the two terms.\" Samadhi signifies only one mental factor, namely one-pointedness, while the word \"jhana\" encompasses the whole state of consciousness, \"or at least the whole group of mental factors individuating that meditative state as a jhana.\" Furthermore, according to Gunaratana, samadhi involves \"a wider range of reference than jhana,\" noting that \"the Pali exegetical tradition recognizes three levels of samadhi: preliminary concentration (\"parikammasamadhi\") [...] access concentration (\"upacarasamadhi\") [...] and absorption concentration (\"appanasamadhi\").\"\n\nAccording to the Pāli canon commentary, access/neighbourhood concentration (\"upacāra-samādhi\") is a stage of meditation that the meditator reaches before entering into \"jhāna\". The overcoming of the five hindrances mark the entry into access concentration. Access concentration is not mentioned in the discourses of the Buddha, but there are several \"suttas\" where a person gains insight into the \"Dhamma\" on hearing a teaching from the Buddha.\n\nAccording to Tse-fu Kuan, at the state of \"access concentration\", some meditators may experience vivid mental imagery, which is similar to a vivid dream. They are as vivid as if seen by the eye, but in this case the meditator is fully aware and conscious that they are seeing mental images. According to Tse-fu Kuan, this is discussed in the early texts, and expanded upon in Theravāda commentaries.\n\nAccording to Venerable Sujivo, as the concentration becomes stronger, the feelings of breathing and of having a physical body will completely disappear, leaving only pure awareness. At this stage inexperienced meditators may become afraid, thinking that they are going to die if they continue the concentration, because the feeling of breathing and the feeling of having a physical body has completely disappeared. They should not be so afraid and should continue their concentration in order to reach \"full concentration\" (\"jhāna\").\n\nA meditator should first master the lower \"jhānas\", before they can go into the higher \"jhānas\". According to Nathan Katz, the early suttas state that \"the most exquisite of recluses\" is able to attain any of the \"jhānas\" and abide in them without difficulty.\n\nAccording to the contemporary Vipassana-movement, the \"jhāna\" state cannot by itself lead to enlightenment as it only suppresses the defilements. Meditators must use the \"jhāna\" state as an instrument for developing wisdom by cultivating insight, and use it to penetrate the true nature of phenomena through direct cognition, which will lead to cutting off the defilements and \"nibbana\".\n\nAccording to the later Theravāda commentorial tradition as outlined by Buddhagoṣa in his \"Visuddhimagga\", after coming out of the state of \"jhāna\" the meditator will be in the state of post-\"jhāna\" access concentration. In this state the investigation and analysis of the true nature of phenomena begins, which leads to insight into the characteristics of impermanence, suffering and not-self arises.\n\nWhile Theravada-meditation was introduced to the west as \"vipassana\"-meditation, which rejected the usefulness of \"jhana\", there is a growing interest among western \"vipassana\"-practitioners in \"jhana\". The nature and practice of \"jhana\" is a topic of debate and contentment among western convert Theravadins, to the extent that the disputes have even been called \"the Jhana wars.\" Both academic scholars and contemporary practitioners have raised questions about the interpretation of the \"jhanas\" as being states of absorption which are not necessary for the attainment of liberation. While groundbreaking research on this topic has been done by Bareau, Schmithausen, Stuart-Fox, Bucknell, Vetter, Bronkhorst, and Wynne, Theravada practitioners have also scrutinized and criticised the \"samatha\"-\"vipassana\" distinction. Reassessments of the description of \"jhana\" in the suttas consider \"jhana\" and \"vipassana\" to be an integrated practice, leading to a \"tranquil and eqaunimous awareness of whatever arises in the field of experience.\"\n\nThe \"Visuddhimagga\", and the \"pioneering popularizing work of Daniel Goleman,\" has been influential in the (mis)understanding of \"dhyana\" being a form of concentration-meditation. The \"Visuddhimagga\" is centered around \"kasina\"-meditation, a form of concentration-meditation in which the mind is focused on a (mental) object. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \"[t]he text then tries to fit all other meditation methods into the mold of kasina practice, so that they too give rise to countersigns, but even by its own admission, breath meditation does not fit well into the mold.\" According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \"the Visuddhimagga uses a very different paradigm for concentration from what you find in the Canon.\" In its emphasis on \"kasina\"-meditation, the \"Visuddhimagga\" departs from the Pali Canon, in which \"dhyana\" is the central meditative practice, indicating that what \"jhana means in the commentaries is something quite different from what it means in the Canon.\"\n\nBhante Henepola Gunaratana also notes that what \"the suttas say is not the same as what the Visuddhimagga says [...] they are actually different,\" leading to a divergence between a [traditional] scholarly understanding and a practical understanding based on meditative experience. Gunaratana further notes that Buddhaghosa invented several key meditation terms which are not to be found in the suttas, such as \"\"parikamma samadhi\" (preparatory concentration), \"upacara samadhi\" (access concentration), \"appanasamadhi\" (absorption concentration).\" Gunaratana also notes that the Buddhaghosa's emphasis on \"kasina\"-meditation is not to be found in the suttas, where \"dhyana\" is always combined with mindfulness.\n\nAccording to Vetter, \"dhyana\" as a preparation of discriminating insight must have been different from the \"dhyana\"-practice introduced by the Buddha, using kasina-exercises to produce a \"more artificially produced dhyana\", resulting in the cessation of apperceptions and feelings. Kasina-exercises are propagated in Buddhaghosas \"Visuddhimagga\", which is considered the authoritative commentary on meditation practice in the Theravada tradition, but differs from the Pali canon in its description of \"jhana\". While the suttas connect \"samadhi\" to mindfulness and awareness of the body, for Buddhaghosa \"jhana\" is a purely mental exercise, in which one-pointed concentration leads to a narrowing of attention.\n\nSeveral western teachers (Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Leigh Brazington, Richard Shankman) make a distinction between 'sutta-oriented' \"jhana' and \"'Visuddhimagga\"-oriented' \"jhana, dubbed \"minimalists\" and \"maximalists\" by Kenneth Rose.\n\nThanissaro Bhikkhu has repeatedly argued that the Pali Canon and the \"Visuddhimagga\" give different descriptions of the jhanas, regarding the \"Visuddhimagga\"-description to be incorrect. \n\nAccording to Richard Shankman, the \"sutta\" descriptions of \"jhāna\" practice explain that the meditator does not emerge from \"jhāna\" to practice \"vipassana\" but rather the work of insight is done whilst in \"jhāna\" itself. In particular the meditator is instructed to \"enter and remain in the fourth \"jhāna\"\" before commencing the work of insight in order to uproot the mental defilements.\n\nKeren Arbel has conducted extensive research on the \"jhanas\" and the contemporary criticisms of the commentarial interpretation. Based on this research, and her own experience as a senior meditation-teacher, she gives a reconstructed account of the original meaning of the \"dhyanas\". She argues that \"jhana\" is an integrated practice, describing the fourth \"jhana\" as \"non-reactive and lucid awareness,\" not as a state of deep concentration. According to Arbel, it develops \"a mind which is not conditioned by habitual reaction-patterns of likes and dislikes [...] a profoundly wise relation to experience, not tainted by any kind of wrong perception and mental reactivity rooted in craving (\"tanha\").\n\nAccording to Kenneth Rose, the \"Visuddhimagga\"-oriented \"maximalist\" approach is a return to ancient Indian \"mainstream practices,\" in which physical and mental immobility was thought to lead to liberation from \"samsara\" and rebirth. This approach was rejected by the Buddha, turning to a gentler approach which results in \"upekkha\" and \"sati\", equanimous awareness of experience.\n\nMahāyāna Buddhism includes numerous schools of practice. Each draw upon various Buddhist sūtras, philosophical treatises, and commentaries, and each has its own emphasis, mode of expression, and philosophical outlook. Accordingly, each school has its own meditation methods for the purpose of developing samādhi and prajñā, with the goal of ultimately attaining enlightenment.\n\nDhyāna is a central aspect of Buddhist practice in Chan, necessary for progress on the path and \"true entry into the Dharma.\"\n\nIn China, the word \"dhyāna\" was originally transliterated with and shortened to just in common usage. The word and the practice of meditation entered into Chinese through the translations of An Shigao (fl. c. 148–180 CE), and Kumārajīva (334–413 CE), who translated Dhyāna sutras, which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara meditation teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school of Kashmir circa 1st-4th centuries CE. The word \"chán\" became the designation for Chan Buddhism (Korean Seon, Zen).\n\nWhile \"dhyana\" in a strict sense refers to the four \"dhyanas\", in Chinese Buddhism \"dhyāna\" may refer to various kinds of meditation techniques and their preparatory practices, which are necessary to practice \"dhyana\". The five main types of meditation in the \"Dyana sutras\" are anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing); paṭikūlamanasikāra meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness maitrī meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of pratītyasamutpāda; and the contemplation on the Buddha’s thirty-two Characteristics.\n\nDuring sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or yoga postures, using the dhyāna mudrā. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath or by bringing that awareness to the energy center below the navel (see also ānāpānasati). Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. This practice may simply be called sitting dhyāna, which is \"zuòchán\" (坐禅) in Chinese, and \"zazen\" (坐禅) in Japanese, \"jwaseon\" (坐禅) in Korean.\n\nIn the Sōtō school of Zen, meditation with no objects, anchors, or content, is the primary form of practice. The meditator strives to be aware of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found throughout Dōgen's \"Shōbōgenzō\", as for example in the \"Principles of Zazen\" and the \"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\". In the Japanese language, this practice is called \"Shikantaza\".\n\nAccording to Charles Luk, in the earliest traditions of Chán, there was no fixed method or formula for teaching meditation, and all instructions were simply heuristic methods, to point to the true nature of the mind, also known as \"Buddha-nature\". According to Luk, this method is referred to as the \"Mind Dharma\", and exemplified in the story of Śākyamuni Buddha holding up a flower silently, and Mahākāśyapa smiling as he understood. A traditional formula of this is, \"Chán points directly to the human mind, to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the Sòng dynasty, practice with the kōan method became popular, whereas others practiced \"silent illumination.\" This became the source of some differences in practice between the Línjì and Cáodòng schools.\n\nA kōan, literally \"public case\", is a story or dialogue, describing an interaction between a Zen master and a student. These anecdotes give a demonstration of the master's insight. Koans emphasize the non-conceptional insight that the Buddhist teachings are pointing to. Koans can be used to provoke the \"great doubt\", and test a student's progress in Zen practice.\n\nKōan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), kinhin (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. Kōan practice is particularly emphasized by the Japanese Rinzai school, but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.\n\nThe Zen student's mastery of a given kōan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as \"dokusan\" (独参), \"daisan\" (代参), or \"sanzen\" (参禅)). While there is no unique answer to a kōan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the kōan and of Zen through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.\n\nB. Alan Wallace holds that modern Tibetan Buddhism lacks emphasis on achieving levels of concentration higher than access concentration. According to Wallace, one possible explanation for this situation is that virtually all Tibetan Buddhist meditators seek to become enlightened through the use of tantric practices. These require the presence of sense desire and passion in one's consciousness, but \"jhāna\" effectively inhibits these phenomena.\n\nWhile few Tibetan Buddhists, either inside or outside Tibet, devote themselves to the practice of concentration, Tibetan Buddhist literature does provide extensive instructions on it, and great Tibetan meditators of earlier times stressed its importance.\n\nDhyana is an important ancient practice mentioned in the Vedic and post-Vedic literature of Hinduism, as well as early texts of Jainism. Dhyana in Buddhism influenced these practices as well as was influenced by them, likely in its origins and its later development.\n\nThere are parallels with the fourth to eighth stages of Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga, as mentioned in his classical work, \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\", which were compiled around 400 CE by, taking materials about yoga from older traditions.\n\nPatanjali discerns \"bahiranga\" (external) aspects of yoga namely, yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, and the \"antaranga\" (internal) yoga. Having actualized the \"pratyahara\" stage, a practitioner is able to effectively engage into the practice of Samyama. At the stage of \"pratyahara\", the consciousness of the individual is internalized in order that the sensations from the senses of taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell don't reach their respective centers in the brain and takes the \"sadhaka\" (practitioner) to next stages of Yoga, namely Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), and Samadhi (mystical absorption), being the aim of all Yogic practices.\n\nThe Eight Limbs of the yoga sutras show Samadhi as one of its limbs. The \"Eight limbs of the Yoga Sutra\" was influenced by Buddhism. Vyasa's Yogabhashya, the commentary to the Yogasutras, and Vacaspati Misra's subcommentary state directly that the samadhi techniques are directly borrowed from the Buddhists' Jhana, with the addition of the mystical and divine interpretations of mental absorption. However, it is also to be noted that the Yoga Sutra, especially the fourth segment of Kaivalya Pada, contains several polemical verses critical of Buddhism, particularly the Vijñānavāda school of Vasubandhu.\n\nThe suttas show that during the time of the Buddha, Nigantha Nataputta, the Jain leader, did not even believe that it is possible to enter a state where the thoughts and examination stop.\n\nThere has been little scientific study of these mental states. In 2008, an EEG study found \"strong, significant, and consistent differences in specific brain regions when the meditator is in a jhana state compared to normal resting consciousness\". Tentative hypotheses on the neurological correlates have been proposed, but lack supporting evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is different from holistic perception. Operationally, entitativity can also be defined as \"perceiving a collection of social targets (e.g., individuals) as possessing unity and coherence (e.g., a group)\". Entitativity is highest for intimacy groups, such as the family, lower for task groups, lower yet for social categories (e.g., people of the same religion), and lowest for transitory groups, such as people waiting at the same bus stop (Lickel et al., 2000).\n\nCampbell (1958) coined the term \"entitativity\" in order to explain why some groups are considered real groups while others are thought to be mere aggregates of individuals. He suggested that people rely on certain perceptual cues as they intuitively determine which aggregations of individuals are groups, and which are not (e.g. Spectators at a football game may seem like a disorganized collection of people, but when they shout the same cheers or express similar emotions, this gives them entitativity)(Forsyth, 2010). \n\nAdditionally, Campbell (1958) emphasized three cues that individuals can use to make judgments regarding entitativity: \"common fate\" (the extent to which individuals in the aggregate seem to experience interrelated outcomes), \"similarity\" (the extent to which the individuals display the same behaviors or resemble one another), and \"proximity\" (the distance between individuals in the aggregate). To illustrate how we make those judgments, consider the example of people sharing a table at a library. They could be friends who are studying together, or they may also be strangers happening to share the same table. If you're wondering whether this is an actual group, you would examine their common fate, similarity, and proximity. Common fate may be something like the group all getting up and leaving together while talking or laughing amongst themselves. Similarity could be as simple as noticing that they are all using the same textbooks or notes, or that they happen to be wearing the same t-shirts to organizations (i.e., fraternity, university group). Finally, their physical proximity to one another (i.e., moving to sit closer) would be the final characteristic to judge that you are witnessing individuals with entitativity (Forsyth, 2010). \n\nThere are two proposed antecedents for the entitativity perception (Ip, Chiu, & Wan, 2006):\n\n\n"}

Since resources are limited, groups need to decide on fair ways of apportioning them out to their members. These fairness judgments are determined by procedural and distributive forms of social justice. When payouts do not occur according to these norms, conflicts arise.\n\nProcedural justice deals with the methods used in making the decisions about the allocation of the group's resources. Issues arise in this area when groups do not stick to their agreed upon methods for spreading out these resources. Conflicts will arise when the methods used are not consistent, open, or agreed upon by the group. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is \"did we make the decision in a fair way?\"\n\nDistributive justice deals with how rewards and costs are distributed across the members of the group. Issues might arise in this area when certain members are favored and consistently given premium rewards or apportioned more resources than other members. An analogy here is cutting up a cake into equal pieces, but someone feels that they have unjustly received a smaller piece. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is \"did I get my fair share?\"\n\nThere are five types of distributive norms that help in maintaining distributive justice.\n\nThe distribution of resources (most often money) is a very common cause of conflict in groups. Individuals tend to push for equality distribution norms when they have not contributed as much to the group. Smaller groups also tend to adopt equality norms, as do women. On the other hand, larger groups, as well as groups that significantly depend on one person's specialized input, prefer equitable distributions for the group.\nNegative inequity is experienced by group members who feel that they are not receiving fair payment for what they have contributed. This often results in lower quality of work, a reduction in effort (perhaps caused by the sucker effect), or complete withdrawal from the group. In contrast, positive inequality is experienced when members receive too much for the amount of effort they've put forth. This can lead to the individual increasing their efforts to actually deserve what they are receiving, but more often it leads to conflict in the group.\nIndividuals tend to be motivated to maximize their personal rewards, so when they feel they are getting less than they deserve, they react negatively. On the flip side, when members feel like they are being rewarded for their input to the group, and they feel that the group is fairly allocating these rewards, they feel esteemed and proud. Members see a motive for group mates to give less rewards, while being less likely to believe they could be over-rewarded. The reaction in the former instance is shaped more by distributive justice, whereas the latter reaction is shaped more by procedural justice.\n\n"}
{"id": "41812810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41812810", "title": "Feminist aesthetics", "text": "Feminist aesthetics\n\nFeminist aesthetics first emerged in the 1970's and refers not to a particular aesthetic or style but to perspectives that question assumptions in art and aesthetics concerning sex-role stereotypes, or gender. In particular, feminists argue that despite seeming neutral or inclusive, the way people think about art and aesthetics is influenced by sex roles. Feminist aesthetics is a tool for analyzing how art is understood using gendered issues. A person's gender identity affects the ways in which they perceive art and aesthetics because of their subject position and the fact that perception is influenced by power. The ways in which people see art is also influenced by social values such as class and race. One's subject position in life changes the way art is perceived because of people's different knowledge's about life and experiences. In the way that feminist history unsettles traditional history, feminist aesthetics challenge philosophies of beauty, the arts and sensory experience. \n\nStarting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define \"taste\". Kant and Hume both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because fine art was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and sex division. Even when those universal aesthetists did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: beauty and sublimity; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine). Feminist aesthetics analyzes why \"feminine\" traits are subservient compared to \"masculine\" traits in art and aesthetics.\n\nAnother explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for \"whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of jouissance\". Instead, a feminist is less likely to view the object as a disinterested interpreter, and intellectualize the sensation (Hilde Hein). Critics of feminist art argue that politics have no place in art, however, many art forms contain politics, but because of their subject position, the critics are unable to perceive it. \n\nThe idea of the \"creative genius\" is inspected in feminist aesthetics. In particular, women artists are often excluded from being creative or artistic geniuses. This exclusion in part stems from the traditional masculine definitions of genius. Christine Battersby has critiqued the fact that women are excluded from being known as geniuses because female artists will be separated from their art, and instead their art will be called genius, instead of the artist. However, women were also excluded because they lacked the opportunities for artistic education required to be recognized as artists and geniuses. In addition, the idea of the creative genius itself celebrates individualism – which Christine Battersby calls \"a kind of masculine heroism\" – and overlooks the work of joint collaborations.\n\nAesthetic theories that make a distinction between \"arts\" and \"crafts\" can be viewed as anti-feminist. Here, art usually refers to \"fine art\" and crafts refers to everything else which has \"everyday aesthetics\". Art forms traditionally used by women, such as embroidery or sewing, are perceived as crafts and not art, because of their domestic uses. Feminist aesthetics focuses on all objects created by women, whether or not they are seen as \"art\". Since those craft practices occur in the home where many women continue to work, their creativity is overlooked by the perception of \"art\", because their domain is marginalized.\n\n"}
{"id": "46978066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46978066", "title": "Francoise Baylis", "text": "Francoise Baylis\n\nFrançoise Elvina Baylis, , (born 1961) is a Canadian bioethicist whose work is at the intersection of applied ethics, health policy, and practice. The focus of her research is on issues of women's health and assisted reproductive technologies, but her research and publication record also extend to such topics as research involving humans (including human embryo research), gene editing, novel genetic technologies, public health, the role of bioethics consultants, and neuroethics. \nBaylis works as a public intellectual who is interested to do bioethics with an impact on health and public policy. She engages with print, radio, television, and online media and has appeared multiple times as a guest on CBC Radio and Radio-Canada. Her frequent contributions to \"The Mark News\" and other online publications illustrate a commitment to citizen engagement and participatory democracy.\n\nBaylis' education includes a Certificate of Bilinguallism from Laurentian University (1981), Political Science degree (BA, First Class Honours) from McGill University (1983), followed by an MA (Philosophy, 1984) and PhD (Philosophy, specialization Bioethics, 1989) from the University of Western Ontario (currently known as Western University). The title of her PhD thesis is \"The ethics of \"ex utero\" research on spare IVF human embryos\" and was completed under the supervision of Benjamin Freedman. In the thesis she introduced (at the time) a \"novel ethical distinction between viable and non-viable human embryos.\" Her concept of \"non-viable embryos\" as acceptable objects for research is still referenced today.\n\nIn 1996 Baylis was hired on at Dalhousie University as an Associate Professor in the Office of Bioethics Education and Research (later the Department of Bioethics), and in 2004 became Professor and Canada Research Chair in Bioethics and Philosophy. \nIn 2007, she became an elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. \nShe previously served as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville as well as a Lecturer with the Departments of Paediatrics, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, and Rehabilitation Medicine with the University of Toronto (1991-1993) and Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology with the University of Western Ontario (1989-1991). \nHer early employment also included working as an Ethics Consultant to the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies and as a Clinical Ethics Consultant at hospitals in London ON, Toronto ON, Knoxville TN, and Halifax NS.\n\nBaylis' current academic appointment is with the Faculty of Medicine and she is cross-appointed to the Departments of Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Philosophy (Dalhousie University). Baylis is the founder and leader (since 2003) of Novel Tech Ethics, now renamed NTE Impact Ethics, an interdisciplinary research team based at Dalhousie University (with some international collaborators) that does research at the intersection of health, bioethics, and public policy.\n\nNotable achievements during her career include: being named to the \"Who's Who in Black Canada\" (2002–present) and to \"Canadian Who's Who\" (2004–present); three Governor-in-Council appointments, including member of the Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee (1999-2001), member of Governing Council, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (2001-2004) and member of the Board of Directors, Assisted Human Reproduction Canada (2006-2010); Royal Society of Canada Academic Secretary (Academy I) and Atlantic Steering Committee Chair (2012-2015); and Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) in Bioethics and Philosophy (2004-2018).\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Baylis was appointed to the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for \"her contributions as a champion of health-care ethics in Canada and for creating forums for discussing current medical-ethics issues.\" Other awards and honours include:\n\nBaylis has been the principal investigator on eleven Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) grants (totaling more than $2.4 million), including a New Emerging Team grant, States of Mind: Emerging Issues in Neuroethics. In total, since 1990 she has secured greater than $2.8 million in research funding as a Principal Investigator, > $1.8 million as a Co-Principal- or Co-Investigator, and >$2 million as a Collaborator, Project Advisor or Team Member. As such, her track record in getting support for health ethics research is likely to be unusually successful, especially for someone trained in the humanities.\n\nBaylis has made numerous contributions to the development of public policy on various assisted human reproduction topics – often the only invited Canadian participant in policy discussions in Europe and elsewhere. Most recently, her reputation garnered an invitation from the US National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine to join the Planning Committee for an International Summit on Human Gene Editing. Baylis led one of the two Canadian Institutes of Health Research-funded neuroethics teams from 2006-2011. Through that six-year program, she helped to head the development of a new field for Canada. She also co-chaired the first international neuroethics conference (Brain Matters I) in Halifax in 2009, which has developed into an annual or sometimes bi-annual conference ever since. Beyond her research contributions in the realm of assisted reproductive technologies (including contemporary family-making) and women's health in general, Baylis is counted as making contributions to several additional, specific areas of scholarly inquiry:\n\nBaylis has also assumed responsibilities for building and maintaining national and international research communities. She was one of the original co-coordinators and advisory board members, as well as the chair of the nominating committee for Feminist Approaches to Bioethics (FAB) – an international network of feminist bioethics researchers. In this regard, Baylis’ work has helped to ensure a venue for publication of feminist bioethics authors with the \"International Journal of FAB\". Moreover, her efforts on behalf of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics (FAB) have fostered community-building among feminist bioethics academics and practitioners as exemplified through FAB's bi-annual World Congress (held in association with International Association of Bioethics meetings). Baylis has also played a role in fostering and helping to direct the health science research community in Canada. She served on the Governing Councils of the Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee (1999-2001), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (2001-2004), and Assisted Human Reproduction Canada (2006-2010). She is known for having advanced the integration of ethics within these agencies and the protection of human research participants. She is also known as an opponent of institutional choices and practices that abet \"structural conflict of interest regarding the funding of research and the governance of research ethics.\"\n\n\nAs a contributor to feminist ethics, Baylis' orientation stresses the political dimensions of doing bioethics, using one's expertise to impact public policy in the hopes of furthering moral and social progress—in the hopes \"to make the world a better place.\" Baylis has authored and co-authored reports for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (for example, regarding the status of scientific researchers). As an example of her efforts at shaping public policy, she has prepared expert testimony for a number of Courts and Canadian Parliamentary Committees for a diversity of bioethics issues, including ethics in the context of clinical trials and governance of assisted human reproduction (e.g. \"The Regulation of Assisted Human Reproductive Technologies and Related Research: A Public Health, Safety and Morality Argument\").\n\nAs Baylis' academic career has progressed, the public character of her work, beyond its immediate relevance to public policy, has increased. She is a proclaimed advocate against social injustice, especially regarding the disproportionate burdens placed upon women as a result of assisted reproductive technologies or by virtue of the exclusion of pregnant women from clinical research. For more than a decade she has sought to engage directly with various publics through public education initiatives, media interviews, and social media (@ImpactEthics). Recently, she was appointed to the Order of Canada \"for her contributions as a champion of health-care ethics in Canada and for creating forums to discuss current medical-ethics issues.\" Baylis understands her duties as an academic to help build and cultivate informed, public debate in order to improve the quality of democracy. Speaking as the leader of the NTE Impact Ethics research group she has said: \"Our big-picture goal is to support democracy by helping people to understand what the issues are and what is at stake and how they can then think about and position themselves vis-à-vis the science.\" Her efforts to build ethics literacy at both the local, national, and international level are evidenced through more than a decade of public education and public engagement with NTE Impact Ethics Events.\n\nSince 2011, Baylis has used her second tenure as a Canada Research Chair to focus on \"developing new strategies that would allow bioethicists to make just and lasting policy contributions.\" As coined by Baylis, \"impact ethics\" is about \"question[ing] the \"status quo\" in health care\", \"mak[ing] science subservient to the human good\", \"mak[ing] public institutions more responsive, accountable, and just\", and \"critiqu[ing] professional bioethics.\" Her research projects on \"impact ethics\" include an emphasis on knowledge translation and mobilization which aim to implement in policy and practice a bioethics that is \"responsible\", \"accountable\" and \"innovative\"—a bioethics that can \"make a difference\" in serving the public by requiring from those who work in the field to act with \"integrity and sensitivity to the real world of healthcare delivery, policy-making and politics.\" A specific arm of these various projects is the \"Impact Ethics\" blog which publishes submissions from a range of authors (students and faculty, academics, and writers outside of academia) with various perspectives on a diversity of subjects for bioethical debate. As Baylis summarizes it: \"Impact ethics is about using the tools of ethics to shock, press, crack, and chip society into a better place. It is about outcomes, and ordering the study of ethics around changing things for the better.\"\n"}

Nominations are also encouraged from areas that may not have been traditionally viewed as directly connected to social justice, such as the arts and business. Nominees may be U.S. citizens or nationals of other countries; no affiliation to Grinnell College is required.\n\nGrinnell was founded in 1846 by a group of transplanted New Englanders with strong Congregational and social-reformer backgrounds. They organized as the Trustees of Iowa College — originally in Davenport, Iowa. In 1859 the trustees moved the College to newly settled Grinnell, Iowa, where their abolitionist sentiments were more welcome. At the time, Grinnell was an important stop on the Underground Railroad that secretly transported slaves to freedom.\n\nGrinnell's social consciousness blossomed during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, when graduates Harry Hopkins '12, Chester Davis '11, Paul H. Appleby '13, Hallie Ferguson Flanagan '11, and Florence Stewart Kerr '12 became influential New Deal administrators.\n\nToday, Grinnell's commitment to social justice continues through a strong philosophy of self governance and personal responsibility, as well as programs and initiatives that encourage students to learn about the world beyond the campus and effect positive social change. More than 300 Grinnell alumni have served in the Peace Corps since it was founded in 1961. Together, these alumni have served in 89 countries from Afghanistan to Zambia.\n\nFor example, the Wall Alumni Prize provides financial support for Grinnell alumni to engage in service projects, programs, and organizations dedicated to improving the lives of others. Under Grinnell's Expanding Knowledge Initiative, the College has introduced curricular innovations in the areas of environmental challenges, human rights, and human dignity. The Liberal Arts in Prison Program, a collaborative effort by Grinnell students, faculty, and staff, engages incarcerated adults in courses in the liberal arts.\n\nThe Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize directly reflects Grinnell's historic mission to educate men and women \"who are prepared in life and work to use their knowledge and their abilities to serve the common good.\" With the creation of the Grinnell Prize, the College is extending its educational mission beyond the campus and alumni community to individuals anywhere who believe innovative social justice programs create a better world.\n\nThe Innovator for Social Justice Prize program was announced in November, 2010.\n\nThe idea for Innovator for Social Justice Prize originated with Raynard S. Kington, M.D., Ph.D., who began his tenure as Grinnell's thirteenth president in August, 2010. In underscoring the college's longstanding belief in social justice as a core tenet of its liberal arts academic mission, President Kington noted that the prize was created to \"encourage and recognize young individuals who embody our core values and organizations that share our commitment to change the world.\"\nThe program drew more than 1,000 nominations from 66 countries in its initial year.\n\nNominations are evaluated based on how candidates have embraced the values of a liberal arts education, including critical thinking, creative problem-solving, free inquiry and commitment to using and sharing knowledge to better humanity.\n\nTo be considered for the Prize, eligible nominees must:\n\n\nCommittee members are recognized individuals who work for social change in various capacities – largely Iowa-based – and represent the college's faculty, student body, alumni, staff and trustees, plus prominent individuals not formally affiliated with Grinnell.

{"id": "7257476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7257476", "title": "Happiness economics", "text": "Happiness economics\n\nThe economics of happiness or happiness economics is the quantitative and theoretical study of happiness, positive and negative affect, well-being, quality of life, life satisfaction and related concepts, typically combining economics with other fields such as psychology, health and sociology. It typically treats such happiness-related measures, rather than wealth, income or profit, as something to be maximized. The field has grown substantially since the late 20th century, for example by the development of methods, surveys and indices to measure happiness and related concepts. Its findings have been described as a challenge to the economics profession.\n\nThe subject may be categorized in various ways, depending on specificity, intersection, and cross-classification. For example, within the \"Journal of Economic Literature\" classification codes, it has been categorized under:\n\nGiven its very nature, reported happiness is subjective. It is difficult to compare one person's happiness with another's. It can be especially difficult to compare happiness across cultures. However, many happiness economists believe they have solved this comparison problem. Cross-sections of large data samples across nations and time demonstrate consistent patterns in the determinants of happiness.\n\nHappiness is typically measured using subjective measures – e.g. self-reported surveys – and/or objective measures. One concern has always been the accuracy and reliability of people's responses to happiness surveys. Objective measures such as lifespan, income, and education are often used as well as or instead of subjectively reported happiness, though this assumes that they generally produce happiness, which while plausible may not necessarily be the case. The terms quality of life or well-being are often used to encompass these more objective measures.\n\nSome scientists claim that happiness can be measured both subjectively and objectively by observing the joy center of the brain lit up with advanced imaging, although this raises philosophical issues, for example about whether this can be treated as more reliable than reported subjective happiness.\n\nMicro-econometric happiness equations have the standard form: formula_1. In this equation formula_2 is the reported well-being of individual formula_3 at time formula_4, and formula_5 is a vector of known variables, which include socio-demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.\n\nHappiness, well-being, or satisfaction with life, was seen as unmeasurable in classical and neo-classical economics. Van Praag was the first person who organized large surveys in order to explicitly measure welfare derived from income. He did this with the Income Evaluation Question (IEQ). This approach is called the Leyden School. It is named after the Dutch university where this approach was developed. Other Researchers included Arie Kapteyn and Aldi Hagenaars.\n\nTypically national financial measures, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP), have been used as a measure of successful policy. There is a significant association between GDP and happiness, with citizens in wealthier nations being happier than those in poorer nations. It has been argued that this relationship extends only to an average GDP per capita of about $15,000. In the 2000s, several studies have obtained the opposite result, so this Easterlin paradox is controversial.\n\nHistorically, economists have said that well-being is a simple function of income. However, it has been found that once wealth reaches a subsistence level, its effectiveness as a generator of well-being is greatly diminished. Happiness economists hope to change the way governments view well-being and how to most effectively govern and allocate resources given this paradox.\n\nIn 2010, Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton found that higher earners generally reported better life satisfaction, but people's day-to-day emotional well-being only rose with earnings until a threshold annual income of $75,000.\n\nOther factors have been suggested as making people happier than money. A short term course of psychological therapy is 32 times more cost effective at increasing happiness than simply increasing income.\n\nScholars at the University of Virginia, University of British Columbia and Harvard University released a study in 2011 after examining numerous academic paper in response to an apparent contradiction: \"When asked to take stock of their lives, people with more money report being a good deal more satisfied. But when asked how happy they are at the moment, people with more money are barely different than those with less.\" Published in the \"Journal of Consumer Psychology\", the study is entitled \"If Money Doesn't Make You Happy, Then You Probably Aren't Spending It Right\" and included the following eight general recommendations:\n\n\nIn their \"Unhappy Cities\" paper, Edward Glaeser, Joshua Gottlieb and Oren Ziv examined the self-reported subjective well-being of people living in American metropolitan areas, particularly in relation to the notion that \"individuals make trade-offs among competing objectives, including but not limited to happiness.\" The researchers findings revealed that people living in metropolitan areas where lower levels of happiness are reported are receiving higher real wages, and they suggest in their conclusion that \"humans are quite understandably willing to sacrifice both happiness and life satisfaction if the price is right.\"\n\nRuut Veenhoven claimed that social security payments do not seem to add to happiness. This may be due to the fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add to happiness in general either. Happiness may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that as people who think that they themselves control their lives are more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease happiness.\n\nAn alternative perspective focuses on the role of the welfare state as an institution that improves quality of life not only by increasing the extent to which basic human needs are met, but also by promoting greater control of one's life by limiting the degree to which individuals find themselves at the mercy of impersonal market forces that are indifferent to the fate of individuals. This is the argument suggested by the U.S. political scientist Benjamin Radcliff, who has presented a series of papers in peer reviewed scholarly journals demonstrating that a more generous welfare state contributes to higher levels of life satisfaction, and does so to rich and poor alike.\n\nGenerally, the well-being of those who are employed is higher than those who are unemployed. Employment itself may not increase subjective well-being, but facilitates activities that do (such as supporting a family, philanthropy, and education). While work does increase well-being through providing income, income level is not as indicative of subjective well-being as other benefits related to employment. Feelings of autonomy and mastery, found in higher levels in the employed than unemployed, are stronger predictors of subjective well-being than wealth.\n\nWhen personal preference and the amount of time spent working do not align, both men and women experience a decrease in subjective well-being. The negative effect of working more or working less than preferred has been found across multiple studies, most finding that working more than preferred (over-employed) is more detrimental, but some found that working less (under-employed) is more detrimental. Most individuals' levels of subjective well-being returned to \"normal\" (level previous to time mismatch) within one year. Levels remained lower only when individuals worked more hours than preferred for a period of two years or more, which may indicate that it is more detrimental to be over-employed than under-employed in the long-term.\nEmployment status effects are not confined to the individual. Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, compared to being employed or not working (and not looking for work). Partner life satisfaction is inversely related to the number of hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed.\nBecoming self-employed can increase subjective well-being, given the right conditions. Those who leave work to become self-employed report greater life satisfaction than those who work for others or become self-employed after unemployment; this effect increases over time. Those who are self-employed and have employees of their own report higher life-satisfaction than those who are self-employed without employees, and women who are self-employed without employees report a higher life satisfaction than men in the same condition.\n\nThe effects of retirement on subjective well-being vary depending on personal and cultural factors. Subjective well-being can remain stable for those who retire from work voluntarily, but declines for those who are involuntarily retired. In countries with an average social norm to work, the well-being of men increases after retirement, and the well-being of retired women is at the same level as women who are homemakers or work outside the home. In countries with a strong social norm to work, retirement negatively impacts the well-being of men and women.\n\nRelative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well-being than did men.\n\nIn rich societies, where a rise in income doesn't equate to an increase in levels of subjective well-being, personal relationships are the determining factors of happiness.\n\nGlaeser, Gottlieb and Ziv suggest in their conclusion that the happiness trade-offs that individuals seem willing to make aligns with the tendency of parents to report less happiness, as they sacrifice their personal well-being for the \"price\" of having children.\n\nThere is a significant correlation between feeling in control of one's own life and happiness levels.\n\nA study conducted at the University of Zurich suggested that democracy and federalism bring well-being to individuals. It concluded that the more direct political participation possibilities available to citizens raises their subjective well-being. Two reasons were given for this finding. First, a more active role for citizens enables better monitoring of professional politicians by citizens, which leads to greater satisfaction with government output. Second, the ability for citizens to get involved in and have control over the political process, independently increases well-being.\n\nAmerican psychologist Barry Schwartz argues in his book \"The Paradox of Choice\" that too many consumer and lifestyle choices can produce anxiety and unhappiness due to analysis paralysis and raised expectations of satisfaction.\n\nNational cross-sectional data suggest an inverse relationship between religious diversity and happiness, possibly by facilitating more bonding (and less bridging) social capital.\n\nMuch of the research regarding happiness and leisure relies on subjective well-being (SWB) as an appropriate measure of happiness. Research has demonstrated a wide variety of contributing and resulting factors in the relationship between leisure and happiness. These include psychological mechanisms, and the types and characteristics of leisure activities that result in the greatest levels of subjective happiness. Specifically, leisure may trigger five core psychological mechanisms including detachment-recovery from work, autonomy in leisure, mastery of leisure activities, meaning-making in leisure activities, and social affiliation in leisure (DRAMMA). Leisure activities that are physical, relational, and performed outdoors are correlated with greater feelings of satisfaction with free time. Research across 33 different countries shows that individuals who feel they strengthen social relationships and work on personal development during leisure time are happier than others. Furthermore, shopping, reading books, attending cultural events, getting together with relatives, listening to music and attending sporting events is associated with higher levels of happiness. Spending time on the internet or watching TV is not associated with higher levels of happiness as compared to these other activities.\nResearch has shown that culture influences how we measure happiness and leisure. While SWB is a commonly used measure of happiness in North America and Europe, this may not be the case internationally. Quality of life (QOL) may be a better measure of happiness and leisure in Asian countries, especially Korea. Countries such as China and Japan may require a different measurement of happiness, as societal differences may influence the concept of happiness (i.e. economic variables, cultural practices, and social networks) beyond what QOL is able to measure. There seem to be some differences in leisure preference cross-culturally. Within the Croatian culture, family related leisure activities may enhance SWB across a large spectrum of ages ranging from adolescent to older adults, in both women and men. Active socializing and visiting cultural events are also associated with high levels of SWB across varying age and gender. Italians seem to prefer social conceptions of leisure as opposed to individualistic conceptions. Although different groups of individuals may prefer varying types and amount of leisure activity, this variability is likely due to the differing motivations and goals that an individual intends to fulfill with their leisure time.\nResearch suggests that specific leisure interventions enhance feelings of SWB. This is both a top-down and bottom-up effect, in that leisure satisfaction causally affects SWB, and SWB causally affects leisure satisfaction. This bi-directional effect is stronger in retired individuals than in working individuals. Furthermore, it appears that satisfaction with our leisure at least partially explains the relationship between our engagement in leisure and our SWB. Broadly speaking, researchers classify leisure into active (e.g. volunteering, socializing, sports and fitness) and passive leisure (e.g. watching television and listening to the radio). Among older adults, passive leisure activities and personal leisure activities (e.g. sleeping, eating, and bathing) correlate with higher levels of SWB and feelings of relaxation than active leisure activities. Thus, although significant evidence has demonstrated that active leisure is associated with higher levels of SWB, or happiness, this may not be the case with older populations.\nBoth regular and irregular involvement in sports leisure can result in heightened SWB. Serious, or systematic involvement in certain leisure activities, such as taekwondo, correlates with personal growth and a sense of happiness. Additionally, more irregular (e.g. seasonal) sports activities, such as skiing, are also correlated with high SWB. Furthermore, the relationship between pleasure and skiing is thought to be caused in part by a sense of flow and involvement with the activity. Leisure activities, such as meeting with friends, participating in sports, and going on vacation trips, positively correlate with life satisfaction. It may also be true that going on a vacation makes our lives seem better, but does not necessarily make us happier in the long term. Research regarding vacationing or taking a holiday trip is mixed. Although the reported effects are mostly small, some evidence points to higher levels of SWB, or happiness, after taking a holiday.\n\n Poverty alleviation are associated with happier populations. According to the latest systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction: Volatile or high inflation is bad for a population's well-being, particularly those with a right-wing political orientation. That suggests the impact of disruptions to economic security are in part mediated or modified by beliefs about economic security.\n\nThe Voxeu analysis of the economic determinants of happiness found that life satisfaction explains the largest share of an existing government's vote share, followed by economic growth, which itself explains six times as much as employment and twice as much as inflation.\n\nIndividualistic societies have happier populations. Institutes of economic freedom are associated with increases wealth inequality but does not necessarily contribute to decreases in aggregate well-being or subjective well-being at the population level. In fact, income inequality enhances global well-being.\nThere is some debate over whether living in poor neighbours make one happier. And, living among rich neighbours can dull the happiness that comes from wealth. This is purported to work by way of an upward or downward comparison effect (Keeping up with the Joneses). The balance of evidence is trending in favour of the hypothesis that living in poor neighbourhoods makes one less happy, and living in rich neighbourhoods actually makes one happier, in the United States. While social status matters, a balance of factors like amenities, safe areas, well maintained housing, turn the tide in favour of the argument that richer neighbours are happier neighbours.\n\n\"The right to participate in the political process, measured by the extent of direct democratic rights across regions, is strongly correlated with subjective well-being (Frey and Stutzer, 2002) ... a potential mechanism that explains this relationship is the perception of procedural fairness and social mobility.\" Institutions and well-being, democracy and federalism are associated with a happier population. Correspondingly, political engagement and activism have associated health benefits.\nOn the other hand, some non democratic countries such as China and Saudi Arabia top the Ipsos list of countries where the citizenry is most happy with their government's direction. That suggests that voting preferences may not translate well into overall satisfaction with the government's direction. In any case, both of these factors revealed preference and domain specific satisfaction rather than overall subjective well being.\n\nHistorically, economists thought economic growth was unrelated to population level well-being, a phenomenon labelled the Easterlin paradox. More robust research has identified that there is a link between economic development and the wellbeing of the population.\nA <2017 meta-analysis shows that the impact of infrastructure expenditure on economic growth varies considerable. So, one cannot assume an infrastructure project will yield welfare benefits. The paper doesn't investigate or elaborate on any modifiable variables that might predict the value of a project. However, government spending on roads and primary industries is the best value target for transport spending, according to a 2013 meta-analysis.\n7%+/−3% per annum discount rates are typically applied as the discount rate on public infrastructure projects in Australia. Smaller real discount rates are used internationally to calculate the social return on investment by governments.\n\nWhile the mainstream happiness economics has focused on identifying the determinants of happiness, an alternative approach in the discipline examines instead what are the economic consequences of happiness. Happiness may act as a determinant of economic outcomes: it increases productivity, predicts one's future income and affects labour market performance. There is a growing number of studies justifying the so-called \"happy-productive worker\" thesis. The positive and causal impact of happiness on an individual's productivity has been established in experimental studies.\n\nThe idea that happiness is important to a society is not new. Many other prominent intellectuals, philosophers and political leaders throughout history, including Aristotle, Confucius, and Plato, incorporated happiness into their work.\n\nThomas Jefferson put the \"pursuit of happiness\" on the same level as life and liberty in the United States' Declaration of Independence. Jeremy Bentham believed that public policy should attempt to maximize happiness, and he even attempted to estimate a \"hedonic calculus\". However, the American ruling philosophy protects the right of individuals to seek their own happiness, but does not place an equal responsibility for the citizens' happiness on the government. In the United States, there is no explicit policy that requires the rulers to develop the physical and mental well-being of the citizens or hold the government agencies accountable for their performance against specific measures or metrics of well-being. Until the 1972 there was no formal government policy, anywhere in the world, that placed happiness and well-being as a main criterion for public policy decision making.\n\nThe following is a chronological list of happiness economics and well-being indices:\n\n1972 – Bhutan's former king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, introduced the Gross National Happiness (GNH) philosophy and its four development pillars at an international conference.\n\n2005 – Med Jones of the International Institute of Management introduced the first GNH Index and Global GNH Index Survey. The GNH Index, also known as Gross National Well-being (GNW) Index framework served as the first integrated objective (economic) and subjective (happiness) socioeconomic development framework. Prior the GNH Index, there were few development indices that improved upon the gross domestic product (GDP), but did not measure happiness. For example, the Genuine Progress Indicator was focused on the environmental cost of economic development, then later (in 2006) it was updated to include similar measures to the GNH Index. Another development index is the Human Development Index (HDI) that originally focused on literacy and education but also did not measure happiness. The HDI now measures three basic dimensions of human development, health (as measured by life expectancy at birth), overall knowledge level (as measured by the literacy rate), and standard of living (as measured by GDP per capita for a given year). Among the criticisms of the HDI is the complaint that it is a mixture of stock measures (life expectancy at birth and literacy rate) and a flow measure (GDP per capita for a given year). To overcome this criticism, Hou, Walsh, and Zhang (2015) proposed a new index called HDIF (Human Development Index Flow), in which they replaced life expectancy at birth by the under-five mortality rate (for a given year), and they also replaced the literacy rate by the gross primary school enrollment ratio for a given year). They calculated both the HDI and the HDIF for many countries and found that \"the HDIF and the HDI tend to converge for wealthy countries and diverge for poor countries, especially those with low HDI rankings\". The development performance of poor countries improved using the HDIF while the performance of the wealthy countries declined.\n\n2006 – The Genuine Progress Indicator was updated from a green measurement system to a broader concept that included quantitative measurement of well-being and happiness. The new measure is motivated by the philosophy of the GNH and the same notion of that subjective measures like well-being are more relevant and important than more objective measures like consumption. It is not measured directly, but only by means of the factors which are believed to lead to it.\n\n2007 – Thailand releases Green and Happiness Index (GHI).\n\n2008 – French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched a Happiness Initiative similar to GNH, calling for the inclusion of happiness and well-being among the criteria for national governance policies. He commissioned three prominent economists, Joseph Stiglitz (USA), Amartya Sen (India), Jean-Paul Fitoussi (France), to publish a report calling for a global \"statistical system which goes beyond commercial activity to measure personal well-being.\" Later it was described as gross domestic happiness (GDH). The GDH Index is similar to the GNH Index of 2005.\n\n2009 – In the United States, the Gallup poll system launched the happiness survey collecting data on national scale. The Gallup Well-Being Index was modeled after the GNH Index framework of 2005. The Well-Being Index score is an average of six sub-indexes which measure life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviors, and access to basic necessities. In October 2009, the US scored 66.1/100.\n\n2010 – The concept was taken seriously, as the Centre for Bhutan Studies, under the leadership of Karma Ura, developed a sophisticated survey instrument to measure the population's general level of well-being. Two Canadians, Michael and Martha Pennock played a major role in developing the Bhutanese survey, which took a six- to seven-hour interview to complete. They developed a shorter international version of the survey which has been used in their home region of Victoria BC as well as in Brazil. The Pennocks also collaborated with Ura in the production of a policy lens which is used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan\n\n2010 – The Center for Bhutan Studies further defined the original four pillars with greater specificity into eight general contributors to happiness—physical, mental and spiritual health; time-balance; social and community vitality; cultural vitality; education; living standards; good governance; and ecological vitality. The Bhutan GNH Index.\n\n2010 – The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative OPHI at the University of Oxford in UK, launched the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) for the United Nations Development Programme, (UNDP). Similar to the GNH Index of 2005, OPHI promotes collection and analysis of data on five dimensions including Quality of work, Empowerment, Physical safety, Ability to go about without shame, Psychological wellbeing.\n\n2011 – UN General Assembly Resolution 65/309, titled \"Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development\"\n\n2011 – The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched \"Better Life Index\" (BLI).\n\n2011 – The United Nations released the World Happiness Report\n\n2011 – Canadian Index of Wellbeing Network (CIW Network) released The Canadian Index of Wellbeing (CIW).\n\n2011 – The Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" published an article suggesting that western GDP economics is an incomplete development model and called for the adoption of Bhutan's GNH philosophy and Jones' GNH Index in Israel.\n\n2011 – Chuluun Togtokh criticized the HDI in an article published in \"Nature\", calling for a revised HDI, writing that \"The revised index should include each nation's per capita carbon emissions, and so become a Human Sustainable Development Index (HSDI).\" Bravo (2014) provided details of how the HSDI was computed and proposed an amended HSDI by including the proportion of forested area in each country. He argued that this proposed indicator \"represents an important measure of the capacity of natural system to provide fundamental ecological services.\"\n\n2012 – In a report prepared for the US Congressman Hansen Clarke, R, researchers Ben Beachy and Juston Zorn, at John F. Kennedy School of Government in Harvard University, recommended that \"the Congress should prescribe the broad parameters of new, carefully designed supplemental national indicators; it should launch a bipartisan commission of experts to address unresolved methodological issues, and include alternative indicators.\" They proposed that the government can use the survey results to see which well-being dimensions are least satisfied and which districts and demographic groups are most deficient, so as to allocate resources accordingly. The report list the Gross National Happiness Index and its seven measurement area as one of the main frameworks to consider.\n\n2012 – Professor Peter T. Coleman, a director of the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution at Columbia University, suggested that Jones' GNH Index initiative could inform the Global Peace Index Initiative GPI.\n\n2012 – South Korea launched Happiness Index citing the GNH Index framework.\n\n2012 – The government of Goa, India, published a strategy for socioeconomic development citing the GNH Index as a model for measuring happiness.\n\n2012 – The city of Seattle in Washington, launched its own happiness index initiative, emphasizing measures similar to the GNH Index.\n\n2013 – The Social Progress Index SPI was launched by Michael Porter\n\n2013 – The president of Singapore, Tony Tan, proposed that in addition to building up substantial financial reserves, Singapore needed to focus on building up its \"social reserves\", a concept that appears to have parallels to GNH.\n\n2013 – Economist Karol Jan Borowiecki motivates that well-being indices can be obtained from the way people communicate, as is established in psychology, and compiles the first well-being indices covering the life-time of a person.\n\n2013 – A joint commission led by the Conseil économique et social, the Conseil supérieur pour un développement durable and the Observatoire de la Compétitivité introduces a set of indicators measuring the quality of life in Luxembourg. The conclusions of the commission are summarised in a document titled \"Projet PIBien-être\", which identifies 64 indicators belonging to 11 different domains to assess quality of life in Luxembourg.\n\n2014 – The government of Dubai launched its localized Happiness Index to measure the public's contentment and satisfaction with different government services.\n\n2014 – The United Kingdom launched its own well-being and happiness statistics.\n\n2015 – Within the \"Projet PIBien-être\" launched in 2013, STATEC (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) presents a preliminary analysis of the \"Luxembourgish Index of Well-being\" (LIW), a first proposal of synthetic indicator measuring the quality of life in Luxembourg. The presentation entitled \"Preliminary Assessment of Quality of Life in Luxembourg\" was delivered by Marcin Piekałkiewicz on 16 December 2015.\n\n2017 – The Minderoo Foundation launched the Global Slavery Index, providing a map of the estimated prevalence of modern slavery. The information allows an objective comparison and assessment of both the problem and adequacy of the response in 167 countries.\n\nThe Satisfaction with Life Index is an attempt to show the average self-reported happiness in different nations. This is an example of a recent trend to use direct measures of happiness, such as surveys asking people how happy they are, as an alternative to traditional measures of policy success such as GDP or GNP. Some studies suggest that happiness can be measured effectively. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), published in November 2008 a major study on happiness economics in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nIn 2013, John Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffery Sachs compiled a treatise under the title \"World Happiness report 2013\" to elaborate on the measurement of popular happiness in different countries thereby adding to the wealth of happiness data available while specifically discussing the issues of measurement, explanation and policy. Global and Regional Happiness Levels are explained in terms of 10 regional groupings of countries based on happiness data available for the year 2010-2012. The happiness level is explained as a function of GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perceptions of corruption.\n\nThere are also several examples of measures that includes self-reported happiness as one variable. Happy Life Years, a concept brought by Dutch sociologist Ruut Veenhoven, combines self-reported happiness with life expectancy. The Happy Planet Index combines it with life expectancy and ecological footprint.\n\nGross National Happiness (GNH) is a concept introduced by the King of Bhutan in 1972 as an alternative to GDP. Several countries have already developed or are in the process of developing such an index. Bhutan's index has led that country to limit the amount of deforestation it will allow and to require that all tourists to its nation must spend US$200 Allegedly, low-budget tourism and deforestation lead to unhappiness.\n\nAfter the military coup of 2006, Thailand also instituted an index. The stated promise of the new Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont is to make the Thai people not only richer but happier as well. Much like GDP results, Thailand releases monthly GNH data. The Thai GNH index is based on a 1–10 scale with 10 being the most happy. As of May 13, 2007, the Thai GNH measured 5.1 points. The index uses poll data from the population surveying various satisfaction factors such as, security, public utilities, good governance, trade, social justice, allocation of resources, education and community problems.\n\nAustralia, China, France and the United Kingdom are also coming up with indexes to measure national happiness. The UK began to measure national wellbeing in 2012. North Korea also announced an international Happiness Index in 2011 through Korean Central Television. North Korea itself came in second, behind #1 China. Canada released the Canadian Index of Wellbeing (CIW) in 2011 to track changes in wellbeing. The CIW has adopted the following working definition of wellbeing: The presence of the highest possible quality of life in its full breadth of expression focused on but not necessarily exclusive to: good living standards, robust health, a sustainable environment, vital communities, an educated populace, balanced time use, high levels of democratic participation, and access to and participation in leisure and culture\n\nEcuador's and Bolivia's new constitutions state the indigenous concept of \"good life\" (\"buen vivir\" in Spanish, \"sumak kawsay\" in Quichua, and \"suma qamaña\" in Aymara) as the goal of sustainable development.\n\nNeoclassical, as well as classical economics, are not subsumed under the term \"happiness economics\" although the original goal was to increase the happiness of the people. Classical and neoclassical economics are stages in the development of welfare economics and are characterized by mathematical modeling. Happiness economics represents a radical break with this tradition. The measurement of \"subjective\" happiness respectively life satisfaction by means of survey research across nations and time (in addition to objective measures like lifespan, wealth, security etc.) marks the beginning of happiness economics.\n\nSome have suggested that establishing happiness as a metric is only meant to serve political goals. Recently there has been concern that happiness research could be used to advance authoritarian aims. As a result, some participants at a happiness conference in Rome have suggested that happiness research should not be used as a matter of public policy but rather used to inform individuals.\n\nEven on the individual level there is discussion on how much effect external forces can have on happiness. Less than 3% of an individual's level of happiness comes from external sources such as employment, education level, marital status, and socioeconomic status. To go along with this, four of the Big Five Personality Traits are substantially associated with life satisfaction, openness to experience is not associated. Having high levels of internal locus of control lead to higher reported levels of happiness.\n\nEven when happiness can be affected by external sources, it has high hedonic adaptation, some specific events such as an increase in income, disability, unemployment, and loss (bereavement) only have short-term (about a year) effects on a person's overall happiness and after a while happiness may return to levels similar to unaffected peers.\n\nWhat has the most influence over happiness are internal factors such as genetics, personality traits, and internal locus of control. It is theorized that 50% of the variation in happiness levels is from genetic sources and is known as the genetic set point. The genetic set point is assumed to be stable over time, fixed, and immune to influence or control. This goes along with findings that well-being surveys have a naturally positive baseline. \nWith such strong internal forces on happiness it is hard to have an effect on a person's happiness externally. This in turn lends itself back to the idea that establishing a happiness metric is only for political gain and has little other use. To support this even further it is believed that a country aggregate level of SWB can account for more variance in government vote share than standard macroeconomic variables, such as income and employment.\n\nAccording to Bond and Lang (2018) the results are skewed due to the fact that the respondents have to \"round\" their true happiness to the scale of, e.g., 3 or 7 alternatives (e.g., very happy, pretty happy, not too happy). This \"rounding error\" may cause a less happy group seem more happy, in the average. This would not be the case if the happiness of both groups would be normally distributed with the same variance, but that is usually not the case, based on their results. For some not-implausible log-normal assumptions on the scale, typical results can be reversed to the opposite results.\n\nThey also show that the \"reporting function\" seems to be different for different groups and even for the same individual at different times. For example, when a person becomes disabled, they soon start to lower their threshold for a given answer (e.g., \"pretty happy\"). That is, they give a higher answer than they would have given at the same happiness state before becoming disabled.\n\n\n\nBooks\n\nArticles\n\n"}

{"id": "1053576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1053576", "title": "John Gray (philosopher)", "text": "John Gray (philosopher)\n\nJohn Nicholas Gray (born 17 April 1948) is an English political philosopher with interests in analytic philosophy and the history of ideas. He retired in 2008 as School Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Gray contributes regularly to \"The Guardian\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\" and the \"New Statesman\", where he is the lead book reviewer. He is an atheist.\n\nGray has written several influential books, including \"\" (1998), which argues that free market globalization is an unstable Enlightenment project currently in the process of disintegration; \"Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals\" (2003), which attacks philosophical humanism, a worldview which Gray sees as originating in religions; and \"\" (2007), a critique of utopian thinking in the modern world.\n\nGray sees volition, and hence morality, as an illusion, and portrays humanity as a ravenous species engaged in wiping out other forms of life. Gray has written that \"humans ... cannot destroy the Earth, but they can easily wreck the environment that sustains them.\"\n\nGray was born into a working-class family, with a docker-turned-carpenter father, in South Shields, which was then in County Durham. He attended South Shields Grammar-Technical School for Boys from 1959 until 1967, then studied at Exeter College, Oxford, reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE), completing his B.A., M.Phil. and D.Phil.\n\nHe formerly held posts as lecturer in political theory at the University of Essex, fellow and tutor in politics at Jesus College, Oxford, and lecturer and then professor of politics at the University of Oxford. He has served as a visiting professor at Harvard University (1985–86) and Stranahan Fellow at the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green State University (1990–1994), and has also held visiting professorships at Tulane University’s Murphy Institute (1991) and Yale University (1994). He was Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science until his retirement from academic life in early 2008.\n\nAmong philosophers, he is known for a thoroughgoing rejection of Rawlsianism and for exploration of the uneasy relationship between value pluralism and liberalism in the work of Isaiah Berlin.\n\nGray's political thought is noted for its mobility across the political spectrum over the years. As a student, Gray was on the left and continued to vote Labour into the mid-1970s. By 1976 he had shifted towards a right-liberal New Right position, on the basis that the world was changing irrevocably through technological inventions, realigned financial markets and new economic power blocs and that the left failed to comprehend the magnitude and nature of this change. In the 1990s Gray became an advocate for environmentalism and New Labour. Gray considers the conventional (left-wing/right-wing) political spectrum of conservatism and social democracy as no longer viable.\n\nOn liberalism, Gray identified the common strands in liberal thought as being \"individualist\", \"egalitarian\", \"meliorist\", and \"universalist\". The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social collectivism, the egalitarian element assigns the same moral worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements, and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local cultural differences.\n\nMore recently, he has criticised neoliberalism, the global free market and some of the central currents in Western thinking, such as humanism, while moving towards aspects of green thought, drawing on the Gaia theory of James Lovelock. It is perhaps for this critique of humanism that Gray is best known.\n\nCentral to the doctrine of humanism, in Gray's view, is the inherently utopian belief in meliorism; that is, that humans are not limited by their biological natures and that advances in ethics and politics are cumulative and that they can alter or improve the human condition, in the same way that advances in science and technology have altered or improved living standards.\n\nGray contends, in opposition to this view, that history is not progressive, but cyclical. Human nature, he argues, is an inherent obstacle to cumulative ethical or political progress. Seeming improvements, if there are any, can very easily be reversed: one example he has cited has been the use of torture by the United States against terrorist suspects. \"What's interesting,\" Gray said in an interview in 032c magazine, \"is that torture not only came back, but was embraced by liberals, and defended by liberals. Now there are a lot of people, both liberal and conservative, who say, 'Well, it's a very complicated issue.' But it wasn't complicated until recently. They didn't say that five or ten years ago.\"\n\nFurthermore, he argues that this belief in progress, commonly imagined to be secular and liberal, is in fact derived from an erroneous Christian notion of humans as morally autonomous beings categorically different from other animals. This belief, and the corresponding idea that history makes sense, or is progressing towards something, is in Gray's view merely a Christian prejudice.\n\nIn \"Straw Dogs\" he argues that the idea that humans are self-determining agents does not pass the acid test of experience. Those Darwinist thinkers who believe humans can take charge of their own destiny to prevent environmental degradation are, in this view, not naturalists, but apostles of humanism.\n\nHe identifies the Enlightenment as the point at which the Christian doctrine of salvation was taken over by secular idealism and became a political religion with universal emancipation as its aim. Communism, fascism and \"global democratic capitalism\" are characterised by Gray as Enlightenment 'projects' which have led to needless suffering, in Gray's view, as a result of their ideological allegiance to this religion.\n\nThe term agonistic liberalism appears in Gray's 1995 book \"Isaiah Berlin\". Gray uses this phrase to describe what he believes is Berlin's theory of politics, namely his support for both value pluralism and liberalism.\n\nMore generally, agonistic liberalism could be used to describe any kind of liberalism that claims its own value commitments do not form a complete vision of politics and society, and that one instead needs to look for what Berlin calls an \"uneasy equilibrium\" between competing values. In Gray's view, many contemporary liberal theorists would fall into this category, for instance John Rawls and Karl Popper.\n\nAgonistic liberalism is an alternative to Berlin's theory of value pluralism and liberalism. While Berlin claimed equal validity for conflicting liberal views, agonistic liberalism holds that over time solutions may be found that determine which values are correct.\n\nAgonistic liberalism is the theory that conflict rather than discussion is the basis of social change.\n\nGray's work has been praised by, amongst others, the novelists J. G. Ballard, Will Self and John Banville, the theologian Don Cupitt, the journalist Bryan Appleyard, the political scientist David Runciman, the venturer George Soros, the environmental scientist James Lovelock and the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb.\n\nFriedrich Hayek described Gray's 1984 book \"Hayek on Liberty\" as \"The first survey of my work which not only fully understands but is able to carry on my ideas beyond the point at which I left off.\"\n\nGray has discussed James Lovelock's new ideas on evolution's next step; a species beyond human species that will be better able to co-exist with other species on this planet in the distant future.\n\nHis 1998 book \"\" was praised by George Soros as \"a powerful analysis of the deepening instability of global capitalism\" which \"should be read by all who are concerned about the future of the global economy\". John Banville praised \"\", saying that 'Gray's assault on Enlightenment ideas of progress is timelier than ever'.\n\nHis 2002 book \"Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals\" has received particular praise. J. G. Ballard wrote that the book \"challenges most of our assumptions about what it means to be human, and convincingly shows that most of them are delusions\" and described it \"a powerful and brilliant book\", \"an essential guide to the new millennium\" and \"the most exhilarating book I have read since Richard Dawkins's \"The Selfish Gene\".\" Will Self called the book \"a contemporary work of philosophy devoid of jargon, wholly accessible, and profoundly relevant to the rapidly evolving world we live in\" and wrote \"I read it once, I read it twice and took notes. I arranged to meet its author so I could publicise the book – I thought it that good.\"\n\nIn 2002 \"Straw Dogs\" was named a book of the year by J. G. Ballard in \"The Daily Telegraph\"; by George Walden in \"The Sunday Telegraph\"; by Will Self, Joan Bakewell, Jason Cowley and David Marquand in the \"New Statesman\"; by Andrew Marr in \"The Observer\"; by Jim Crace in \"The Times\"; by Hugh Lawson Tancred in \"The Spectator\"; by Richard Holloway in the \"Glasgow Herald\"; and by Sue Cook in \"The Sunday Express\".\n\nNassim Nicholas Taleb has written that John Gray is the modern thinker for whom he has the most respect, calling him \"prophetic\".\n\nGray's \"Straw Dogs\" has been criticised by Terry Eagleton, who has written: \"mixing nihilism and New Ageism in equal measure, Gray scoffs at the notion of progress for 150 pages before conceding that there is something to be said for anaesthetics. The enemy in his sights is not so much a Straw Dog as a Straw Man: the kind of starry-eyed rationalist who passed away with John Stuart Mill, but who he has to pretend still rules the world\".\n\nThe academic and author Danny Postel of the University of Denver also took issue with \"Straw Dogs\". Postel stated that Gray's claim that environmental destruction was the result of humanity's flawed nature would be \"welcome news to the captains of industry and the architects of the global economy; the ecological devastation they leave in their wake, according to Gray, has nothing to do with their exploits.\" Postel also claimed that too much of \"Straw Dogs\" rested on \"blanket assertion\", and criticised Gray's use of the term \"plague of people\" as an outdated \" neo-Malthusian persiflage about overpopulation\". Postel strongly condemned Gray for outlining \"complete political passivity. There is no point whatsoever in our attempting to make the world a less cruel or more livable place.\"\n\nJohn Gray has made several broadcasts for BBC Radio 4's programme \"A Point of View\".\n\nIn August and September 2011, he made six broadcasts:\n\nHe presented a second sequence from November 2014, sharing his \"Point of View\" on:\n\nOther programmes include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The organization of the group was an adaptation of the democratic centralist partisan model.<br>\nIn years that followed the last coup d'état he directed study groups that were called \"Universidad de las Sombras\" (\"University of Shadows\"). As suggested by its name, it had a secret status, which was a consequence of the Dirty War, that is, political persecution and forced disappearance carried out by the military government, both being crimes against humanity.<br>\nSebreli is mainly known because of his past collaboration with cultural magazines, such as Contorno and Sur. Nowadays he is columnist for La Nación and Perfil newspapers and Ñ magazine.\nHe engaged in several TV debates with Hugo Mujica.\n\nIn his work, Sebreli is radically critic of populism. His arguments are characterized by a sharp focus in the Argentine heterogeneous experiences of Peronism, movement he describes as fascist in its core. He criticizes the figure of Juan Domingo Perón, depicting him as an authoritarian and charismatic leader, thus making use of Weberian categories of thought. Sebreli states that the persistence of Peronism could be understood if one considers that, as a matter-of-fact, \"there are sectors in the Argentine society that have a (pretended) lack of memory and are prone to self-deception\". In one of his latest books (\"El malestar en la política\", 2012), he argues that Kirchnerism is a form of \"latinoamerican neopopulism\" and \"plebiscitary caesarism\", for it perfectly contrasts with a democratic republic.\n\nSebreli is quite known due to his criticism of 'irrational' theoretical inquiries. His arguments are an effort to corrode the foundations of psychoanalysis, and it is for that reason he labels such discipline as pseudoscience, following Karl Popper, as it lacks a proper scientific method. He asserts that Schopenhauer is \"the true father of modern irracionalism\", and that along with Dostoievski and Nietzsche he contributed to the transformation of philosophy in art, the aestheticization of life and thought.\n\nSebreli was member of the so-called “first Argentine existentialist group” along with Oscar Masotta and Carlos Correas. He introduced Jean-Paul Sartre into the academic milieux of his time.\nMolded by the Hegelian and Marxist Left, he introduced the political thought of Alexandre Kojève and that of Tran Duc Thao.\n\nIn 2002 he supported Ricardo López Murphy candidacy to presidency, something he later referred to as \"situational.\" Sebreli identified as social-democrat, \"in a European sense,\" and more recently as a left-liberal.\n\nThere are no known translations of Sebreli works to English.\n\n"}

They are treasures which embody not only the technical brilliance of the composer but also offer a peep into the advaitic school of Hindu philosophy and elements of Tantric rituals. They are very elaborate compositions which may be well compared with major symphonies in the Western system.\n\nThese songs are set in praise of the Goddess Kamalamba who is enshrined in Tiruvarur in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu in South India. The Goddess is the reference to the Divine Mother of the universe, or the Supreme Consciousness. The lyrics and the descriptive details are loaded with the mystical symbolism of the Vedantic (advaita) tradition and the chakras of the human system are closely linked to the evolutionary aspects described in the compositions that reflect the scholarly reach, musical depth and mystical significance of the composer. Navavarna refers to the 9 layers of the Sri Chakra yantra, one of the primary modes of Devi worship. Each avarna has a deity associated with it, which is mentioned in each of the songs.\n\nMusically, they are par excellence and the majestic sweep of well known ragas (melodic forms) like Todi, Kalyani, Kambhoji, Sankarabharanam, Sahana, Anandabhairavi and Bhairavi are offset against haunting melodies in lesser known ragas like Punnagavarali, Ghanta and Ahiri.\n\nDikshitar uses several talas (time measures) although Rupakam (3 beats) seems to be his favourite. Ata talam (14 beats) and Misra Jampa (10 beats) in the Kambhoji and Bhairavi pieces are rarely used because of the technical difficulty in executing these. An added element is the use of different case endings (which Dikshitar uses in his other group krities, like the Abhayamba and Nilotpalamba set). The Dhyana (invocatory) kriti in Todi is in the vocative case, followed by the Anandabhairavi in the nominative, Kalyani in the accusative, Sankarabharanam in the instrumental, Kambhoji in the dative, Bhairavi in the ablative and so on. The ninth avarana kriti in Ahiri has all the cases; the raga itself has all the 22 Sruti (notes) in the octave. It is believed that such a fusion of all melodic and temporal elements in the same kriti is a musical way of expressing the advaitic ideal of \"aham Brahmasmi\" or complete union with the Absolute. Indeed, the Ahiri composition is very unusual musically especially the pallavi which has a repeating and distinctive prose sections, are seamlessly put together.\n\nThe set concludes with a short and sweet mangalam (auspicious conclusion) in Sri ragam set in Khanda Ekam (5 beat talam). The entire set consists therefore of the dhyanam (invocation), the nine avaranas, and the mangalam (conclusion), a total of 11 pieces.\n\nThe rendition of this classic cycle of compositions begin with an invocatory song on Lord Ganesha and Lord Muruga.\n\n\nThe 11 kritis are as follows:\n\n\nOne of the specialities of this group set is the usage of Vibhakti or declension of the noun \"Kamalamba\" i.e., \"कमलांबा\" in 8 cases like:\n\nकमलांबा, कमलांबां, कमलांबिकया, कमलांबिकायै, कमलांबिकायाः, कमलांबिकायाः, कमलांबिकायां, कमलांबिके.\n\nThe Dhyana krithi, krithi for the eighth chakram, and Mangala krithi use the last declension. The Ahiri krithi can be decomposed so, to detail about the use of declensions of the noun.\n\nPallavi: 1st vibhakthi\n\nAnupallavi: \n1st two lines - 2nd vibhakthi\nNext two lines (Madhyama kala sahityam) - 3rd vibhakthi\n\nCharanam:\n1st line - 4th vibhakthi\n2nd line - 5th vibhakthi\n3rd line - 6th vibhakthi\n4th line - 7th vibhakthi\nMadhyama kala sahityam - 8th vibhakthi.\n\nThe rendering of these Kritis are considered to be extremely challenging owing to the complexity of the words and the notations. The D.K. Pattamal and D.K. Jayaraman school are considered to be specialists in the rendering of these compositions. It requires years of training to render them to perfection.\n\nSri Muthuswamy Dikshitar was a great Devi Upasaka and was well versed in all aspects of Sri Vidya Upasana. Out of his devotion to Sri Kamalamba, (one of the 64 Sakti Peethams in India), the celebrated deity at the famous Tyagaraja Temple in Tiruvarur and his compassion for all bhaktas, Sri Muthuswamy Dikshitar composed the Kamalamba Navavarana kritis, expounding in each of the nine kritis, the details of the each avarana of the Sri Chakra, including the devatas and the yoginis. Singing these kritis with devotion, sraddha and understanding would be the easy way to Sri Vidya Upasana.\n\nThe details of Chakras covered are as follows:\n\n"}

It was co-founded by two musicians, reggae artist Sams’K Le Jah and rapper Serge Bambara (\"Smockey\") in the Summer of 2013. They organized several protests in early 2014, for example hosting a joint rally with the newly formed Movement of People for Progress, filling a 35,000-capacity sports stadium to its rafters. \n\nWhen the October 2014 Burkinabé uprising broke out the group became a prominent part of the protests, its activists gaining note due to their presence on the streets. President Compaoré was forced to resign and flee the country on 31 October, after 27 years of rule. The presidency was subsequently occupied by the military, which named the pro-protest officer Yacouba Isaac Zida as the country's interim leader. Le Balai Citoyen, which launched a symbolic sweeping of Ouagadougou's streets following Compaoré's departure, has been reported to be supportive of Zida's transitional rule. However, its leaders called for protesters to \"remain vigilant and on high alert, to not let anyone steal the victory of the sovereign people.\"\n\nThe movement is part of the Burkinabé Sankarist political tradition, appealing to the legacy and ideals of Captain Thomas Sankara, a radical left-wing revolutionary who ruled the country from 1983 until his death in 1987, killed during a coup orchestrated by his successor Compaoré. Co-founder Sams’K Le Jah received his political education in the Pioneers of the Revolution, the youth movement of Sankara's \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\".\n\nThe movement is named both in reference to \"sweeping out\" perceived political corruption, and to the regular street-cleaning exercises – initiated by Thomas Sankara – in which citizens would pick up brooms and clean their neighbourhoods, both an act of community development and a metaphor for societal self-sufficiency. Members carry brooms during protests as a symbol of this.\n\nLe Balai Citoyen was spread throughout Burkina Faso mostly by Burkinabé youth, as young people (<25 years of age) constitute 65% of Burkina Faso's population. Smockey and SamsK Le Jah were influenced by movements like Y'en a Marre in Senegal and the Black Power movement in the United States. Initially the two artists spread their political messages to the youth through music broadcast on the radio. They continued to spread their messages at politically involved concerts with many attendees. Smockey and SamsK Le Jah were able to use their popularity to expand the reaches of their message. Le Balai Citoyen quickly gained public recognition and was endorsed by influential public figures such as Burkinabé lawyer Guy Hervé Kam. This was accompanied by a rise in young figures speaking out against the current political regime. Thomas Sankara was used as a motivational symbol to bring people together for this movement. Smockey and SamsK Le Jah worked hard to further advance the movement by hosting conferences and meeting with influential figures, rural community members, and students from across the country. People were encouraged to participate in their local Balais Citoyen clubs, and learn the purpose of the movement.\n\nLe Balai Citoyen focuses on all aspects of justice and civil rights through community involvement. Directly after its inception in 2013, members participated in several outreach programs and calls to action. On August 12th 2013, the movement put on a commemoration ceremony to honor Thomas Sankara and Norbert Zongo.\n\nBetween May and June 2014, Le Balai Citoyen held several sit-ins in both Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest city in the country. One of the sit-ins occurred at hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso (l'Hopital Sanou Souro) urging officials to renovate the establishment. Another took place in front of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso's electricity provider SONABEL for better electricity services. One more took place in front of Bobo-Dioulasso's town hall. \n\nIn October 2014, Blaise Compaoré put forth an amendment to the constitution known as Article 37 and called for a referendum. This amendment would grant him an extension to his presidency. L'inserrection Populaire (English: The Popular Insurrection) manifested between October 27th-31st as the public's response to the referendum. In this period Le Balai Citoyen collaborated with Collectif des Femmes pour la Défense de la Constitution (English: Women's Collective for the Defense of the Constitution), Le Collectif anti-referendum (English: The Anti-referendum Collective), and more to protest in the streets. Individuals from all groups carried brooms and spatulas as they marched, to symbolize the sweeping out of the regime. \n\nLe Balai Citoyen has also participated in many community service ventures. In 2014 they organized a public service cleaning day for a maternity ward in Ouagadougou (Maternité Pogbi) and arranged a blood drive in both Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. They also opened up an international fundraising campaign for Yalgado, the largest public hospital in Ouagadougou. In more recent years, the movement has been focused on expressing solidarity with other African nations experiencing political turmoil.\n\"Our Number is Our Strength!\" \"Together we are never alone!\"\n\n"}
{"id": "17888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17888", "title": "Leon Trotsky", "text": "Leon Trotsky\n\nLeon Trotsky (; born Lev Davidovich Bronstein; – 21 August 1940) was a Russian revolutionary, Marxist theorist, and Soviet politician whose particular strain of Marxist thought is known as Trotskyism.\n\nInitially supporting the Menshevik Internationalists faction within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, he joined the Bolsheviks (\"majority\") just before the 1917 October Revolution, immediately becoming a leader within the Communist Party. He would go on to become one of the seven members of the first Politburo, founded in 1917 to manage the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nDuring the early days of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the Soviet Union, he served first as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and later as the founder and commander of the Red Army, with the title of People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs. He became a major figure in the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War (1918–1922).\n\nAfter leading a failed struggle of the Left Opposition against the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and against the increasing role of bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, Trotsky was removed as Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs (January 1925), removed from the Politburo (October 1926), removed from the Central Committee (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), exiled to Alma–Ata (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). As the head of the Fourth International, Trotsky continued to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union while in exile.\n\nTrotsky was assassinated in Mexico City by Ramón Mercader, a Spanish-born NKVD agent. On 20 August 1940, Mercader attacked Trotsky with an ice axe and Trotsky died the next day in a hospital. Mercader acted upon instruction from Stalin and was nearly beaten to death by Trotsky's bodyguards, and spent the next 20 years in a Mexican prison for the murder. Stalin presented Mercader with an Order of Lenin in absentia.\n\nTrotsky's ideas formed the basis of Trotskyism, a major school of Marxist thought that opposes the theories of Stalinism. He was written out of the history books under Stalin, and was one of the few Soviet political figures who was not rehabilitated by the government under Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s.\n\nLeon Trotsky was born Lev Davidovich Bronstein on 7 November 1879, the fifth child of a Ukrainian-Jewish family of wealthy farmers in Yanovka or Yanivka, in the Kherson governorate of the Russian Empire (now Bereslavka, in Ukraine), a small village from the nearest post office. His parents were David Leontyevich Bronstein (1847–1922) and his wife Anna Lvovna (née Zhivotovskaya) (1850–1910). Trotsky's father was born in Poltava, and later moved to Bereslavka as it had a large Jewish community. The language spoken at home was a mixture of Russian and Ukrainian (known as Surzhyk). Trotsky's younger sister, Olga, who also grew up to be a Bolshevik and a Soviet politician, married the prominent Bolshevik Lev Kamenev.\n\nSome authors, notably Robert Service, have also claimed that Trotsky's childhood first name was the Yiddish \"Leiba\". The American Trotskyist David North said that this was an assumption from Trotsky's Jewish origins but that, contrary to Service's claims, there is no documentary evidence to support him using a Yiddish name, when that language was not spoken by his family. Both North and Walter Laqueur in their books say that Trotsky's childhood name was \"Lyova\", a standard Russian diminutive of the name \"Lev.\" North has compared the speculation on Trotsky's given name to the undue emphasis given to him having a Jewish surname. \n\nWhen Trotsky was eight, his father sent him to Odessa to be educated. He was enrolled in a German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa as a result of the Imperial government's policy of Russification. As Isaac Deutscher notes in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook.\n\nAlthough Trotsky spoke French, English and German to a good standard, he said in his autobiography \"My Life\" that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, while Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.\n\nTrotsky became involved in revolutionary activities in 1896 after moving to the harbor town of Nikolayev (now Mykolaiv) on the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea. At first a \"narodnik\" (revolutionary agrarian socialist populist), he initially opposed Marxism but was won over to Marxism later that year by his future first wife, Aleksandra Sokolovskaya. Instead of pursuing a mathematics degree, Trotsky helped organize the South Russian Workers' Union in Nikolayev in early 1897. Using the name 'Lvov,' he wrote and printed leaflets and proclamations, distributed revolutionary pamphlets, and popularized socialist ideas among industrial workers and revolutionary students.\n\nIn January 1898, more than 200 members of the union, including Trotsky, were arrested. He was held for the next two years in prison awaiting trial, first in Nikolayev, then Kherson, then Odessa, and finally in Moscow. In the Moscow prison he came into contact with other revolutionaries and heard about Lenin and read Lenin's book, \"The Development of Capitalism in Russia\". Two months into his imprisonment, on 1–3 March 1898, the first Congress of the newly formed Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) was held. From then on Trotsky identified as a member of the party.\n\nWhile in the prison in Moscow, in the summer of 1899, Trotsky married Aleksandra Sokolovskaya (1872–1938), a fellow Marxist. The wedding ceremony was performed by a Jewish chaplain.\n\nIn 1900, he was sentenced to four years in exile in Siberia. Because of their marriage, Trotsky and his wife were allowed to be exiled to the same location in Siberia. They were exiled to Ust-Kut and the Verkholensk in the Baikal Lake region of Siberia. They had two daughters, Zinaida (1901 – 5 January 1933) and Nina (1902 – 9 June 1928), both born in Siberia.\n\nIn Siberia, Trotsky studied philosophy. He became aware of the differences within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known as \"economists\" argued that the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot in life and were not so worried about changing the government. \n\nThey believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker's struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper \"Iskra,\" or in English, \"The Spark,\" which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the \"Iskra\" position and began writing for the paper.\n\nIn the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in a load of hay on a wagon. Aleksandra later escaped from Siberia with their daughters. Both daughters married and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents. Nina Nevelson died from tuberculosis, cared for in her last months by her older sister. Zinaida Volkova died after following her father into exile in Berlin. She had taken her son by her second marriage, and left her daughter in Russia. Suffering also from tuberculosis, then a fatal disease, and depression, Volkova committed suicide. Their mother Aleksandra disappeared in 1935 during the Great Purges in the Soviet Union under Stalin, and was murdered by Stalinist forces three years later.\n\nUntil this point in his life, Trotsky had used his birth name: Lev (Leon) Bronstein. He changed his surname to \"Trotsky\"—the name he would use for the rest of his life. It is said he adopted the name of a jailer of the Odessa prison in which he had earlier been held. This became his primary revolutionary pseudonym. After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining Georgi Plekhanov, Vladimir Lenin, Julius Martov and other editors of \"Iskra\". Under the pen name \"Pero\" (\"feather\" or \"pen\" in Russian), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.\n\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of \"Iskra\" were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by Plekhanov and the \"new guard\" led by Lenin and Martov. Plekhanov's supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within \"Iskra,\" expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard.\n\nIn March 1903 Lenin wrote:\n\nBecause of Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But, from then on he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.\n\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met Natalia Sedova, who soon became his companion. They married in 1903 and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, Lev Sedov (24 February 1906 – 16 February 1938) and Sergei Sedov (21 March 1908 – 29 October 1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\n\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name \"Sedova-Trotskaya\".\n\nIn the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898, \"Iskra\" succeeded in convening the party's Second Congress in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other \"Iskra\" editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with \"Iskra\" supporters handily defeating the few \"economist\" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the Jewish Bund, which had co-founded the RSDLP in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.\n\nShortly thereafter, the pro-\"Iskra\" delegates split into two factions. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party, while Martov and his supporters, the Mensheviks, argued for a larger and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the \"Iskra\" editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.\n\nFrom 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a \"non-factional social democrat\". He worked between 1904 and 1917 trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. During these years, Trotsky began developing his theory of permanent revolution, and developed a close working relationship with Alexander Parvus in 1904–07.\n\nDuring their split, Lenin referred to Trotsky as a \"Judas\", a \"scoundrel\" and a \"swine\".\n\nThe unrest and agitation against the Russian government came to a head in Saint Petersburg on 3 January 1905 (Julian Calendar), when a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in the city. This single strike grew into a general strike and by 7 January 1905, there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg.\n\nOn Sunday, 9 January 1905, Father Georgi Gapon led a peaceful procession of citizens through the streets to the Winter Palace to beseech the Tsar for food and relief from the oppressive government. The Palace Guard fired on the peaceful demonstration, resulting in the deaths of some 1,000 demonstrators. Sunday, 9 January 1905, became known as Bloody Sunday.\n\nFollowing the events of Bloody Sunday, Trotsky secretly returned to Russia in February 1905, by way of Kiev. At first he wrote leaflets for an underground printing press in Kiev, but soon moved to the capital, Saint Petersburg. There he worked with both Bolsheviks, such as Central Committee member Leonid Krasin, and the local Menshevik committee, which he pushed in a more radical direction. The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural Finland. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution.\n\nOn 19 September 1905, the typesetters at the Ivan Sytin's printing house in Moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay. By the evening of 24 September, the workers at 50 other printing shops in Moscow were also on strike. On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers. On 7 October 1905, the railway workers of the Moscow–Kazan Railway went out on strike. Amid the resulting confusion, Trotsky returned from Finland to Saint Petersburg on 15 October 1905. On that day, Trotsky spoke before the Saint Petersburg Soviet Council of Workers Deputies, which was meeting at the Technological Institute in the city. Also attending were some 200,000 people crowded outside to hear the speeches—about 50% of all workers in Saint Petersburg.\n\nAfter his return, Trotsky and Parvus took over the newspaper \"Russian Gazette,\" increasing its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded, together with Parvus and Julius Martov and other Mensheviks, \"Nachalo\" (\"The Beginning\"), which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in 1905.\n\nJust before Trotsky's return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had: an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital's workers, the first Soviet (\"Council\") of Workers. By the time of Trotsky's arrival, the Saint Petersburg Soviet was already functioning headed by Khrustalyev-Nosar (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov). Khrustalyev-Nosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Khrustalev-Nosar was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the Soviet.\n\nHowever, since his election, he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks' original opposition to him. Khrustalev-Nosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Indeed, to the outside world, Khrustalev-Nosar was the embodiment of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name \"Yanovsky\" (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar's arrest on 26 November 1905, was elected its chairman. On 2 December, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts: \n\nThe following day, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested. Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. On 4 October 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to Siberia.\n\nWhile en route to exile in Obdorsk, Siberia, in January 1907, Trotsky escaped at Berezov and once again made his way to London. He attended the 5th Congress of the RSDLP. In October, he moved to Vienna, Austria-Hungary. For the next seven years, he often took part in the activities of the Austrian Social Democratic Party and, occasionally, of the German Social Democratic Party.\n\nIn Vienna, Trotsky became close to Adolph Joffe, his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to psychoanalysis.\n\nIn October 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of \"Pravda\" (\"Truth\"), a bi-weekly, Russian-language social democratic paper for Russian workers, which he co-edited with Adolph Joffe and Matvey Skobelev. It was smuggled into Russia. The paper appeared very irregularly; only five issues were published in its first year.\n\nAvoiding factional politics, the paper proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905–1907 revolution. Money was very scarce for publication of \"Pravda.\" Trotsky approached the Russian Central Committee to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909.\n\nThe Central Committee in 1910 was controlled by a majority of Bolsheviks. Lenin agreed to the financing of \"Pravda\", but required a Bolshevik be appointed as co-editor of the paper. When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in Paris over Lenin's objections, Trotsky's \"Pravda\" was made a party-financed 'central organ'. Lev Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910. Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing \"Pravda\" for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.\n\nThe Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912, and also called it \"Pravda\". Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913 he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the letter was intercepted by the Russian police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.\n\nThe 1910s was a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP, leading to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of \"expropriations\", i.e., armed robbery of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party. These actions had been banned by the 5th Congress, but were continued by the Bolsheviks.\n\nIn January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction, led by Lenin, as well as a few defecting Mensheviks, held a conference in Prague and decided to break away from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and formed a new party, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In response, Trotsky organized a \"unification\" conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. \"The August Bloc\") and tried to re-unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks into one party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.\n\nIn Vienna, Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers, such as \"Kievskaya Mysl,\" under a variety of pseudonyms, often using \"Antid Oto\". In September 1912, \"Kievskaya Mysl\" sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two Balkan Wars for the next year and became a close friend of Christian Rakovsky. The latter was later a leading Soviet politician and Trotsky's ally in the Soviet Communist Party. On 3 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, in which Austria-Hungary fought against the Russian Empire, Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral Switzerland to avoid arrest as a Russian émigré.\n\nThe outbreak of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions, while Plekhanov and other social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent. In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the Swiss Socialist Party, prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, \"The War and the International,\" and the pro-war position taken by the European social democratic parties, primarily the German party. \n\nAs a war correspondent for the \"Kievskaya Mysl\", Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) \"Nashe Slovo\" (\"Our Word\"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of \"peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered.\" Lenin advocated Russia's defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the Second International.\n\nTrotsky attended the Zimmerwald Conference of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a Third International. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.\n\nOn 31 March 1916, Trotsky was deported from France to Spain for his anti-war activities. Spanish authorities did not want him and deported him to the United States on 25 December 1916. He arrived in New York City on 13 January 1917. He stayed for nearly three months at 1522 Vyse Avenue in The Bronx. In New York he wrote articles for the local Russian language socialist newspaper, \"Novy Mir,\" and the Yiddish-language daily, \"Der Forverts\" (\"The Jewish Daily Forward\"), in translation. He also made speeches to Russian émigrés.\n\nTrotsky was living in New York City when the February Revolution of 1917 overthrew Tsar Nicholas II. He left New York on 27 March 1917, but his ship, the \"SS Kristianiafjord,\" was intercepted by British naval officials in Canada at Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was detained for a month at Amherst Internment Camp in Nova Scotia. While imprisoned in the camp, Trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates, describing his month at the camp as \"one continual mass meeting\".\n\nTrotsky's speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of German officer inmates who complained to the British camp commander, Colonel Morris, about Trotsky's \"anti-patriotic\" attitude. Morris then forbade Trotsky to make any more public speeches, leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against Morris' order. Back in Russia, after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers' and peasants' soviets, the Russian foreign minister Pavel Milyukov was compelled to demand the release of Trotsky as a Russian citizen, and the British government freed him on 29 April 1917.\n\nHe reached Russia on 17 May 1917. After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the Mezhraiontsy, a regional social democratic organization in Saint Petersburg, and became one of its leaders. At the First Congress of Soviets in June, he was elected a member of the first All-Russian Central Executive Committee (\"VTsIK\") from the Mezhraiontsy faction. \n\nAfter an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in Petrograd, Trotsky was arrested on 7 August 1917. He was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary uprising by Lavr Kornilov. After the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the Petrograd Soviet, Trotsky was elected chairman on . He sided with Lenin against Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev when the Bolshevik Central Committee discussed staging an armed uprising, and he led the efforts to overthrow the Provisional Government headed by Aleksandr Kerensky.\n\nThe following summary of Trotsky's role in 1917 was written by Stalin in \"Pravda\", 6 November 1918. Although this passage was quoted in Stalin's book \"The October Revolution\" (1934), it was expunged from Stalin's \"Works\" (1949).\n\nAfter the success of the uprising on 7–8 November 1917, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a counter-attack by Cossacks under General Pyotr Krasnov and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at Gatchina. Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other socialist parties. By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin's top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading. This reversal of position contributed to continuing competition and enmity between the two men, which lasted until 1926 and did much to destroy them both.\n\nAfter the Bolsheviks came to power, Trotsky became the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and published the secret treaties previously signed by the Triple Entente that detailed plans for post-war reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders.\n\nTrotsky led the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918. At that time the Soviet government was split on the issue. Left Communists, led by Nikolai Bukharin, continued to believe that there could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist country and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace.\n\nThey cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary Red Army against Polish forces of Gen. Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki in Belarus, White forces in the Don region, and newly independent Ukrainian forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and asymmetrical warfare were used.\n\nThey were willing to hold talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, reparations, etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West, but they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany in order to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.\n\nLenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:\n\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories. He wrote in 1925:\n\nThroughout January and February 1918, Lenin's position was supported by 7 members of the Bolshevik Central Committee and Bukharin's by 4. Trotsky had 4 votes (his own, Felix Dzerzhinsky's, Nikolai Krestinsky's and Adolph Joffe's) and, since he held the balance of power, he was able to pursue his policy in Brest-Litovsk. When he could no longer delay the negotiations, he withdrew from the talks on 10 February 1918, refusing to sign on Germany's harsh terms.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, the Central Powers notified the Soviet government that they would no longer observe the truce after 17 February. At this point Lenin again argued that the Soviet government had done all it could to explain its position to Western workers and that it was time to accept the terms. Trotsky refused to support Lenin since he was waiting to see whether German workers would rebel and whether German soldiers would refuse to follow orders.\n\nGermany resumed military operations on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized and poorly led, were no match for it. In the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7–4. The Soviet government sent a radiogram to the German side accepting the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.\n\nGermany did not respond for three days, and continued its offensive encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7–4 on 23 February 1918; the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs in order to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.\n\nThe failure of the recently formed Red Army to resist the German offensive in February 1918 revealed its weaknesses: insufficient numbers, lack of knowledgeable officers, and near absence of coordination and subordination. Celebrated and feared Baltic Fleet sailors, one of the bastions of the new regime led by Pavel Dybenko, fled from the German army at Narva. The notion that the Soviet state could have an effective voluntary or militia type military was seriously undermined.\n\nTrotsky was one of the first Bolshevik leaders to recognise the problem, and he pushed for the formation of a military council of former Russian generals that would function as an advisory body. Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee agreed on 4 March to create the Supreme Military Council, headed by former chief of the imperial General Staff Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich.\n\nThe entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People's Commissar (defence minister) Nikolai Podvoisky and commander-in-chief Nikolai Krylenko, protested vigorously and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the Russian Civil War, and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the Military Opposition (Russian: ), which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918–1919.\n\nOn 13 March 1918, Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs – in place of Podvoisky – and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over Brest-Litovsk.\n\nWith the help of his deputy Ephraim Sklyansky, Trotsky spent the rest of the Civil War transforming the Red Army from a ragtag network of small and fiercely independent detachments into a large and disciplined military machine, through forced conscription, party-controlled blocking squads, compulsory obedience and officers chosen by the leadership instead of the rank and file. He defended these positions throughout his life.\n\nThe military situation soon tested Trotsky's managerial and organisation-building skills. In May–June 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions \"en route\" from European Russia to Vladivostok rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organised resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the White Army after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.\n\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged mobilisation, which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of political commissars into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:\nIn response to Fanya Kaplan's failed assassination of Lenin on 30 August 1918, and to the successful assassination of the Petrograd Cheka chief Moisei Uritsky on 17 August 1918, the Bolsheviks instructed Felix Dzerzhinsky to commence a Red Terror, announced in the 1 September 1918 issue of the \"Krasnaya Gazeta\" (\"Red Gazette\"). Regarding the Red Terror Trotsky wrote:\n\nIn dealing with deserters, Trotsky often appealed to them politically, arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:\n\nIn September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing continuous military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the Latvian Riflemen, Ioakim Vatsetis (a.k.a. Jukums Vācietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of day-to-day operations of the army while Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\n\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general Pavel Pavlovich Sytin to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled from the front. Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.\n\nThroughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky's leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the VIIIth Party Congress in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first Politburo after the Congress. But he later wrote:\n\nIn mid-1919 the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky's leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000, and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts. The Red Army had defeated the White Army's spring offensive in the east and was about to cross the Ural Mountains and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral Alexander Kolchak's forces. But in the south, General Anton Denikin's White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On 6 June, Red Army commander-in-chief, Jukums Vācietis, ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander Sergey Kamenev (a former colonel of the Imperial army), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members Ivar Smilga, Mikhail Lashevich and Sergey Gusev vigorously protested and wanted to keep the emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front. Trotsky, who had earlier had conflicts with the leadership of the Eastern Front, including a temporary removal of Kamenev in May 1919, supported Vācietis.\n\nAt the 3–4 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against Vācietis and Trotsky. Trotsky's plan was rejected and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin to dismiss Trotsky from his post. But when Trotsky offered his resignation on 5 July, the Politburo and the Orgburo of the Central Committee unanimously rejected it.\n\nHowever, some significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while the work in Moscow was informally coordinated by Smilga. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, Vācietis was suddenly arrested by the Cheka on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and Tukhachevsky were defeated during the Battle of Warsaw, but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and later support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.\n\nBy October 1919, the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin's troops approached Tula and Moscow from the south, and General Nikolay Yudenich's troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent Estonia and Finland from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee. He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By 22 October, the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November, Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned. Trotsky was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions in Petrograd.\n\nWith the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government's emphasis shifted to the economy. Trotsky spent the winter of 1919–20 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of War Communism, which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal. He put Trotsky in charge of the country's railroads (while retaining overall control of the Red Army), which he directed should be militarized in the spirit of War Communism. It was not until early 1921, due to economic collapse and social uprisings, that Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership abandoned War Communism in favor of the New Economic Policy.\n\nIn early 1920, Soviet–Polish tensions eventually led to the Polish–Soviet War. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army's successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant \"The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war.\"\n\nThe Red Army was defeated by Poland and the offensive was turned back during the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920, in part because of Stalin's failure to obey Trotsky's orders in the run-up to the decisive engagements. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty and this time prevailed.\n\nIn late 1920, after the Bolsheviks won the Civil War and before the Eighth and Ninth Congress of Soviets, the Communist Party had a heated and increasingly acrimonious debate over the role of trade unions in the Soviet Union. The discussion split the party into many \"platforms\" (factions), including Lenin's, Trotsky's and Bukharin's; Bukharin eventually merged his with Trotsky's. Smaller, more radical factions like the Workers' Opposition (headed by Alexander Shlyapnikov) and the Group of Democratic Centralism were particularly active.\n\nTrotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarised \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state the workers should have nothing to fear from the state, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress he argued for \"...a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime. This is the militarisation of the working class.\" \n\nLenin sharply criticised Trotsky and accused him of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\" and of staging \"factional attacks\". His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions take a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. This cannot be achieved by bureaucratic methods and orders from above.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.\n\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, Yevgeny Preobrazhensky and Leonid Serebryakov) supporting Trotsky.\n\nAt a meeting of his faction at the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by Vyacheslav Molotov. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents. At the end of the Tenth Congress, after peace negotiations had failed, Trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.\n\nYears later, anarchist Emma Goldman and others criticised Trotsky's actions as Commissar for War for his role in the suppression of the rebellion, and argued that he ordered unjustified incarcerations and executions of political opponents such as anarchists, although Trotsky did not participate in the actual suppression. Some Trotskyists, most notably Abbie Bakan, have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were \"counterrevolutionary\" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion. Other historians, most notably Paul Avrich, claimed the evidence did not point towards this conclusion, and saw the Kronstadt Rebellion as spontaneous.\n\nVladimir Cherniaev, a leading Russian historian, sums up Trotsky's main contributions to the Russian Revolution:\nHistorian Geoffrey Swain argues that:\nLenin said in 1921 that Trotsky was \"in love with organisation,\" but in working politics, \"he has not got a clue.\" Swain explains the paradox by arguing that Trotsky was not good at teamwork; he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist, not as a professional revolutionary like the others.\n\nIn late 1921, Lenin's health deteriorated and he was absent from Moscow for longer periods of time. He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee general secretary. Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev became part of the \"troika\" (triumvirate) formed by Stalin to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number-two man in the country and Lenin's heir presumptive, would not succeed Lenin.\n\nThe rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the \"troika.\" Stalin's power of patronage in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\n\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the \"troika\" nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables). In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\". Lenin was shocked and responded: \n\nFrom then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in \"Lenin's Testament.\" As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky \"categorically refused\".\n\nIn late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy. Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), further centralising state control. The alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade but was hindered by Lenin's progressing illness.\n\nIn January 1923, Lenin amended his Testament to suggest that Stalin should be removed as the party's general secretary, while also mildly criticising Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders. The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called \"Great-Russian nationalistic campaign\" at the XIIth Party Congress.\n\nAt the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin's final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue. Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the \"troika.\" Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers.\n\nThe delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a standing ovation. This upset the \"troika\", already infuriated by Karl Radek's article, \"Leon Trotsky – Organiser of Victory\" published in \"Pravda\" on 14 March 1923. Stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin's prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.\n\nIn mid-1923 the \"troika\" had Trotsky's friend and supporter Christian Rakovsky removed from his post as head of the Ukrainian government (USSR \"Radnarkom\") and sent to London as ambassador. When regional leaders in Ukraine protested against Rakovsky's reassignment, they too were reassigned to various posts all over the Soviet Union. \n\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"Workers' Truth\" and \"Workers' Group\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission, attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\n\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent \"The Declaration of 46\" to the Central Committee on 15 October in which they wrote:\n\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the \"troika\" and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's \"Pravda\" article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the \"troika\" tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The \"troika\" used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\" and other sins.\n\nTrotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as \"The New Course\" in January 1924. The illusion of a \"monolithic Bolshevik leadership\" was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of \"Pravda\". The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16–18 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee's position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the Left Opposition.\n\nSince the \"troika\" controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin's Secretariat and \"Pravda\" through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-\"troika\" delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\" as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts, and the \"troika\" was careful to emphasise that the debate was limited to Trotsky's \"mistakes\" and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision-making process.\n\nImmediately after the Conference, Trotsky left for a Caucasian resort to recover from his prolonged illness. On his way, he learned about Lenin's death on 21 January 1924. He was about to return when a follow up telegram from Stalin arrived, giving an incorrect date of the scheduled funeral, which would have made it impossible for Trotsky to return in time. Many commentators speculated after the fact that Trotsky's absence from Moscow in the days following Lenin's death contributed to his eventual loss to Stalin, although Trotsky generally discounted the significance of his absence.\n\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by \"troika\" partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the \"troika\" and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing Mikhail Frunze, who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.\n\nAt the thirteenth Party Congress in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:\n\nIn the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party \"regime\", began to crystallise. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the \"troika\", but it also began formulating a program. \n\nEconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician Yevgeni Preobrazhensky came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the \"troika\" at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building 'Socialism in One Country'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\n\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the \"troika\", always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published \"Lessons of October,\" an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\n\nIn it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the \"Literary Discussion\", with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\n\n\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\n\n1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky. After the bruising \"Literary Discussion\" and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts: chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in \"My Life\" that he \"was taking a rest from politics\" and \"naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears\".\n\nSome contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man. Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (maintaining Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.\n\nIn one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances surrounding the controversy around Lenin's Testament were described by American Marxist Max Eastman in his book \"Since Lenin Died\" (1925). The Soviet leadership denounced Eastman's account and used party discipline to force Trotsky to write an article denying Eastman's version of the events.\n\nIn the meantime, the \"troika\" finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance Grigory Sokolnikov aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the XIVth Party Congress in December 1925. With only the Leningrad Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed \"The New Opposition\", were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.\n\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the United Opposition.\n\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the Chinese Revolution. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XVth Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the GPU (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\n\nSoviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911, resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, Puyi, on 12 February 1912. Sun Yat-sen established the Republic of China.\n\nIn reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\" — the Kuomintang. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a Northern Expedition was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese Communist Party to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.\n\nTrotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang's right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927 by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.\n\nWhile the catastrophic events in China completely vindicated Trotsky's criticism of Stalin's approach towards the Chinese Revolution, this paled in significance compared to the demoralization that the Soviet masses felt at such a big setback for socialist revolution in China, with this demoralization aiding Stalin and his allies in the Communist Party and the Soviet state. Attacks against the United Opposition quickly increased in volatility and ferocity afterwards.\n\nIn October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party on 12 November. Their leading supporters, from Kamenev down, were expelled in December 1927 by the XVth Party Congress, which paved the way for mass expulsions of rank-and-file oppositionists as well as internal exile of opposition leaders in early 1928.\n\nDuring this time Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat Adolph Joffe, in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XVth Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to Alma Ata, Kazakhstan on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to Turkey in February 1929, accompanied by his wife Natalia Sedova and their eldest son, Lev.\n\nAfter Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, \"admitted their mistakes\" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was Christian Rakovsky, who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the Soviet Union, and was exiled to Yakutia in March 1933. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Constantinople. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally \"admitted his mistakes\" (his letter to \"Pravda\", titled \"There Should Be No Mercy\", depicted Trotsky and his supporters as \"agents of the German Gestapo\"). Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935. However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of Sergey Kirov, and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the Great Purge).\n\nAlmost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union's borders were executed in the Great Purges of 1936–1938, although Rakovsky survived until the Medvedev Forest massacre of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin's orders, less than three months into the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Also among the Medvedev Forest victims was Trotsky's sister/Kamenev's first wife, Olga Kameneva.\n\nIn February 1929, Trotsky was deported from the Soviet Union to his new exile in Turkey. During his first two months in Turkey, Trotsky lived with his wife and eldest son at the Soviet Union Consulate in Constantinople and then at a nearby hotel in the city. In April 1929, Trotsky, his wife and son were moved to the island of Büyükada (aka Prinkipo) by the Turkish authorities. On Prinkipo, they were moved into a house called the Yanaros mansion, where Trotsky and his wife lived until July 1933. During his exile in Turkey, Trotsky was under the surveillance of the Turkish police forces of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Trotsky was also at risk from the many former White Army officers who lived on Prinkipo, officers who had opposed the October Revolution and who had been defeated by Trotsky and the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky's European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety.\n\nIn July 1933, Trotsky was offered asylum in France by Prime Minister Édouard Daladier. Trotsky accepted the offer, but he was forbidden to live in Paris and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in Royan. The philosopher and activist Simone Weil also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards to stay for a few days at her parents' house. Following the 6 February 1934 crisis in France, the French minister of internal affairs, Albert Sarraut, signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France. However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. Accordingly, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of Barbizon under the strict surveillance of the French police, where Trotsky found his contact with the outside world to be even worse than during his exile in Turkey.\n\nIn May 1935, soon after the French government had agreed the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union government, Trotsky was officially told that he was no longer welcome in France. After weighing his options, Trotsky applied to move to Norway. After obtaining permission from then Justice Minister Trygve Lie to enter the country, Trotsky and his wife became a guest of Konrad Knudsen at Norderhov, near Hønefoss, and spent over a year living at Knudsen's house, from 18 June 1935 to 2 September 1936, although Trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby Oslo Community Hospital from 19 September 1935. \n\nFollowing French media complaints about Trotsky's role in encouraging the mass strikes in France in May and June 1936 with his articles, the Johan Nygaardsvold-led Norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about Trotsky's actions. In the summer of 1936, Trotsky's asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist Nasjonal Samling, led by Vidkun Quisling,  along with an increase in pressure from the Soviet government on the Norwegian authorities. On 5 August 1936, Knudsen's house was burgled by fascists from the Nasjonal Samling while Trotsky and his wife were out on a seashore trip with Knudsen and his wife. The fascist burglars targeted Trotsky's works and archives for vandalism. The raid was largely thwarted by Knudsen's daughter, Hjørdis, although the burglars did take a few papers from the nearest table as they left. Although the fascist perpetrators were caught and put on trial, the \"evidence\" obtained in the burglary was used by the government to make claims against Trotsky. \n\nOn 14 August 1936, the Soviet Press Agency TASS announced the discovery of a \"Trotskyist–Zinovievist\" plot and the imminent start of the Trial of the Sixteen accused. Trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into Moscow's accusations. The accused were sentenced to death, including Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, and executed on 25 August 1936. On 26 August 1936, eight policemen arrived at Knudsen's house demanding that Trotsky sign new conditions for residing in Norway. These conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters, to give no interviews, and to have all his correspondence (incoming and outgoing) inspected by the police. Trotsky categorically refused the conditions, and Trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence. The following day Trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities, with the police officially citing Trotsky as a \"witness\" to the fascist raid of 5 August 1936.\n\nOn 2 September 1936, four weeks after the fascist break-in at Knudsen's house, Trygve Lie ordered that Trotsky and his wife be transferred to a farm in Hurum, where they were under house arrest.  The treatment of Trotsky and his wife at Hurum was harsh, as they were forced to stay indoors for 22 hours per day under the constant guard of thirteen policemen, with only one hour permitted twice a day for a walk on the farm.  Trotsky was prevented from posting any letters and prevented from arguing back against his critics in Norway and beyond. Only Trotsky's lawyers and the Norwegian Labour Party Parliamentary leader, Olav Scheflo, were permitted to visit.  From October 1936, even the outdoor walks were prohibited for Trotsky and his wife.  Trotsky did eventually manage to smuggle out one letter on 18 December 1936, titled \"The Moscow \"Confessions\"\". On 19 December 1936, Trotsky and his wife were deported from Norway after being put on the Norwegian oil tanker \"Ruth\", under guard by Jonas Lie. When later living in Mexico, Trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at Hurum, and accused the Norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the Trial of the Sixteen and other show trials, saying: \n\nThe \"Ruth\" oil tanker on which Trotsky and his wife were put arrived in Mexico on 9 January 1937.  On Trotsky's arrival, the Mexican president, Lázaro Cárdenas, welcomed Trotsky to Mexico and arranged for his special train \"The Hidalgo\" to bring Trotsky to Mexico City from the port of Tampico.\n\nFrom January 1937 to April 1939, Trotsky and his wife lived in the Coyoacán area of Mexico City at La Casa Azul (The Blue House), the home of the painter Diego Rivera and Rivera's wife and fellow painter, Frida Kahlo, with whom Trotsky had an affair. His final move was a few blocks away to a residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939, following a break with Rivera.\nTrotsky wrote prolifically while in exile, penning several key works, including his \"History of the Russian Revolution\" (1930) and \"The Revolution Betrayed\" (1936), a critique of the Soviet Union under Stalinism. He argued that the Soviet state had become a \"degenerated workers' state\" controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy, which would eventually either be overthrown via a political revolution establishing a workers' democracy, or degenerate into a capitalist class.\n\nWhile in Mexico, Trotsky also worked closely with James P. Cannon, Joseph Hansen, and Farrell Dobbs of the Socialist Workers Party of the United States, and other supporters. Cannon, a long-time leading member of the American communist movement, had supported Trotsky in the struggle against Stalinism since he had first read Trotsky's criticisms of the Soviet Union in 1928. Trotsky's critique of the Stalinist regime, though banned, was distributed to leaders of the Comintern. Among his other supporters was Chen Duxiu, founder of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIn August 1936, the first Moscow show trial of the so-called \"Trotskyite–Zinovievite Terrorist Center\" was staged in front of an international audience. During the trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other accused, most of them prominent Old Bolsheviks, confessed to having plotted with Trotsky to kill Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership. The court found everybody guilty and sentenced the defendants to death, Trotsky \"in absentia\". The second show trial, of Karl Radek, Grigori Sokolnikov, Yuri Pyatakov and 14 others, took place in January 1937, during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to Trotsky. In April 1937, an independent \"Commission of Inquiry\" into the charges made against Trotsky and others at the \"Moscow Trials\" was held in Coyoacán, with John Dewey as chairman. The findings were published in the book \"Not Guilty\".\n\nFor fear of splitting the Communist movement, Trotsky initially opposed the idea of establishing parallel Communist parties or a parallel international Communist organization that would compete with the Third International. In mid-1933, after the Nazi takeover in Germany and the Comintern's response to it, he changed his mind. He said, that:\n\nIn 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International, which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the Stalinist Comintern.\n\nTowards the end of 1939, Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Representative Martin Dies, chairman of the committee, demanded the suppression of the American Communist Party. Trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the NKVD's activities against him and his followers.\n\nHe made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party, and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nAfter quarreling with Diego Rivera, Trotsky moved to his final residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939.\n\nOn 27 February 1940, Trotsky wrote a document known as \"Trotsky's Testament\", in which he expressed his final thoughts and feelings for posterity. He was suffering from high blood pressure, and feared that he would suffer a cerebral haemorrhage. After forcefully denying Stalin's accusations that he had betrayed the working class, he thanked his friends and above all his wife, Natalia Sedova, for their loyal support:\n\nAfter an ineffectual attempt to have Trotsky murdered in March 1939, Stalin assigned the overall organization of implementing the task to the NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov, who in turn co-opted Nahum Eitingon. According to Sudoplatov's \"Special Tasks\", the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks to carry out the murder, one of which relied on Ramón Mercader. According to Sudoplatov, all three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD's hitherto-established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nOn 24 May 1940, Trotsky survived a raid on his villa by armed assassins led by the NKVD agent Iosif Grigulevich and Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros. Trotsky's 14-year-old grandson, Vsevolod Platonovich \"Esteban\" Volkov (born 7 March 1926), was shot in the foot, and a young assistant and bodyguard of Trotsky, Robert Sheldon Harte, was abducted and later murdered. Trotsky's other guards fended off the attackers. Following the failed assassination attempt, Trotsky wrote an article titled \"Stalin Seeks My Death\" on 8 June 1940, in which he stated that another assassination attempt was certain.\n\nOn 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in his study by Mercader, who used an ice axe as a weapon. The blow to his head was bungled and failed to kill Trotsky instantly. Witnesses stated that Trotsky spat on Mercader and began struggling fiercely with him, which resulted in Mercader's hand being broken. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky's bodyguards burst into the room and nearly killed Mercader, but Trotsky stopped them, laboriously stating that the assassin should be made to answer questions. Trotsky was then taken to a hospital, operated on, and survived for more than a day, dying at the age of 60 on 21 August 1940 from exsanguination and shock. Mercader later testified at his trial:\n\nAccording to James P. Cannon, the secretary of the Socialist Workers Party (USA), Trotsky's last words were \"I will not survive this attack. Stalin has finally accomplished the task he attempted unsuccessfully before.\"\n\nTrotsky's house in Coyoacán was preserved in much the same condition as it was on the day of the assassination and is now the Leon Trotsky Museum, run by a board which includes his grandson Esteban Volkov. Trotsky's grave is located in its grounds. The foundation \"International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum\" has been organized to raise funds to further improve the museum.\n\nTrotsky was never formally rehabilitated during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the Glasnost-era rehabilitation of most other Old Bolsheviks killed during the Great Purges. His son, Sergei Sedov, killed in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was Nikolai Bukharin. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky's books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.\n\nTrotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the General Prosecutor's Office (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center \"Memorial\").\n\nEsteban Volkov, who lives in Mexico, is an active promoter of his grandfather. Trotsky's great-granddaughter, Mexican-born Nora Volkow (one of Volkov's daughters), is currently head of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. Verónica Volkow, another daughter, is a poet and teacher of history of art in Mexico's National University.\n\nTrotsky considered himself a \"Bolshevik-Leninist\", arguing for the establishment of a vanguard party. He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.\n\nHis politics differed in many respects from those of Stalin or Mao Zedong, most importantly in his rejection of the theory of Socialism in One Country and his declaring the need for an international \"permanent revolution\". Numerous Fourth Internationalist groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist totalitarianism, advocating political revolution, arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.\n\nPermanent Revolution is the theory that the bourgeois democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into proletarian tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in March 1850, in the aftermath of the 1848 Revolution, in their Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League:\n\nTrotsky's conception of Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism Georgy Plekhanov, that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. This conception was first developed by Trotsky in collaboration with Alexander Parvus in late 1904–1905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books \"1905\" and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"Results and Prospects\".\n\nAccording to Trotskyists, the October Revolution was the first example of a successful Permanent Revolution. The proletarian, socialist October Revolution took place precisely because the bourgeoisie, which took power in February, had not been able to solve any of the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. It had not given the land to the peasants (which the Bolsheviks did on 25 October), nor given freedom to the oppressed minority nations, nor emancipated Russia from foreign domination by ending the war which, at that point, was fought mainly to please the British and French creditors. Trotskyists today argue that the state of the Third World shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.\n\nTrotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time he helped to generalise the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards the united front, a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.\n\nAfter he was exiled and politically marginalised by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British Socialist Workers Party in \"International Socialism\", his articles on the united front represent an important part of his political legacy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17881783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17881783", "title": "List of New Testament Latin manuscripts", "text": "List of New Testament Latin manuscripts\n\nLatin manuscripts of the New Testament are handwritten copies of translations from the Greek originals. Translations of the New Testament are called \"versions\". They are important in textual criticism, because sometimes versions provide evidence (called a \"witness\") to an earlier reading of the Greek, i.e. to the text that may have been lost (or preserved only very poorly) in the subsequent Greek tradition. It is also hypothesised that, in some cases, for example, in the case of the Codex Bezae, early Latin manuscripts may have influenced some early Greek manuscripts. Thus, accidentally or deliberately, some Latin readings may have \"crossed back over\" into the Greek. One possible example of this is the well known Comma Johanneum.\n\nLatin manuscripts are divided into \"Old Latin\" and Vulgate. Old Latin manuscripts, also called \"Vetus Latina\" or \"Itala\", are so called not because they are written in Old Latin (i.e. Latin prior to 75 BC), but because they are the oldest versions of the New Testament in Latin. From the linguistic point of view, Old Latin New Testament manuscripts may at times use non-standard grammar and vocabulary.\n\nUnlike the Vulgate, the Vetus Latina tradition reflects numerous distinct, similar, and not entirely independent translations of various New Testament texts, extending back to the time of the original Greek autographs.\n\nIn 382 AD Jerome began a revision of the existing Vetus Latina into contemporary Latin, corrected against manuscripts in the original Greek and Hebrew. Jerome's version is known as the Vulgate.\n\nThe list of Old Latin manuscripts below is based on citations in \"Novum Testamentum Graece\" (NA27) and \"The Greek New Testament\" (UBS4). Each manuscript is identified first by its siglum (the first column, s., in the table), as given by the critical apparatus of the editions mentioned. These sigla are related to content, so are not unique. For example, the letter \"t\" refers to Codex Bernensis in the gospels, but Liber Comicus elsewhere. So sigla need disambiguation. In the table below, this is done by providing a full name. Additionally, the standard unique serial number for each manuscript is provided. Taken together sigla, name and number provide unambiguous identification, and some further information regarding the content, history and relationship of manuscripts.\n\nSigla, names and numbers exist to serve different scholastic purposes. Sigla, in the context of reference to an \"original\" document, provide unique and concise identification of witnesses to the text of that original, suited to minimizing the space taken by citation in a critical apparatus. Names, on the other hand, normally refer to specific handwritten \"volumes\" (often including other text), either as originally bound or in their current form. Names are typically Latin, and can refer to the place of composition (Codex Sangallensis, \"Book from St. Gall\") or rediscovery (Stonyhurst Gospel), the current location (Liber Ardmachanus, \"Book of Armagh\"), a famous owner (Codex Bezae, \"Theodore Beza's Book\"), a volume's function (Liber Comicus, \"The Lectionary\"), or can even refer to physical characteristics of a volume (Codex Gigas, \"The Huge Book\" or Codex Aureus, \"The Gold Book\"). The Book of Mulling is also known as Liber Moliensis after the name of the scribe, as tradition has it.\n\nThe Beuron Ancient Latin Institute (\"Vetus Latina Institut\") has introduced a new numerical system for Old Latin manuscripts, of which there are about 90 altogether. These \"Beuron numbers\" are designed to provide unambiguous identification of witnesses in academic usage, yet they are not used very widely in general literature, as they may cause confusion with the Greek minuscule manuscripts.\n\nBeuron Institute allocated numbers up to 100 to all existing Old Latin manuscripts, depending on what parts of NT they include, and how old their text is. The lowest numbers are allocated to the gospels, and to the most complete manuscripts. For example, Codex Bezae (d) is a witness for the Gospels (Gosp), the Book of Acts and the General epistles (Gen), and is allocated number 5.\n\nNA27 and UBS4 interact with the Vulgate witness only at the level of critical editions, not at the level of manuscripts themselves. The manuscripts that provide evidence of Jerome's version are identified in the apparatus of \"Biblia Sacra Vulgata\" (the Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate).\n\nIn practice, citation of manuscript evidence implies any of several methodologies. The ideal, but most costly, method is physical inspection of the manuscript itself; alternatively, published photographs or facsimile editions may be inspected. This method involves paleographical analysis—interpretation of handwriting, incomplete letters and even reconstruction of lacunae. More typically, editions of manuscripts are consulted, which have done this paleographical work already. The lists below note the names of the editors of standard editions of the manuscripts listed. As a last resort, sometimes a critical edition of NT, that cites readings of a manuscript in its apparatus, may be offered as authority for the text of the manuscript at these points.\n\nIt must also be observed that certain Latin NT manuscripts may present a mixture of Vulgate and Old Latin texts. For example, Codex Sangermanensis (g ) is Old Latin in Matthew, but Vulgate in the rest of the Gospels. Also, the text of John in Codex Veronensis is believed to be part Old Latin and part Vulgate. Hence, some codices are cited as manuscript witnesses \"both\" to the Vetus Latina and to the Vulgate.\n\nThe table below employs the following conventions.\n\n\nFor precision, publication data is given in the language of the title page of the edition. To make this information comprehensible to the English language reader, links are provided to English language article titles, where necessary and possible.\n\nWhen a single editor is responsible for more than one edition, these are listed in alphabetical order of the sigla of the relevant manuscripts. In such cases, if the manuscript is not readily identifiable from the title, its name (siglum and number) are appended after the citation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "197367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197367", "title": "Mantra", "text": "Mantra\n\nA mantra (, English pronunciation ) is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a syllable, word or phonemes, or group of words in Sanskrit believed by practitioners to have psychological and spiritual powers. Mantra meditation helps to induce an altered state of consciousness. A mantra may or may not have a syntactic structure or literal meaning.\n\nThe earliest mantras were composed in Vedic Sanskrit by Hindus in India, and are at least 3000 years old. Mantras now exist in various schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In Japanese Shingon tradition, the word \"Shingon\" means mantra. Similar hymns, chants, compositions, and concepts are found in Zoroastrianism, Taoism, Christianity, and elsewhere.\n\nThe use, structure, function, importance, and types of mantras vary according to the school and philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism. Mantras serve a central role in tantra. In this school, mantras are considered to be a sacred formula and a deeply personal ritual, effective only after initiation. In other schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism, initiation is not a requirement.\n\nMantras come in many forms, including \"ṛc\" (verses from the Rigveda for example) and \"sāman\" (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example). They are typically melodic, mathematically structured meters, believed to be resonant with numinous qualities. At its simplest, the word ॐ (Aum, Om) serves as a mantra. In more sophisticated forms, mantras are melodic phrases with spiritual interpretations such as a human longing for truth, reality, light, immortality, peace, love, knowledge, and action. Some mantras have no literal meaning, yet are musically uplifting and spiritually meaningful.\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"\" (m.; also n. \"mantram\" in Tamil, the Sanskrit word 'Mantra' derived from Tamil word 'Mantram') consists of the root \"man-\" \"to think\" (also in \"manas\" \"mind\") and the suffix \"-tra\", designating tools or instruments, hence a literal translation would be \"instrument of thought\".\n\nScholars consider mantras to be older than 1000 BC. By the middle Vedic period—1000 BC to 500 BC—claims Frits Staal, mantras in Hinduism had developed into a blend of art and science.\n\nThe Chinese translation is , the Japanese on'yomi reading of the Chinese being \"shingon\" (which is also used as the proper name for the prominent esoteric Shingon sect).\n\nAccording to Bernfried Schlerath, the concept of \"sātyas mantras\" is found in Indo-Iranian Yasna 31.6 and the Rigveda, where it is considered structured thought in conformity with the reality or poetic (religious) formulas associated with inherent fulfillment.\n\nMantras are neither unique to Hinduism nor other Indian religions such as Buddhism; similar creative constructs developed in Asian and Western traditions as well. Mantras, suggests Frits Staal, may be older than language.\n\nThere is no generally accepted definition of mantra.\n\nRenou has defined mantra as a thought. Mantras are structured formulae of thoughts, claims Silburn. Farquhar concludes that mantras are a religious thought, prayer, sacred utterance, but also believed to be a spell or weapon of supernatural power. Zimmer defines mantra as a verbal instrument to produce something in one’s mind. Bharati defines mantra, in the context of the Tantric school of Hinduism, to be a combination of mixed genuine and quasi-morphemes arranged in conventional patterns, based on codified esoteric traditions, passed on from a guru to a disciple through prescribed initiation.\n\nJan Gonda, a widely cited scholar on Indian mantras, defines mantra as general name for the verses, formulas or sequence of words in prose which contain praise, are believed to have religious, magical or spiritual efficiency, which are meditated upon, recited, muttered or sung in a ritual, and which are collected in the methodically arranged ancient texts of Hinduism. There is no universally applicable uniform definition of mantra because mantras are used in different religions, and within each religion in different schools of philosophy. In some schools of Hinduism for example, suggests Gonda, a mantra is sakti (power) to the devotee in the form of formulated and expressed thought. Staal clarifies that mantras are not rituals, they are what is recited or chanted during a ritual.\n\nIn Oxford Living Dictionary mantra is defined as a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation. Cambridge Dictionary provides two different definitions. The first refers to Hinduism and Buddhism: a word or sound that is believed to have a special spiritual power. The second definition is more general: a word or phrase that is often repeated and expresses a particularly strong belief. For instance, a football team can choose individual words as their own \"mantra.\"\n\nThere is a long history of scholarly disagreement on the meaning of mantras and whether they are instruments of mind, as implied by the etymological origin of the word \"mantra\". One school suggests mantras are mostly meaningless sound constructs, while the other holds them to be mostly meaningful linguistic instruments of mind. Both schools agree that mantras have melody and a well designed mathematical precision in their construction and that their influence on the reciter and listener is similar to that is observed in people around the world listening to their beloved music that is devoid of words.\n\nStaal presents a non-linguistic view of mantras. He suggests that verse mantras are metered and harmonized to mathematical precision (for example, in the \"viharanam\" technique), which resonate, but a lot of them are a hodgepodge of meaningless constructs such as are found in folk music around the world. Staal cautions that there are many mantras that can be translated and do have spiritual meaning and philosophical themes central to Hinduism, but that does not mean all mantras have a literal meaning. He further notes that even when mantras do not have a literal meaning, they do set a tone and ambiance in the ritual as they are recited, and thus have a straightforward and uncontroversial ritualistic meaning. The sounds may lack literal meaning, but they can have an effect. He compares mantras to bird songs, that have the power to communicate, yet do not have a literal meaning. On that \"saman\" category of Hindu mantras, which Staal described as resembling the arias of Bach's oratorios and other European classics, he notes that these mantras have musical structure, but they almost always are completely different from anything in the syntax of natural languages. Mantras are literally meaningless, yet musically meaningful to Staal. The \"saman\" chant mantras were transmitted, from one Hindu generation to next, verbally for over 1000 years, but never written, and a feat suggests Staal that was made possible by the strict mathematical principles used in constructing the mantras. These \"saman\" chant mantras are also mostly meaningless, cannot be literally translated as Sanskrit or any Indian language, but nevertheless are beautiful in their resonant themes, variations, inversions, and distribution. They draw the devotee in. Staal is not the first person to view Hindu mantras in this manner. The ancient Hindu Vedic ritualist Kautsa was one of the earliest scholars to note that mantras are meaningless; their function is phonetic and syntactic, not semantic.\n\nHarvey Alper and others present mantras from the linguistic point view. They admit Staal's observation that many mantras do contain bits and pieces of meaningless jargon, but they question what language or text doesn't. The presence of an abracadabra bit does not necessarily imply the entire work is meaningless. Alper lists numerous mantras that have philosophical themes, moral principles, a call to virtuous life, and even mundane petitions. He suggests that from a set of millions of mantras, the devotee chooses some mantras voluntarily, thus expressing that speaker's intention, and the audience for that mantra is that speaker's chosen spiritual entity. Mantras deploy the language of spiritual expression, they are religious instruments, and that is what matters to the devotee. A mantra creates a feeling in the practicing person. It has an emotive numinous effect, it mesmerizes, it defies expression, and it creates sensations that are by definition private and at the heart of all religions and spiritual phenomena.\n\nDuring the early Vedic period, claims Staal, Vedic poets became fascinated by the inspirational power of poems, metered verses, and music. They referred to them with the root \"dhi-\", which evolved into \"dhyana\" (meditation) of Hinduism, and the language used to start and assist this process manifested as a mantra. By the middle vedic period (1000 BC to 500 BC), mantras were derived from all vedic compositions. They included \"ṛc\" (verses from Rigveda for example), \"sāman\" (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example), \"yajus\" (a muttered formula from the yajurveda for example), and \"nigada\" (a loudly spoken yajus). During the Hindu Epics period and after, mantras multiplied in many ways and diversified to meet the needs and passions of various schools of Hinduism. Mantras took a center stage in the Tantric school, which posited that each mantra (\"bijas\") is a deity; it is this distinct school of Hinduism and 'each mantra is a deity' reasoning that led to the perception that some Hindus have tens of millions of gods. Mantra came to mean in some Hindu schools as ‘that which protects our mind’ or “Manah traayate iti Mantraaha’.\n\nOne function of mantras is to solemnize and ratify rituals. Each mantra, in Vedic rituals, is coupled with an act. According to \"Apastamba Srauta Sutra\", each ritual act is accompanied by one mantra, unless the \"Sutra\" explicitly marks that one act corresponds to several mantras. According to Gonda, and others, there is a connection and rationale between a Vedic mantra and each Vedic ritual act that accompanies it. In these cases, the function of mantras was to be an instrument of ritual efficacy for the priest, and a tool of instruction for a ritual act for others.\n\nOver time, as the Puranas and Epics were composed, the concepts of worship, virtues and spirituality evolved in Hinduism. Religions such as Jainism and Buddhism branched off, and new schools were founded, each continuing to develop and refine its own mantras. In Hinduism, suggests Alper, the function of mantras shifted from the quotidian to redemptive. In other words, in Vedic times, mantras were recited a practical, quotidian goal as intention, such as requesting a deity's help in the discovery of lost cattle, cure of illness, succeeding in competitive sport or journey away from home. The literal translation of Vedic mantras suggests that the function of mantra, in these cases, was to cope with the uncertainties and dilemmas of daily life. In a later period of Hinduism, mantras were recited with a transcendental redemptive goal as intention, such as escape from the cycle of life and rebirth, forgiveness for bad karma, and experiencing a spiritual connection with the god. The function of mantras, in these cases, was to cope with the human condition as a whole. According to Alper, redemptive spiritual mantras opened the door for mantras where every part need not have a literal meaning, but together their resonance and musical quality assisted the transcendental spiritual process. Overall, explains Alper, using Śivasūtra mantras as an example, Hindu mantras have philosophical themes and are metaphorical with social dimension and meaning; in other words, they are a spiritual language and instrument of thought.\n\nAccording to Staal, Hindu mantras may be spoken aloud, \"anirukta\" (not enunciated), \"upamsu\" (inaudible), or \"manasa\" (not spoken, but recited in the mind). In ritual use, mantras are often silent instruments of meditation.\n\nThe most basic mantra is \"Om\", which in Hinduism is known as the \"pranava mantra,\" the source of all mantras. The Hindu philosophy behind this is the premise that before existence and beyond existence is only One reality, Brahma, and the first manifestation of Brahma expressed as Om. For this reason, Om is considered as a foundational idea and reminder, and thus is prefixed and suffixed to all Hindu prayers. While some mantras may invoke individual gods or principles, fundamental mantras, like the 'Shanti Mantra, the 'Gayatri Mantra' and others all ultimately focus on the One reality.\n\nTantric school\n\nIn the Tantric school the universe is sound. The supreme (para) brings forth existence through the Word (Shabda). Creation consists of vibrations at various frequencies and amplitudes giving rise to the phenomena of the world.\n\nBuhnemann notes that deity mantras are an essential part of Tantric compendia. The tantric mantras vary in their structure and length. Mala mantras are those mantras which have an enormous number of syllables. In contrast, bija mantras are one-syllabled, typically ending in anusvara (a simple nasal sound). These are derived from the name of a deity; for example, Durga yields \"dum\" and Ganesha yields \"gam\". Bija mantras are prefixed and appended to other mantras, thereby creating complex mantras. In the tantric school, these mantras are believed to have supernatural powers, and they are transmitted by a preceptor to a disciple in an initiation ritual. Tantric mantras found a significant audience and adaptations in medieval India, Hindu Southeast Asia and numerous Asian countries with Buddhism.\n\nMajumdar and other scholars suggest mantras are central to the Tantric school, with numerous functions. From initiating and emancipating a tantric devotee to worshiping manifested forms of the divine. From enabling heightened sexual energy in the male and the female to acquiring supernormal psychological and spiritual power. From preventing evil influences to exorcizing demons, and many others. These claimed functions and other aspects of the tantric mantra are a subject of controversy among scholars. \n\nTantra usage is not unique to Hinduism: it is also found in Buddhism both inside and outside India.\n\nMantra japa\n\nMantra \"japa\" is a practice of repetitively uttering the same mantra for an auspicious number of times, the most popular being 108, and sometimes just 5, 10, 28 or 1008. \"Japa\" is found in personal prayer or meditative efforts of some Hindus, as well during formal puja (group prayers). Japa is assisted by malas (bead necklaces) containing 108 beads and a head bead (sometimes referred to as the 'meru', or 'guru' bead); the devotee using his/her fingers to count each bead as he/she repeats the chosen mantra. Having reached 108 repetitions, if he/she wishes to continue another cycle of mantras, the devotee turns the mala around without crossing the head bead and repeats the cycle. Japa-yajna is claimed to be most effective if the mantra is repeated silently in mind (manasah).\n\nAccording to this school, any shloka from holy Hindu texts like the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Yoga Sutra, even the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Durga saptashati or Chandi is a mantra, thus can be part of the \"japa\", repeated to achieve a numinous effect. The \"Dharmasāstra\" claims Gāyatri mantra derived from Rig Veda verse 3.62.10, and the Purușasūkta mantra from Rig Veda verse 10.90 are most auspicious mantras for \"japa\" at sunrise and sunset; it is claimed to purify the mind and spirit.\n\nNotable Hindu mantras\n\nThere are numerous other important mantras.\n\nShiva sutra mantras\n\nApart from Shiva Sutras, which originated from Shiva's tandava dance, the Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta are a collection of seventy-seven aphorisms that form the foundation of the tradition of spiritual mysticism known as Kashmir Shaivism. They are attributed to the sage Vasugupta of the 9th century C.E. \"Sambhavopaya\" (1-1 to 1–22), \"Saktopaya\" (2-1 to 2–10) and \"Anavopaya\" (3-1 to 3–45) are the main sub-divisions, three means of achieving God consciousness, of which the main technique of \"Saktopaya\" is a mantra. But \"mantra\" in this context does not mean incantation or muttering of some sacred formula. The word \"mantra\" is used here in its etymological signification. That which saves one by pondering over the light of Supreme I-consciousness is a mantra. The divine Supreme I-consciousness is the dynamo of all the mantras. \"Deha\" or body has been compared to wood, \"mantra\" has been compared to \"arani\"—a piece of wood used for kindling fire by friction; \"prana\" has been compared to fire. \"Sikha\" or flame has been compared to \"atma\" (Self); \"ambara\" or sky has been compared to Shiva. When prana is kindled by means of mantra used as arani, fire in the form of \"udana\" arises in \"susumna\", and then just as flame arises out of kindled fire and gets dissolved in the sky, so also \"atma\" (Self) like a flame having burnt down the fuel of the body, gets absorbed in Shiva.\n\nTranscendental Meditation\nThe Transcendental Meditation technique, also known as 'TM', uses mantras that are assigned to the practitioner to be used as thought sound only, not chanted, without connection to any meaning or idea.\n\nThe spiritual exercises of Surat Shabda Yoga include simran (repetition, particularly silent repetition of a mantra given at initiation), dhyan (concentration, viewing, or contemplation, particularly on the Inner Master), and bhajan (listening to the inner sounds of the Shabda or the Shabda Master).\n\nRepetition of a \"mantram\" (i.e., mantra) or holy name is Point 2 in the eight-point Passage Meditation program taught by Eknath Easwaran, who recommended using a mantram drawn from a faith tradition, east or west. The mantram is to be used frequently throughout the day, at opportune moments. This method of mantram repetition, and the larger program, was developed for use in any major faith tradition, or outside all traditions. Easwaran's method of mantram repetition has been the subject of scientific research at the San Diego Veterans Administration, which has suggested health benefits that include managing stress and reducing symptoms of PTSD.\n\nThe concept of mantras in Jainism is not focused on material aspects, rather mainly deals with seeking forgiveness, praising Arihants, or deities like Nakoda, Padmavati, Manibhadra, Saraswati, Lakshmi, and others. Yet some mantras are claimed to enhance intellect, prosperity, wealth or fame. There are many mantras in Jainism; most of them are in Sanskrit or Prakrit, but in the last few centuries, some have been composed in Hindi or Gujrati languages. Mantras, couplets, are either chanted or sung, either aloud or by merely moving lips or in silence by thought.\n\nSome examples of Jain mantras are Bhaktamara Stotra, Uvasagharam Stotra, etc. But the greatest is said to be the Namokar or Navkar Mantra.\n\nThe Navkar Mantra (literally, \"Nine Line Mantra\") is a central mantra in Jainism.\nThe initial 5 lines consist of salutations to various sanctified souls, and the latter 4 lines are explanatory in nature, highlighting the benefits and greatness of this mantra.\n\n\"Pratikraman\" also contains the following prayer:\n\nIn Jainism, forgiveness is one of the main virtues to be cultivated. \"Kṣamāpanā\" or supreme forgiveness forms part of one of the ten characteristics of \"dharma\". <br>In the \"pratikramana\" prayer, Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from \"ekindriyas\" or single sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities. Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, \"Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ.\" \"Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ\" is a Prakrit phrase literally meaning \"may all the evil that has been done be fruitless.\"\n\nIn their daily prayers and samayika, Jains recite the following \"Iryavahi sutra\" in Prakrit, seeking forgiveness from literally all creatures while involved in routine activities:\n\nMay you, O Revered One, voluntarily permit me. I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on a living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed, which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with earth, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.\n\nAccording to Jack Kornfield, \n\n\"The use of mantra or the repetition of certain phrases in Pali is a highly common form of meditation in the Theravada tradition. Simple mantras use repetition of the Buddha’s name, “Buddho,” [as “Buddho” is actually a title rather than a name] or use the “Dhamma,” or the “Sangha,” the community, as mantra words. Other used mantras are directed toward developing loving kindness. Some mantras direct attention to the process of change by repeating the Pali phrase that means “everything changes,” while other mantras are used to develop equanimity with phrases that would be translated, “let go.”\n\nVery often mantra practice is combined with breathing meditation so that one recites a mantra simultaneously with in-breath and out-breath to help develop tranquility and concentration. Mantra meditation is especially popular among the lay people. Like other basic concentration exercises, it can be used simply to the mind, or it can be the basis for an insight practice where the mantra becomes the focus of observation of how life unfolds, or an aid in surrendering and letting go.\" \nThe \"Buddho\" mantra is widespread in the Thai Forest Tradition and was taught by Ajahn Chah and his students. Another popular mantra in Thai Buddhism is \"Samma-Araham\", referring to the Buddha who has 'perfectly' (\"samma\") attained 'perfection in the Buddhist sense' (\"araham\"), used in Dhammakaya meditation.\n\nIn the Tantric Theravada tradition of Southeast Asia, mantras are central to their method of meditation. Popular mantras in this tradition include \"Namo Buddhaya\" (\"Homage to the Buddha\") and \"Araham\" (\"Worthy One\").\n\nIn Buddhism in China and Vietnam, ten small mantras were finalized by the monk Yulin (玉琳國師), a teacher of the Shunzhi Emperor for monks, nuns, and laity to chant in the morning.\n\nAlong with the ten mantras, the Great Compassion Mantra, the Shurangama Mantra of the Shurangama, Heart Sutra and various forms of nianfo are also chanted. The Shurangama Mantra may be the longest mantra. There are Thai Buddhist amulet katha: that is, mantras to be recited while holding an amulet.\n\nKūkai (774–835), a noted Buddhist monk, advanced a general theory of language based on his analysis of two forms of Buddhist ritual language: \"dharani\" (dhāra.nī) and \"mantra\". Mantra is restricted to esoteric Buddhist practice whereas dharani is found in both esoteric and exoteric ritual. Dharanis for instance are found in the Heart Sutra. The term \"shingon\" (lit. \"true word\") is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese term for a mantra, \"zhēnyán\".\n\nThe word \"dharani\" derives from a Sanskrit root \"dh.r\" which means to hold or maintain. Ryuichi Abe suggests that it is generally understood as a mnemonic device which encapsulates the meaning of a section or chapter of a sutra. Dharanis are also considered to protect the one who chants them from malign influences and calamities.\n\nThe term \"mantra\" is traditionally said to be derived from two roots: \"man\", to think; and the action-oriented suffix \"-tra\". Thus a mantra can be considered to be a linguistic device for deepening one's thought or in the Buddhist context for developing the enlightened mind. They have also been used as magic spells for purposes such as attaining wealth and long life and eliminating enemies. In daily living, many thought the pronunciation of the mantra was not important to take its effect and the expected effect, may not happen because of fixed karma (定業), or because there appears a better way to solve the situation.\n\nThe distinction between dharani and mantra is hard to make. We can say that all mantras are dharanis but that not all dharanis are mantras. Mantras do tend to be shorter. Both tend to contain some unintelligible phonic fragments such as Om, or Hu.m, which is perhaps why some people consider them to be essentially meaningless. Kūkai made mantra a special class of dharani which showed that every syllable of a dharani was a manifestation of the true nature of reality – in Buddhist terms that all sound is a manifestation of shunyata or emptiness of self-nature. Thus rather than being devoid of meaning, Kūkai suggests that dharanis are in fact saturated with meaning – every syllable is symbolic on multiple levels.\n\nOne of Kūkai's distinctive contributions was to take this symbolic association even further by saying that there is no essential difference between the syllables of mantras and sacred texts, and those of ordinary language. If one understood the workings of mantra, then any sounds could be a representative of ultimate reality. This emphasis on sounds was one of the drivers for Kūkai's championing of the phonetic writing system, the kana, which was adopted in Japan around the time of Kūkai. He is generally credited with the invention of the kana, but there is apparently some doubt about this story amongst scholars.\n\nThis mantra-based theory of language had a powerful effect on Japanese thought and society which up until Kūkai's time had been dominated by imported Chinese culture of thought, particularly in the form of the Classical Chinese language which was used in the court and amongst the literati, and Confucianism which was the dominant political ideology. In particular, Kūkai was able to use this new theory of language to create links between indigenous Japanese culture and Buddhism. For instance, he made a link between the Buddha Mahavairocana and the Shinto sun Goddess Amaterasu. Since the emperors were thought to be descended form Amaterasu, Kūkai had found a powerful connection here that linked the emperors with the Buddha, and also in finding a way to integrate Shinto with Buddhism, something that had not happened with Confucianism. Buddhism then became essentially an indigenous religion in a way that Confucianism had not. And it was through language and mantra that this connection was made. Kūkai helped to elucidate what mantra is in a way that had not been done before: he addresses the fundamental questions of what a text is, how signs function, and above all, what language is. In this, he covers some of the same ground as modern day Structuralists and others scholars of language, although he comes to very different conclusions.\n\nIn this system of thought, all sounds are said to originate from \"a\" – which is the short \"a\" sound in father. For esoteric Buddhism \"a\" has a special function because it is associated with Shunyata or the idea that no thing exists in its own right, but is contingent upon causes and conditions. (See Dependent origination) In Sanskrit \"a\" is a prefix which changes the meaning of a word into its opposite, so \"vidya\" is understanding, and \"avidya\" is ignorance (the same arrangement is also found in many Greek words, like e.g. \"atheism\" vs. \"theism\" and \"apathy\" vs. \"pathos\"). The letter a is both visualised in the Siddham script and pronounced in rituals and meditation practices. In the Mahavairocana Sutra which is central to Shingon Buddhism it says: Thanks to the original vows of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, a miraculous force resides in the mantras, so that by pronouncing them one acquires merit without limits\". [in Conze, p. 183]\n\nA mantra is Kuji-kiri in Shugendo. The word Shingon means mantra. According to Alex Wayman and Ryujun Tajima, Shingon means \"true speech\", has the sense of \"an exact mantra which reveals the truth of the dharmas\", and is the path of mantras. The practice of writing mantras, and copying texts as a spiritual practice, became very refined in Japan, and some of these are written in the Japanese script and Siddham script of Sanskrit, recited in either language. There are thirteen mantras used in Shingon-Buddhism, each dedicated to a major deity. The mantra for each deity name in Japanese, its equivalent name in Sanskrit, a transliteration of mantra, and the Japanese version in Shingon tradition are as follows:\n\nMantrayana (Sanskrit), which may be translated as \"way of the mantra\", was the original self-identifying name of those that have come to be determined 'Nyingmapa'. The Nyingmapa which may be rendered as \"those of the ancient way\", a name constructed due to the genesis of the Sarma \"fresh\", \"new\" traditions. Mantrayana has developed into a synonym of Vajrayana.\n\nNoted translator of Buddhist texts Edward Conze (1904–1979) distinguishes three periods in the Buddhist use of mantra.\n\nInitially, according to Conze, like their fellow Indians, Buddhists used mantra as protective spells to ward off malign influences. Despite a Vinaya rule which forbids monks engaging in the Brahminical practice of chanting mantras for material gain, there is a number of protective mantras for a group of ascetic monks. However, even at this early stage, there is perhaps something more than animistic magic at work. Particularly in the case of the Ratana Sutta the efficacy of the verses seems to be related to the concept of \"truth\". Each verse of the sutta ends with \"by the virtue of this truth may there be happiness\".\n\nConze notes that later mantras were used more to guard the spiritual life of the chanter, and sections on mantras began to be included in some Mahayana sutras such as the White Lotus Sutra, and the Lankavatara Sutra. The scope of protection also changed in this time. In the Sutra of Golden Light the Four Great Kings promise to exercise sovereignty over the different classes of demigods, to protect the whole of Jambudvipa (the Indian subcontinent), to protect monks who proclaim the sutra, and to protect kings who patronise the monks who proclaim the sutra. The apotheosis of this type of approach is the Nichiren school of Buddhism that was founded in the 13th century Japan, and which distilled many previously complex Buddhist practices down to the veneration of the Lotus Sutra through a recitation of the daimoku: \"Nam myoho renge kyo\" which translates as \"Homage to the Lotus Sutra\".\n\nThe third period began, according to Conze, in about the 7th century, to take center stage and become a vehicle for salvation in their own right. Tantra started to gain momentum in the 6th and 7th century, with specifically Buddhist forms appearing as early as 300CE. \"Mantrayana\" was an early name for what is now more commonly known as \"Vajrayana\", which gives us a hint as to the place of mantra in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. The aim of Vajrayana practice is to give the practitioner a direct experience of reality, of things as they really are. Mantras function as symbols of that reality, and different mantras are different aspects of that reality – for example wisdom or compassion. Mantras are often associated with a particular deity, one famous exception being the Prajnaparamita mantra associated with the Heart Sutra. One of the key Vajrayana strategies for bringing about a direct experience of reality is to engage the entire psycho-physical organism in the practices. In one Buddhist analysis, the person consists of 'body, speech and mind' (refer: Three Vajra). So a typical sadhana or meditation practice might include mudras, or symbolic hand gestures; the recitations of mantras; as well as the visualisation of celestial beings and visualising the letters of the mantra which is being recited. Clearly here mantra is associated with speech. The meditator may visualise the letters in front of themselves, or within their body. They may be pronounced out loud, or internally in mind only.\n\nProbably the most famous mantra of Buddhism is Om mani padme hum, the six syllable mantra of the Bodhisattva of compassion Avalokiteśvara (Tibetan: \"Chenrezig\", Chinese: \"Guanyin\"). This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. The Dalai Lama is said to be an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, and so the mantra is especially revered by his devotees.\n\nThe book \"Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism\" by Lama Anagarika Govinda, gives a classic example of how such a mantra can contain many levels of symbolic meaning.\n\nDonald Lopez gives a good discussion of this mantra and its various interpretations in his book \"Prisoners of Shangri-LA: Tibetan Buddhism and the West\". Lopez is an authoritative writer and challenges the stereotypical analysis of the mantra as meaning \"The Jewel in the Lotus\", an interpretation that is not supported by either a linguistic analysis, nor by Tibetan tradition, and is symptomatic of the Western Orientalist approach to the 'exotic' East. He suggests that Manipadma is actually the name of a bodhisattva, a form of Avalokiteshvara who has many other names in any case including Padmapani or \"lotus flower in hand\". The Brahminical insistence on the absolutely correct pronunciation of Sanskrit broke down as Buddhism was exported to other countries where the inhabitants found it impossible to reproduce the sounds. So in Tibet, for instance, where this mantra is on the lips of many Tibetans all their waking hours, the mantra is pronounced \"Om mani pema hung\".\n\nThe following list of mantras is from \"\", Volume 1, Number 2, 1973. (pp. 168–169) (augmented by other contributors). It also includes renderings of \"Om mani padme hum\". The mantras used in Tibetan Buddhist practice are in Sanskrit, to preserve the original mantras. Visualizations and other practices are usually done in the Tibetan language.\n\n\n\nAccording to Tibetan Buddhism, this mantra (Om tare tutare ture soha) can not only eliminate disease, troubles, disasters, and karma, but will also bring believers blessings, longer life, and even the wisdom to transcend one's circle of reincarnation.\nTara representing long life and health.\nThere are mantras in Bön and some Chinese sects.\n\n\nThe mantra in Chinese Buddhist canon are collected by Qianlong Emperor into a book. Kuang-Ming Lin (林光明) amended it.\n\nBahá’ís recite the mantra \"Alláh-u-Abha\" 95 times a day. Many use beads.\n\nIn the Sikh religion, a \"mantar\" or \"mantra\" is a Shabad (Word or hymn) from the Adi Granth to concentrate the mind on God. Through repetition of the mantra, and listening to one's own voice, thoughts are reduced and the mind rises above materialism to tune into the voice of God. \n\nMantras in Sikhism are fundamentally different from the secret mantras used in other religions. Unlike in other religions, Sikh mantras are open for anyone to use. They are used openly and are not taught in secret sessions but are used in front of assemblies of Sikhs.\n\nThe Mool Mantar, the first composition of Guru Nanak, is the second most widely known Sikh mantra.\n\nThe most widely known mantra in the Sikh faith is \"Wahe Guru.\" According to the Sikh poet Bhai Gurdas, the word \"Wahe Guru\" is the Gurmantra, or the mantra given by the Guru, and eliminates ego. \n\nAccording to the 10th Sikh Master, Guru Gobind Singh, the \"Wahe Guru\" mantra was given by God to the Order of the Khalsa, and reforms the apostate into the purified.\n\nThere are mantras in Taoism, such as the words in Dafan yinyu wuliang yin (大梵隱語無量音) and the Tibetan Buddhism mantra \"om\" (唵). There are mantras in Cheondoism, Daesun Jinrihoe, Jeung San Do and Onmyōdō.\n\n"}

His mother, Marie Müser, was a German nurse who left Germany just before the beginning of World War I. His father, Augusto Bunge, also of some German descent, was an Argentinian physician and socialist legislator. Mario, who was the couple's only child, was raised without any religious education, and enjoyed a happy and stimulating childhood in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.\n\nBunge has four children: Carlos F. and Mario A. J. (with ex-wife Julia), and Eric R. and Silvia A., with his present wife, the Argentinian mathematician Marta Cavallo.\nMario and Marta live in Montreal.\n\nBunge began his studies at the National University of La Plata, graduating with a Ph.D. in physico-mathematical sciences in 1952. He was professor of theoretical physics and philosophy, 1956–1966, first at La Plata then at University of Buenos Aires. He was, until his recent retirement at age 90, the Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at McGill University in Montreal, where he had been since 1966.\n\nBunge's students include Roger Angel, David Blitz, Mike Dillinger, Andrés Kálnay, Jean-Pierre Marquis, Dan A. Seni, Héctor Vucetich, and Miguel A. Quintanilla.\n\nBunge is a prolific intellectual, having written more than 400 papers and 80 books, notably his monumental \"Treatise on Basic Philosophy\" in 8 volumes (1974–1989), a comprehensive and rigorous study of those philosophical aspects Bunge takes to be the core of modern philosophy: semantics, ontology, epistemology, philosophy of science and ethics. Here, Bunge develops a comprehensive scientific outlook which he then applies to the various natural and social sciences.\n\nHis thinking embodies global systemism, emergentism, rationalism, scientific realism, materialism and consequentialism. Bunge has repeatedly and explicitly denied being a logical positivist, and has written on metaphysics. In the political arena, Bunge has defined himself as a \"left-wing liberal\" and democratic socialist, in the tradition of John Stuart Mill and José Ingenieros. He is also a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.\n\nPopularly, he is known for his remarks considering psychoanalysis as an example of pseudoscience. He has also freely criticized the ideas of well known scientists and philosophers such as Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, and Daniel Dennett.\n\nIn his review of \"Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist\", James Alcock sees in Bunge \"a man of exceedingly high confidence who has lived his life guided by strong principles about truth, science, and justice\" and one who is \"[impatient] with muddy thinking\".\n\nMario Bunge has been distinguished with twenty one honorary doctorates and four honorary professorships by universities from both the Americas and Europe. Bunge is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1984–) and of the Royal Society of Canada (1992–). In 1982 he was awarded the \"Premio Príncipe de Asturias\" (Prince of Asturias Award), in 2009 the Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 2014 the Ludwig von Bertalanffy Award in Complexity Thinking.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11442890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11442890", "title": "Mythopoeic thought", "text": "Mythopoeic thought\n\nMythopoeic thought is a hypothetical stage of human thought preceding modern thought, proposed by Henri Frankfort and his wife Henriette Antonia Frankfort in the 1940s. According to this proposal, there was a \"mythopoeic\" stage, in which humanity did not think in terms of generalizations and impersonal laws: instead, humans saw each event as an act of will on the part of some personal being. This way of thinking supposedly explains the ancients' tendency to create myths, which portray events as acts of gods and spirits. A physiological motivation for this was suggested by Julian Jaynes in 1976 in the form of bicameralism.\n\nThe term \"mythopoeic\" means \"myth-making\" (from Greek \"muthos,\" \"myth\", and \"poiein,\" \"to make\"). A group of Near Eastern specialists used the term in their 1946 book \"The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East,\" later republished as the 1949 paperback \"Before Philosophy: The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man.\" In this book's introduction, two of the specialists, Henri and Mrs. H.A. Frankfort, argue that mythopoeic thought characterizes a distinct stage of human thought that differs fundamentally from modern, scientific thought. Mythopoeic thought, the Frankforts claim, was concrete and personifying, whereas modern thought is abstract and impersonal: more basically, mythopoeic thought is \"pre-philosophical\", while modern thought is \"philosophical\". Because of this basic contrast between mythopoeic and modern thought, the Frankforts often use the term \"mythopoeic thought\" as a synonym for ancient thought in general.\n\nAccording to the Frankforts, \"the fundamental difference between the attitudes of modern and ancient man as regards the surrounding world is this: for modern, scientific man the phenomenal world is primarily an 'It'; for ancient—and also for primitive—man it is a 'Thou'\". In other words, modern man sees most things as impersonal objects, whereas ancient man sees most things as persons.\n\nAccording to the Frankforts, ancients viewed the world this way because they didn't think in terms of universal laws. Modern thought \"reduces the chaos of perceptions to an order in which typical events take place according to universal laws.\" For example, consider a river that usually rises in the spring. Suppose that, one spring, the river fails to rise. In that case, modern thought doesn't conclude that the laws of nature have changed; instead, it searches for a set of fixed, universal laws that can explain why the river has risen in other cases but not in this case. Modern thought is abstract: it looks for unifying principles behind diversity.\n\nIn contrast, the Frankforts argue, \"the primitive mind cannot withdraw to that extent from perceptual reality\". Mythopoeic thought doesn't look for unifying principles behind the diversity of individual events. It is concrete, not abstract: it takes each individual event at face value. When a river rises one year and fails to rise another year, mythopoeic thought doesn't try to unite those two different events under a common law. Instead, \"when the river does not rise, it has \"refused\" to rise\". And if no law governs the river's behavior, if the river has simply \"refused\" to rise, then its failure to rise must be a \"choice\": \"The river, or the gods, must be angry\", and must be \"choosing\" to withhold the annual flooding. Thus, mythopoeic thought ends up viewing the entire world as personal: each event is an act of will.\n\nThe Frankforts argue that mythopoeic thought explains the tolerance of seeming contradictions in mythology. According to the Frankforts' theory, the ancients didn't try to unite different experiences under a universal law; instead, they took each individual experience at face value. Therefore, they sometimes took one experience and developed a myth from it, and took a different experience and developed a different myth from it, without worrying whether those two myths contradicted each other: \"The ancients ... are likely to present various descriptions of natural phenomena side by side even though they are mutually exclusive.\" For example, the ancient Egyptians had three different creation myths.\n\nAccording to the Frankforts, \"ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians\"—the Frankforts' area of expertise—\"lived in a wholly mythopoeic world\". Each natural force, each concept, was a personal being from their viewpoint: \"In Egypt and Mesopotamia the divine was comprehended as immanent: the gods were in nature.\" This immanence and multiplicity of the divine is a direct result of mythopoeic thought: hence, the first step in the loss of mythopoeic thought was the loss of this view of the divine. The ancient Hebrews took this first step through their doctrine of a single, transcendent God: \n\"When we read in Psalm 19 that 'the heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork,' we hear a voice which mocks the beliefs of the Egyptians and Babylonians. The heavens, which were to the psalmist but a witness of God's greatness, were to the Mesopotamians the very majesty of godhead, the highest ruler, Anu. [...] The God of the psalmists and the prophets was not in nature. He transcended nature — and transcended, likewise, the realm of mythopoeic thought.\"\n\nThe ancient Hebrews still saw each major event as a divine act. However, they saw the divine as a single being—not a myriad of spirits, one for each natural phenomenon. Moreover, they didn't see the divine as a will within nature: for them, the divine will was a force or law \"behind\" all natural events.\n\nSome Greek philosophers went further. Instead of seeing each event as an act of will, they developed a notion of impersonal, universal law: they finally abandoned mythopoeic thought, postulating impersonal laws behind all natural phenomena. These philosophers may not have been scientific by today's rigid standards: their hypotheses were often based on assumptions, not empirical data. However, by the mere fact that they looked behind the apparent diversity and individuality of events in search of underlying laws, and defied \"the prescriptive sanctities of religion\", the Greeks broke away from mythopoeic thought.\n\nReligious scholar Robert Segal has pointed out that the dichotomy between a personal and an impersonal view of the world is not absolute, as the Frankforts' distinction between ancient and modern thought might suggest: \"Any phenomenon can surely be experienced as both an It and a Thou: consider, for example, a pet and a patient.\" Furthermore, Segal argues, it is \"embarrassingly simplistic\" to call the ancient Near East \"wholly mythopoeic\", the Hebrews \"largely nonmythopoeic\", and the Greeks \"wholly scientific\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1367932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1367932", "title": "Naturalized epistemology", "text": "Naturalized epistemology\n\nNaturalized epistemology, coined by W. V. O. Quine, is a collection of philosophic views concerned with the theory of knowledge that emphasize the role of natural scientific methods. This shared emphasis on scientific methods of studying knowledge shifts focus to the empirical processes of knowledge acquisition and away from many traditional philosophical questions. There are noteworthy distinctions within naturalized epistemology. Replacement naturalism maintains that traditional epistemology should be abandoned and replaced with the methodologies of the natural sciences. The general thesis of cooperative naturalism is that traditional epistemology can benefit in its inquiry by using the knowledge we have gained from the cognitive sciences. Substantive naturalism focuses on an asserted equality of facts of knowledge and natural facts. \nObjections to naturalized epistemology have targeted features of the general project as well as characteristics of specific versions. Some objectors suggest that natural scientific knowledge cannot be circularly grounded by the knowledge obtained through cognitive science, which is itself a natural science. This objection from circularity has been aimed specifically at strict replacement naturalism. There are similar challenges to substance naturalism that maintain that the substance naturalists' thesis that all facts of knowledge are natural facts is not only circular but fails to accommodate certain facts. Several other objectors have found fault in the inability of naturalized methods to adequately address questions about what value forms of potential knowledge have or lack. Naturalized epistemology is generally opposed to the antipsychologism of Immanuel Kant, Gottlob Frege, Karl Popper, Edmund Husserl and others.\n\nW. V. O. Quine's version of naturalized epistemology considers reasons for serious doubt about the fruitfulness of traditional philosophic study of scientific knowledge. These concerns are raised in light of the long attested incapacity of philosophers to find a satisfactory answer to the problems of radical scepticism, more particularly, to David Hume's criticism of induction. But also, because of the contemporaneous attempts and failures to reduce mathematics to pure logic by those in or philosophically sympathetic to The Vienna Circle. He concludes that studies of scientific knowledge concerned with meaning or truth fail to achieve the Cartesian goal of certainty. The failures in the reduction of mathematics to pure logic imply that scientific knowledge can at best be defined with the aid of less certain set-theoretic notions. Even if set theory's lacking the certainty of pure logic is deemed acceptable, the usefulness of constructing an encoding of scientific knowledge as logic and set theory is undermined by the inability to construct a useful translation from logic and set-theory back to scientific knowledge. If no translation between scientific knowledge and the logical structures can be constructed that works both ways, then the properties of the purely logical and set-theoretic constructions do not usefully inform understanding of scientific knowledge.\n\nOn Quine's account, attempts to pursue the traditional project of finding the meanings and truths of science philosophically have failed on their own terms and failed to offer any advantage over the more direct methods of psychology. Quine rejects the analytic-synthetic distinction and emphasizes the holistic nature of our beliefs. Since traditional philosophic analysis of knowledge fails, those wishing to study knowledge ought to employ natural scientific methods. Scientific study of knowledge differs from philosophic study by focusing on how humans acquire knowledge rather than speculative analysis of knowledge. According to Quine, this appeal to science to ground the project of studying knowledge, which itself underlies science, should not be dismissed for its circularity since it is the best option available after ruling out traditional philosophic methods for their more serious flaws. This identification and tolerance of circularity is reflected elsewhere in Quine's works.\n\nCooperative naturalism is a version of naturalized epistemology which states that while there are evaluative questions to pursue, the empirical results from psychology concerning how individuals actually think and reason are essential and useful for making progress in these evaluative questions. This form of naturalism says that our psychological and biological limitations and abilities are relevant to the study of human knowledge. Empirical work is relevant to epistemology but only if epistemology is itself as broad as the study of human knowledge.\n\nSubstantive naturalism is a form of naturalized epistemology that emphasizes how all epistemic facts are natural facts. Natural facts can be based on two main ideas. The first is that all natural facts include all facts that science would verify. The second is to provide a list of examples that consists of natural items. This will help in deducing what else can be included.\n\nQuine articulates the problem of circularity inherent in naturalized epistemology when it is treated as a replacement for traditional epistemology. If the goal of traditional epistemology is to validate or to provide the foundation for the natural sciences, naturalized epistemology would be tasked with validating the natural sciences by means of those very sciences. That is, an empirical investigation into the criteria which are used to scientifically evaluate evidence must presuppose those very same criteria. However, Quine points out that these thoughts of validation are merely a byproduct of traditional epistemology. Instead, the naturalized epistemologist should only be concerned with understanding the link between observation and science even if that understanding relies on the very science under investigation.\n\nIn order to understand the link between observation and science, Quine's naturalized epistemology must be able to identify and describe the process by which scientific knowledge is acquired. One form of this investigation is reliabilism which requires that a belief be the product of some reliable method if it is to be considered knowledge. Since naturalized epistemology relies on empirical evidence, all epistemic facts which comprise this reliable method must be reducible to natural facts. That is, all facts related to the process of understanding must be expressible in terms of natural facts. If this is not true, i.e. there are facts which cannot be expressed as natural facts, science would have no means of investigating them. In this vein, Roderick Chisholm argues that there are epistemic principles (or facts) which are necessary to knowledge acquisition, but may not be, themselves, natural facts. If Chisholm is correct, naturalized epistemology would be unable to account for these epistemic principles and, as a result, would be unable to wholly describe the process by which knowledge is obtained.\n\nBeyond Quine's own concerns and potential discrepancies between epistemic and natural facts, Hilary Putnam argues that the replacement of traditional epistemology with naturalized epistemology necessitates the elimination of the normative. But without the normative, there is no \"justification, rational acceptability [nor] warranted assertibility\". Ultimately, there is no \"true\" since any method for arriving at the truth was abandoned with the normative. All notions which would explain truth are only intelligible when the normative is presupposed. Moreover, for there to be \"thinkers\", there \"must be some kind of truth\"; otherwise, \"our thoughts aren't really about anything[...] there is no sense in which any thought is right or wrong\". Without the normative to dictate how one should proceed or which methods should be employed, naturalized epistemology cannot determine the \"right\" criteria by which empirical evidence should be evaluated. But these are precisely the issues which traditional epistemology has been tasked with. If naturalized epistemology does not provide the means for addressing these issues, it cannot succeed as a replacement to traditional epistemology.\n\nJaegwon Kim, another critic of naturalized epistemology, further articulates the difficulty of removing the normative component. He notes that modern epistemology has been dominated by the concepts of justification and reliability. Kim explains that epistemology and knowledge are nearly eliminated in their common sense meanings without normative concepts such as these. These concepts are meant to engender the question \"What conditions must a belief meet if we are justified in accepting it as true?\". That is to say, what are the necessary criteria by which a particular belief can be declared as \"true\" (or, should it fail to meet these criteria, can we rightly infer its falsity)? This notion of truth rests solely on the conception and application of the criteria which are set forth in traditional and modern theories of epistemology.\n\nKim adds to this claim by explaining how the idea of \"justification\" is the only notion (among \"belief\" and \"truth\") which is the defining characteristic of an epistemological study. To remove this aspect is to alter the very meaning and goal of epistemology, whereby we are no longer discussing the study and acquisition of knowledge. Justification is what makes knowledge valuable and normative; without it what can rightly be said to be true or false? We are left with only descriptions of the processes by which we arrive at a belief. Kim realizes that Quine is moving epistemology into the realm of psychology, where Quine’s main interest is based on the sensory input-output relationship of an individual. This account can never establish an affirmable statement which can lead us to truth, since all statements without the normative are purely descriptive (which can never amount to knowledge). The vulgar allowance of any statement without discrimination as scientifically valid, though not true, makes Quine’s theory difficult to accept under any epistemic theory which requires truth as the object of knowledge.\n\nAs a result of these objections and others like them, most, including Quine in his later writings, have agreed that naturalized epistemology as a replacement may be too strong of a view. However, these objections have helped shape rather than completely eliminate naturalized epistemology. One product of these objections is cooperative naturalism which holds that empirical results are essential and useful to epistemology. That is, while traditional epistemology cannot be eliminated, neither can it succeed in its investigation of knowledge without empirical results from the natural sciences. In any case, Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters.\n\n"}

A close friend of Thomas Jefferson, Mazzei acted as an agent to purchase arms for Virginia during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nMazzei was born Filippo Mazzei in Poggio a Caiano in Tuscany as a son of Domenico and Elisabetta. He studied medicine in Florence and practiced in Italy and the Middle East for several years before moving to London in 1755 to take up a mercantile career as an importer. In London he worked as a teacher of Italian language. While in London he met the Americans Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. While doing work for Franklin, Mazzei shared his idea of importing Tuscan products, wine and olive trees, to the New World. They convinced him to undertake his next venture.\n\nOn September 2, 1773 Mazzei boarded a ship from Livorno to Virginia bringing with him plants, seeds, silkworms, and 10 farmers from Lucca. While visiting Jefferson at his estate, the two became good friends and Jefferson gave Mazzei a large allotment of land for an experimental plantation. Mazzei and Jefferson started what became the first commercial vineyard in the Commonwealth of Virginia. They shared an interest in politics and liberal values, and maintained an active correspondence for the rest of Mazzei's life.\n\nIn 1779 Mazzei returned to Italy as a secret agent for the state of Virginia. He purchased and shipped arms to them until 1783. After briefly visiting the United States again in 1785, Mazzei travelled throughout Europe promoting Republican ideals. He wrote a political history of the American Revolution, 'Recherches historiques et politiques sur les Etats-Unis de l'Amerique septentrionale\", and published it in Paris in 1788. After its publication Mazzei became an unofficial roving ambassador in Europe for American ideas and institutions.\n\nWhile in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth he became attached as a Privy Councilor at the court of King Stanislaus II. There he became acquainted with Polish liberal and constitutional thought, like the works of Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki and ideas of Golden Freedoms and Great Sejm. King Stanislaus appointed Mazzei to be Poland's representative in Paris, where he again met Jefferson.\n\nAfter Poland was partitioned between Russia and Prussia in 1795, Mazzei, along with the rest of the Polish court, was given a pension by the Russian crown. He later spent more time in France, becoming active in the politics of the French Revolution under the Directorate. When Napoleon overthrew that government Mazzei returned to Pisa, Italy. He died there in 1816. After his death the remainder of his family returned to the United States at the urging of Thomas Jefferson. They settled in Massachusetts and Virginia. Mazzei's daughter married a nephew of John Adams. \n\nHe was buried at the Pisa Suburbano Cemetery in Pisa.\n\nMany biographers believe Jefferson and Washington had a falling out over a letter Jefferson sent to Mazzei in Italy, which called Washington's administration \"Anglican, monarchical, and aristocratical\" as England and claimed that Washington had appointed as military officers \"all timid men that prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty ... [I]t would give you a fever were I to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies, men who were Samsons in the field and Solomons in the council, but who have had their heads shorn by the harlot England.\" The letter was eventually published overseas and then re-translated back into English by Noah Webster and published in the United States.\n\nThe contribution of Philip Mazzei to the Declaration of Independence was acknowledged by John F. Kennedy in his book \"A Nation of Immigrants\", in which he states that:\n\nA 40-cent United States airmail stamp was issued in 1980 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Mazzei's birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is a separate and more fundamental issue than the regress argument found in discussions on justification of knowledge.\n\nAmerican philosopher Roderick Chisholm in his \"Theory of Knowledge\" details the problem of the criterion with two sets of questions:\n\n\nAn answer to either set of questions will allow us to devise a means of answering the other. Answering the former question set first is called \"particularism\", whereas answering the latter set first is called \"methodism\". A third solution is \"skepticism\", which proclaims that since one cannot have an answer to the first set of questions without first answering the second set, and one cannot hope to answer the second set of questions without first knowing the answers to the first set, we are, therefore, unable to answer either. This has the result of us being unable to justify any of our beliefs.\n\nParticularist theories organize things already known and attempt to use these particulars of knowledge to find a method of how we know, thus answering the second question set.

The initialism \"RSVP\" is no longer used much in France, where it is considered formal and old-fashioned (if not totally unknown by most French people). In French, the complete sentence \"Répondez s'il vous plaît\" gives the impression the speaker is begging for an answer. In France, it is now more common to use \"Réponse attendue avant le...\", meaning \"[Your] answer is expected before...\". In addition, the French initialism \"SVP\" is frequently used to represent \"s'il vous plaît\" (\"please\").\n\nThe phrase \"RSVP, regrets only\", or simply \"Regrets only\", is a popular modern variation that implies \"if you do not reply, that will be taken as an acceptance.\"\n\nMore specifically, if most invitations can be assumed to be accepted, a \"regrets only\" RSVP will reduce the communication required by both the host and their guests. The phrase \"Regrets only\" refers to the assumption that a declination will be worded with some variation of \"We regret we cannot attend...\".\n\nPrior to sending the RSVP invitation, the host may mail out a \"save the date\" card to advise the date and location of the celebration. This may be used when the event will be held a considerable time in the future and/or in a distant location to allow for travel plans, for such events as a wedding, christening, or any other important event.\n\nIn recent years, the use of RSVP in the English language has spread outside of the discourse of highly formal correspondence and commonly figures in group emails.

{"id": "26535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26535", "title": "Richard of Saint Victor", "text": "Richard of Saint Victor\n\nRichard of Saint Victor, C.R.S.A. (died 1173) was a Medieval Scottish philosopher and theologian and one of the most influential religious thinkers of his time. A canon regular, he was a prominent mystical theologian, and was prior of the famous Augustinian Abbey of Saint Victor in Paris from 1162 until his death in 1173.\n\nVery little is known about the origins and upbringing of Richard of Saint Victor. John of Toulouse wrote a short \"Vita\" of Richard in the seventeenth century. He said that Richard came from Scotland. John added that Richard was received into the Abbey of St Victor by Abbot Gilduin (1114–1155) and was a student under Hugh of St Victor, the most influential of all Victorine teachers (implying that Richard entered the community before Hugh's death in 1141). This account of Richard's early life is not accepted by all modern scholars, however, and some have suggested that Richard entered the abbey after Hugh's death in 1141.\n\nAll scholarship agrees, however, that Richard was a magister during the 1150s, and was then promoted to subprior in 1159 (as stated by a document found at the abbey). He served under Achard of St. Victor's elected successor Ernisius, who was unworthy of the position. Richard's life was then burdened by the frustrations of working under a man who was ill-suited for his responsibilities. Ernisius wasted the abbey's resources on overly ambitious building projects and persecuted those who attempted to resist him. Richard was allowed to keep his office but his influence was restricted. Things became so unbearable that an appeal was made to the Pope, who then visited Saint Victor in 1162. Through a multitude of transactions, Ernisius was eventually removed from his position and the Pope commended Richard for his continued involvement in the matter. Letters from England written to Richard show that he was in constant touch with English affairs and give evidence of the international character of intellectual life at this time.\n\nHe was then promoted to prior in 1162, a position he held until his death on 10 March 1173.\n\nRichard wrote extensively (Migne's \"Patrologia Latina\" contains 34 works attributed to him, and this is not Richard's full corpus). There are some problems with establishing the chronology of Richard’s works. The earliest ones come before 1153, and the latest were written one or two years before his death. His earlier works are similar to the general teaching and writing of the period. His writing develops from basic exegesis, theology and philosophy to more of a study of purely spiritual questions. In his early writings he relies on the moral interpretations of previous theologians such as Augustine of Hippo, Bede, Pope Gregory I and Hugh. He later became more independent and strayed from Hugh's influence. There is some debate between historians about which of Richard's texts are the most influential and important. Because Richard's work covers many spheres of thought it is somewhat difficult to categorise his work.\n\n\"The Book of the Twelve Patriarchs\", sometimes titled \"Benjamin Minor\", is one of Richard of Saint Victor's great works on contemplation. It is not exactly known when it was written, but it would seem to date before 1162. Richard specifies that this work is not a treatise on contemplation but rather prepares the mind for contemplation. \n\"The Mystical Ark\", sometimes called \"Benjamin Major\" or \"The Grace of Contemplation\" completes this with the study of the mind in relation to prayer. However, in the last chapters of \"Benjamin Major\", written later than the Minor, Richard almost abandons his topic and the discussion of the teaching of mystical theology takes up a good portion of every remaining chapter. He is still attempting to instruct his followers on a text but he has also engaged himself in creating a system of mystical theology.\n\nOne of Richard’s greatest works was the \"De Trinitate\" which was probably written while Richard was prior, between 1162 and 1173. This is known because it incorporates pieces of theological text which editors are now finding in earlier works. \"De Trinitate\" is Richard's most independent and original study on dogmatic theology. It stems from the desire to show that dogmatic truths of Christian revelation are ultimately not against reason. Richard's theological approach stems from a profoundly mystical life of prayer, which in the Spirit seeks to involve the mind, in continuation with the Augustinian and Anselmian tradition.\n\nOwing to the fact that until recently this masterpiece has not been available in any English translation, its diffusion has been limited and its influence has seldom gone beyond 'Book III', condemning serious enquiry to an understanding of Richard's argument that is only partial. Finally, in 2011, through the efforts of Ruben Angelici's scholarship, the first, full translation of Richard's 'De Trinitate' has been released for publication in English and now this scholastic masterpiece is readily available to a wider audience to be appreciated in its entirety.\n\nRichard wrote a massive handbook of biblical education entitled \"Liber Exceptionum\" (\"Book of Selections/Book of Notes\"), important scriptural commentaries, and many treatises.\n\n\"The Four Degrees of Violent Charity\", composed about 1170, with its description of how vehement love leads to union with God and more perfect service of neighbour, has been of interest to writers interested in Christian mysticism.\n\nRichard’s other treatises are a number of short works which mainly deal with textual difficulties and theological issues. Many of them can be grouped together with larger works. Some of them are correspondence between Richard and his students while others seem to have been written at the request of friends. Although short, they are often interesting because they allow the modern reader to see the mentality of the students and the discussions and issues of the time.\n\nRichard of Saint Victor’s \"Commentary on Ezekiel\" is of special interest in the field of art history because they explanations laid out by the author are accompanied by illustrations. A number of copies have come down to us, none of which are dated, but they are written in a style attributable to the second half of the twelfth century.\n\nWhat makes Richard of Saint-Victor stand out from other theologians of his time is that he approaches theological problems as more of a psychologist, contributing to 'a careful analysis of contemplative experiences.' \n\n\n\n"}

Meilland', is a well-known and successful garden rose. By 1992, over one hundred million plants of this hybrid tea had been sold. The cultivar has large flowers of a light yellow to cream color, slightly flushed at the petal edges with crimson-pink. It is hardy and vigorous and relatively resistant to disease, making it popular in gardens as well as in the floral trade.\n\nIt was developed by French horticulturist Francis Meilland in the years 1935 to 1939. When Meilland foresaw the German invasion of France, he sent cuttings to friends in Italy, Turkey, Germany, and the United States to protect the new rose. It is said that it was sent to the US on the last plane available before the German invasion, where it was safely propagated by the Conard Pyle Co. during the war.\n\nThe cultivar was hybridized in 1935, receiving the number 3-35-40 (the third hybridization in 1935, and the 40th cultivar selected for test proliferation). As those first tests produced beautiful flowers in autumn of 1936, the first no. 3-35-40 were grown in Meilland's rose fields in June 1939. That summer, cuttings were sent to partners in other countries. According to Meilland's records, 'Madame A. Meilland' was hybridized from the hybrid tea 'Margaret McGredy' and an unnamed seedling.\nBecause Meilland had sent out his cuttings just before the war, communication between the cultivators was not possible, which is why the rose received different names. In France, Francis and Alain Meilland decided to call the cultivar 'Madame A. Meilland', in honor of Francis' deceased mother, Alain Meilland's wife Claudia. This is the formal cultivar name. Other names are considered by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as trade or selling names. In Italy it was called (Italian for \"joy\"), in Germany (Latin for \"glory of God\") and in the US, Sweden, and Norway .\n\nThe rose eventually became known as . In early 1945 rose grower Meilland wrote to Field Marshal Alan Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke) to thank him for his key part in the liberation of France and to ask if Brooke would give his name to the rose. Brooke declined saying that, though he was honored to be asked, his name would soon be forgotten and a much better and more enduring name would be \"Peace\".\n\nThe adoption of the trade name \"Peace\" was publicly announced in the United States on 29 April 1945 by the introducers, Conard Pyle Co. This was the very day that Berlin fell, a day considered a turning point in the Second World War in Europe. Later that year Peace roses were given to each of the delegations at the inaugural meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco, each with a note that read:\n\nPeter Beales, English rose grower and expert, said in his book \"Roses\":\n\n'Mme A. Meilland' forms elegant buds that open to large, cupped flowers with a high-centered form and an average diameter of . Their color is a combination of pale yellow and crimson edges that depends on the location, the weather and changes as the flower fades. The durable flowers are very full, with 40 to 43 petals, survive rainy periods, and have a sweet and fruity fragrance that varies in its strength from mild to strong. The cultivar flowers continuously throughout the season up to the first frost.\n\nThe vigorous shrub grows high and wide, is winter hardy down to (USDA zone 6), half-shade tolerant, and disease resistant. The large, glossy leaves are very dark and leathery. 'Mme A. Meilland' is very versatile—it is used as cut rose and as garden rose, solitarily or in groups, as standard rose to high, or in containers.\n\n'Mme A. Meilland' has been granted numerous awards, starting with the selection as \"Most Beautiful French Rose\" in Lyon in 1942, gold medals in Lyon (1942), Portland (1944), The Hague (1965) and from the Royal National Rose Society in 1947. In 1944, it was included in the All-America Rose Selection.\n\nIn 1976, it was the first cultivar to be granted the highest award a rose can be granted when it was selected as \"World's Favorite Rose\" and included into the Rose Hall of Fame.\n\nAs an often cultivated plant, several sports of 'Mme A. Meilland' are known. 'Climbing Peace' (Kordes 1951) has slightly bigger flowers but flowers less well, 'Chicago Peace' (Johnston 1962) differs mainly in its richer colors with a mixture of crimson and apricot, while 'Kronenbourg' (syn. 'Flaming Peace', McGredy 1966) has red petals with yellow backs, creating an interesting contrast.\n\nIt is also used in the hybridization of new cultivars, and played a role in the development of well known cultivars such as 'Garden Party' (Swim, 1959), 'Super Star' (Tantau, 1960), and 'Pullman Orient Express' (Lim & Twomey, 1991).\n\n"}

The modern Chinese 老師/老师 (\"Chinese\" ) is a common word for teacher or professor without the religious or spiritual connotation of \"rōshi\". Chinese Chán Buddhism (Zen is the Japanese transliteration of Chán) uses the semantically related title \"sifu\" (師父/师父, literally \"master father\" or \"father of masters\", or 師傅/师傅, literally \"master teacher\" or \"teacher of masters\"; both pronounced \"shīfu\") as an honorific title for the highest masters, but it also may be used in respectful address of monks and nuns generally.\n\nTraditionally, the term \"rōshi\" has been applied as a respectful honorific to a significantly older Zen teacher considered to have matured in wisdom and to have attained a superior understanding and expression of the Dharma (Japanese: \"mujōdō no taigen\") . Typically, a \"rōshi\" will have received dharma transmission (Jap: \"inka shōmei\") many years ago and although often the abbot or spiritual director of a monastery may in fact be too old to carry these responsibilities. \n\nDespite this historical reality, it has come in some modern Zen schools to be applied as a general title for a teacher regardless of the age of the individual who receives it. This is especially true in the United States and Europe where it appears that some confusion has arisen where the word \"rōshi\" has been conflated with the term \"oshō\", which is the generic term for a Soto Buddhist teacher who has received \"shiho\" and completed her or his basic training. Historically, the term \"rōshi\" will only be applied to an \"oshō\" after they have given many years of service as a teacher.\n\nIn some Rinzai organizations, a monastic is sometimes called \"rōshi\" after they have received \"inka shōmei\", meaning they have completed \"kōan\" study and received Dharma transmission from their master;\n\nAccording to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of \"rōshi\" is equivalent to \"Zen master\" and \"shike\":\nIn the Sōtō organization, a person is sometimes called \"rōshi\" after they have received the title of \"shike\", but this is by no means standard practice:\nMany Zen communities in the United States confer the honorific title of \"rōshi\" to their teachers as a regular title, in deference to perceived Japanese Zen tradition. In most western instances it is used synonymously with the term Zen master, which has a quite specific meaning in Japan, namely the select group of persons who are qualified to supervise the headtemples and monk training halls.\n\nIn the west, Rinzai and Soto-uses of the term have been mixed:\nIn the Sanbo Kyodan, a lay organization that combines Soto and Rinzai elements, a person is called \"rōshi\" when they have received \"inka\", indicating they have passed the \"kōan\" curriculum and received Dharma transmission.\n\nThe use of the term \"rōshi\" in the U.S. and Europe has at times led to confusion and controversy. Stuart Lachs has argued that Zen institutions in the West have often attributed a mythic status to the title \"rōshi\" with harmful consequences.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the seventy-eighth Patriarch in his lineage. As one of the early Korean Zen masters to settle in the United States, he opened many temples and practice groups across the globe. He was known for his charismatic style and direct presentation of Zen, which was well tailored for the Western audience.\n\nKnown by students for his many correspondences with them through letters, his utilization of dharma combat and expressions such as \"only don't know\" or \"only go straight\" in teachings, he was conferred the honorific title of Dae Jong Sa in June 2004 by the Jogye Order for a lifetime of achievements. Considered the highest honor to have bestowed upon one in the order, the title translates \"Great Lineage Master\" and was bestowed for his establishment of the World Wide Kwan Um School of Zen. He died in November that year at Hwagaesa in Seoul, South Korea, at age 77.\n\nSeung Sahn was born in 1927 as Duk-In Lee (modern romanisation: \"Yi Deog'in\") in Sunchon (순천), South Pyongan Province of occupied Korea (now North Korea) to Presbyterian parents. In 1944, he joined an underground resistance movement in response to the ongoing occupation of Korea by the Empire of Japan. He was captured by Japanese police shortly after, avoided a death sentence, and spent time in prison. Upon his release, he studied Western philosophy at Dongguk University. One day, a monk friend of his lent him a copy of the \"Diamond Sutra\". While reading the text, he became inspired to ordain as a monk and left school, receiving the prātimokṣa precepts in 1948. Seung Sahn then performed a one-hundred day solitary retreat in the mountains of Korea, living on a diet of pine needles and rain water. It is said he attained enlightenment on this retreat.\n\nWhile seeking out a teacher who could confirm his enlightenment, he found Kobong, who told him to keep a not-knowing mind. In the fall of 1948, Seung Sahn learned dharma combat while sitting a one-hundred day sesshin at Sudeoksa—where he was known to stir up mischief, nearly being expelled from the monastery. After the sesshin was concluded, he received dharma transmission (\"inka\") from two masters, Keumbong and Keum'oh. He then went to see Kobong, who confirmed Seungsahn's enlightenment on January 25, 1949 and gave him dharma transmission as well. Seung Sahn is the only person Kobong gave Dharma transmission to. He spent the next three years in observed silence.\n\nDrafted into the Republic of Korea Army in 1953, he served as a army chaplain and then as a captain for almost five years, taking over for Kobong as abbot of Hwagaesa in Seoul, South Korea in 1957. In the next decade, he would go on to found Buddhist temples in Hong Kong and Japan. While in Japan, he was acquainted with the kōan (Korean \"gong'an\") tradition of the Rinzai school of Zen, likely undergoing kōan study with a Rinzai master.\n\nComing to the United States in 1972, he settled in Providence, Rhode Island and worked at a laundromat as a repairman, spending much of his off time improving upon his English. Shortly after arriving, he found his first students at nearby Brown University, most of whom came by way of a recommendation from a professor there. Among these first students was Jacob Perl (Wubong), who helped to found the Providence Zen Center with the others.\nIn 1974, Seung Sahn began founding more Zen centers in the United States—his school still yet to be established—beginning with Dharma Zen Center in Los Angeles—a place where laypeople and the ordained could practice and live together. That following year, he went on to found the Chogye International Zen Center of New York City, and then, in 1977, Empty Gate Zen Center. Meanwhile, in 1979, the Providence Zen Center moved from its location in Providence to its current space in Cumberland, Rhode Island.\n\nThe Kwan Um School of Zen was founded in 1983 and, unlike more traditional practice in Korea, Seungsahn allowed laypersons in the lineage to wear the robes of full monastics. Celibacy was not required and the rituals of the school are unique. Although the Kwan Um School does utilize traditional Seon and Zen rituals, elements of their practice also closely resemble rituals found often in Pure Land Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, and the Huayan school. In 1986, along with a former student and Dharma heir Dae Gak, Seungsahn founded a retreat center and temple in Clay City, Kentucky called Furnace Mountain—the temple name being \"Kwan Se Um San Ji Sah\" (or, \"Perceive World Sound High Ground Temple\"). The center functions independently of the Kwan Um organization today.\nOver his tenure as Guiding Teacher, Seungsahn appointed many Dharma heirs. He created the title \"Ji Do Poep Sa Nim\" (JDPSN) for those not ready for full dharma transmission but capable of teaching at a higher capacity. In 1977, Seungsahn was hospitalized for cardiac arrhythmia and it was then discovered that he had advanced diabetes. He had been in and out of hospitals for heart complications for years preceding his death, and in 1987 began spending much less time at his residence in the Providence Zen Center. Starting in 1990, and under invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev, Seungsahn began making trips to the Soviet Union to teach. His student, Myong Gong Sunim, later opened a practice center in the country (Novgorod Center of Zen Meditation). \n\nSeungsahn implemented the use of simple phraseology to convey his messages, delivered with charisma, which helped make the teachings easier to consume for Western followers. Some of his more frequently employed phrases included \"only go straight\" or \"only don't know\". He even went so far as to call his teachings \"Don't Know Zen\", which was reminiscent of the style of Bodhidharma. Seungsahn used correspondences between him and his students as teaching opportunities. Back-and-forth letters allowed for a kind of dharma combat through the mail and made him more available to the school's students in his absence. This was another example of his skillful implementation of unorthodox teaching methods, adapting to the norms of Western culture and thus making himself more accessible to those he taught. He was a supporter of what he often termed \"together action\"—encouraging students to make the lineage's centers their home and practice together.\nSeungsahn also developed his own kōan study program for students of the Kwan Um School, known today as the \"Twelve Gates\". These twelve kōans are a mixture of ancient cases and cases which he developed. Before receiving inka to teach (in Kwan Um, inka is not synonymous with Dharma transmission), students must complete the Twelve Gates, though often they will complete hundreds more. One of the more well known cases of the Twelve Gates is \"Dropping Ashes on the Buddha\", the Sixth Gate, which is also the title of one of his books. In the book \"The Compass of Zen\", this kong-an is transcribed as follows: \"Somebody comes to the Zen center smoking a cigarette. He blows smoke and drops ashes on the Buddha.\" Seungsahn then poses the question, \"If you are standing there at that time, what can you do?\" Not included in this version of the kōan is the Kwan Um School of Zen's following side note on the case, \"[H]ere is an important factor in this case that has apparently never been explicitly included in its print versions. Zen Master Seung Sahn has always told his students that the man with the cigarette is also very strong and that he will hit you if he doesn't approve of your response to his actions.\"\n\nWhen Seungsahn first began teaching in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than a few of his earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Seung Sahn made trips to Israel, which led to the 1999 opening of the Tel Aviv Zen Center. His remaining years were spent in particularly poor health. He had a pacemaker put in his chest in 2000, followed by renal failure in 2002. In June 2004, he was given the honorific title \"Dae Jong Sa\" \"Great Lineage Master\" by the Jogye Order in commemoration of his accomplishments, the highest title the order can grant.\nSeung Sahn died shortly after on November 30, 2004 at the age of 77 in Seoul, South Korea at Hwagaesa, the first temple where he served as abbot.\n\nThere is a belief that Seung Sahn made too many students Dharma teachers. He also upset some in the Jogye Order by allowing lay Dharma teachers to wear long robes - while the Korean Jogye Order also gives the title poep sa (Dharma teachers) to laypeople, long robes are reserved for monks in Korea.\nIn the beginning of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.\n\nSeung Sahn was accused of carrying out sexual relationships with students secretly while supposedly celibate. The first accusations of sexual relationships between Seung Sahn and students came about in 1988. Sonia Alexander, former director of Cambridge Zen Center, has claimed that Seung Sahn had carried out long-term sexual relationships with a number of his female followers. Journalist Rick Fields confirms this, writing “the supposedly celibate Korean Zen master Seung Sahn (Seon-sa-nim) revealed long-term relationships with two students.” According to Sonia Alexander, when questioned about the nature of these relationships Seung Sahn stated that \"it wasn't [romantic] love, it wasn't lust.\" These alleged relationships caused Alexander to end her involvement with the Kwan Um School, believing in retrospect that she had been used over the years only to help build more Zen Centers for the lineage. In addition to Alexander, author Sandy Boucher spoke with several other women who lived at the Cambridge Zen Center at the time, one of whom said that in her opinion Sonia was very much in the minority in feeling used and that Seung Sahn's affairs had not been hurtful to the women involved. Notwithstanding her reservations, Alexander still has reverence for Seung Sahn, feels her time spent in the school was to her benefit, and subsequently rejoined the Kwan Um School as a Senior Dharma Teacher in 2011.\n\nAccording to author Timothy Miller, “the Kwan Um organization has had to struggle with disclosures of controversial sexual conduct on the part of its leader; Seung Sahn was generally understood by his followers to be a celibate monk, and the revelation that he had had affairs with female students caused some members to leave the movement.”\n\nCommenting during this period, Soenghyang (Barbara Rhodes) - now head Zen Master of the Kwan Um School of Zen - said they were \"just people learning to live as a community\" and their teacher was \"just trying to learn the same thing.\" \n\nZen Master Seung Sahn did publicly admit the nature of the relationships and did two repentance ceremonies. The Kwan Um School of Zen has since developed and enforced an ethics committee that has very strict guidelines for teacher/student relationships and consequences for unethical behavior of any member of the school.\n\nThe following list documents Seung-Sahn Haeng-Won's transmission lineage, starting with the Buddha and the First Patriarch.\n\nIndia\nChina\nKorea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The essay champions contemplative life to the life of action. According to Gilbert, scientific principle of heredity shows we are never less free, never have more illusions than when we try to act with some conscious aim in mind. Critical contemplation is guided by conscious aesthetic sense as well as by the soul. The soul is wiser than we are, writes Wilde, it is the concentrated racial experience revealed by the imagination. Criticism is above reason, sincerity and fairness; it is necessarily subjective. It is increasingly more to criticism than to creation that future belongs as its subject matter and the need to impose form on chaos constantly increases.

{"id": "47634579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47634579", "title": "The Critical Legal Studies Movement (book)", "text": "The Critical Legal Studies Movement (book)\n\nThe Critical Legal Studies Movement is a book by philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger. First published in 1983 as an article in the \"Harvard Law Review\", published in book form in 1986, and reissued with a new introduction in 2015, \"The Critical Legal Studies Movement\" is a principal document of the American critical legal studies movement that supplied the book with its title. In the book, Unger argues that law and legal thought offers unrealized possibilities for the self-construction of a more democratic society, and that many lawyers and legal theorists have uncritically surrendered to constraints that undermine their ability to make use of law’s transformative potential. Unger explains how the critical legal studies movement has refined and reformulated the major themes of leftist and progressive legal theorists, namely the critique of formalism and objectivism in legal doctrine, and the purely instrumental use of legal practice and doctrine to advance leftist aims, and in doing so, has identified elements of a constructive program for the reconstruction of society.\n\nUnger sets out to show how contemporary theories of law and society have been constrained by the false belief that law is a necessary expression of certain abstract ideas of social organization, such as democracy or market economy. Unger contends that these modes of social organization do not have any natural, necessary, or inevitable form. Unger begins \"The Critical Legal Studies Movement\" by critiquing formalism and objectivism, the ideas that he believes lie at the root of the necessitarian thinking that blinds us to law's transformative and constructive potential and possibilities. Formalism is the belief that lawmaking differs fundamentally from law application. Objectivism is the belief that authoritative legal materials (statues, cases, accepted legal ideas) embody and sustain a defensible scheme of human association and display an intelligible moral order.\n\nUnger suggests that applying \"extreme criticism\" to formalist and objectivist ideas will expose the elements of a constructive program for the reconstruction of society in line with leftist aims. In this chapter he sets forth critiques of objectivism and formalism. His critique of objectivism aims to show that there is no built-in legal structure for a social organization, and that democracy and the market do not have a universal legal language. His attack on formalism shows that existing legal theories claim to achieve \"sanctification of the actual\"—that is, these theories claim that substantive law and doctrine just happens to coincide with a coherent normative theory about human conduct. Unger explains that such legal analysis is, in reality, pieced together by an endless process of ad hoc adjustments.\n\nUnger explains that the turning point for many critical legal theorists was when they decided to pursue the critical attack on formalism and objectivism to the hilt, at grave risk of \"confusion, paralysis, and marginality.\"\n\nIn this chapter, Unger sets forth the constructive outcome of the critiques of formalism and objectivism, namely the practice of \"deviationist doctrine\" (also called \"expanded doctrine\"), and the search for alternative institutional forms for basic social institutions, particularly the market and democracy.\n\nDeviationist doctrine, according to Unger, represents an attempt to bridge doctrine with empirical social theory and ideological conflict. Such an expanded form of doctrine fights over the terms of social life, and refuses to accept that established forms of society reflect any practical or psychological necessities. Everything is up for grabs. Such doctrine aims to point out how biased, power-ridden and makeshift legal materials have gained a semblance of necessity that they should not be granted. In brief, deviationist doctrine encourages theorists to transform society by taking an ideal from one part of social life, and extending it into an area from which it had previously been excluded. This has the advantage of allowing the theorist to draw upon a rich collective history of ideas and institutions that have helped to articulate the ideal in the past, and can now be marshaled to defend its extension into a new area of social life.\n\nThe search for alternative forms of basic social organization aims to shape social institutions to be more hospitable and nurturing to the context-transcending nature of human beings. Unger characterizes this search as \"the quest for a social world that can better do justice to a being whose most remarkable quality is precisely the power to overcome and revise, with time, every social or mental structure in which he moves.\" Unger sees this effort as defensible because it pushes the preconceptions of liberal legal and political theory to their natural conclusions.\n\nUnger sketches the various features that the institutional program he proposes should have:\n\nIn this section, Unger proposes the transformation of existing doctrine that would help to advance the aims of the critical legal studies movement. First, he explains how the ambitions underlying equal protection doctrine could better be achieved by expanding this doctrine so that individuals and institutions are vested with \"destabilization rights\"—that is, the right to disentrench accumulations of power that serve to inhibit and disempower members of society. Second, he proposes to change the social institutions of contract and property to bring them more in line with principles of solidarity and community.\n\nIn this chapter, Unger addresses two plausible objections to the program of critical legal studies, and offers his response to them. The objections are, in turn, that it seems merely an accident that we find ourselves in a situation in which we are engaged in the \"internal development\" of a program such as the one Unger describes, and thus such a program would seem to have no intrinsic authority, since just as easily we could have found ourselves developing a program that leads in another direction. The second plausible objection is that any tradition is inherently ambiguous, and equally compelling arguments could be made for developing the tradition of leftist movements in some other direction.\n\nUnger contends that the program he sets forth is one that has the best chance of harnessing the \"negative capability\" of human beings—that is, teaching the person \"to move within contexts with the dignity of a context-transcending agent.\" Such a world would be one that more fully reconciles the conflict, felt in every person's life, between the need for self-assertion among other people, and the need to be protected from other people. Furthermore, against the claim that tradition is ambiguous and could be developed in some other direction, Unger argues that his program offers the best chance for making freedom concrete for human beings. Such a program seeks to narrow the gap between our vast transcending capabilities, and the limiting structures in which we live.\n\nUnger concludes \"The Critical Legal Studies Movement\" by describing how his program offers the opportunity to fuse the revolution in the sphere of personal relations, with revolution in the uses of government power and institutional structure. The transformative activity that he urges would take place in several settings: in contributing substantive ideas to the project of a democratic remaking of social life; in the transformation of professional technique in all areas of professional expertise, so that there is less gap between activities that leave social structures unchallenged, and activities that call structures into question, and so that the gap between laymen and professionals begins to wane; and finally, in the setting of law schools, where, by penetrating the specialized study of law, the ideas Unger sets forth have the greatest chance of taking root so that they spread throughout society.\n\nReviewing the book for the \"New York Times\", Calvin Woodard described \"The Critical Legal Studies Movement\" as an \"ambitious and impressive undertaking. It also defies summation. It is a carefully crafted statement with ideas interlocked like a chain-link fence that stretches as far as the eye can see.\" The central theme of the movement, Woodard explained, is\n\nto remove the constraints and hindrances imposed on individuals by unjust social hierarchy and class, enabling them to develop a new sense of self and to give full and free expression to their innate intelligence and imagination. To Mr. Unger, liberated individuals endowed with dignity, self-respect and equal opportunity are the highest hope of humankind. Collectively, a society of such people would make up a new form of \"empowered democracy\" in which all social decisions would be regarded as political ones...\n\nWoodard gave high praise to \"The Critical Legal Studies Movement\", stating that \"[w]hether one agrees with Mr. Unger and C.L.S. or not, one cannot fail to be impressed by his high idealism and intelligence,\" but that \"I suspect it will be read mostly by the converted and others will not bother. As a result, a whole generation of older readers will miss out on a book that very probably will have enormous influence on the younger generation of law students.\"\n\n"}

The text presents a Thomist philosophy regarding religion and morality. It contains a study of Atheism, titled \"The Meaning of Contemporary Atheism\", which has had a considerable impact on Catholic views of Atheism.\n\nIn this essay, Maritain considers empiricist epistemology. While he acknowledges that sense-data plays an important part in human knowledge of the world, he rejects the thesis that the real does not exist or cannot be known, because he believes that the intellect can transcend sensory experience to perceive the noumenal world.\n\nMaritain here supports the theory that the aesthetic carries a \"hidden truth\", as an expression of the fundamental individuality of the artist.\n\nMaritain introduces various terms to distinguish the beliefs of atheists. These terms are:\n\n\nThe absolute atheist does not lack belief in God, but rather constantly challenges and fights against God. Those described as such never stop thinking about God in order to liberate themselves from anything that connotes God.\n\nPractical atheists prefer to be seen as adherents to religious faith for selfish reasons, yet deny the gospels by lacking concern for the well-being of others.\n\nThe pseudo-atheist believes that he or she is an atheist, but unconsciously believes in God. According to Maritain, the \"God\" whose existence is denied is not God, but rather a being of reason, a nonexistent entity which he or she has mistakenly labeled as God. Thus, the pseudo atheist actually denies an entity that is self-evidently nonexistent or that necessitates negative consequences for nature or humanity.\n\nThe real atheist denies the \"God Who is the authentic object of reason and of faith and Whose authentic idea [the atheist's] mind misuses.\" Maritain states the morality of the real atheist is but a false idol of the \"separate Good,\" which is God's morality.\n\n"}

Nicholson on Indian philosophy, describing the philosophical unification of Hinduism, which it places in the Middle Ages. The book was published in the US in 2010 in hardcover, with a paperback edition appearing in 2014. An Indian hardcover edition was published by Permanent Black in 2011. The book won the 2011 award for Best First Book in the History of Religions from the American Academy of Religion, and has been reviewed in numerous professional journals.\n\"Unifying Hinduism\" contains 10 chapters.\nMuch of the book focuses on the thought of the medieval Indian philosopher, Vijnanabhiksu. The book's central concern is to show that Vijnanabhiksu provided a philosophical synthesis of diverse schools of Indian philosophy, thereby providing a philosophical unification of Hinduism long before the British colonial conquest and rule of India. This refutes claims that Hinduism only attained unity (or only was \"invented\") as a response to colonial influence.\n\nAfter an introductory first chapter, the next five chapters focus on Vijñānabhikṣu’s philosophical syntheses. Chapter 2, entitled \"An Alternate History of Vedanta\", sets the stage by tracing the history of Bhedābheda Vedānta, a comparatively neglected tradition that teaches the \"difference and nondifference\" of Brahman and the individual self. Vijnanabhikshu's version of this \"Difference and Non-Difference\" Vedanta is described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 offers a historical overview of two important non-Vedanta Indian philosophies, the schools of Sāṃkhya and Yoga,\nfocusing on their views of God, documenting that contrary to widespread views of Sāṃkhya as entirely atheistic, most first millennium Sāṃkhya authors were theists. \nChapter 5, \"Reading Against the Grain of the Samkhyasutras\", focuses on a controversial assertion by Vijñānabhikṣu that some Sāṃkhyasūtra verses that explicitly argue against God's existence do not ultimately intend to deny God’s existence, but represent merely a “temporary concession” (abhyupagamavāda) or “bold assertion” (prauḍhivāda). \nFinally, Chapter 6, \"Yoga, Praxis, and Liberation\", discusses Vijñānabhikṣu’s commentary on Patañjali's Yogasūtras, arguing that Vijñānabhikṣu’s commentaries on Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga represent a unified whole.\n\nChapter 7, \"Vedanta and Samkhya in the Orientalist Imagination\", discusses how Vijñānabhikṣu was diversely viewed by nineteenth-century European scholars, who in some sense can be understood as \"intellectual inheritors of Vijñānabhikṣu’s thought\".\n\nThe next two chapters return to South Asian thought, with Chapter 8 focuses on Indian philosophical doxographies (categorizations)\nand Chapter 9, \"Affirmers (Astikas) and Deniers (Nastikas) in Indian History\", providing a history and preferred translation of the two terms āstika and nāstika, which are more often translated as \"orthodox\" and \"heterodox\".\nThe concluding tenth chapter, \"Hindu Unity and the Non-Hindu Other\", discusses the timing of the unification of Hindu philosophical schools, suggesting that the stimulus was the presence of Islam.\n\n\"Unifying Hinduism\" won the 2011 award for Best First Book in the History of Religions from the American Academy of Religion.\n\nReviews have appeared in the \n\"Journal of the American Academy of Religion\",\n\"Religious Studies Review\",\n\"Sophia\",\n\"Journal of the American Oriental Society\",\n\"Journal of Asian Studies\",\n\"Journal of Hindu Studies\",\n\"South Asian History and Culture\",\n\"Literature and Theology\",\n\"\", and\n\"Metapsychology.\n\"Unifying Hinduism\" has also been discussed in the book \"Indra's Net\".\n\nIn the \"Journal of the American Academy of Religion\", Christopher Key Chapple wrote that the author \"has created a tour-de-force that puts India’s premodern thinkers in conversation with its postmodern intellectuals\". In particular,\nAlso in the \"Journal of the American Academy of Religion\", Michael S. Allen wrote that the book won Best First Book \"for good reason: lucid and accessible... Nicholson’s book offers an excellent model for South Asianists seeking to engage with the wider field of religious studies\", while the book \"can also be recommended to nonspecialists with interests in religious identity, boundary formation, and comparative theology\". To Allen, \"Nicholson has convincingly shown that a process of unification began well before the British colonial period, extending back several centuries at the very least\". However, \"there is reason to suspect that the beginnings of the process he describes predate the twelfth century... [which] would in turn call into question the degree to which Islam influenced the process.\"\n\nIn \"Religious Studies Review\", Jeffrey D. Long wrote that the book \"sets the record\nstraight\" regarding the historical emergence Hinduism, and \"promises to change the scholarly conversation on Hindu identity\". Long describes the book as \"marvelously clear, meticulously researched, and tightly argued\", pointing out that the book also \nIn \"Sophia\", Reid Locklin wrote the book was \"somewhat fragmented\", with chapters showing marks of prior publication or presentation elsewhere, but that \"The cumulative effect is nevertheless very impressive\", and that \"Given the enormous scope of its enquiry, the work is relatively concise, very accessible and therefore suitable for the advanced undergraduate or graduate classroom\".\n\nIn \"Journal of the American Oriental Society\", John Nemec wrote that the book's strengths \"lie with the larger, theoretical argument Nicholson makes regarding the role of doxography in shaping knowledge\", and that the book\nBut Nemec was still left \"with certain doubts and questions\", such as how our understanding of Vijnanabhiksu's views might change if more of his works were available in translation, and whether premodern Indian philosophers might have been \"more aware of their mutual differences than this volume allows\". Despite such doubts, Nemec suggested that the volume would be \"of value to medievalists, scholars of Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga, and of Indian philosophy more generally, to scholars concerned with colonialism, and even those concerned with communal relations in contemporary South Asia.\"\n\nIn \"Journal of Asian Studies\", Tulasi Srinivas wrote that she \"found this book very valuable, challenging of my assumptions\", calling the book \"erudite and thought provoking\", and its argument \"powerful, well researched and delivered, and... remarkably persuasive\". She wondered whether \"penetrability\" between various philosophical schools might be overstated, and how views of Vijnanabhiksu might change if more of his works were available in translation. She regarded the book as having \"political ramifications that suggest that the origins of Hinduism are not only the Vedas, as Hindu nationalists claim... nor a product of British colonial rule... as understood by some scholars.\" She also viewed the book as significant for its \"broader political and critical claim that Bhedabheda Vedanta is valuable and on par with the better known schools of Indian philosophy\".\n\nIn \"Journal of Hindu Studies\", David Buchta wrote that the author's position is \"clearly and coherently argued and well-supported\", stating that \"the balance that Nicholson's analysis offers, correcting exaggerated claims about the colonial invention of Hinduism, is its most important contribution to the study of Hinduism\". Furthermore, Nicholson \"shows sensitivity to the political implications of the discussion and the possibility that scholarship supporting the pre-colonial development of a sense of Hindu unity can be co-opted in support of communalism\", and is therefore \"careful to emphasise that, while Hindus may have long agreed that a sense of unity exists, the details have just as long been to subject of debate and development\".\n\nIn \"South Asian History and Culture\", Kaif Mahmood pointed out that \"beliefs\" have been only one among many types of religious expression that also include religious art, ritual, and law; Mahmood suggested that Nicholson engaged in \"unstated [and debatable] theoretical presumptions that philosophy is identical to religion\". Nicholson's analyses also raise the question, unaddressed by the book, of whether \"if what we call Hinduism was invented for the purpose of preserving a particular identity, what was it that was being preserved, if there was no Hinduism before? A weak identity may be strengthened, even refined, but can an identity be invented out of nothing?\" Mahmood is also concerned that the book fails to discuss or acknowledge a core question related to Vijnanbhiksu's motivation, that is\nIn \"Literature and Theology\", Robert Leach wrote that the book was \"rich, erudite, challenging, and always interesting [and] it will be very difficult to read this book and retain the notion that the idea of Hinduism was dreamt up, virtually from scratch, in the 19th century\". Leach added that\n\nLeach also found of interest Nicholson's conclusion that \"in Classical India nastika principally denoted non-acceptance of 'correct ritual performance' (i.e. heteropraxy), but in late medieval Vedanta came to be understood as the rejection of 'correct opinion' (heterodoxy)\", pointing out that \"This conclusion can have significant consequences for the debate on the so-called 'Protestantisation' of Hinduism in the 19th century\".\n\nIn \"\", R. Puligandla described the book as \"clear, analytical, well-documented\", recommending that \"all scholars and students of Hinduism and Indian philosophy should find this book beneficial and rewarding\", although \"Nicholson's arguments and conclusions will not persuade some scholars, especially those who hold the view that Hinduism as a unified tradition has existed since ancient times\".\n\nIn \"Metapsychology\", Vineeth Mathoor described the book as presenting \"the history of [the] dialectical relation between Hinduism and the many streams within it [yielding] what it today stands for: tolerance, pluralism and inclusivism\", calling the book \"path-breaking\" and \"a must read for scholars of Indian history, Hinduism and south Asian religious traditions\".\n\nIn his book \"Indra's Net: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity\", Rajiv Malhotra quoted and cited numerous ideas from \"Unifying Hinduism\", describing it as an \"excellent study of the pre-colonial coherence of Hinduism\", and as a \"positive exception to many [reifying, homogenizing, and isolating] trends in scholarship\" by Westerners about the evolution of Hindu philosophy. However, despite the citations, it was alleged that Rajiv Malhotra's work actually plagiarised Nicholson's work. It led to an online controversy without any actual law suit being filed against Rajiv Malhotra. In response to Nicholson, Malhotra stated \"I used your work with explicit references 30 times in Indra's Net, hence there was no ill-intention,\" and provided with a list of these citations. He added that he will be removing all references to Nicholson, replacing them with original Indian sources. Thereafter, a re-written version of the debated chapter was posted on the book's website.\n\nThe original hardcover edition was published by in 2010 by Columbia University Press. A hardcover edition was published in India in 2011 by Permanent Black. Paperback and electronic versions have also been published:\n\n\n"}
