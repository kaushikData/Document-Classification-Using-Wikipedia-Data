Having served in Europe and the Middle East, many of them experienced racism from both British Officers and common soldiers, which alienated them from British nationalism. Some of them from the 9th Battalion had participated in the Taranto Revolt, which started on 6 December 1918, shortly after the armistice. This was stimulated by the War Office refusing to allow the troops of the British West Indies Regiment receive the extra 6 pence a day which had been given to British soldiers. This was explained as being because they were \"natives\". The all-white Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps did receive the increment. They were also put to work as labourers for the White Italian Labour Corps. Officers were attacked and explosives and guns were used. The Worcestershire Regiment was dispatched to quell the revolt, and they executed one rebel by firing squad. Nevertheless, some 50 to 60 sergeants met on 17 December to form the \"Caribbean League\" which had four meetings in the next few weeks. Aside from addressing various grievances they had, pan-Caribbean sentiments were fostered, and a movement for independence in the West Indies was discussed. This included plans to set up an office in Kingston, Jamaica, and organise strikes. After being betrayed to the authorities, the league was disbanded. In February 1919, Army Order No. 1, granting the wage increase, was extended to the BWIR.\n\n\n"}

Conway's thought is original as it is rationalist philosophy, with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.\n\nAnne Finch was born to Sir Heneage Finch (who had held the posts of the Recorder of London and Speaker of the House of Commons under Charles I) and his second wife, Elizabeth (daughter of William Cradock of Staffordshire). Her father died the week before her birth. She was the youngest child. Her early education was by tutors and included Latin, to which she later added Greek and Hebrew. Her stepbrother, John Finch, who encouraged her interests in philosophy and theology, introduced Anne to the Cambridge Platonist Henry More, who was one of John's tutors at Christ's College, Cambridge. This led to a lifelong correspondence and close friendship between them on the subject of René Descartes' philosophy, over the course of which Anne grew from More's informal pupil to his intellectual equal. More said of her that he had \"scarce ever met with any Person, Man or Woman, of better Natural parts than Lady Conway\" (quoted in Richard Ward's \"The Life of Henry More\" (1710) p. 193), and that \"in the knowledge of things as well Natural and Divine, you have not onely out-gone all of your own Sex, but even of that other also.\" Conway grew up in the house now known as Kensington Palace, which her family owned at the time.\n\nIn 1651 she married Edward Conway, later 1st Earl of Conway, and in the following year More dedicated his book \"Antidote against Atheism\" to her. In 1658, Anne gave birth to her only child, Heneage Edward Conway, who died of smallpox just two years later. Her husband was also interested in philosophy and had himself been tutored by More, but she went far beyond him in both the depth of her thought and the variety of her interests. She became interested in the Lurianic Kabbalah, and then in Quakerism, to which she converted in 1677. In England at that time the Quakers were generally disliked and feared, and suffered persecution and even imprisonment. Conway's decision to convert, to make her house a centre for Quaker activity, and to proselytise actively was thus particularly bold and courageous.\n\nHer life from the age of twelve (when she suffered a period of fever) was marked by the recurrence of severe migraines. These meant that she was often incapacitated by pain, and she spent much time under medical supervision and searching for a cure (at one point even having her jugular veins opened). She had medical consults from Dr. Thomas Willis. Conway was famously treated by many of the great physicians of her time, but none of the treatments had any effect. She died in 1679 at the age of forty-seven.\n\nThe text itself was probably written in 1677 and shows the influence of Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont.\nThe text was first published in Latin translation by van Helmont in Amsterdam in 1690 as \"Principia philosophiae antiquissimae et recentissimae\". An English edition appeared in 1692. The \"Principles\" develops Conway's monistic view of the world as created from one substance. Conway is critical of the Cartesian idea that bodies are constituted of dead matter, of Henry More's concept of the soul in his \"Antidote Against Atheism,\" and of dualist theories of the relationship between the body and spirit.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "954797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=954797", "title": "Bernard Gert", "text": "Bernard Gert\n\nBernard Gert (; October 16, 1934 – December 24, 2011) was a moral philosopher known primarily for his work in normative ethics, as well as in medical ethics, especially pertaining to psychology.\n\nHis work has been called \"among the clearest and most comprehensive on the contemporary scene\", \"far more detailed and more concretely worked out\" and \"systematic\" than competing comprehensive ethical theories. Because it avoids pitfalls associated with other dominant ethical theoretical approaches (such as deontology, utilitarianism, contractarianism, and virtue ethics), Gert's moral theory \"provides what many people are looking for\".\n\nBorn in Cincinnati, Ohio, Gert studied philosophy at Cornell University. He was a professor at Dartmouth College for fifty years, from 1959 to 2009. Upon his death in 2011, he was the Stone Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, Emeritus at Dartmouth. He also had other adjunct and visiting appointments, including being a fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution. He died in 2011 in North Carolina.\n\nA source of notoriety among his contemporaries was that his family became a family of philosophers: his two children, Joshua and Heather, both became philosophers, and both married two other philosophers.\n\nGert advocates the following definition of morality:\n\nAccording to Gert, his theory counts as a natural law theory because he holds that all moral agents must be able to understand morality in order to count as moral agents. In other words, \"moral judgments can only be made about those who know what kind of behavior morality prohibits, requires, discourages, encourages, and allows.\"\n\nAccording to Gert, harm (or \"evil\") is the central moral concept. Gert believes harm is what all rational creatures seek to avoid. He advances the following five-concept account of harm:\nHe maintains that commonsense morality is far more concerned with prohibiting (and discouraging) evil than with requiring (or encouraging) people to enhance goods or benefits.\n\nOn Gert's view, the bases for morality are rationality and impartiality.\n\nOn Gert's conception of rationality, it is irrational to fail to be averse to harm. Everyone avoids harm insofar as they are rational. Rationality does require that we avoid harming ourselves without an adequate reason. A rational person would not cause his own pain unless it were for an adequate reason, for example, to cure a disease. Even a masochist causes pain in himself for a reason, presumably for pleasure. This helps show that no rational being seeks to harm himself for its own sake.\n\nThe sort of \"adequate reason\" in question involves avoiding any of the five basic evils or obtaining of any of the following \"basic goods\":\n\nAccording to Gert, acting rationally does not always require acting morally. For example, it is not irrational to set a trap for someone who is wearing an Armani suit so that they fall into a swimming pool in front of a video camera, since the pleasure one can get out of watching the video constitutes an adequate reason for harming the other person. It would also be rational for a sadist to torture other people for fun provided the sadist could get away with it.\n\nThere are five sorts of irrational desire according to Gert: seeking death, pain, disability, loss of freedom, or loss of pleasure. We arrive at moral rules by extending these objects of irrational desire to others. Rationality, alone, does not require this. However, if we adopt the principle of impartiality, whereby we apply the rules without regard to who gains or loses, we extend these prohibitions to others. This results in rules such as \"do not kill\", \"do not cause pain\", \"do not disable\", and so forth.\n\nOn Gert's view, there are several reasons to act morally. The primary one is i) that someone else will be harmed. While it is rational not to care about others, the fact that they will be harmed is enough of a reason itself.\n\nOther reasons to act morally include ii) that acting immorally will corrupt one's own character, and iii) that some forms of immoral action can make the world inhospitable to oneself, such that in some cases it is irrational to act immorally toward others.\n\nIn his book \"Common Morality: Deciding What to Do\", Gert proposes ten moral rules which, if followed, create a moral system. The rules are as follows:\n\n\nThe first five of these rules directly prohibit harming other people. Thus, they can be summarized with the slogan, 'do not harm'. The second five rules get their force from the fact that if it were generally allowed that those rules be broken, many harms (and losses of benefits) would result. They can be summarized with the slogan, 'do not violate trust'.\n\nGert holds that the moral rules are not absolute, but admit of exceptions. To determine whether a moral rule applies in a certain case or whether there is an exception, Gert advises people to follow what he calls the \"two step procedure.\" The first step is to ascertain all morally relevant information about the scenario at hand in order to make a justified evaluation. The second step is to consider the consequences of other people knowing that they can violate the moral rule in similar circumstances.\n\nAn example of this would be if you were to consider violating rule #9 (breaking the law) in order to run a red light. You evaluate the scenario and notice that there are no cars around and running the red light will not cause any harm, however, you do not want other people to know that they can run red lights too, because that would lead to more car accidents, which is indirectly causing pain and death. Another example of violating the moral rules would be killing in self-defense. If you evaluate the situation, you find that if you do not kill the other person, they will violate one of the moral rules and kill you. Also, it would be acceptable in this scenario for other people to know that killing in self-defense is allowable.\n\n\"Moral ideals\", according to Gert, are objectives to lessen the amount of harm or evil in the world. These differ from moral rules, which are requirements that people avoid performing certain kinds of actions which produce harms to others. Morality encourages, but does not require, people to live up to moral ideals. Examples of moral ideals are the objectives of reducing the incidence of domestic violence or of breast cancer.\n\nWhat Gert calls \"utilitarian ideals\" are objectives to increase the amount of good in the world. For example, the objective of giving poor children extra presents for Christmas.\n\nAlthough his moral system shares similarities to deontology, rule utilitarianism, and contractarianism, Gert does not ally himself with any of those positions. He writes, \"I think that my view is best characterized as a natural law theory . . . in the tradition of Hobbes\". He also writes, \"my view has been characterized as Kant with consequences, as Mill with publicity, and as Ross with a theory.\"\n\nHowever, when Walter Sinnott-Armstrong once labeled the theory as \"a sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism\", Gert replied that \"there may be no point in denying that I am some form of consequentialist\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24142855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24142855", "title": "Biocentrism (ethics)", "text": "Biocentrism (ethics)\n\nBiocentrism (from Greek βίος \"bios\", \"life\" and κέντρον \"kentron\", \"center\"), in a political and ecological sense, as well as literally, is an ethical point of view that extends inherent value to all living things. It is an understanding of how the earth works, particularly as it relates to biodiversity. It stands in contrast to anthropocentrism, which centers on the value of humans. The related ecocentrism extends inherent value to the whole of nature.\n\nBiocentrism does not imply the idea of equality among the animal kingdom, for no such notion can be observed in nature. Biocentric thought is nature-based, not human-based.\n\nAdvocates of biocentrism often promote the preservation of biodiversity, animal rights, and environmental protection. The term has also been employed by advocates of \"left biocentrism\", which combines deep ecology with an \"anti-industrial and anti-capitalist\" position (according to David Orton \"et al.\").\n\nThe term biocentrism encompasses all environmental ethics that \"extend the status of moral object from human beings to all living things in nature\". Biocentric ethics calls for a rethinking of the relationship between humans and nature. It states that nature does not exist simply to be used or consumed by humans, but that humans are simply one species amongst many, and that because we are part of an ecosystem, any actions which negatively affect the living systems of which we are a part adversely affect us as well, \"whether or not\" we maintain a biocentric worldview. Biocentrists observe that all species have inherent value, and that humans are not \"superior\" to other species in a moral or ethical sense.\n\nThe four main pillars of a biocentric outlook are:\n\n\nBiocentrism views individual species as parts of the living biosphere. It observes the consequences of reducing biodiversity on both small and large scales and points to the inherent value all species have to the environment. \n\nThe environment is seen for what it is; the biosphere within which we live and depend on its diversity for our health. From these observations the ethical points are raised.\n\nBiocentric ethics differs from classical and traditional ethical thinking. Rather than focusing on strict moral rules, as in Classical ethics, it focuses on attitudes and character. In contrast with traditional ethics, it is nonhierarchical and gives priority to the natural world rather than to humankind exclusively.\n\nBiocentric ethics includes Albert Schweitzer's ethics of \"Reverence for Life\", Peter Singer's ethics of Animal Liberation and Paul Taylor's ethics of biocentric egalitarianism.\n\nAlbert Schweitzer's \"reverence for life\" principle was a precursor of modern biocentric ethics. In contrast with traditional ethics, the ethics of \"reverence for life\" denies any distinction between \"high and low\" or \"valuable and less valuable\" life forms, dismissing such categorization as arbitrary and subjective. Conventional ethics concerned itself exclusively with human beings—that is to say, morality applied only to interpersonal relationships—whereas Schweitzer's ethical philosophy introduced a \"depth, energy, and function that differ[s] from the ethics that merely involved humans\". \"Reverence for life\" was a \"new ethics, because it is not only an extension of ethics, but also a transformation of the nature of ethics\".\n\nSimilarly, Peter Singer argues that non-human animals deserve the same equality of consideration that we extend to human beings. His argument is roughly as follows:\n\n\nBiocentrism is most commonly associated with the work of Paul Taylor, especially his book \"Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics\" (1986). Taylor maintains that biocentrism is an \"attitude of respect for nature\", whereby one attempts to make an effort to live one's life in a way that respects the welfare and inherent worth of all living creatures. Taylor states that:\n\n\nHistorian Donald Worster traces today's biocentric philosophies, which he sees as part of a recovery of a sense of kinship between man and nature, to the reaction by the British intelligencia of the Victorian era against the Christian ethic of dominion over nature. He has pointed to Charles Darwin as an important spokesman for the biocentric view in ecological thought and quotes from Darwin's \"Notebook on Transmutation of Species\" (1837): If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, diseases, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusement—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all netted together.\n\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin published his book \"On the Origin of Species\". This publication sparked the beginning of biocentrist views by introducing evolution and \"its removal of humans from their supernatural origins and\nplacement into the framework of natural laws\".\n\nThe work of Aldo Leopold has also been associated with biocentrism. The essay \"The Land Ethic\" in Leopold's book Sand County Almanac (1949) points out that although throughout history women and slaves have been considered property, all people have now been granted rights and freedoms. Leopold notes that today land is still considered property as people once were. He asserts that ethics should be extended to the land as \"an evolutionary possibility and an ecological necessity\". He argues that while people's instincts encourage them to compete with others, their ethics encourage them to co-operate with others. He suggests that \"the land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land\". In a sense this attitude would encourage humans to co-operate with the land rather than compete with it.\n\nOutside of formal philosophical works biocentric thought is common among pre-colonial tribal peoples who knew no world other than the natural world.\n\nThe paradigm of biocentrism and the values that it promotes are beginning to be used in law.\n\nIn recent years, cities in Maine, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia have adopted laws that protect the rights of nature. The purpose of these laws is to prevent the degradation of nature; especially by corporations who may want to exploit natural resources and land space, and to also use the environment as a dumping ground for toxic waste. \nThe first country to include rights of nature in its constitution is Ecuador (See 2008 Constitution of Ecuador). Article 71 states that nature \"has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes\".\n\nIn Islam:\nIn Islam, biocentric ethics stem from the belief that all of creation belongs to Allah (God), not humans, and to assume that non-human animals and plants exist merely to benefit humankind leads to environmental destruction and misuse. As all living organisms exist to praise God, human destruction of other living things prevents the earth's natural and subtle means of praising God. The Qur'an acknowledges that humans are not the only all-important creatures and emphasizes a respect for nature. Muhammad was once asked whether there would be a reward for those who show charity to nature and animals, to which he replied, \"for charity shown to each creature with a wet heart [i.e. that is alive], there is a reward.\" \nIn Hinduism: \nHinduism contains many elements of biocentrism. In Hinduism, humans have no special authority over other creatures, and all living things have souls ('atman'). Brahman (God) is the \"efficient cause\" and Prakrti (nature), is the \"material cause\" of the universe. However, Brahman and Prakrti are not considered truly divided: \"They are one in [sic] the same, or perhaps better stated, they are the one in the many and the many in the one.\"\n\nHowever, while Hinduism does not give the same direct authority over nature that the Judeo-Christian God grants, they are subject to a \"higher and more authoritative responsibility for creation\". The most important aspect of this is the doctrine of Ahimsa (non-violence). The Yājñavalkya Smṛti warns, \"the wicked person who kills animals which are protected has to live in hell fire for the days equal to the number of hairs on the body of that animal\". The essential aspect of this doctrine is the belief that the Supreme Being incarnates into the forms of various species. The Hindu belief in Saṃsāra (the cycle of life, death and rebirth) encompasses reincarnation into non-human forms. It is believed that one lives 84,000 lifetimes before one becomes a human. Each species is in this process of samsara until one attains moksha (liberation).\n\nAnother doctrinal source for the equal treatment of all life is found in the Rigveda. The Rigveda states that trees and plants possess divine healing properties. It is still popularly believed that every tree has a Vriksa-devata (a tree deity).Trees are ritually worshiped through prayer, offerings, and the sacred thread ceremony. The Vriksa-devata worshiped as manifestations of the Divine. Tree planting is considered a religious duty.\n\nIn Jainism: \nThe Jaina tradition exists in tandem with Hinduism and shares many of its biocentric elements.\n\nAhimsa (non-violence), the central teaching of Jainism, means more than not hurting other humans. It means intending not to cause physical, mental or spiritual harm to any part of nature. In the words of Mahavira: ‘You are that which you wish to harm.’ Compassion is a pillar of non-violence. Jainism encourages people to practice an attitude of compassion towards all life.\n\nThe principle of interdependence is also very important in Jainism. This states that all of nature is bound together, and that \"if one does not care for nature one does not care for oneself.\".\n\nAnother essential Jain teaching is self-restraint. Jainism discourages wasting the gifts of nature, and encourages its practitioners to reduce their needs as far as possible. Gandhi, a great proponent of Jainism, once stated \"There is enough in this world for human needs, but not for human wants.\"\n\nIn Buddhism:\nThe Buddha's teachings encourage people \"to live simply, to cherish tranquility, to appreciate the natural cycle of life\". Buddhism emphasizes that everything in the universe affects everything else. \"Nature is an ecosystem in which trees affect climate, the soil, and the animals, just as the climate affects the trees, the soil, the animals and so on. The ocean, the sky, the air are all interrelated, and interdependent—water is life and air is life.\"\n\nAlthough this holistic approach is more ecocentric than biocentric, it is also biocentric, as it maintains that all living things are important and that humans are not above other creatures or nature. Buddhism teaches that \"once we treat nature as our friend, to cherish it, then we can see the need to change from the attitude of dominating nature to an attitude of working with nature—we are an intrinsic part of all existence rather than seeing ourselves as in control of it.\"\n\nBiocentrism has faced criticism for a number of reasons. Some of this criticism grows out of the concern that biocentrism is an anti-human paradigm and that it will not hesitate to sacrifice human well-being for the greater good. Biocentrism has also been criticized for its individualism; emphasizing too much on the importance of individual life and neglecting the importance of collective groups, such as an ecosystem.\n\nA more complex form of criticism focuses on the contradictions of biocentrism. Opposed to anthropocentrism, which sees humans as having a higher status than other species, biocentrism puts humans on a par with the rest of nature, and not above it. In his essay \"A Critique of Anti-Anthropocentric Biocentrism\" Richard Watson suggests that if this is the case, then \"Human ways—human culture—and human actions are\nas natural as the ways in which any other species of animals behaves\". He goes on to suggest that if humans must change their behavior to refrain from disturbing and damaging the natural environment, then that results in setting humans apart from other species and assigning more power to them. This then takes us back to the basic beliefs of anthropocentrism. Watson also claims that the extinction of species is \"Nature's way\" and that if humans were to instigate their own self-destruction by exploiting the rest of nature, then so be it. Therefore, he suggests that the real reason humans should reduce their destructive behavior in relation to other species is not because we are equals but because the destruction of other species will also result in our own destruction. This view also brings us back to an anthropocentric perspective.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6685900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6685900", "title": "College Scholastic Ability Test (South Korea)", "text": "College Scholastic Ability Test (South Korea)\n\nCollege Scholastic Ability Test or CSAT (, ; also abbreviated as Suneung (, ) is a type of standardized test accepted by South Korean universities. It was made official in 1994. CSAT is managed by the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation (KICE).\nThe test is offered every November, but the exact dates may change annually. CSAT plays an important role in education in South Korea. It is commonly believed that the CSAT will determine which university the student will enter. CSAT is even described as 'the chance to make or break one's future.' Of the students taking the test, the percentage of re-takers is about 20%.\n\nOn the test day, the stock markets open late and buses and subways are increased to avoid traffic jams that could prevent students from getting to testing sites, and planes are grounded so the noise does not disturb the students. In some cases, students are also escorted by police officers. Younger students and the members of the students' families gather outside testing sites to cheer on the students.\n\nCSAT has been praised for its efficiency, meritocratic factors, and high international results.\n\nThe Preliminary College Scholastic Ability Test (PCSAT) is a preliminary examination for the CSAT that is hosted nationally. The relationship between PCSAT and CSAT is comparable to that of PSAT and SAT. PCSAT is divided into two categories: the National United Achievement Tests (NUAT) and the College Scholastic Ability Test Simulation (CSAT Simulation). These two tests have more similar sample groups to the CSAT than private mock tests do. Moreover, the PCSAT’s examiner committee is similar to that of the CSAT, so the types of questions resemble those seen in the CSAT. In particular, since the CSAT Simulation is hosted by the same institution as the CSAT, it is being used to predict the level of difficulty or the types of questions that might appear in the same year’s CSAT. \n\nAlthough both the NUAT and the CSAT Simulation are similar to the CSAT regarding the number of examinees, types of questions, and relative difficulty, the NUAT is hosted by the Ministry of Education targeting only high school students. On the other hand, the CSAT Simulation is run by KICE and can be applied for by anyone who is eligible for the CSAT. Nevertheless, both exams function as reliable, official mock tests for the CSAT and both are graded by KICE.\n\nThe National United Achievement Test (NUAT, ) is administered in the same way as the CSAT. It was first introduced in 2002 to alleviate the dependency on private mock tests. High school students in South Korea can apply for this test, and local offices of education decide whether the test is administered in the district. Normally, every office of education throughout the nation participates in the NUAT to prepare the students for the CSAT; hence, the number of applicants is almost parallel to that of the CSAT. Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, Busan Metropolitan Office of Education (for freshmen and sophomores), Gyeonggi-do Office of Education, and Incheon Office of Education take turns creating the questions. KICE is in charge of grading and printing the report cards.\n\nThe basic structure of this exam is identical to that of the CSAT. For mathematics, social studies, science, and second language, the range the exam covers is determined by when the exam is held. In the case of the Korean and English sections, the questions are not directly from textbooks but still constructed in consonance with the curriculum.\n\nAs of 2014, there are four NUAT a year; however, it is not same for every district, and some have only two exams a year for freshmen and sophomores. While the NUAT for freshmen and sophomores is held in March, June, September, and November, seniors take tests in March, April, July, and October to avoid overlapping with months when the CSAT Simulation is held (June and September). These two tests are appropriate for relative evaluations such as measuring average score, percentage, or ranks since the PCSAT has more similar sample groups to the CSAT than private mock tests do.\n\n\nThe College Scholastic Ability Test Simulation (CSAT Simulation, ) is hosted by KICE, and unlike the NUAT, anyone who is eligible for the CSAT can also apply for this test. The CSAT Simulation was introduced after the CSAT failed to set the proper difficulty level in 2001 and 2002. It was first implemented in 2002, and during its early years, it was held only once a year, in September. Starting from 2004, it is being held twice a year, every June and September. The exam covers everything in the curriculum for the Korean and second language sections; for other sections, two-thirds of what the CSAT covers. However, the September exam covers everything in every section just like the CSAT. \nThe number of questions and test time per section is same as those of the CSAT.\n\nSince the Liberation of Korea, South Korea has changed the methods of university and college admission at least twelve times. Some argue the number of changes can be extended to sixteen. The policies ranged from sometimes allowing colleges to choose on their own to outlawing hagwons. Because of this, parents and students had difficult times in adjusting to the changes. Some argue that the constant changes show an instability of the system as well as the sensitivity of the admission process to public opinion.\n\nThe very first methods of university and college admissions were left to the choice of the university. Each university was allowed to do as they like. The first form of CSAT appeared in the beginnings of 1960. The Supreme Council for National Reconstruction established an early form of CSAT from 1962 to 1963. It served as a qualification test for the students. However, due the small number of students passing the tests, the colleges soon had a shortage of students. The process was also criticized to have led to an inefficient selection of students, Due to this, the government scrapped the policy from 1964 to 1968. A similar policy was adopted in 1969 by the Third Republic of South Korea. The new test was called \"Preliminary College Entrance Examination\" (대학입학예비고사). This policy continued mostly unchanged until 1981.\n\nIn 1981, the policy was significantly changed. The test name was changed to \"Preliminary College Preparations Examination\" (대학예비고사). The cutline policy was scrapped. At this time, hagwons, or cram schools, were also outlawed. In 1982, the test name was changed to \"College Entrance Strength Test\" (대입학력고사).\n\nThe current system of CSAT was established in 1994, although it went through several revisions since then. In 2004, the government of South Korea introduced a policy called '2008 College Admissions Change Proposal' but failed to bring about significant changes.\n\nThe test material is based on nation-standard textbooks and designed to prompt thinking skills. KICE is officially in charge of making the problems, printing the tests, correcting the tests, supervising the test-making processes, setting the test fee, and admitting the tests. The problems are created by members of the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation, university-level professors, and high-school teachers. There are two groups involved with making the problems, the 'creating problems' group and 'checking over the problems' group. The former group is mainly made out of professors, though high-school teachers have been included in the group since the year 2000. The latter group is composed only of high-school teachers. Those involved in making the problems sign non-disclosure agreement directly with the KICE. As of 2012, there were a total of 696 staff members involved in making the problems. A member of the problem-making group is paid around $300 per day.\n\nThe subjects of 2016 were: National Language, Mathematics, English language, Korean History, Social Studies/Science/Vocational Education, and Foreign language/Hanja. Students can choose from all or some of the subjects. The subjects Mathematics is also divided into type Ga(가) and type Na(나). Students can choose from which test to take.\n\nKorean History is Required subject, and if students do not take it, all the scores will be invalid.\n\nThe subject Social Studies is further divided into Life and Ethics, Ethics and Thought, Geography of Korea, Geography of the world, History of Eastern Asia, World History, Law and Politics, Society and Culture, and Economics. Students can choose two subjects out of those. In the Science section, students can choose from Physics 1, Chemistry 1, Biology 1, Earth Science 1, Physics 2, Chemistry 2, Biology 2, and Earth Science 2. Students can choose two subjects out of those. Vocational Education is divided to Agricultural Science, Industry, Commerce, Oceanography, and Home Economics. Students must choose one subject. However, the subject Vocational Education can only be taken if the student had completed 80% of the expert studies. Foreign Language is divided into German language 1, French language 1, Spanish language 1, Chinese language 1, Japanese language 1, Russian language 1, Arabic language 1, basic Vietnamese language, and Hanja 1. Students can choose one subject.\n\nAfter the test, the administrators gather the test, scan the image, and correct the test. The correction of the test, including confirming the documentations and the grades, and printing of the results take around a month\n\nThe test is taken extremely seriously and other day-to-day operations are grounded and delayed on the test day. Neither the students nor the administrators of the test could bring in cell phones, books, newspapers, foods, or any material that could distract the other test-takers in any way. Most of the complaints after the test had been involved the actions of the administrators, involving: talking, opening the windows, standing in front of their particular desks, sniffle, clicking a computer mouse, and eating chocolate. Test administrators are warned to not do anything that could distract the student in any way.\n\nListening components during the day of the test will also be broadcast nationwide at 1:10pm on EBS Radio. During these broadcasts, all flights will be grounded, and the general public is advised not to be alarmed by the changes in radio programming on EBS Radio since the programmes during the day of the test are subject to change.\n\nPressure to perform well on the CSAT has been linked to stress, psychological depression and suicide.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12150337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12150337", "title": "Criticism of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report", "text": "Criticism of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report\n\nThe IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) is a report on climate change created with the help of a large number of contributors, both scientists and governmental representatives. There has been considerable political controversy over a small number of errors found in the report, and there have been calls for review of the process used to formulate the report. The overwhelming majority view of scientists with expertise in climate change is that errors, when found, are corrected, and the issues as identified do not undermine the conclusions of the report that the climate system is warming in response to increased levels of greenhouse gases, largely due to human activities.\n\nSome observers have identified issues in which the peer-reviewed science suggests outcomes more severe than outlined by the report, while other observers have said that some conclusions in the report are not satisfactorily supported by the peer-reviewed science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have acknowledged that a paragraph in the WGII report on the projected date of melting of Himalayan glaciers is incorrect. Climate expert Martin Parry, who had been co-chair of the working group on impacts for IPCC AR4, stated that \"What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance\". The IPCC had investigated other alleged mistakes, which were \"generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment\", and were commonly based on the mistaken idea that the IPCC could not use grey literature such as reports from campaign groups and governments.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic Sea ice is melting faster than predicted by climate models. The study concludes that the 18 models on which the IPCC has based its current recommendations could already be out of date, and that the retreat of the ice could already be 30 years ahead of the IPCC's worst-case scenario, possibly leading to an ice-free summer Arctic before the end of the 21st century.\n\nThe IPCC AR4 estimates explicitly exclude the influence of the melting of ice sheets. These ice sheets include most notably the Greenland ice sheet, and both the east and west Antarctic ice sheets, as well as numerous glaciers. This may result in a major underestimate of the upper limit for sea level rise in the long term. Due to Arctic melting the Greenland ice sheet is particularly vulnerable, and a study by climatologist James E. Hansen states that \"we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.\", the melting of the Greenland ice sheet would result in an increase in sea level rise of over 7m. Melting of the west Antarctic ice sheet would cause a similar, if slightly smaller rise in sea levels due to being grounded below sea level, whilst the effect of the melting of the east Antarctic, although less probable would be an order of magnitude greater.\n\nIn a lecture he gave at the University of California, Santa Barbara, James E. Hansen criticised the IPCC for its description of future sea level rise. Hansen has also written on this issue:\n\nThe IPCC [Working Group I] (2007) midrange projection for sea level rise this century is 20–43 cm (8–17 inches) and its full range is 18– 59 cm (7–23 inches). The IPCC notes that they are unable to evaluate possible dynamical responses of the ice sheets, and thus do not include any possible ‘rapid dynamical changes in ice flow’. Yet the provision of such specific numbers for sea level rise encourages a predictable public response that the projected sea level change is moderate, and smaller than in IPCC (2001). Indeed, there have been numerous media reports of ‘reduced’ sea level rise predictions, and commentators have denigrated suggestions that business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions may cause a sea level rise of the order of meters\n\n[...] The IPCC is doing a commendable job, but we need something more. Given the reticence that the IPCC necessarily exhibits, there need to be supplementary mechanisms. The onus, it seems to me, falls on us scientists as a community.\n\nIn a lecture given at Princeton University, IPCC author Michael Oppenheimer admitted that the IPCC report could have better explained the contribution of melting ice sheets in predictions of sea level rise. Oppenheimer said that the IPCC Working Group II Summary for Policymakers (quoted below) managed this better than the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers:\n\nThere is medium confidence [about 5/10 chance of being correct] that at least partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheet, would occur over a period of time ranging from centuries to millennia for a global average temperature increase of 1-4°C (relative to 1990–2000), causing a contribution to sea-level rise of 4-6 m or more.\n\nA paragraph in the 938-page 2007 Working Group II report (WGII) included a projection that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers which highlighted the importance of the glaciers for freshwater availability, and stated that \"Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century\". Late in 2009, in the approach to the Copenhagen climate summit, the 2035 date was strongly questioned in India. On 19 January 2010 the IPCC acknowledged that the paragraph was incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust. They expressed regret for \"the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance\" and their vice-chairman Jean-Pascal van Ypersele said that the reviewing procedures would have to be tightened.\n\nThe WGII report (\"Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\"), chapter 10, page 493, includes this paragraph:\n\nThere was controversy in India over this statement, and at the start of December 2009 J. Graham Cogley of Trent University, Ontario, described the paragraph as wildly inaccurate. The rates of recession of Himalayan glaciers were exceptional, but their disappearance by 2035 would require a huge acceleration in rate. The first sentence of the IPCC WGII report, including the date of 2035, came from the cited source, \"(WWF, 2005)\". This was a March 2005 World Wildlife Fund Nepal Program report, page 29:\n\nOn page 2, the WWF report cited an article in the 5 June 1999 issue of \"New Scientist\" which quoted Syed Hasnain, Chairman of the International Commission for Snow and Ice (ICSI), saying that most of the glaciers in the Himalayan region \"will vanish within 40 years as a result of global warming\". That article was based on an email interview, and says that \"Hasnain's four-year study indicates that all the glaciers in the central and eastern Himalayas could disappear by 2035 at their present rate of decline.\" Both the article and the WWF report referred to Hasnain's unpublished 1999 ICSI study, \"Report on Himalayan Glaciology\", which does not estimate a date for the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers.\n\nThe second sentence of the questionable WGII paragraph which states \"Its total area will likely shrink from the present 500,000 to 100,000 km by the year 2035\" could not refer to the Himalayan glaciers, which cover about 33,000 km. Cogley said that a bibliographic search indicated that it had been copied inaccurately from a 1996 International Hydrological Programme (IHP) report by Kotlyakov, published by UNESCO, which gave a rough estimate of shrinkage of the world's total area of glaciers and ice caps by 2350.<ref name=\"Science/AAAS 924-925\"></ref>\n\nCogley suggested that the \"2035\" figure in the second sentence of the WGII paragraph was apparently a typographic error. He concluded, \"This was a bad error. It was a really bad paragraph, and poses a legitimate question about how to improve IPCC’s review process. It was not a conspiracy. The error does not compromise the IPCC Fourth Assessment, which for the most part was well reviewed and is\nhighly accurate.\"\n\nStatements very similar to those made in both sentences of the WGII paragraph appeared as two successive paragraphs in an April 1999 article in \"Down to Earth \", published in the India Environment Portal (IEP). This included the substitution of 2035 for 2350 as stated in the IHP study. \"New Scientist\" has drawn attention to Hasnain's claim about the timing of glaciers disappearing:\n\nThe question of whether it was acceptable to use material which had not been peer reviewed has been disputed. IPCC rules permit the use of non-peer-reviewed material, subject to a procedure in which authors are to critically assess any source that they wish to include, and \"each chapter team should review the quality and validity of each source before incorporating results from the source into an IPCC Report.\"\n\nThe official statement issued by the IPCC on 20 January 2010 noted that \"a paragraph in the 938-page Working Group II contribution to the underlying assessment refers to poorly substantiated estimates of rate of recession and date for the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers. In drafting the paragraph in question, the clear and well-established standards of evidence, required by the IPCC procedures, were not applied properly.\" It emphasised that the paragraph did not affect the conclusion in the final summary for policymakers in the 2007 report, which it described as \"robust, appropriate, and entirely consistent with the underlying science and the broader IPCC assessment\", and reaffirmed a commitment to absolute adherence to the IPCC standards. The IPCC also stated that it did not change the broad picture of man-made climate change. This was confirmed by Wilfried Haeberli, who announced the latest annual results of the World Glacier Monitoring Service. He stated that the important trend of 10 years or so showed \"an unbroken acceleration in melting\" and on expected trends, many glaciers will disappear by mid century. Glaciers in lower mountain ranges were the most vulnerable, and while those in the Himalayas and Alaska could grow in the short term, in a realistic mid-range warming scenario they would not last many centuries. Mojib Latif, a climate scientist who contributed to the report of Working Group 1, sees the consequences of the glacier data mistake but also the need to continue focusing on global warming.\n\nChapter 9 of the Working Group II report states that \"In other countries, additional risks that could be exacerbated by climate change include greater erosion, deficiencies in yields from rain-fed agriculture of up to 50% during the 2000–2020 period, and reductions in crop growth period (Agoumi, 2003).\" This claim was also included in the AR4 Synthesis Report, and has been mentioned in speeches by IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. The source cited in the report for this claim is a non-peer reviewed policy paper published by International Institute for Sustainable Development, a Canadian think tank. Chris Field, the new lead author of the IPCC's climate impacts team, questioned the claim, telling the Sunday Times that \"I was not an author on the Synthesis Report but on reading it I cannot find support for the statement about African crop yield declines\". Former IPCC chairman Robert Watson said \"Any such projection should be based on peer-reviewed literature from computer modelling of how agricultural yields would respond to climate change. I can see no such data supporting the IPCC report.\"\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency used the IPCC report on this point, and received criticism that because of the nature of the source, they should not have done so. The EPA rebutted this criticism, noting that \"The IPCC statement cites a report by Dr. Ali Agoumi... These vulnerability studies were prepared under the U.N. Environment Programme Global Environment Fund and included in the National Communications of these three countries to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (Ministry of Territory Development and Environment, 2001, Kingdom of Morocco, 2001 and Republic of Tunisia, 2001)... Dr. Coleen Vogel, a contributing lead author of the IPCC chapter on Africa impacts... explained that Agoumi’s report received rigorous scrutiny by her fellow authors and was thoroughly discussed during development of the chapter... The process described by Dr. Vogel is consistent with the IPCC’s guidance on the use of gray literature\".\n\nThe Working Group II: Impacts, Adaption and Vulnerability report states that \"The Netherlands is an example of a country highly susceptible to both sea-level rise and river flooding because 55% of its territory is below sea level\". This was based on data it had received from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (the PBL). When the Dutch government raised questions, the PBL acknowledged in a statement that it had supplied the incorrect wording to the IPCC, \"This should have read that 55 per cent of the Netherlands is at risk of flooding; 26 per cent of the country is below sea level, and 29 per cent is susceptible to river flooding.\" It used Normaal Amsterdams Peil as the datum for sea level. Martin Parry, climate expert and co-chair of the IPCC working group II, said that various different figures could have been used, depending on how the issue was defined. A figure of 60%, for land that lies below high water level during storms, is used by the Dutch Ministry of Transport, while a figure of 30%, referring to land below mean sea level, is used by others.\n\n\"De Volkskrant\" reported Mary Jean Burer, a spokesperson for the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) as saying that the confusion can partly be blamed on several EU articles by the Transport Ministry in which numbers like 55 and 60 percent land area are mixed up. \"Sometimes it refers to floods, sometimes the sea level\". PBL employee Oude Lohuis added that the IPCC cannot be blamed for the fact that the statement of 55% being below sea level wasn't noticed. \"The ministry says in some brochures that during spring tides the Netherlands is 60 % below sea level\", he said, \"So for outsiders it's not a strange number\"\n\nRichard Black, an environmental reporter for the \"BBC\", once observed that the IPCC is an unusual organisation in that the evidence is supplied by scientists, but the summaries of its reports are agreed between scientists and representatives of governments.\n\nIn January 2005, Dr. Chris Landsea who had been an author on the 2001 report (TAR), withdrew his participation in the Fourth Assessment Report claiming that the portion of the IPCC to which he contributed had become \"politicized\" and that the IPCC leadership simply dismissed his concerns. He published an open letter explaining why he was resigning and to \"bring awareness to what I view as a problem in the IPCC process\".\n\nLandsea alleged that lead author Kevin Trenberth had told a press conference that global warming was contributing to \"recent hurricane activity\", which Landsea described as a \"misrepresentation of climate science while invoking the authority of the IPCC\". He said that the process of producing the Fourth Assessment Report is \"motivated by pre-conceived agendas\" and \"scientifically unsound\". Landsea wrote that \"the IPCC leadership said that Dr. Trenberth was speaking as an individual even though he was introduced in the press conference as an IPCC lead author.\"\n\nThe 2007 IPCC Working Group I Report quantified the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on the climate in terms of their radiative forcing. Radiative forcing measures the influence a particular factor has on changing the Earth-atmosphere-system energy balance. The effect of aerosols was assessed to be the dominant uncertainty in radiative forcing.\n\nA 2008 Report for the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) suggested that the IPCC report may have been 'overconfident' with its uncertainty estimate for the total aerosol forcing. This was based on an earlier 2006 paper that elicitated the judgment of twenty-four experts on aerosol forcing. The CCSP Report went on to say:\n\n[...] expert judgment is not a substitute for definitive scientific research. Nor is it a substitute for careful deliberative expert reviews of the literature of the sort undertaken by the IPCC. However, its use within such review processes could enable a better expression of the diversity of expert judgment and allow more formal expression of expert judgments, which are not adequately reflected, in the existing literature. It can also provide insights for policy makers and research planners while research to produce more definitive results is ongoing. It is for these reasons that Moss and Schneider have argued that such elicitations should become a standard input to the IPCC assessment process\n\nIn 2007, economist and former IPCC author Richard Tol wrote a paper on the IPCC Working Group III Report. Tol said that the quality of the Working Group III Report had declined. He made several criticisms of the Report's content, and suggested changes in procedure that could improve the quality of future IPCC assessments:\n\nIt would be much better to shift the IPCC from UNEP and the environment ministries to ICSU and the ministries of research and higher education. Academic quality should be guiding principle in selecting authors. As a check, the committees that nominate and select authors should publish their proceedings. The review editors should become more independent, and gain the right to reject chapters that are not properly revised. The alternative is a gradual erosion of the quality, prestige and, eventually, influence of the IPCC.\n\nThe report was also criticized by \"The Sunday Telegraph\" for using grey literature. Examples they gave included the use of non-peer reviewed sources from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the World Wildlife Fund, and student dissertations. IPCC rules permit the use of non-peer-reviewed material, subject to critical assessment and review of the quality and validity of each source. Climate expert Martin Parry, who had been co-chair of the working group on impacts for IPCC AR4, said of \"grey literature\" such as reports from campaign groups and governments that \"many such reports are intensively reviewed, both internally and externally. Even if not peer-reviewed, there are reports that contain valuable information.\"\n\nThe focus by the media on errors found in the Fourth Assessment Report resulted in a number of responses from the scientific community.\n\nOn February 2010 the International Council for Science (ICSU) released a statement indicating that \"in proportion to the sheer volume of the research reviewed and analyzed, these lapses of accuracy are minor and they in no way undermine the main conclusions\" and \"That these errors have resulted in attempts to discredit the main conclusions of the report, accusations of scientific conspiracies, and personal attacks on scientists is unacceptable\".\n\nOn March 12, 2010, an open letter was released signed by Gary Yohe, Stephen Schneider and Cynthia E. Rosenzweig along with 249 other scientists, the vast majority of whom were climate change scientists working at leading U.S. universities, including both IPCC and non-IPCC authors. The opening of the letter stated:\n\nTwo months later on May 6, 2010, another open letter from 255 members of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences including 11 Nobel laureates stated that they were \"deeply disturbed by the recent escalation of political assaults on scientists in general and on climate scientists in particular\". They outlined scientific methodology and the conclusions of climate science, in contrast to \"recent assaults on climate science and, more disturbingly, on climate scientists by climate change deniers.\" Regarding the mistakes found in the report, the letter expressed:\n\nOn July, 2010, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency put forward a publication stating that it had \"found no errors that would undermine the main conclusions in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on possible future regional impacts of climate change\". Among the key findings the publication mentions:\n\n"}

The complementary processcreating a message for transmission to an addresseeis called encoding.\n\nAll communication depends on the use of codes. When the message is received, the addressee is not passive, but decoding is more than simply recognising the content of the message. Over time, each individual in the audience develops a cognitive framework of codes which will recall the denotative meaning and suggest possible connotative meanings for each signifier. But the actual meaning for each message is context-dependent: the codified relations between the signifiers in the particular context must be interpreted according to the syntactic, semantic and social codes so that the most appropriate meaning is attributed (for labelling usages by reference to national characteristics, see Americanism).\n\nAlthough the addresser may have a very clearly defined intention when encoding and wish to manipulate the audience into accepting the preferred meaning, the reality is not that of textual determinism. What is decoded does not follow inevitably from an interpretation of the message. Not infrequently, the addressees find different levels of meaning. Umberto Eco called this mismatch between the intended meaning and interpreted meaning aberrant decoding. This apparent failure of communication may result from the fact that the parties use different codes because they are of a different social class or because they have different training or ability, because they have different world views or ideologies, or because they are from different cultures. David Morley argues that the outcome of decoding will be influenced by pragmatic issues, i.e. whether: \nFurther, Umberto Eco suggests a distinction between \"closed\" texts which predispose a dominant interpretation and more \"open\" texts which may have latent meanings or be encoded in a way that encourages the possibility of alternative interpretations.\n\n"}

He is Honorary Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney, and has held visiting appointments at Sidney Sussex College and King's College, Cambridge, the Centre for History and Economics, Cambridge, Queen Mary University of London, and the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. Professor Moggach has also held the University Research Chair in Political Thought at the University of Ottawa and the Killam Research Fellowship awarded by the Canada Council for the arts. He was named Distinguished University Professor at University of Ottawa in 2011.\n\nDouglas Moggach has written on Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Hegel, Friedrich Schiller, Bruno Bauer, aesthetics, Republicanism, and history of ancient and modern political thought.\n\nMoggach's research falls into three principal areas: analysis of the philosophy, politics, and economic thought of the Hegelian School; the historical development of German idealism from Leibniz to Hegel; and aesthetics and politics. His archival research led to the discovery and publication of lost texts by Bruno Bauer, a leading figure in the Hegelian School of the 1830s and 1840s. Moggach argues that the political thinking of the German Hegelians represents a specific variant of republicanism, which recognizes modern social diversity and alienation. His works in German Idealism have focused on the foundational importance of Leibniz for Kant and Hegel, and trace the origins of Kant's juridical thought in the German Enlightenment debates about freedom, perfection, and state economic direction. Moggach has also published on aesthetics and politics, notably on Schiller and Bauer, developing the concept of an aesthetic republicanism based on an aesthetic version of Kant's moral idea of autonomy. Moggach also traces the relations between German idealism and various strands of Romanticism, and contributes to conceptions of universality, freedom and republicanism in European political thought. Moggach wrote the chapter on Marx in The Impact of Idealism, ed. N. Boyle and J. Walker, vol. 2 (CUP 2013), and the chapter on Romantic Political Thought in Oxford Companion to European Romanticism, ed. P. Hamilton (OUP, 2016).\n\nMoggach discovered an unpublished manuscript by Bruno Bauer, which had been awarded the Prussian Royal Prize in philosophy by a panel headed by Hegel in 1829. This manuscript, written in Latin, is held in the archives of the Humboldt Universität, Berlin, but had not been recognized before. Moggach shows how after attending Hegel's lectures on logic in 1828, Bauer applies this logic to the categories of aesthetic judgement that Kant had developed in his Third Critique. Starting from the Hegelian premise of the unity of thought and being, Bauer wants to show that the separation of subject and object in Kant's Critiques of Pure and of Practical Reason remains a feature of the Critique of Judgement. Bauer argues that Kant does make efforts to bridge the gap, and he opens the path that Hegel will follow, but Kant does not finally succeed in this objective. What prevents him from succeeding is his faulty treatment of the categories involved in making aesthetic judgements. Moggach thinks that in this early text Bauer also lays the foundations for his later theory of infinite self-consciousness, and for his specific type of ethical and historical idealism.\n\nMoggach's book, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer (CUP, 2003) traces the emergence of German republicanism from philosophical and religious polemics of the 1830s and 1840s, its relation to Kant and Hegel, and its assessment of political and economic change. This work was short-listed for the 2004 C.B. Macpherson Prize, awarded by the Canadian Political Science Association. It was reviewed by Frederick Beiser in Times Literary Supplement, 24 September 2004; Choice, Nov. 2004; and other journals.\n\nMoggach's edited volume, The New Hegelians (CUP, 2006), is intended to show that after Hegel's death in 1831, members of his school developed his philosophy in new directions in order to understand the evolution of modern society, along with the modern state and economy. The Hegelians were not mere imitators of their teacher, but creative thinkers about modernity and its problems, especially social cohesion and the conflict of individual interests. According to Moggach, many of these New or Young Hegelians found a solution to these conflicts in republican ideas of virtue, rethought so that they are compatible with modern institutions. Moggach applies the idea of republican rigorism, introduced by other historians of political thought, to outline these solutions. For the Hegelians, this concept involves changing the boundaries between morality and legality that Kant had established. Kant had claimed that the legal sphere concerns the external aspects of action alone, but not its motivating principles or maxims. For the Hegelians, though, political action has to promote, or at least not hinder, the external freedom of others, but it must also have the right kinds of internal ethical motivation: this means not acting from private interest, but from an idea of the general good. In this way Kant's idea of autonomy is related to political as well as moral action, and to republican ideas of freedom as non domination.\n\nIn a subsequent edited volume, Politics, Religion, and Art: Hegelian Debates (Northwestern UP, 2011), Moggach and his colleagues continue to establish the importance of the Hegelians of the 1830's and 1840's as innovators in theology, aesthetics, and ethics, and as creative contributors to foundational debates about modernity, state, and society. The political significance of religious and aesthetic debates, and the German contributions to republican political thought, receive further attention in this volume, which also draws heavily on archival material.\n\nMoggach, Beiser, and other interlocutors debated Schiller's republicanism in a special issue of Inquiry (2008). Moggach produced a critical discussion of multiculturalism, in a published conversation with Charles Taylor, Jeremy Waldron, James Tully, and others.\n\nSelected Books\n\n"}

{"id": "8447322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8447322", "title": "Evolution as fact and theory", "text": "Evolution as fact and theory\n\nMany scientists and philosophers of science have described evolution as fact and theory, a phrase which was used as the title of an article by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould in 1981. He describes \"fact\" in science as meaning data, not absolute certainty but \"confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent\". A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of evolution come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical common descent, and from transitions in the fossil record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts.\n\nEach of the words \"evolution\", \"fact\" and \"theory\" has several meanings in different contexts. \"Evolution\" means change over time, as in stellar evolution. In biology it refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in gene frequency over time; it can also refer to explanatory theories (such as Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection) which explain the mechanisms of evolution. To a scientist, \"fact\" can describe a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can refer to something that is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; and it can also refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public, \"theory\" can mean an opinion or conjecture (\"e.g.\", \"it's only a theory\"), but among scientists it has a much stronger connotation of \"well-substantiated explanation\". With this number of choices, people can often talk past each other, and meanings become the subject of linguistic analysis.\n\nEvidence for evolution continues to be accumulated and tested. The scientific literature includes statements by evolutionary biologists and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.\n\nEvolution has been described as \"fact and theory\"; \"fact, not theory\"; \"only a theory, not a fact\"; \"multiple theories, not fact\"; and \"neither fact, nor theory.\" The disagreements among these statements, however, have more to do with the meaning of words than the substantial issues and this controversy is discussed below.\n\nProfessor of biology Jerry Coyne sums up biological evolution succinctly:\n\nThis shows the breadth and scope of the issue, incorporating the scientific fields of zoology, botany, genetics, geology, and paleontology, among many others.\n\nBut the central core of evolution is generally defined as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next. This has been dubbed the standard genetic definition of evolution. Natural selection is only one of several mechanisms in the theory of evolutionary change that explains how organisms historically adapt to changing environments. The principles of heredity were re-discovered in 1900, after Darwin's death, in Gregor Mendel's research on the inheritance of simple trait variations in peas. Subsequent work into genetics, mutation, paleontology, and developmental biology expanded the applicability and scope of Darwin's original theory.\n\nAccording to Douglas J. Futuyma:\n\nThe word \"evolution\" in a broad sense refers to processes of change, from stellar evolution to changes in language. In biology, the meaning is more specific: heritable changes which accumulate over generations of a population. Individual organisms do not evolve in their lifetimes, but variations in the genes they inherit can become more or less common in the population of organisms. Any changes during the lifetime of organisms which are not inherited by their offspring are not part of biological evolution.\n\nTo Keith Stewart Thomson, the word evolution has at least three distinct meanings:\n\nThomson remarks: \"Change over time is a fact, and descent from common ancestors is based on such unassailable logic that we act as though it is a fact. Natural selection provides the outline of an explanatory theory.\"\n\nBiologists consider it to be a scientific fact that evolution has occurred in that modern organisms differ from past forms, and evolution is still occurring with discernible differences between organisms and their descendants. There is such strong quantitative support for the second that scientists regard common descent as being as factual as the understanding that in the Solar System the Earth orbits the Sun, although the examination of the fundamentals of these processes is still in progress. There are several theories about the mechanisms of evolution, and there are still active debates about specific mechanisms.\n\nThere is a fourth meaning for the word \"evolution\" that is \"not\" used by biologists today. In 1857, the philosopher Herbert Spencer defined it as \"change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.\" He claimed (before Darwin) that this was \"settled beyond dispute\" for organic evolution and applied it to the evolution of star systems, geology and human society. Even Spencer by 1865 was admitting that his definition was imperfect, but it remained popular throughout the nineteenth century before declining under the criticisms of William James and others.\n\nFact is often used by scientists to refer to experimental or empirical data or objective verifiable observations. \"Fact\" is also used in a wider sense to mean any theory for which there is overwhelming evidence.\n\nIn the sense that evolution is overwhelmingly validated by the evidence, it is a fact. It is frequently said to be a fact in the same way as the Earth's revolution around the Sun is a fact. The following quotation from Hermann Joseph Muller's article, \"One Hundred Years Without Darwinism Are Enough,\" explains the point.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) makes a similar point:\n\nStephen Jay Gould also points out that \"Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory—natural selection—to explain the mechanism of evolution.\" These two aspects are frequently confused. Scientists continue to argue about particular explanations or mechanisms at work in specific instances of evolution – but the fact that evolution has occurred, and is still occurring, is undisputed.\n\nA common misconception is that evolution cannot be reliably observed because it all happened millions of years ago and the science therefore is not dependent on facts (in the initial sense above). However, both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-founders of the theory, and all subsequent biologists depend primarily on observations of living organisms; Darwin concentrated largely on the breeding of domesticated animals whereas Wallace started from the biogeographical distribution of species in the Amazon and Malay Archipelago. In the early twentieth century, population genetics had centre stage, and more recently DNA has become the main focus of observation and experimentation.\n\nPhilosophers of science argue that we do not know mind-independent empirical truths with absolute certainty: even direct observations may be \"theory laden\" and depend on assumptions about our senses and the measuring instruments used. In this sense all facts are provisional.\n\nThe scientific definition of the word \"theory\" is different from the definition of the word in colloquial use. In the vernacular, \"theory\" can refer to guesswork, a simple conjecture, an opinion, or a speculation that does not have to be based on facts and need not be framed for making testable predictions.\n\nIn science, however, the meaning of theory is more rigorous. A scientific theory is \"a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses.\" Theories are formed from hypotheses that have been subjected repeatedly to tests of evidence which attempt to disprove or falsify them. In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859.\n\nThe \"theory of evolution\" is actually a network of theories that created the research program of biology. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories in his original formulation, which included mechanistic explanations for:\nSince Darwin, evolution has become a well-supported body of interconnected statements that explains numerous empirical observations in the natural world. Evolutionary theories continue to generate testable predictions and explanations about living and fossilized organisms.\n\nPhylogenetic theory is an example of evolutionary theory. It is based on the evolutionary premise of an ancestral descendant sequence of genes, populations, or species. Individuals that evolve are linked together through historical and genealogical ties. Evolutionary trees are hypotheses that are inferred through the practice of phylogenetic theory. They depict relations among individuals that can speciate and diverge from one another. The evolutionary process of speciation creates groups that are linked by a common ancestor and all its descendants. Species inherit traits, which are then passed on to descendants. Evolutionary biologists use systematic methods and test phylogenetic theory to and explain changes in and among species over time. These methods include the collection, measurement, observation, and mapping of traits onto evolutionary trees. Phylogenetic theory is used to test the independent distributions of traits and their various forms to provide explanations of observed patterns in relation to their evolutionary history and biology. The neutral theory of molecular evolution is used to study evolution as a null model against which tests for natural selection can be applied.\n\nThe following sections provide specific quotable references from evolutionary biologists and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.\n\n\n\"Fact\" is commonly used to refer to the observable changes in organisms' traits over generations while the word \"theory\" is reserved for the mechanisms that cause these changes:\n\n\nOther commentators – focusing on the changes in species over generations and in some cases common ancestry – have stressed, in order to emphasize the weight of supporting evidence, that evolution is a fact, arguing that the use of the term \"theory\" is not useful:\n\nEvolutionary biologist Kirk J. Fitzhugh writes that scientists must be cautious to \"carefully and correctly\" describe the nature of scientific investigation at a time when evolutionary biology is under attack from creationists and proponents of intelligent design. Fitzhugh writes that while facts are states of being in nature, theories represent efforts to connect those states of being by causal relationships:\n\nEvolution' cannot be both a theory and a fact. Theories are concepts stating cause–effect relations. Regardless of one's certainty as to the utility of a theory to provide understanding, it would be epistemically incorrect to assert any theory as also being a fact, given that theories are not objects to be discerned by their state of being.\"\n\nFitzhugh recognizes that the \"theory\" versus \"fact\" debate is one of semantics. He nevertheless contends that referring to evolution as a \"fact\" is technically incorrect and distracts from the primary \"goal of science, which is to continually acquire causal understanding through the critical evaluation of our theories and hypotheses.\" Fitzhugh concludes that the \"certainty\" of evolution \"provides no basis for elevating any evolutionary theory or hypothesis to the level of fact.\"\n\nDr William C. Robertson writing for National Science Teachers Association writes, \"I have heard too many scientists claim that evolution is a fact, often in retort to the claim that it is just a theory. Evolution isn’t a fact. Rather than claiming so, I think scientists would be better served to agree that evolution is a theory and then proceed to explain what a theory is -- a coherent explanation that undergoes constant testing and often revision over a period of time.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1157333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1157333", "title": "Evolutionary medicine", "text": "Evolutionary medicine\n\nEvolutionary medicine or Darwinian medicine is the application of modern evolutionary theory to understanding health and disease. Modern medical research and practice have focused on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying health and disease, while evolutionary medicine focuses on the question of why evolution has shaped these mechanisms in ways that may leave us susceptible to disease. The evolutionary approach has driven important advances in our understanding of cancer, autoimmune disease, and anatomy. Medical schools have been slower to integrate evolutionary approaches because of limitations on what can be added to existing medical curricula.\n\nUtilizing the Delphi method, 56 experts from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, medicine, and biology agreed upon 14 core principles intrinsic to the education and practice of evolutionary medicine. These 14 principles can be further grouped into five general categories: question framing, evolution I and II (with II involving a higher level of complexity), evolutionary trade-offs, reasons for vulnerability, and culture. Additional information regarding these principles may be found in the table below.\nAdaptation works within constraints, makes compromises and trade-offs, and occurs in the context of different forms of competition.\n\nAdaptations can only occur if they are evolvable. Some adaptations which would prevent ill health are therefore not possible.\nOther constraints occur as the byproduct of adaptive innovations.\n\nOne constraint upon selection is that different adaptations can conflict, which requires a compromise between them to ensure an optimal cost-benefit tradeoff.\n\nDifferent forms of competition exist and these can shape the processes of genetic change.\n\nHumans evolved to live as simple hunter-gatherers in small tribal bands. Contemporary humans now have a very different environment and way of life. This change makes present humans vulnerable to a number of health problems, termed \"diseases of civilization\" and \"diseases of affluence\". Stone-age humans evolved to live off the land, taking advantage of the resources that were readily available to them. Evolution is slow, and the rapid change from stone-age environments and practices to the world of today is problematic because we are still adapted to stone-age circumstances that no longer apply. This misfit has serious implications for our health. \"Modern environments may cause many diseases such as deficiency syndromes like scurvy and rickets\".)\n\nIn contrast to the diet of early hunter-gatherers, the modern Western diet often contains high quantities of fat, salt, and simple carbohydrates, such as refined sugars and flours. These relatively sudden dietary changes create health problems.\n\nExamples of aging-associated diseases are atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, cataracts, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. The incidence of all of these diseases increases rapidly with aging (increases exponentially with age, in the case of cancer). \nOf the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.<ref name=\"doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011\"></ref> In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.\n\nMany contemporary humans engage in little physical exercise compared to the physically active lifestyles of ancestral hunter-gatherers. Prolonged periods of inactivity may have only occurred in early humans following illness or injury, so a modern sedentary lifestyle may continuously cue the body to trigger life preserving metabolic and stress-related responses such as inflammation, and some theorize that this causes chronic diseases.\n\nContemporary humans in developed countries are mostly free of parasites, particularly intestinal ones. This is largely due to frequent washing of clothing and the body, and improved sanitation. Although such hygiene can be very important when it comes to maintaining good health, it can be problematic for the proper development of the immune system. The hygiene hypothesis is that humans evolved to be dependent on certain microorganisms that help establish the immune system, and modern hygiene practices can prevent necessary exposure to these microorganisms. \"Microorganisms and macroorganisms such as helminths from mud, animals, and feces play a critical role in driving immunoregulation\" (Rook, 2012). Essential microorganisms play a crucial role in building and training immune functions that fight off and repel some diseases, and protect against excessive inflammation, which has been implicated in several diseases. For instance, recent studies have found evidence supporting inflammation as a contributing factor in Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThis is a partial list: all links here go to a section describing or debating its evolutionary origin.\n\nAs noted in the table below, adaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies with evolutionary perspectives on medicine and physiological dysfunctions (see in particular, Randy Nesse and George C. Williams' book \"Why We Get Sick\").\nEvolutionary psychiatrists and psychologists suggest that some mental disorders likely have multiple causes.\n\nSee several topic areas, and the associated references, below.\n\nCharles Darwin did not discuss the implications of his work for medicine, though biologists quickly appreciated the germ theory of disease and its implications for understanding the evolution of pathogens, as well as an organism’s need to defend against them.\n\nMedicine, in turn, ignored evolution, and instead focused (as done in the hard sciences) upon proximate mechanical causes.\nmedicine has modelled itself after a mechanical physics, deriving from Galileo, Newton, and Descartes... As a result of assuming this model, medicine is mechanistic, materialistic, reductionistic, linear-causal, and deterministic (capable of precise predictions) in its concepts. It seeks explanations for diseases, or their symptoms, signs, and cause in single, materialistic— i.e., anatomical or structural (e.g., in genes and their products)— changes within the body, wrought directly (linearly), for example, by infectious, toxic, or traumatic agents. \nGeorge C. Williams was the first to apply evolutionary theory to health in the context of senescence. Also in the 1950s, John Bowlby approached the problem of disturbed child development from an evolutionary perspective upon attachment.\n\nAn important theoretical development was Nikolaas Tinbergen’s distinction made originally in ethology between evolutionary and proximate mechanisms.\n\nRandolph M. Nesse summarizes its relevance to medicine: all biological traits need two kinds of explanation, both proximate and evolutionary. The proximate explanation for a disease describes what is wrong in the bodily mechanism of individuals affected by it. An evolutionary explanation is completely different. Instead of explaining why people are different, it explains why we are all the same in ways that leave us vulnerable to disease. Why do we all have wisdom teeth, an appendix, and cells that can divide out of control?\n\nThe paper of Paul Ewald in 1980, “Evolutionary Biology and the Treatment of Signs and Symptoms of Infectious Disease”, and that of Williams and Nesse in 1991, “The Dawn of Darwinian Medicine” were key developments. The latter paper “draw a favorable reception”, and led to a book, \"Why We Get Sick\" (published as \"Evolution and healing\" in the UK).

Her many books and articles on topics ranging from totalitarianism to epistemology have had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century.\n\nArendt was born in Hanover, but largely raised in Königsberg in a secular merchant Jewish culture to parents who were politically progressive, being supporters of the Social Democrats. Her father died when she was seven, so she was raised by her mother and grandfather. After completing her secondary education, she studied at the University of Marburg under Martin Heidegger, with whom she had a brief affair, and who had a lasting influence on her thinking. She obtained her doctorate in philosophy in 1929 at the University of Heidelberg with Karl Jaspers.\n\nHannah Arendt married Günther Stern in 1929, but soon began to encounter increasing antisemitism in 1930s Germany. Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, and while researching antisemitic propaganda for the Zionist Federation of Germany in Berlin that year, Arendt was denounced and briefly imprisoned by the Gestapo. On release, she fled Germany, living in Czechoslovakia and Switzerland before settling in Paris. There she worked for Youth Aliyah, assisting young Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Divorcing Stern in 1937, she married Heinrich Blücher in 1940, but when Germany invaded France in 1940 she was detained by the French as an alien, despite having been stripped of her German citizenship in 1937. She escaped and made her way to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. She settled in New York, which remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. She became a writer and editor and worked for the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, becoming an American citizen in 1950. With the appearance of \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" in 1951, her reputation as a thinker and writer was established and a series of seminal works followed. These included \"The Human Condition\" in 1958, and both \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" and \"On Revolution\" in 1963. She taught at many American universities, while declining tenure-track appointments. She died suddenly from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 69, leaving her last work, \"The Life of the Mind\", unfinished.\n\nHer works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the nature of power and evil, as well as politics, direct democracy, authority, and totalitarianism. In the popular mind she is best remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of Adolf Eichmann, her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, which was considered an apologia, and for the phrase \"the banality of evil\". She is commemorated by institutions and journals devoted to her thinking, the Hannah Arendt Prize for political thinking, and on stamps, street names and schools, amongst other things.\n\nHannah Arendt was born Johanna Cohn Arendt in 1906 into a comfortable educated secular family of German Jews in Linden, Prussia (now a part of Hanover), in Wilhelmine Germany. The family were merchants of Russian extraction from Königsberg, the East Prussian capital. Arendt's grandparents were part of the Reform Jewish community there. Hannah's paternal grandfather, (1843–1913), was a prominent businessman, local politician, one of the leaders of the Königsberg Jewish community and a member of the Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens (Central Organinzation for German Citizens of the Jewish Faith). Like other members of the \"Centralverein\" he saw himself primarily as German and disapproved of the activities of Zionists, such as the young Kurt Blumenfeld (1884–1963), who was a frequent visitor to their home and would later become one of Hannah's mentors. Of Max Arendt's children, Paul Arendt (1873–1913) was an engineer and Henriette Arendt (1874–1922) a policewoman who became a social worker.\n\nHannah was the only child of Paul and Martha (born Cohn) Arendt (1874–1948), who were married on April 11, 1902. She was named after her paternal grandmother. The Cohns had originally come to Königsberg from nearby Russian territory (now Lithuania) in 1852, as refugees from anti-Semitism there, and made their living as tea importers; J. N. Cohn & Company became the largest business in the city. The Arendts had reached Germany from Russia a century earlier. Hannah's extended family contained many more women, who shared the loss of husbands and children. Hannah's parents were better educated and politically more to the left than her grandparents, both being members of the Social Democrats, rather than the German Democratic Party that most of their contemporaries supported. Paul Arendt was educated at the Albertina (University of Königsberg). Though he worked as an engineer, he prided himself on his love of Classics. He collected a large library, in which Hannah immersed herself. Martha Cohn, a musician, had studied for three years in Paris.\n\nIn the first four years of their marriage, the Arendts lived in Berlin, where they were supporters of the socialist journal . At the time of Hannah's birth, Paul Arendt was employed by an electrical engineering firm in Linden, and they lived in a frame house on the market square (Marktplatz). The Arendt family moved back to Königsberg in 1909, because of Paul's deteriorating health. Hannah's father suffered from a prolonged illness with syphilis and had to be institutionalized in 1911. He died on October 30, 1913, when Hannah was seven, leaving her mother to raise her. They lived at Hannah's grandfather's house at Tiergartenstrasse 6, a leafy residential street adjacent to the Königsberg Tiergarten, in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Hufen. Although Hannah's parents were non-religious, they were happy to allow Max Arendt to take Hannah to the Reform synagogue. She also received religious instruction from the rabbi, Hermann Vogelstein, who would come to her school for that purpose. At the time the young Hannah confided that she wished to marry him when she grew up. Her family moved in circles that included many intellectuals and professionals. It was a social circle of high standards and ideals. As she recalled it:\n\nMy early intellectual formation occurred in an atmosphere where nobody paid much attention to moral questions; we were brought up under the assumption: \"Das Moralische versteht sich von selbst\", moral conduct is a matter of course.\nThis time was a particularly favorable period for the Jewish community in Königsberg, an important center of the \"Haskalah\" (enlightenment). Arendt's family was thoroughly assimilated (\"Germanized\") and she later remembered: \"With us from Germany, the word 'assimilation' received a 'deep' philosophical meaning. You can hardly realize how serious we were about it.\" Despite these conditions, the Jewish population lacked full citizenship rights, and although antisemitism was not overt, nor was it absent. Arendt came to define her Jewish identity negatively after encountering overt antisemitism as an adult. She came to greatly identify with Rahel Varnhagen (1771–1833), the Prussian socialite who desperately wanted to assimilate into German culture, only to be rejected because she was born Jewish. Arendt later said of Varnhagen that she was \"my very closest woman friend, unfortunately dead a hundred years now.\" Varnhagen would later become the subject of a biography by Hannah.\n\nIn the last two years of the First World War, Hannah's mother organized social democratic discussion groups and became a follower of Rosa Luxembourg (1871-1919) as socialist uprisings broke out across Germany. Luxembourg's writings would later influence Hannah's political thinking. In 1920, Martha Cohn married Martin Beerwald (1869–1941), an ironmonger and widower of four years, and they moved to his home, two blocks away, at Busoldstrasse 6, providing Hannah with improved social and financial security. Hannah was fourteen at the time and acquired two older stepsisters, Clara (1901–1932) and Eva (1902–1988).\n\nHannah Arendt's mother, who considered herself progressive, sought to raise her daughter along strict Goethean lines, which amongst other things, involved the reading of the complete works of Goethe, often summed up in the phrase from \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\" (1796) as — \"Was aber ist deine Pflicht? Die Forderung des Tages\" (And just what is your duty? The demands of the day). Goethe, at the time, was considered the essential mentor of \"Bildung\" (education), the conscious formation of mind, body and spirit. The key elements were considered to be self-discipline, constructive channeling of passion, renunciation and responsibility for others. Hannah's developmental progress (\"Entwicklung\") was carefully documented by her mother in a book, which she titled \"Unser Kind\" (Our Child) and measured her against the benchmark of what was then considered \"normale Entwicklung\" (\"normal development\"). \n\nArendt enrolled in the Szittnich School, Königsberg (Hufen-Oberlyzeum), on Bahnstrasse in August 1913, but her studies there were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, forcing the family to temporarily flee to Berlin on August 23, 1914, in the face of the advancing Russian army. There they stayed with her mother's sister, Margarethe Fürst (1884–1942), and her three children, while Hannah attended school in Berlin-Charlottenburg. After ten weeks, when Königsberg appeared to be no longer threatened, the Arendts were able to return, where they spent the remaining war years at her grandfather's house. Arendt was precocious, learning ancient Greek as a child, writing poetry in her teenage years, and starting both a philosophy club and Greek \"Graecae\" at her school. She was fiercely independent in her schooling and a voracious reader, absorbing French and German literature and poetry (committing large amounts to heart) and philosophy. By the age of 16, she had read Kierkegaard, Jaspers' \"Psychologie der Weltanschauungen\" and Kant's \"Kritik der reinen Vernunft\" (\"Critique of Pure Reason\"). Kant, whose home town was also Königsberg, was an important influence on her thinking, and it was Kant who had written about Königsberg that \"such a town is the right place for gaining knowledge concerning men and the world even without travelling\". \n\nArendt attended the Königin-Luise-Schule for her secondary education, a girls' \"Gymnasium\" on Landhofmeisterstrasse. Most of her friends, while at school, were gifted children of Jewish professional families, generally older than her and went on to university education. Among them was (1902–1967), who introduced her to his girlfriend, Anne Mendelssohn, who would become a lifelong friend. When Anne moved away, Ernst became Arendt's first romantic relationship. Like Arendt, Anne would go on to become a philosopher, obtaining her doctorate at Hamburg, while Ernst became a philologist.\n\nArendt's education at the Luise-Schule ended in 1922 when she was expelled at the age of fifteen for leading a boycott of a teacher who insulted her. Instead, her mother arranged for her to go to Berlin to be with social democrat family friends. In Berlin she lived in a student residence and audited courses of her choosing at the University of Berlin (1922–1923), including classics and Christian theology under Romano Guardini. This enabled her to successfully apply sit the entrance examination (\"Abitur\") for the University of Marburg, where Ernst Grumach had studied under Martin Heidegger, who had been appointed a professor there in 1922. For the examination, her mother engaged a private tutor, while her Aunt Frieda Arendt, a teacher, also helped her, and Frieda's husband Ernst Aron provided financial assistance for her to attend university.\n\nIn Berlin, Guardini had introduced her to Kierkegaard, and she resolved to make theology her major field. At Marburg (1924–1926) she studied classical languages, German literature, Protestant theology with Rudolf Bultmann and philosophy with Nicolai Hartmann and Heidegger. The 17-year-old Arendt then began a long and problematic romantic relationship with the 35-year-old Heidegger, who was married with two young sons. Arendt later faced criticism for this because of Heidegger's support for the Nazi Party after being elected rector at the University of Freiburg in 1933. Nevertheless, he remained one of the most profound influences on her thinking. The details of the relationship remained a secret until Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's biography of Arendt appeared in 1982, by which time Arendt and Heidegger had both died, though Heidegger's wife, Elfride Petri (1893–1992), was still alive. Nevertheless, the affair was not well known until 1995, when Elzbieta Ettinger gained access to the sealed correspondence and published a controversial account that was used by Arendt's detractors to cast doubt on her integrity. That account, which caused a scandal, was subsequently refuted.\n\nAt Marburg, Arendt lived at Lutherstrasse 4. Among her friends there was Hans Jonas, her only Jewish classmate. Another fellow student of Heidegger's was Jonas' fiend, the Jewish philosopher Gunther Siegmund Stern (1902–1992)son of the noted psychologist Ludwig Wilhelm Sternwho would later become her first husband. Stern had completed his doctoral dissertation with Edmund Husserl at Freiburg University, and was now working on his \"Habilitation\" thesis with Heidegger, but Arendt, involved with Heidegger, took little notice of him at the time. \n\nAfter a year at Marburg, Arendt spent a semester at Freiburg, attending the lectures of Husserl. In 1926 she moved to the University of Heidelberg, where in 1929, she completed her dissertation under the other leading figure of the then new and revolutionary \"Existenzphilosophie\", Karl Jaspers (1883–1969), a friend of Heidegger's. Her thesis was entitled \": Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation\" (\"On the concept of love in the thought of Saint Augustine: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation\"). She remained a lifelong friend of Jaspers and his wife, Gertrud Mayer (1879–1974), developing a deep intellectual relationship with him. At Heidelberg, her circle of friends included Hans Jonas, who had also moved from Marburg to study Augustine, working on his \"Augustin und das paulinische Freiheitsproblem. Ein philosophischer Beitrag zur Genesis der christlich-abendländischen Freiheitsidee\" (1930), and also a group of three young philosophers: Karl Frankenstein, Erich Neumann and . Other friends and students of Jaspers were the linguists and (seen with Hannah, here), with whom she attended lectures by Friedrich Gundolf at Jaspers' suggestion and who kindled in her an interest in German Romanticism. She also became reacquainted with Kurt Blumenfeld, at a lecture, who introduced her to Jewish politics. At Heidelberg, she lived in the old town (\"Altstadt\") near the castle, at Schlossberg 16. The house was demolished in the 1960s, but the one remaining wall bears a plaque commemorating her time there (\"see image\").\nOn completing her dissertation, Arendt turned to her \"Habilitationsschrift\", initially on German Romanticism, and hence an academic teaching career. However 1929 was also the year of the Depression and the end of the golden years (\"Goldene Zwanziger\") of the Weimar Republic, which was to become increasingly unstable over its remaining four years. Arendt, as a Jew, had little if any chance of obtaining an academic appointment in Germany. Nevertheless, she completed most of the work before she was forced to leave Germany.\n\nIn 1929, Arendt met Günther Stern again, this time in Berlin at a New Year's masked ball, and began a relationship with him. Within a month she had moved in with him in a one-room studio, shared with a dancing school in Berlin-Halensee. Then they moved to Merkurstrasse 3, Nowawes, in Potsdam and were married there on September 26. They had much in common and the marriage was welcomed by both sets of parents. In the summer, Hannah Arendt successfully applied to the \"Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft\" for a grant to support her \"Habilitation\", which was supported by Heidegger and Jaspers among others, and in the meantime, with Günther's help was working on revisions to get her dissertation published.\n\nAfter Arendt and Günther were married, they began two years of what Christian Dries refers to as the \"Wanderjahre\" (years of wandering). They had the ultimately fruitless aim of having Günther accepted for an academic appointment. They lived for a while in Drewitz, a southern neighborhood of Potsdam, before moving to Heidelberg, where they lived with the Jaspers. After Heidelberg, where Günther completed the first draft of his \"Habilitation\" thesis, the Sterns then moved to Frankfurt where Günther hoped to finish it. There, Arendt participated in the university's intellectual life, attending lectures by Karl Mannheim and Paul Tillich, among others. The Sterns collaborated intellectually, writing an article together on Rilke's \"Duino Elegies\" (1923) and both reviewing Mannheim's \"Ideologie und Utopie\" (1929). The latter was Arendt's sole contribution in sociology. In both her treatment of Mannheim and Rilke, Arendt found love to be a transcendent principle \"Because there is no true transcendence in this ordered world, one also cannot exceed the world, but only succeed to higher ranks\". In Rilke she saw a latter day secular Augustine, describing the \"Elegies\" as the \"letzten literarischen Form religiösen Dokumentes\" (ultimate form of religious document). Later, she would discover the limitations of transcendent love in explaining the historical events that pushed her into political action. Another theme from Rilke that she would develop was the despair of not being heard. Reflecting on Rilke's opening lines, which she placed as an epigram at the beginning of their essay\n\n\"Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich den aus der Engel Ordnungen?\"<br>\n\nArendt and Stern begin by stating\n\nThe paradoxical, ambiguous, and desperate situation from which standpoint the \"Duino Elegies\" may alone be understood has two characteristics: the absence of an echo and the knowledge of futility. The conscious renunciation of the demand to be heard, the despair at not being able to be heard, and finally the need to speak even without an answer–these are the real reasons for the darkness, asperity, and tension of the style in which poetry indicates its own possibilities and its will to form\n\nArendt also published an article on Augustine (354–430) in the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" to mark the fifteen hundredth anniversary of his death. She saw this article as forming a bridge between her treatment of Augustine in her dissertation and her subsequent work on Romanticism. When it became evident Stern would not succeed in obtaining an appointment, the Sterns returned to Berlin in 1931.\n\nIn Berlin, where the couple initially lived in the predominantly Jewish area of \"Bayerisches Viertel\" (Bavarian Quarter or \"Jewish Switzerland\") in Schöneberg, Stern obtained a position as a staff-writer for the cultural supplement of the \"Berliner Börsen-Courier\", edited by Herbert Ihering, with the help of Bertold Brecht. There he started writing using the \"nom-de-plume\" of Günther Anders, i.e. \"Günther Other\". Arendt assisted Günther with his work, but the shadow of Heidegger hung over their relationship. While Günther was working on his \"Habilitationsschrift\", Arendt had abandoned the original subject of German Romanticism for her thesis in 1930, and turned instead to Rahel Varnhagen and the question of assimilation. Anne Mendelssohn had accidentally acquired a copy of Varhagen's correspondence and excitedly introduced introduced her to Arendt, donating her collection to her. A little later, Arendt's own work on romanticism led her to a study of Jewish salons and eventually to those of Varnhagen. In Rahel, she found qualities she felt reflected her own, particularly those of sensibility and vulnerability. Rahel, like Hannah, found her destiny in her Jewishness. Hannah Arendt would come to call Rahel Varnhagen's discovery of living with her destiny as being a \"conscious pariah\". This was a personal trait that Arendt had recognized in herself, although she did not embrace the term till later.\n\nBack in Berlin, Arendt found herself becoming more involved in politics and started studying political theory, and reading Marx and Trotsky, while developing contacts at the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik. Despite the political leanings of her mother and husband she never saw herself as a political leftist, justifying her activism as being through her Jewishness.\nHer increasing interest in Jewish politics and her examination of assimilation in her study of Varnhagen led her to publish her first article on Judaism, \"\" (\"The Enlightenment and the Jewish Question\", 1932). Blumenfeld had introduced her to the \"Jewish question\", which would be his lifelong concern. Meanwhile, her views on German Romanticism were evolving. She wrote a review of 's \"Die Entstehung des deutschen Bildungsprinzips\" (\"The Origin of German Educational Principle\", 1930), which dealt with the emergence of \"\" (educational elite) in the time of Rahel Varnhagen. At the same time she began to be occupied by Max Weber's description of the status of Jewish people within a state as \"pariavolk\" (pariah people) in his \"Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft\" (1922), while borrowing Bernard Lazare's term \"paria conscient\" (conscious pariah) with which she identified. In both these articles she advanced the views of Johann Herder. Another interest of hers at the time was the status of women, resulting in her 1932 review of Alice Rühle-Gerstel's book \"Das Frauenproblem in der Gegenwart. Eine psychologische Bilanz\" (Contemporary Women's Issues: A psychological balance sheet). Although not a supporter of the women's movement, the review was sympathetic. At least in terms of the status of women at that time, she was skeptical of the movement's ability to achieve political change. She was also critical of the movement, because it \"was\" a women's movement, rather than contributing with men to a political movement, abstract rather than striving for concrete goals. In this manner she echoed Rosa Luxemburg. Like Luxemburg, she would later criticize Jewish movements for the same reason. Arendt consistently prioritized political over social questions.\n\nBy 1932, faced with a deteriorating political situation, Arendt was deeply troubled by reports that Heidegger was speaking at National Socialist meetings. She wrote, asking him to deny that he was attracted to National Socialism. Heidegger replied that he did not seek to deny the rumors (which were true), and merely assured her that his feelings for her were unchanged. As a Jew in Nazi Germany, Arendt was prevented from making a living and discriminated against and confided to Anne Mendelssohn that emigration was probably inevitable. By 1933, life for the Jewish population in Germany was becoming precarious. Adolf Hitler became \"Reichskanzler\" (Chancellor) in January, and the Reichstag was burned down (\"Reichstagsbrand\") the following month. This led to the suspension of civil liberties, with attacks on the left, and, in particular, members of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (German Communist Party: KPD). Stern, who had communist associations, fled to Paris, but Arendt stayed on to become an activist. Knowing her time was limited, she used the apartment at Opitzstrasse 6 in Berlin-Steglitz that she had occupied with Stern since 1932 as an underground railway way-station for fugitives. Her rescue operation there is now recognized with a plaque on the wall (\"see image\"). \nArendt had already positioned herself as a critic of the rising Nazi Party in 1932 by publishing \"Adam-Müller-Renaissance?\" a critique of the appropriation of the life of Adam Müller to support right wing ideology. The beginnings of anti-Jewish laws and boycott came in the spring of 1933. Confronted with systemic antisemitism, Arendt adopted the \"motiv\" \"If one is attacked as a Jew one must defend oneself as a Jew. Not as a German, not as a world citizen, not as an upholder of the Rights of Man.\" This was Arendt's introduction of the concept of Jew as Pariah that would occupy her for the rest of her life in her Jewish writings. She took a public position by publishing part of her largely completed biography of Rahel Varnhagen as \"Originale Assimilation: Ein Nachwort zu Rahel Varnhagen 100 Todestag\" (\"Original Assimilation: An Epilogue to the One Hundredth Anniversary of Rahel Varnhagen's Death\") in the \"\" on March 7, 1933 and a little later also in \"\". In the article she argues that the age of assimilation that began with Varnhagen's generation had come to an end with an official state policy of antisemitism. She opened with the declaration: \n\nToday in Germany it seems Jewish \"assimilation\" must declare its bankruptcy. The general social antisemitism and its official legitimation affects in the first instance assimilated Jews, who can no longer protect themselves through baptism or by emphasizing their differences from Eastern Judaism.\n\nAs a Jew, Arendt was anxious to inform the world of what was happening to her people in 1930–1933. She surrounded herself with Zionist activists, including Kurt Blumenfeld, Martin Buber and Salman Schocken, and started to research antisemitism. Arendt had access to the Prussian State Library for her work on Varnhagen. Blumenfeld's Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland (Zionist Federation of Germany) persuaded her to use this access to obtain evidence of the extent of antisemitism, for a planned speech to the Zionist Congress in Prague. This research was illegal at the time. Her actions led to her being denounced by a librarian for anti-state propaganda, resulting in the arrest of both Arendt and her mother by the \"Gestapo\". They served eight days in prison but her notebooks were in code and could not be deciphered, and she was released by a young, sympathetic arresting officer to await trial.\n\nOn release, realizing the danger she was now in, Arendt and her mother fled Germany following the established escape route over the Erzgebirge Mountains by night into Czechoslovakia and on to Prague and then by train to Geneva. In Geneva, she made a conscious decision to commit herself to \"the Jewish cause\". She obtained work with a friend of her mother's at the League of Nations' Jewish Agency for Palestine, distributing visas and writing speeches.\n\nFrom Geneva the Arendts traveled to Paris in the autumn, where she was reunited with Stern, joining a stream of refugees. While Arendt had left Germany without papers, her mother had travel documents and returned to Königsberg and her husband. In Paris, she befriended Stern's cousin, the Marxist literary critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) and also the Jewish philosopher Raymond Aron (1905–1983).\n\nArendt was now an \"émigré\", an exile, stateless, without papers, and had turned her back on the Germany and Germans of the \"Nazizeit\". Her legal status was precarious and she was coping with a foreign language and culture, all of which took its toll on her mentally and physically. In 1934 she started working for the Zionist-funded outreach program Agriculture et Artisanat, giving lectures, and organizing clothing, documents, medications and education for Jewish youth seeking to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine, mainly as agricultural workers. Initially she was employed as a secretary, and then office manager. To improve her skills she studied French, Hebrew and Yiddish. In this way she was able to support herself and her husband. When the organization closed in 1935, her work for Blumenfeld and the Zionists in Germany brought her into contact with the wealthy philanthropist (born Halphen, 1884–1975), wife of Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild, becoming her assistant. In this position she oversaw the baroness' contributions to Jewish charities through the Paris Consistoire, although she had little time for the family as a whole. The Rothschilds had headed the central \"Consistoire\" for a century but stood for everything Arendt did not, opposing immigration and any connection with German Jewry.\n\nLater in 1935, Arendt joined Youth Aliyah (Youth immigration), an organization similar to Agriculture et Artisanat that was founded in Berlin on the day Hitler seized power. It was affiliated with Hadassah. These organizations saved many from the Holocaust. There she eventually became Secretary-General (1935–1939). Her work with Youth Aliyah also involved finding food, clothing, social workers and lawyers, but above all, fund raising. She made her first visit to Palestine in 1935, accompanying one of these groups and meeting with her cousin Ernst Fürst there. With the Nazi annexation of Austria and invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Paris was flooded with refugees, and she became the special agent for the rescue of the children from those countries. In 1938, Arendt completed her biography of Rahel Varnhagen, although this was not published until 1958. In April 1939, following the devastating \"Kristallnacht\" pogrom of November 1938, Martha Beerwald realized her daughter would not return and made the decision to leave her husband and join Arendt in Paris. One stepdaughter had died and the other had moved to England, Martin Beerwald would not leave and she no longer had any close ties to Königsberg. \n\nIn 1936, Arendt met the self-educated Berlin poet and Marxist philosopher Heinrich Blücher (1899–1970) in Paris. Blücher had been a Spartacist and then a founding member of the KPD, but had been expelled due to his work in the \"Versöhnler\" (Conciliator faction). Although Arendt had rejoined Stern in 1933, their marriage existed in name only, with them having separated in Berlin. She fulfilled her social obligations and used the name Hannah Stern, but the relationship effectively ended when Stern, perhaps recognizing the danger better than her, emigrated to America with his parents in 1936. In 1937, Arendt was stripped of her German citizenship and she and Stern divorced. She had begun seeing more of Blücher, and eventually they began living together. It was Blücher's long political activism that began to move Arendt's thinking towards political action. Arendt and Blücher married on January 16, 1940, shortly after their respective divorces were finalized.\n\nOn May 5, 1940, in anticipation of the German invasion of France and the Low Countries that month, the Gouverneur général of Paris issued a proclamation ordering all \"enemy aliens\" between 17 and 55 who had come from Germany (predominantly Jews) to report separately for internment. The women were gathered together in the Vélodrome d'Hiver on May 15, so Hannah Arendt's mother, being over 55, was allowed to stay in Paris. Arendt described the process of making refugees as \"the new type of human being created by contemporary history ... put into concentration camps by their foes and into internment camps by their friends\". The men, including Blücher, were sent to Camp Vernet in southern France, close to the Spanish border. Arendt and the other women were sent to Camp Gurs, to the west of Gurs, a week later. The camp had originally been set up to accommodate refugees from Spain. On June 22, France capitulated and signed the Compiègne armistice, dividing the country. Gurs was in the southern Vichy controlled section. Arendt describes how, \"in the resulting chaos we succeeded in getting hold of liberation papers with which we were able to leave the camp\", which she did with about 200 of the 7,000 women held there, about four weeks later. There was no Résistance then, but she managed to walk and hitchhike north to Montauban, near Toulouse where she knew she would find help.\n\nMontauban had become an unofficial capital for former detainees, and Arendt's friend Lotta Sempell Klembort was staying there. Blücher's camp had been evacuated in the wake of the German advance, and he managed to escape from a forced march, making his way to Montauban, where the two of them led a fugitive life. Soon they were joined by Anne Mendelssohn and Arendt's mother. Escape from France was extremely difficult without official papers; their friend Walter Benjamin had taken his own life after being apprehended trying to escape to Spain. One of the best known illegal routes operated out of Marseilles, where Varian Fry, an American journalist, worked to raise funds, forge papers and bribe officials with Hiram Bingham, the American vice-consul there. Fry and Bingham secured exit papers and American visas for thousands, and with help from Günther Stern, Arendt, her husband, and her mother managed to secure the requisite permits to travel by train through Spain to Lisbon, Portugal. There, they eventually secured a passage to New York in April 1941. A few months later, Fry's operations were shut down and the borders sealed.\n\nUpon arriving in New York, Arendt became active in the German-Jewish community. From 1941 to 1945, she wrote a political column for the New York German-language Jewish newspaper \"\", writing on anti-semitism, refugees and the need for a Jewish army and contributed to the \"Menorah Journal\", a Jewish-American magazine. She also wrote for other German \"émigré \" publications and became an editor at Schocken Books, which later published a number of her works. Beginning in 1944, she was the director of research and Executive Director for the Commission of European Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, and in that capacity traveled to Europe after the war. In 1948 she became engaged with the campaign of Judah Magnes for a two-state solution in Palestine.\nTogether with her husband, she lived at 370 Riverside Drive in New York and at Kingston, New York, where Blücher taught at nearby Bard College for many years.\n\nIn the 1950s Arendt wrote some of her most important works, including \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" (1951), \"The Human Condition\" (1958) and \"On Revolution\" (1963). Arendt began corresponding with the American author Mary McCarthy, six years her junior, in 1950 and they soon became lifelong friends. In 1950, Arendt also became a naturalized citizen of the United States. The same year, she started seeing Martin Heidegger again, and had what the American writer Adam Kirsch called a \"quasi-romance\", lasting for two years, with the man who had previously been her mentor, teacher, and lover. During this time, Arendt defended him against critics who noted his enthusiastic membership in the Nazi Party. She portrayed Heidegger as a naïve man swept up by forces beyond his control, and pointed out that Heidegger's philosophy had nothing to do with National Socialism. Her work was recognized by many awards, including the Danish Sonning Prize in 1975 for Contributions to European Civilization.\n\nArendt taught at many institutions of higher learning from 1951 onwards, but, preserving her independence, consistently refused tenure-track positions. She served as a visiting scholar at the University of Notre Dame; University of California, Berkeley; Princeton University (where she was the first woman to be appointed a full professor in 1959); and Northwestern University. She also taught at the University of Chicago from 1963 to 1967, where she was a member of the Committee on Social Thought; The New School in Manhattan where she taught as a university professor from 1967; Yale University, where she was a fellow; and the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University (1961–62, 1962–63). She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962 and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1964.\n\nIn 1974, Arendt was instrumental in the creation of Structured Liberal Education (SLE) at Stanford University. She wrote a letter to the president of Stanford to persuade the university to enact Mark Mancall's vision of a residentially based humanities program. At the time of her death, she was University Professor of Political Philosophy at the New School.\n\nIn addition to her affair with Heidegger, and her two marriages, Arendt had a number of close friendships. Since her death, her correspondences with many of them have been published, revealing much information about her thinking. To her friends she was both loyal and generous, dedicating a number of her works to them. \"Freundschaft\" (friendship) she described as being one of \"tätigen Modi des Lebendigseins\" (the active modes of being alive), and, to her, friendship was central both to her life and to the concept of politics. Hans Jonas described her as having a \"genius for friendship\", and, in her own words, \"\"der Eros der Freundschaft\" (love of friendship). Her philosophy-based friendships were male and European, while her later American friendships were more diverse, literary, and political. Although she became an American citizen in 1950, her cultural roots remained European, and her language remained her German \"Muttersprache\"\". She surrounded herself with German-speaking \"émigrés\", sometimes referred to as \"The Tribe\". To her, \"wirkliche Menschen\" (real people) were \"pariahs\", not in the sense of outcasts, but in the sense of outsiders, unassimilated, with the virtue of \"social nonconformism ... the \"sine qua non\" of intellectual achievement\", a sentiment she shared with Jaspers.\nArendt always had a \"beste Freundin\". In her teens she had formed a lifelong relationship with her \"Jugendfreundin\", Anne Mendelssohn Weil (\"Annchen\"). On emigrating to America, Hilde Frankel, Paul Tillich's secretary and mistress, filled that role until her death in 1950. After the war, Arendt was able to return to Germany and renew her relationship with Weil, who made several visits to New York, especially after Blücher's death in 1970. Their last meeting was in Tegna, Switzerland in 1975, shortly before Arendt's death. With Frankel's death, Mary McCarthy became Arendt's closest friend and confidante.\n\nWhile Blücher had survived a cerebral aneurysm in 1961, he remained unwell after 1963, sustaining a series of heart attacks. On October 31, 1970 he died of a massive heart attack. A devastated Arendt had previously told Mary McCarthy, \"Life without him would be unthinkable\". Arendt was also a heavy smoker and was frequently depicted with a cigarette in her hand. She sustained a near fatal heart attack while lecturing in Scotland in May 1974, and although she recovered, she remained in poor health afterwards, and continued to smoke. On the evening of December 4, 1975, shortly after her 69th birthday, she had a further heart attack in her apartment while entertaining friends, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her ashes were buried alongside those of Blücher at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York in May 1976.\n\nAfter Arendt's death the title page of the final part of \"The Life of the Mind\" (\"Judging\") was found in her typewriter, which she had just started, consisting of the title and two epigraphs. This has subsequently been reproduced (\"see image\").\n\nArendt wrote works on intellectual history as a philosopher, using events and actions to develop insights into contemporary totalitarian movements and the threat to human freedom presented by scientific abstraction and bourgeois morality. Intellectually, she was an independent thinker, a loner not a \"joiner\", separating herself from schools of thought or ideology. In addition to her major texts she published a number of anthologies, including \"Between Past and Future\" (1961), \"Men in Dark Times\" (1968) and \"Crises of the Republic\" (1972). She also contributed to many publications, including \"The New York Review of Books\", \"Commonweal\", \"Dissent\" and \"The New Yorker\". She is perhaps best known for her accounts of Adolf Eichmann and his trial, because of the intense controversy that it generated. She was also a minor poet, but kept this very private. She had started writing at seventeen, and her work is marked by a deep melancholy she called \"Müdigkeit\" (weariness), a Romantic yearning from the past steeped in Kierkegaardian angst.\n\nWhile Arendt never developed a coherent political theory and her writing does not easily lend itself to categorization, the tradition of thought most closely identified with Arendt is that of civic republicanism, from Aristotle to Toqueville. Her political concept is centered around active citizenship that emphasizes civic engagement and collective deliberation. She believed that no matter how bad, government could never succeed in extinguishing human freedom, despite holding that modern societies frequently retreat from democratic freedom with its inherent disorder for the relative comfort of administrative bureaucracy. Her political legacy is her strong defense of freedom in the face of an increasingly less than free world. She does not adhere to a single systematic philosophy, but rather spans a range of subjects covering totalitarianism, revolution, the nature of freedom and the faculties of thought and judgment.\n\nWhile she is best known for her work on \"dark times\", the nature of totalitarianism and evil, she imbued this with a spark of hope and confidence in the nature of mankind:\n\nThat even in the darkest of times we have the right to expect some illumination, and that such illumination might well come less from theories and concepts than from the uncertain, flickering, and often weak light that some men and women, in their lives and their works, will kindle under almost all circumstances and shed over the time span that was given to them.\n\nArendt's doctoral thesis, \"Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin. Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation\" (\"Love and Saint Augustine\"), was published in 1929 and attracted critical interest. Although an English translation had been prepared by E B Ashton in the early 1960s, Arendt did not want it published without revising it and adding new material. Although she prepared several manuscripts, she ultimately abandoned the task and it was not published in English until 1996. In this, she combines approaches of both Heidegger and Jaspers. Arendt's interpretation of love in the work of Augustine deals with three concepts, love as craving or desire (\"Amor qua appetitus\"), love in the relationship between man (\"creatura\") and creator (\"Creator - Creatura\"), and neighborly love (\"Dilectio proximi\"), and is constructed in three sections dealing with each of these. Love as craving anticipates the future, while love for the Creator deals with the remembered past. Of the three, \"dilectio proximi\" or \"caritas\" is perceived as the most fundamental, to which the first two are oriented, which she treats under \"vita socialis\" (social life). The second of the Great Commandments (or Golden Rule) \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\" uniting and transcending the former. Augustine's influence (and Jaspers' views on his work) persisted in Arendt's writings for the rest of her life. \n\nAlready in this work some of the leitmotifs of her canon were apparent. For instance, she introduced the concept of \"\" (Natality) as a key condition of human existence and its role in the development of the individual. She made clear, in her revisions to the English translation, through explicit reference, that it was \"natality\" that she was introducing, and would develop further in \"The Human Condition\" (1958). Although she did not specifically use the word \"Natalität\" in the original German version, she explained that the construct of natality was implied in her discussion of new beginnings and man's elation to the Creator as \"nova creatura\". The centrality of the theme of birth and renewal is apparent in the constant reference to Augustinian thought, and specifically the innovative nature of birth, from this, her first work, to her last, \"The Life of the Mind\".\n\nLove is another connecting theme. In addition to the Augustinian loves expostulated in her dissertation, the phrase \"amor mundi\" (love of the world) is one often associated with Arendt and both permeates her work and was an absorbing passion from her dissertation to \"The Life of the Mind\" (1978). She took the phrase from Augustine's homily on the , \"If love of the world dwell in us\". \"Amor mundi\" was her original title for \"The Human Condition\" (1958), the subtitle of Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's biography (1982), the title of a collection of writing on faith in her work and the newsletter of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College.\n\nArendt's first major book, \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" (1951), examined the roots of Communism and Nazism. The book is structured as three essays, \"Antisemitism\", \"Imperialism\" and \"Totalitarianism\". In this book, Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a \"novel form of government,\" that \"differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship\" in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries. The book was opposed by some on the left on the grounds that it presented the two movements as equally tyrannical. She further contends that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy. That totalitarianism in Germany was, in the end, about terror and consistency, not eradicating Jews only.\n\nA second, enlarged edition was published in 1958, and contained two additional chapters, replacing her original \"Concluding Remarks\". Chapter Thirteen was titled \"Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government\", which she had published separately in 1963. Chapter Fourteen dealt with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, entitled \"Epilogue: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution\". Subsequent editions omitted this chapter, which was published separately in English (\"Totalitarian Imperialism: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution\") and German (\"Die ungarische Revolution und der totalitäre Imperialismus\") in 1958.\n\nArendt's \"Habilitationsschrift\" on Rahel Varnhagen was completed while she was living in exile in Paris in 1938, but due to the deteriorating political situation was not published till 1957, when she was living in the United States, since she had not managed to escape with a copy of the manuscript, but relied on a copy she had given to Gershom Scholem. Ostensibly a biography of this nineteenth century Jewish socialite, it formed an important step in her analysis of Jewish history and the subjects of assimilation and emancipation, and introduced her treatment of the Jewish diaspora as either \"pariah\" or \"parvenu\". In addition it represents an early version of her concept of history. She dedicated the book to Anne Mendelssohn, who had first drawn her attention to Varnhagen's writing.\n\nArendt's relation to Varnhagen permeates her subsequent work. Her examination of Varnhagen's life is set against the background of the catastrophic destruction of German-Jewish culture and its demonstrations of the illusion of any true German-Jewish \"symbiosis\" and the threatened existence of her subject. In this sense the book partially reflects Arendt's own view of herself as a German Jewish woman driven out of her own culture into a stateless existence. In this sense the work has been referred to as \"biography as autobiography\".\n\nIn what is arguably her most influential work, \"The Human Condition\" (1958), Arendt differentiates political and social concepts, labor and work, and various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social part of human nature, political life, has been intentionally realized in only a few societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom. Conceptual categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between ontological and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as that which is both existential and aesthetic.\n\nArendt had first introduced the concept of \"natality\" in her \"Love and Saint Augustine\" (1929) and in \"The Human Condition\" starts to develop this further. In this, she departs from Heidegger's emphasis on mortality. Arendt's positive message is one of the \"miracle of beginning\", the continual arrival of the new to create action, that is to alter the state of affairs brought about by previous actions. Natality would go on to become a central concept of her political theory, and also what Karin Fry considers its most optimistic one.\n\n\"Between Past and Future\" is an anthology of six essays written between 1954 and 1961, and later expanded, and deals with a variety of different philosophical subjects; \"Tradition and the Modern Age\", \"The Concept of History\", \"What Is Authority?\", \"What Is Freedom?\", \"The Crisis in Education\" and \"The Crisis in Culture\". \n\nThe essays share the central idea that humans are living between the past and the uncertain future. They must permanently think to exist, and each man is required to learn thinking. For a long time humans have resorted to tradition, but in modern times, this tradition has been abandoned; there is no more respect for tradition and culture. In these essays, Arendt tries to find solutions to help humans think again today. According to her, there is no way to live again with tradition, and modern philosophy has not succeeded in helping humans to live correctly.\n\nArendt's book \"On Revolution\" presents a comparison of two of the main revolutions of the eighteenth century, the American and French Revolutions. She goes against a common impression of both Marxist and leftist views when she argues that France, while well-studied and often emulated, was a disaster and that the largely ignored American Revolution was a success. The turning point in the French Revolution occurred when the leaders rejected their goals of freedom in order to focus on compassion for the masses. In the United States, the founders never betray the goal of \"\". Arendt believes the revolutionary spirit of those men had been lost, however, and advocates a \"council system\" as an appropriate institution to regain that spirit.\n\nThe anthology of essays \"Men in Dark Times\" presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the twentieth century, such as Walter Benjamin, Karl Jaspers, Rosa Luxemburg, Hermann Broch, Pope John XXIII, and Isak Dinesen.\n\n\"Crises of the Republic\" was the third of Arendt's anthologies, and as the subtitle \"Lying in Politics, Civil Disobedience, On Violence, Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\" indicates, consists of four interconnected essays on contemporary American politics and the crises it faced in the 1960s and 1970s. The first essay, \"Lying in Politics\" looks for an explanation behind the administration's deception regarding the Vietnam War, as revealed in the \"Pentagon Papers\". \"Civil Disobedience\" examines the opposition movements, while the final \"Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\" is a commentary, in the form of an interview on the third essay, \"On Violence\".\n\n\"On Violence\", the third of these essays, distinguishes between violence and power. Arendt maintains that, although theorists of both the left and right regard violence as an extreme manifestation of power, the two concepts are, in fact, antithetical. Power comes from the collective will and does not need violence to achieve any of its goals, since voluntary compliance takes its place. As governments start losing their legitimacy, violence becomes an artificial means toward the same end and is, therefore, found only in the absence of power. Bureaucracies then become the ideal birthplaces of violence since they are defined as the \"rule by no one\" against whom to argue and, therefore, recreate the missing links with the people they rule over.\n\nArendt's last major work, \"The Life of the Mind\" remained incomplete at the time of her death. During Arendt's tenure at the New School, in 1974, she presented a graduate level political philosophy class entitled, \"Philosophy of the Mind\". It was during these class lectures that Arendt crystallized her concepts. The class was based on her working draft of \"Philosophy of the Mind\", which was later edited to \"Life of the Mind\". Arendt's working draft of \"Philosophy of the Mind\" was distributed to graduate students at the New School during her visiting professorship in 1974. She conceived of a trilogy based on the mental activities of thinking, willing, and judging. Stemming from her Gifford Lectures at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland (1972–1974), her last writing focused on the first two. In a sense, \"Life of the Mind\" went beyond her previous work concerning the \"\". In her discussion of thinking, she focuses mainly on Socrates and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between oneself. This appropriation of Socrates leads her to introduce novel concepts of conscience—an enterprise that gives no positive prescriptions, but instead, tells one what I cannot do if I would remain friends with myself when I re-enter the two-in-one of thought where I must render an account of my actions to myself—and morality—an entirely negative enterprise concerned with forbidding participation in certain actions for the sake of remaining friends with oneself. She died suddenly five days after completing the second part, with the first page of Judging, still in her typewriter. The task then fell to McCarthy to edit the first two parts and provide some indication of the direction of the third.\n\nAlthough Arendt's exact intentions in the third part are unknown, she did leave manuscripts (such as \"Thinking and Moral Considerations\" and \"Some Questions on Moral Philosophy\") and lectures (\"Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy\") concerning her thoughts on the mental faculty of Judging. The first two articles were edited and published in an anthology (\"Responsibility and Judgement\") by Jerome Kohn, one of Arendt's assistants and a director of the Hannah Arendt Center at The New School in New York, in 2003. The last was edited and published by Ronald Beiner, professor of political science at the University of Toronto, in 1982.\n\nAfter Hannah Arendt's death a number of her essays and notes have continued to be edited and published posthumously by friends and colleagues, including those that give some insight into the unfinished third part of \"The Life of the Mind\". \"The Jew as Pariah: Jewish Identity and Politics in the Modern Age\" (1978), is a collection of 15 essays and letters from the period 1943–1966 on the situation of Jews in modern times, to try and throw some light on her views on the Jewish world, following the backlash to \"Eichmann\", but proved to be equally polarizing. A further collection of her writings on being Jewish was published as \"The Jewish Writings\" (2007). Other work includes the collection of forty, largely fugitive, essays, addresses, and reviews entitled \"Essays in Understanding 1930–1934: Formation, Exile, and Totalitarianism\" (1994), that presaged her monumental \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\", in particular \"On the Nature of Totalitarianism\" (1953) and \"The Concern with Politics in Contemporary European Philosophical Thought\" (1954). The remaining essays were published as \"Thinking Without a Banister: Essays in Understanding, 1953-1975\" (2018). Her notebooks which form a series of memoirs, were published as \"Denktagebuch\" in 2002.\n\nSome further insight into her thinking is provided in the continuing posthumous publication of her correspondence with many of the important figures in her life, including Karl Jaspers (1992), Mary McCarthy (1995), Heinrich Blücher (1996), Martin Heidegger (2004), Alfred Kazin (2005), Walter Benjamin (2006), Gershom Scholem (2011) and Günther Stern (2016). Other correspondence that has been published, include those with a number of women friends such as Hilde Fränkel and Anne Mendelsohn Weil (\"see\" Relationships).\nOn hearing of Adolf Eichmann's capture and plans for his trial, Hannah Arendt contacted \"The New Yorker\" and offered to travel to Israel to cover it. The offer was accepted and in her subsequent reporting of the 1961 trial in 1963, which evolved into the book \"\" (1963), Arendt was critical of the way the trial was conducted in Israel and coined the phrase \"the banality of evil\" to describe the phenomenon of Eichmann. She was struck by his very ordinariness and the demeanor he exhibited of a bland bureaucrat, in contrast to the horrific crimes he stood accused of. She examined the question of whether evil is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions. Arendt's argument was that Eichmann was not a monster, contrasting the immensity of his actions with the very ordinariness of the man himself. Eichmann, she stated, not only called himself a Zionist, having initially opposed the Jewish persecution, but also expected his captors to understand him. She pointed out that his actions were not driven by malice, but rather blind dedication to the regime and his need to belong, to be a joiner. In his own words: \n\nI sensed I would have to live a leaderless and difficult individual life, I would receive no directives from anybody, no orders and commands would any longer be issued to me, no pertinent ordinances would be there to consult—in brief, a life never known before lay ahead of me.\n\nOn this, Arendt would later state \"Going along with the rest and wanting to say 'we' were quite enough to make the greatest of all crimes possible\". What Arendt observed, during the trial was a bourgeois sales clerk, who found a meaningful role for himself and a sense of importance in the Nazi movement. She noted that his addiction to clichés and use of bureaucratic morality clouded his ability to question his actions, \"to think\". This led her to set out her most famous, and most debated, dictum \"the lesson that this long course in human wickedness had taught us — the lesson of the fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil.\"\n\nArendt was also critical of the way that some Jewish leaders associated with the Jewish Councils (Judenräte), notably M. C. Rumkowski, acted during the Holocaust, which she described as a moral catastrophe. While her argument was not to allocate blame, rather she mourns what she considered a moral failure of compromising the imperative that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong. She describes the cooperation of the Jewish leaders in terms of a disintegration of Jewish morality \"this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter in the whole dark story\". Widely, misunderstood, this caused an even greater controversy and particularly animosity toward her in the Jewish community and in Israel.\n\nNo other book on either Eichmann or National Socialism has aroused so much controversy. Arendt was profoundly shocked by the response, writing to Karl Jaspers \"People are resorting to any means to destroy my reputation ... They have spent weeks trying to find something in my past that they can hang on me\". Her critics included The Anti-Defamation League and many other Jewish groups, editors of publications she was a contributor to, faculty at the universities she taught at and friends from all parts of her life. Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew, until 1999. Arendt responded to the controversies in the book's Postscript;\n\nArendt ended the book by writing: \n\nPrior to Arendt's depiction of Eichmann, the popular image had been, as the New York Times put it \"the most evil monster of humanity\". Roger Berkowitz, Director of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard, states that Arendt neither defended Eichmann, nor denied that his actions were evil and that he was an anti-semite, nor that he should be executed for his actions. But rather that we should understand that those actions were neither monstrous, nor sadistic. In understanding Eichmann, Arendt argues, we come to understand a greater truth about the nature of evil, that individuals participate in atrocities from an inability to critically examine blind allegiance to ideologies that provide a sense of meaning in a lonely and alienating world. Thus, she concludes, thoughtless zealotry is the face of evil in the modern world. Nor was Arendt alone in raising concerns about the role played by the \"Judenräte\".\n\nRejections of Arendt's characterization of Eichmann and allegations of racism against her have persisted ever since, though much of this is based on information that was not available at the time of the trial. Issues around factual accuracy have been disputed, as well as whether Eichmann was merely dissembling. Irving Howe, one of her critics, described how the Eichmann issue engendered what approached \"civil war\" amongst New York intellectuals. Howe rightly surmised that \"such controversies are never settled. They die down, simmer, and erupt again\". Thus the appearance of the 2012 film \"Hannah Arendt\" reignited the controversy. Berkowitz states that claiming Arendt exonerated Eichmann as simply a man who followed orders, is a misreading of the book. In fact she argued that Eichmann acted equally out of conviction, and even at times disobeyed orders, such as those of Himmler. Eichmann was, as Berkowitz states, \"someone convinced that he was sacrificing an easy morality for a higher good\". What has emerged following this revisiting of the controversy, is a consensus that whether Arandt was right or wrong about Eichmann, she was correct about the nature of evil, in that events of horror can too easily arise from origins that are mundane. Arendt's depiction of the nature of evil has proved both tenacious and timeless in its relevance. \n\nWhile much has been made of Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, Ada Ushpiz, in her 2015 documentary \"Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt\" placed it in a much broader context of the use of rationality to explain seemingly irrational historical events..\n\nIn an interview with Joachim Fest in 1964, Arendt was asked about Eichmann's defense that he had made Kant's principle of duty his guiding principle all his life. Arendt replied that that was outrageous and that Eichmann was misusing Kant, by not considering the element of judgement required in assessing one's own actions - \"\"Kein Mensch hat das Recht zu gehorchen bei Kant\" (Nobody has the right of obedience to Kant), she stated. The reference was to Kant's \"Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der bloßen Vernunft\" (Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason 1793) in which he states:\n\n\"Der Satz 'man muß Gott mehr gehorchen, als den Menschen' bedeutet nur, daß, wenn die letzten etwas gebieten, was an sich böse (dem Sittengesetz unmittelbar zuwider) ist, ihnen nicht gehorcht werden darf und soll\" (The saying, \"We must hearken to God, rather than to man\",\" signifies no more than this, viz. that should any earthly legislation enjoin something immediately contradictory of the moral law, obedience is not to be rendered)\n\nKant clearly defines a higher moral duty than rendering merely unto Caesar. Arendt's reply was subsequently corrupted to read \"Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen\" (No one has the right to obey), which has been widely reproduced, although it does encapsulate an aspect of her moral philosophy.\n\nThe phrase \"Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen\" has become one of her iconic images, appearing on the wall of the house in which she was born (\"see\" Commemorations), among other places. A fascist bas-relief on the Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari (1942), in the Piazza del Tribunale, Bolzano, Italy celebrating Mussolini, read \"Credere, Obbedire, Combattere\" (Believe, Obey, Combat). In 2017 it was altered to read Hannah Arendt's original words on obedience in the three official languages of the region.\n\nThe phrase has been appearing in other artistic work featuring political messages, such as the 2015 installation by Wilfried Gerstel, which has evoked the concept of resistance to dictatorship, as expressed in her essay \"Personal Responsibility under Dictatorship\" (1964).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1961, while covering the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt wrote a letter to Karl Jaspers that Adam Kirsch described as reflecting \"pure racism\" toward Sephardic Jews from the Middle East and Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe. She wrote:\n\nOn top, the judges, the best of German Jewry. Below them, the prosecuting attorneys, Galicians, but still Europeans. Everything is organized by a police force that gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic. Some downright brutal types among them. They would obey any order. And outside the doors, the oriental mob, as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country.\n\nAlthough Arendt remained a Zionist both during and after World War II, she made it clear that she favored the creation of a Jewish-Arab federated state in Palestine, rather than a purely Jewish state. She believed that this was a way to address Jewish statelessness and to avoid the pitfalls of nationalism.\n\nIt was not just Arendt's analysis of the Eichmann trial that drew accusations of racism. In her 1958 essay in \"Dissent\" entitled \"Reflections on Little Rock\" she expressed opposition to desegregation following the 1957 Little Rock Integration Crisis in Arkansas. As she explains in the preface, for a long time the magazine was reluctant to print her contribution, so far did it appear to differ from the publication's liberal values. Eventually it was printed alongside critical responses. Later the \"New Yorker\" would express similar hesitancy over the Eichmann papers. So vehement was the response, that Arendt felt obliged to defend herself in a sequel. The debate over this essay has continued since. William Simmons devotes a whole section of his 2011 text on human rights (\"Human Rights Law and the Marginalized Other\") to a critique of Arendt's position and in particular on Little Rock. While a number of critics feel she was fundamentally racist, many of those who have defended Arendt's position have pointed out that her concerns were for the welfare of the children, a position she maintained throughout her life. She felt that the children were being subjected to trauma in order to serve a broader political strategy of forcible integration. While over time Arendt conceded some ground to her critics, namely that she argued as an outsider, she remained committed to her central critique that children should not be thrust into the front-lines of geopolitical conflict.\n\nEmbraced by feminists, as a pioneer in a world dominated by men up to her time, she would be very surprised to hear herself described as a feminist, remaining opposed to the social dimensions of Women's Liberation, urging independence, but always keeping in mind \"Viva la petite différence!\" On becoming the first woman to be appointed a professor at Princeton, the media were much engaged in this achievement, but she never wanted to be seen as an exception, either as a woman (an \"exception woman\") or a Jew, stating emphatically \"I am not disturbed at all about being a woman professor, because I am quite used to being a woman\". She rather enjoyed what she saw as the privileges of being feminine as opposed to feminist, \"Intensly feminine and therefore no feminist\", stated Hans Jonas. Arendt considered some professions and positions unsuitable for women, particularly those involving leadership, telling Güunter Gaus \"It just doesn't look good when a woman gives orders\". Despite these views, and having been labelled \"anti-feminist\", much space has been devoted to examining Arendt's place in relation to feminism. In the last year's of her life, Virginia Held noted that Arendt's views evolved with the emergence of a new feminism in America in the 1970s to recognize the importance of the women's movement.\n\nIn \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\", Hannah Arendt devotes a lengthy chapter (\"The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man\") to a critical analysis of human rights, in what has been described as \"the most widely read essay on refugees ever published\". Arendt is not skeptical of the notion of political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights. Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable, and possessed simply by virtue of being human. In contrast, civil rights are possessed by virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt's primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty. She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments have little incentive to respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.\n\nArendt's analysis draws on the refugee upheavals in the first half of the twentieth century along with her own experience as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany. She argued that as state governments began to emphasize national identity as a prerequisite for full legal status, the number of minority resident aliens increased along with the number of stateless persons whom no state was willing to recognize legally. The two potential solutions to the refugee problem, repatriation and naturalization, both proved incapable of solving the crisis. Arendt argued that repatriation failed to solve the refugee crisis because no government was willing to take them in and claim them as their own. When refugees were forcibly deported to neighboring countries, such immigration was deemed illegal by the receiving country, and so failed to change the fundamental status of the migrants as stateless. Attempts at naturalizing and assimilating refugees also had little success. This failure was primarily the result of resistance from both state governments and the majority of citizens, since both tended to see the refugees as undesirables who threatened their national identity. Resistance to naturalization also came from the refugees themselves who resisted assimilation and attempted to maintain their own ethnic and national identities. Arendt contends that neither naturalization nor the tradition of asylum was capable of handling the sheer number of refugees. Instead of accepting some refugees with legal status, the state often responded by denaturalizing minorities who shared national or ethnic ties with stateless refugees.\n\nArendt argues that the consistent mistreatment of refugees, most of whom were placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, the rights must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state. She concluded \"The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable–even in countries whose constitutions were based upon them–whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of any sovereign state\". Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state—national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests. This restriction presents a dilemma for liberalism because liberal theorists typically are committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.\n\nIn one of her most quoted passages, she puts forward the concept that human rights are little more than an abstraction: \n\nThe conception of human rights based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships - except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.\n\nSeveral authors have written biographies that focus on the relationship between Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger. In 1999, the French feminist philosopher Catherine Clément wrote a novel, \"Martin and Hannah\", speculating on the trianglular relationship between Heidegger and the two women in his life, Arendt and Heidegger's wife Elfriede Petri. In addition to the relationships, the novel is a serious exploration of philosophical ideas, that centers on Arendt's last meeting with Heidegger in Freiburg in 1975. The scene is based on Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's description in \"Hannah Arendt: For Love of the World\" (1982), but reaches back to their childhoods, and Heidegger's role in encouraging the relationship between the two women. The novel explores Heidegger's embrace of Nazism as a proxy for that of Germany and, as in Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, the difficult relationship between collective guilt and personal responsibility. Clément also brings Hannah's other mentor and confidante, Karl Jaspers, into the matrix of relationships.\n\nArendt's life remains part of current culture and thought. In 2012 the German film, \"Hannah Arendt\", directed by Margarethe von Trotta was released. The film, with Barbara Sukowa in the title role, depicted the controversy over Arendt's coverage of the Eichmann trial and subsequent book, in which she was widely misunderstood as defending Eichmann and blaming Jewish leaders for the Holocaust.\n\nHannah Arendt is widely considered one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century. As a political theorist, moral philosopher and polemicist, she is unmatched in both range and rigor. In 1998 Walter Laqueur stated \"No twentieth-century philosopher and political thinker has at the present time as wide an echo\", as philosopher, historian, sociologist and also journalist. In popular imagination she is known primarily for the reaction to her work on Adolf Eichmann, and in particular for the one phrase \"the banality of evil\". Arendt's legacy has been described as a cult, yet she shunned publicity, never expecting, as she explained to Karl Jaspers in 1951, to see herself as a \"cover girl\" on the newsstands. In Germany, there are tours available of sites associated with her life.\n\nThe study of the life and work of Hannah Arendt, and of her political and philosophical theory is described as Arendtian. In her will she established the Hannah Arendt Bluecher Literary Trust as the custodian of her writings and photographs. Her personal library was deposited at Bard College at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, ephemera, and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment as well as her desk (in McCarthy House). The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection. Most of her papers were deposited at the Library of Congress and her correspondence with her German friends and mentors, such as Heidegger, Blumenfeld and Jaspers, at the in Marbach. The Library of Congress listed more than 50 books written about her in 1998, and that number has continued to grow, as have the number of scholarly articles, estimated as 1000 at that time.\n\nHer life and work is recognized by the institutions most closely associated with her teaching, by the creation of Hannah Arendt Centers at both Bard (Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities) and The New School, both in New York State. In Germany, her contributions to understanding authoritarianism is recognised by the Hannah-Arendt-Institut für Totalitarismusforschung (Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism) in Dresden. There are Hannah Arendt Associations (Hannah Arendt Verein) such as the Hannah Arendt Verein für politisches Denken in Bremen that awards the annual Hannah-Arendt-Preis für politisches Denken (Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thinking) established in 1995. In Oldenburg, the Hannah Arendt Center at Carl von Ossietzky University was established in 1999, and holds a large collection of her work (Hannah Arendt Archiv), and administers the internet portal \"HannahArendt.net\" (A Journal for Political Thinking) as well as a monograph series, the \"Hannah Arendt-Studien\". In Italy, the Hannah Arendt Center for Political Studies is situated at the University of Verona for Arendtian studies.\n\nIn 2017 a journal, \"Arendt Studies\", was launched to publish articles related to the study of the life, work, and legacy of Hannah Arendt. Many places associated with her, have memorabilia of her on display, such as her student card at the University of Heidelberg (\"see image\"). 2006, the anniversary of her birth, saw commemorations of her work in conferences and celebrations around the world.\n\nIn 2015, the filmmaker Ada Ushpiz produced a documentary on Hannah Arendt, \"Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt\". The \"New York Times\" designated it a New York Times critics pick. Of the many photographic portraits of Arendt, that taken in 1944 by Fred Stein (\"see image\"), whose work she greatly admired, has become iconic, and has been described as better known than the photographer himself, having appeared on a German postage stamp.(\"see image\") Among organizations that have recognized Arendt's contributions to civilization and human rights, is the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).\n\nThe rise of nativism, such as the election of Donald Trump in America, and concerns regarding an increasing authoritarian style of governance has led to radio broadcasts and writers, including Jeremy Adelman and Zoe Williams, to revisit Arendt's ideas to seek the extent to which they inform our understanding of such movements. At the same time Amazon reported that it had sold out of copies of \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" (1951). In particular Michiko Kakutani has addressed what she refers to as \"The Death of Truth\". In her book, she argues that the rise of totalitarianism has been founded on the violation of truth. She begins her book with an extensive quote from \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" \n\nThe ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e., the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (i.e., the standards of thought) no longer exist \n\nKakutani believed that Arendt's words speak not just events of a previous century but apply equally to the contemporary cultural landscape populated with fake news and lies. She also draws on Arendt's essay \"Lying in Politics\" from \"Crises in the Republic\" pointing to the lines:\n\nThe historian knows how vulnerable is the whole texture of facts in which we spend our daily life; it is always in danger of being perforated by single lies or torn to shreds by the organized lying of groups, nations, or classes, or denied and distorted, often carefully covered up by reams of falsehoods or simply allowed to fall into oblivion. Facts need testimony to be remembered and trustworthy witnesses to be established in order to find a secure dwelling place in the domain of human affairs\n\nArendt drew attention to the critical role that propaganda plays in gaslighting populations, Kakutani observes, citing the passage:\n\nIn an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true . ... The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness\n\nBut it is also relevant that Arendt took a broader perspective on history than merely totalitarianism in the early twentieth century, stating \"the deliberate falsehood and the outright lie have been used as legitimate means to achieve political ends since the beginning of recorded history\". Contemporary relevance is also reflected in the increasing use of the phrase, attributed to her, \"No one has the right to obey\" to reflect that actions result from choices, and hence judgement, and that we cannot disclaim responsibility for that which we have the power to act upon. In addition those centers established to promote Arendtian studies continue to seek solutions to a wide range of contemporary issues in her writing.\n\nArendt's teachings on obedience have also been linked to the controversial psychology experiments by Stanley Milgram, that implied that ordinary people can easily be induced to commit atrocities. Milgram himself drew attention to this in 1974, stating that he was testing the theory that Eichmann like others would merely follow orders, but unlike Milgram she argued that actions involve responsibility.\n\nArendt's theories on the political consequences of how nations deal with refugees has remained relevant and compelling. Arendt had observed first hand the displacement of large stateless and rightsless populations, treated not so much as people in need than problems to solve, and in many cases, resist. She wrote about this in her 1943 essay \"We refugees\". Another Arendtian theme that finds an echo in contemporary society is her observation, inspired by Rilke, of the despair of not being heard, the futility of tragedy that finds no listener that can bring comfort, assurance and intervention. An example of this being gun violence in America and the resulting political inaction.\n\nMany of the houses in which Hannah Arendt lived, bear commemorative plaques (\"Gedenktafeln\"), such as that shown on this page for Heidelberg, and also Marburg and Berlin. In 2017, Babelsberg announced it would erect a plaque on her home there. Her birth town of Linden, Hannover celebrates her name in a variety of ways, including a plaque. The city library has a Hannah Arendt Room, exhibiting her personal possessions. Her house bears a plaque, two schools and a road (Hannah-Arendt-Weg) near the town hall are named after her, as is the square in front of the state parliament (Hannah-Arendt-Platz). There is a Hannah Arendt Fellowship and a Hannah Arendt Chair at the Helene-Lange-Schule, while Hannover celebrates Hannah Arendt Days (Hannah Arendt Tagen). Her birthplace also has a mural on a wall in the courtyard, bearing the inscription \"Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen\" (No one has the right to obey), a saying often attributed to her as summarizing her verdict on Adolf Eichmann. Her contributions to resistance and rescue are commemorated at the Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand (German Resistance Memorial Center) in Berlin.\n\nHannah Arendt has been honoured by the use of her name in many contexts, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"Hindu astrology\" has been in use as the English equivalent of \"Jyotiṣa\" since the early 19th century, whereas \"Vedic astrology\" is a relatively recent term, entering common usage in the 1980s with self-help publications on Āyurveda or yoga. \"Vedanga Jyotishya\" is one of the earliest texts about astronomy within the Vedas. However, some authors have claimed that the horoscopic astrology practiced in the Indian subcontinent came from Hellenistic influences, post-dating the Vedic period. In the epics \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\", only electional astrology, omens, dreams and physiognomy are used.\n\nFollowing a judgement of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in 2001 which favoured astrology, some Indian universities now offer advanced degrees in Hindu astrology, despite protest from the scientific community. Astrology is rejected as pseudoscience by the scientific community.\n\nJyotiṣa is one of the Vedāṅga, the six auxiliary disciplines used to support Vedic rituals. Early jyotiṣa is concerned with the preparation of a calendar to determine dates for sacrificial rituals, with nothing written regarding planets. There are mentions of eclipse-causing \"demons\" in the Atharvaveda and Chāndogya Upaniṣad, the latter mentioning Rāhu (a shadow entity believed responsible for eclipses and meteors). The term \"graha\", which is now taken to mean planet, originally meant demon. The Ṛigveda also mentions an eclipse-causing demon, Svarbhānu, however the specific term \"graha\" was not applied to Svarbhānu until the later \"Mahābhārata\" and \"Rāmāyaṇa\".\n\nThe foundation of Hindu astrology is the notion of bandhu of the Vedas (scriptures), which is the connection between the microcosm and the macrocosm. Practice relies primarily on the sidereal zodiac, which differs from the tropical zodiac used in Western (Hellenistic) astrology in that an \"ayanāṁśa\" adjustment is made for the gradual precession of the vernal equinox. Hindu astrology includes several nuanced sub-systems of interpretation and prediction with elements not found in Hellenistic astrology, such as its system of lunar mansions (\"Nakṣatra\"). It was only after the transmission of Hellenistic astrology that the order of planets in India was fixed in that of the seven-day week. Hellenistic astrology and astronomy also transmitted the twelve zodiacal signs beginning with Aries and the twelve astrological places beginning with the ascendant. The first evidence of the introduction of Greek astrology to India is the \"Yavanajātaka\" which dates to the early centuries CE. The \"Yavanajātaka\" ( \"Sayings of the Greeks\") was translated from Greek to Sanskrit by Yavaneśvara during the 2nd century CE, and is considered the first Indian astrological treatise in the Sanskrit language. However the only version that survives is the verse version of Sphujidhvaja which dates to AD 270. The first Indian astronomical text to define the weekday was the \"Āryabhaṭīya\" of Āryabhaṭa (born AD 476).\n\nAccording to Michio Yano, Indian astronomers must have been occupied with the task of Indianizing and Sanskritizing Greek astronomy during the 300 or so years between the first \"Yavanajataka\" and the \"Āryabhaṭīya\". The astronomical texts of these 300 years are lost. The later \"Pañcasiddhāntikā\" of Varāhamihira summarizes the five known Indian astronomical schools of the sixth century. Indian astronomy preserved some of the older pre-Ptolemaic elements of Greek astronomy.\n\nThe main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the \"\", and \"Sārāvalī\" by .\nThe \"Horāshastra\" is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century. The \"Sārāvalī\" likewise dates to around 800 CE. English translations of these texts were published by N.N. Krishna Rau and V.B. Choudhari in 1963 and 1961, respectively.\n\nAstrology remains an important facet of folk belief in the contemporary lives of many Hindus. In Hindu culture, newborns are traditionally named based on their jyotiṣa charts, and astrological concepts are pervasive in the organization of the calendar and holidays, and in making major decisions such as those about marriage, opening a new business, or moving into a new home. Many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the \"fruit of karma\". The Navagraha, planetary deities, are considered subordinate to Ishvara (the Hindu concept of a supreme being) in the administration of justice. Thus, it is believed that these planets can influence earthly life.\n\nAstrology retains a position among the sciences in modern India.\n\nIndia's University Grants Commission and Ministry of Human Resource Development decided to introduce \"Jyotir Vigyan\" (i.e. \"\") or \"Vedic astrology\" as a discipline of study in Indian universities, stating that \"vedic astrology is not only one of the main subjects of our traditional and classical knowledge but this is the discipline, which lets us know the events happening in human life and in universe on time scale.\" \nThe decision was backed by a 2001 judgement of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, and some Indian universities offer advanced degrees in astrology. \nThis was met with widespread protests from the scientific community in India and Indian scientists working abroad. A petition sent to the Supreme Court of India stated that the introduction of astrology to university curricula is \"a giant leap backwards, undermining whatever scientific credibility the country has achieved so far\".\n\nIn 2004, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, concluding that the teaching of astrology did not qualify as the promotion of religion. In February 2011, the Bombay High Court referred to the 2004 Supreme Court ruling when it dismissed a case which had challenged astrology's status as a science. despite continuing complaints by scientists, astrology continues to be taught at various universities in India, and there is a movement in progress to establish a national Vedic University to teach astrology together with the study of tantra, mantra, and yoga.\n\nThere are sixteen \"Varga\" (, 'part, division'), or divisional, charts used in Hindu astrology:\n\nThe Nirayana, or sidereal zodiac, is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees, which, like the Sāyana, or tropical zodiac, is divided into 12 equal parts. Each part (of 30 degrees) is called a sign or \"rāśi\" (Sanskrit: 'part'). Vedic (Jyotiṣa) and Western zodiacs differ in the method of measurement. While synchronically, the two systems are identical, Jyotiṣa primarily uses the sidereal zodiac (in which stars are considered to be the fixed background against which the motion of the planets is measured), whereas most Western astrology uses the tropical zodiac (the motion of the planets is measured against the position of the Sun on the spring equinox). After two millennia, as a result of the precession of the equinoxes, the origin of the ecliptic longitude has shifted by about 22 degrees. As a result, the placement of planets in the Jyotiṣa system is consistent with the actual zodiac, while in western astrology the planets fall into the following constellation about two-thirds of the time.\n\nThe \"nakshatras\" or lunar mansions are 27 equal divisions of the night sky used in Hindu astrology, each identified by its prominent star(s).\n\nHistorical (medieval) Hindu astrology enumerated either 27 or 28 nakṣatras. In modern astrology, a rigid system of 27 nakṣatras is generally used, each covering 13° 20′ of the ecliptic. The missing 28th nakshatra is \"Abhijeeta\". Each nakṣatra is divided into equal quarters or \"padas\" of 3° 20′. Of greatest importance is the Abhiśeka Nakṣatra, which is held as king over the other nakṣatras. Worshipping and gaining favour over this nakṣatra is said to give power to remedy all the other nakṣatras, and is of concern in predictive astrology and mitigating Karma.\n\nThe 27 nakshatras are: \n\nThe word \"dasha\" (Devanāgarī: दशा, Sanskrit,\"\", 'planetary period') means 'state of being' and it is believed that the \"daśā\" largely governs the state of being of a person. The Daśā system shows which planets may be said to have become particularly active during the period of the Daśā. The ruling planet (the Daśānātha or 'lord of the Daśā') eclipses the mind of the person, compelling him or her to act per the nature of the planet.\n\nThere are several \"dasha\" systems, each with its own utility and area of application. There are Daśās of \"grahas\" (planets) as well as Daśās of the Rāśis (zodiac signs). The primary system used by astrologers is the Viṁśottarī Daśā system, which has been considered universally applicable in the \"kaliyuga\" to all horoscopes.\n\nThe first Mahā-Daśā is determined by the position of the natal Moon in a given Nakṣatra. The lord of the Nakṣatra governs the Daśā. Each Mahā-Dāśā is divided into sub-periods called \"bhuktis\", or \"antar-daśās\", which are proportional divisions of the maha-dasa. Further proportional sub-divisions can be made, but error margins based on accuracy of the birth time grow exponentially. The next sub-division is called \"pratyantar-daśā\", which can in turn be divided into \"sookshma-antardasa\", which can in turn be divided into \"praana-antardaśā\", which can be sub-divided into \"deha-antardaśā\". Such sub-divisions also exist in all other Daśā systems.\n\nThe Navagraha (nine \"graha\"; Devanāgarī: ग्रह, Sanskrit: , 'seizing, laying hold of, holding')) describe nine celestial bodies used in Hindu astrology.\n\nThe Navagraha are said to be forces that capture or eclipse the mind and the decision making of human beings, thus the term \"graha\". When the \"grahas\" are active in their Daśās or periodicities they are said to be particularly empowered to direct the affairs of people and events.\n\nGemstones are considered of use in strengthening the favourable influence of planets in the horoscope. The benefic planets of a horoscope are the lords of the kendra (first, fourth, seventh and tenth house) and the trikonas (first, fifth and ninth house).\n\nThe Navagraha, their corresponding astronomical bodies (when such exist), and their associated gemstones are:\n\nRahu and Ketu do not correspond to real astronomical bodies. They are described as \"shadow planets\" with an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other, being diametrically opposed twins. Rahu's cycle approximates the pattern of solar and lunar eclipses for which Rahu is believed to be the cause.\n\nA natal chart shows the position of the \"grahas\" at the moment of birth. Since that moment, the \"grahas\" have continued to move around the zodiac, interacting with the natal chart grahas. This period of interaction is called \"gochara\" (Sanskrit: \"\", 'transit').\n\nThe study of transits is based on the transit of the Moon (Chandra), which spans roughly two days, and also on the movement of Mercury (Budha) and Venus (Śukra) across the celestial sphere, which is relatively fast as viewed from Earth. The movement of the slower planets – Jupiter (Guru), Saturn (Śani) and Rāhu–Ketu — is always of considerable importance. Astrologers study the transit of the Daśā lord from various reference points in the horoscope.\n\nIn Hindu astronomy, \"yoga\" (Sanskrit: \"\", 'union') is a combination of planets placed in a specific relationship to each other.\n\nRāja yogas are perceived as givers of fame, status and authority, and are typically formed by the association of the Lord of Keṅdras/quadrants, when reckoned from the Lagna/ascendant, and the Lords of the Tṛkoṇa/trines. The Rāja yogas are culminations of the blessings of Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī. Some planets, such as Mars for Leo Lagna, do not need another \"graha\" to create \"Rājayoga\", but are capable of giving \"Rājayoga\" suo-moto due to their own lordship of the 4th Bhāva and the 9th Bhāva from the Lagna, the two being a Keṅdra and Tṛkoṇa Bhāva respectively.\n\nDhana Yogas are formed by the association of wealth-giving planets such as the Dhaneśa or the 2nd Lord and the Lābheśa or the 11th Lord from the Lagna. Dhana Yogas are also formed due to the auspicious placement of the Dārāpada/ A7, when reckoned from the Ārūḍha Lagna (AL). The combination of the Lagneśa and the Bhāgyeśa also leads to wealth through the Lakṣmī Yoga.\n\nSanyāsa Yogas are formed due to the placement of four or more \"grahas\", excluding the Sun, in a Keṅdra Bhāva from the Lagna.\n\nThere are some overarching yogas in Jyotiṣa such as Amāvasyā Doṣa, Kāla Sarpa Yoga-Kāla Amṛta Yoga and Graha Mālika Yoga that can take precedence oveYamaha yogar planetary placements in the horoscope.\n\nThe Hindu Jātaka, or birth chart, is the Bhāva Cakra (Sanskrit: 'division' 'wheel'), the complete 360° circle of life, divided into houses, and represents a way of enacting the influences in the wheel. Each house has associated kāraka (Sanskrit: 'significator') planets that can alter the interpretation of a particular house. Each Bhāva spans an arc of 30° with twelve Bhāvas in any chart of the horoscope. These are a crucial part of any horoscopic study since the Bhāvas, understood as 'state of being', personalize the Rāśis/ Rashis to the native and each Rāśi/ Rashi apart from indicating its true nature reveals its impact on the person based on the Bhāva occupied. The best way to study the various facets of Jyotiṣa is to see their role in chart evaluation of actual persons and how these are construed.\n\n\"Drishti\" (Sanskrit: \"\", 'sight') is an aspect to an entire house. \"Grahas\" cast only forward aspects, with the furthest aspect being considered the strongest. For example, Mars aspects the 4th, 7th, and 8th houses from its position, and its 8th house aspect is considered more powerful than its 7th aspect, which is in turn more powerful than its 4th aspect.\n\nThe principle of Dristi (aspect) was devised on the basis of the aspect of an army of planets as deity and demon in a war field. Thus the Sun, a deity king with only one full aspect, is more powerful than the demon king Saturn, which has three full aspects.\n\nAspects can be cast both by the planets (Graha Dṛṣṭi) and by the signs (Rāśi Dṛṣṭi). Planetary aspects are a function of desire, while sign aspects are a function of awareness and cognizance.\n\nThere are some higher aspects of Graha Dṛṣṭi (planetary aspects) that are not limited to the Viśeṣa Dṛṣṭi or the special aspects. Rāśi Dṛṣṭi works based on the following formulaic structure: all movable signs aspect fixed signs except the one adjacent, and all dual and mutable signs aspect each other without exception.\n\nAstrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.\n\nAstrologers in Indian astrology make grand claims without taking adequate controls into consideration. Saturn was in Aries in 1909, 1939 and 1968, yet the astrologer Bangalore Venkata Raman claimed that \"when Saturn was in Aries in 1939 England had to declare war against Germany\", ignoring the two other dates. Astrologers regularly fail in attempts to predict election results in India, and fail to predict major events such as the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Predictions by the head of the Indian Astrologers Federation about war between India and Pakistan in 1982 also failed.\n\nIn 2000, when several planets happened to be close to one another, astrologers predicted that there would be catastrophes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves. This caused an entire sea-side village in the Indian state of Gujarat to panic and abandon their houses. The predicted events did not occur and the vacant houses were burgled.\n\nIn one test, 27 Indian astrologers, with the appropriate horoscopes, failed to determine the intelligence difference between 100 mentally bright and 100 mentally handicapped children at a rate higher than that determined by chance alone in a double blind test. The astrologers had, on average, 14 years experience. A team of astrologers from one astrologers institute also performed at chance expectation. The president of the Maharashtra Astrological Society claimed to be able to predict sex and intelligence 60 per cent of the time each, but he performed no better than chance in double blind conditions.\n\n\nPopular treatments:\n"}

{"id": "711424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=711424", "title": "Imitation of God", "text": "Imitation of God\n\nImitation of God () is the religious precept of Man finding salvation by attempting to realize his concept of supreme being. It is found in ancient Greek philosophy and several world religions. In some branches of Christianity, however, it plays a key role.\n\nThe phrase \"Imitatio Dei\" in its Genitive Form is Imitation of a God as in a Demigod; rather than imitating God.\n\nSome scholars, such as Cyril Rodd, argue that the concept is not important in the ethics of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nThe concept of \"imitatio Dei\" - generally taken to be a \"mitzvah\" - in Judaism is derived, in part, from the concept of \"imago Dei\" - being made in the image of God. Not only do people in the Torah aspire to take on godly virtues, they are aided by the depiction of God as a human - anthropomorphism. The concept is arguably best expressed in the following quote, taken from \"Leviticus\":\n\nSpeak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: 'Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.\nThis concept was later to become part of the basis of rabbinic Judaism. Jews are exhorted to perform acts of kindness similar to the ones ascribed to God. Examples are burying the dead (as God buried Moses), visiting the sick (as God visited Abraham) and some very similar \"mitzvot\". The Talmud states: \"As He is merciful, so should you be merciful\".\n\n\"Imitatio Dei\" appears in one form or another in Plato, Aristotle (where not only humans but everything else 'strives' toward the Unmoved Mover), and the Stoic philosophers.\n\nThe Christian disciple is told to imitate God on several occasions. Matthew 5:48 states, \"Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\" Luke 6:36 states, \"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\" In Ephesians 5, they are told by Paul to \"Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children\". The believer is also advised to follow the ways of Jesus, notably in 1 Corinthians 11:1: \"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.\"\n\nThe Imitation of God is one of the core principles in Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, as well as in Oriental Orthodoxy (Syriac Orthodoxy, Coptic Orthodoxy, Ethiopian Orthodoxy, and the Armenian Apostolic faith).\nThe Catholic Church fully endorses the concept of \"Imitatio Dei/Christi\". In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, it is integrally related to the concept of \"Divinization/Theosis\".\n\nThe general understanding is that a person can become more similar to God over time, a process called \"theosis\" in Greek. This doctrine derives from the biblical mandate to be holy as God is Holy (Lev 20.26). It can be achieved by purification (\"katharsis\") and illumination (\"theoria\"), the highest point in illumination is the union with God. The best imitation of God is not only the man's effort, but it is mainly achieved by the grace of God. Nevertheless, Eastern Orthodox theology does not usually understand this tri-partite ascent as an attempt to become like God, but as a way to unite with the one God. For most Orthodox theologians imitatio Dei is not the way to salvation, if it is understood as an individual, personal attempt to become god-like.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism the same concepts have been treated under different names (\"Via purgativa\", \"via iluminativa\" and \"via unitiva\") by St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Avila. \"Via purgativa\" is the Roman Catholic equivalent to \"katharsis\", and \"theoria\" is subdivided between illumination and full mystical union. This three-step scheme is also found in the Eastern categories of prayer; ordinary prayer, prayer with mind and heart, and unceasing prayer.\n\nIn Protestantism, the picture is different. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition \"Imitatio dei\" is widely accepted, whereas the Lutheran tradition prefers to talk of \"conformitas\" (in German \"Nachfolge\") instead of \"Nachahmung\" (imitation), because Jesus was singular and cannot and need not be imitated, but followed.\n\nThough lacking an official scripture, the practice of Deism is described by Thomas Paine in \"The Age of Reason\": \"The true Deist has but one Deity, and his religion consists in contemplating the power, wisdom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in endeavoring to imitate him in everything moral, scientifically, and mechanical.\" He also explains that the works of the Deity are strictly found in \"the Creation we behold\" where \"God speaketh universally to man.\" Paine gives an example when he condemns the doctrine of loving the enemy, in which he states, \"We imitate the moral character of the Creator by forbearing with each other, for he forbears with all.\"\n\n\n"}

An international day for yoga was declared unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice originated in India. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his UN address suggested the date of 21 June, as it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and shares a special significance in many parts of the world.\n\nThe idea of International Day of Yoga was first proposed by the current Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi during his speech at the UNGA, on 27 September 2014. He stated:\n\nFollowing this initial proposal, the UNGA held informal consultations on the draft resolution entitled \"International Day of Yoga\", on 14 October 2014. The consultations were convened by the delegation of India.\nIn 2015 Reserve Bank of India issued a 10 rupees commemorative coin to mark the International Day of Yoga.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, India's Permanent Representative Asoke Mukherji introduced the draft resolution in UNGA. The draft text received broad support from 177 Member States who sponsored the text, which was adopted without a vote. This initiative found support from many global leaders. A total of 177 nations co-sponsored the resolution, which is the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA resolution of such nature.\n\nWhen proposing 21 June as the date, Modi said that the date was the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere (shortest in the southern hemisphere), having special significance in many parts of the world. From the perspective of yoga, the summer solstice marks the transition to Dakshinayana. The second full moon after summer solstice is known as Guru Poornima. Shiva, the first yogi (Adi Yogi), is said to have begun imparting the knowledge of yoga to the rest of mankind on this day, and became the first guru (Adi Guru). Dakshinayana is also considered a time when there is natural support for those pursuing spiritual practices.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the UN resolution, several leaders of the spiritual movement in India voiced their support for the initiative. The founder of Isha Foundation, Sadhguru, stated, \"this could be a kind of a foundation stone to make scientific approach to the inner well-being of the human being, a worldwide thing... It's a tremendous step for the world.\" The founder of Art of Living, Ravi Shankar, lauded the efforts of Modi, saying, \"It is very difficult for any philosophy, religion or culture to survive without state patronage. Yoga has existed so far almost like an orphan. Now, official recognition by the UN would further spread the benefit of yoga to the entire world.\"\n\nThe first International Day of Yoga was observed all over the world on 21 June 2015. The Ministry of AYUSH made the necessary arrangements in India. 35,985 people, including Narendra Modi and a large number of dignitaries from 84 nations, performed 21 yoga asanas (postures) for 35 minutes at Rajpath in New Delhi. The day devoted to yoga was observed by millions across the world. NCC cadets entered the \"Limca Book of Records\" for the \"largest yoga performance simultaneously by a single uniformed youth organisation\" by performing at multiple venues.\n\nThe event at Rajpath established two Guinness world records awarded to the Ministry of AYUSH and received by AYUSH minister Shripad Yesso Naik. The two records were for the largest yoga class, featuring 35,985 people, and for the largest number of participating nationalities (84 nations). In San Francisco, 5,000 participants gathered in the Marina Green park to practice yoga.\n\nA senior government official said, \"The government of India has decided to take forward the momentum created by International Day of Yoga, 2015 with greater and more active participation of youth during the current year celebrations.\" The ministry organized an event titled \"The National Event of Mass Yoga Demonstration\" at Chandigarh, which was to be attended by the Indian Prime Minister.\n\nIndia's Permanent Mission to the UN organized celebrations at the United Nations on 20 and 21 June 2016. A special event titled \"Conversation with Yoga Masters – Yoga for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\" was the centerpiece. Sadhguru was the main speaker at the event.\n\nIn Lucknow, the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi participated in the event and practiced yoga along with 51,000 participants. Many business leaders in India also took part in the event. In New York, thousands of participants gathered to practice yoga on Times Square. Japan created a Parliamentary League for the promotion of yoga just prior to the event, in April 2017. In China, the largest gathering was 10,000 participants in the city of Wuxi. In Athens, the event took place on 25 June as part of the Greek \"Open Yoga Day\" and in Kyiv, the event happened on 18 June and gathered a few hundred participants. In Ireland, participants met in the round room of the City Hall in Dublin.\n\nThe event in Dehradun was held at the Forest Research Institute. PM Modi led an estimated 50,000 volunteers to mark the fourth anniversary of International Yoga Day. The theme for 2018 was \"Yoga for Peace\". Over 1 lakh people gathered at a yoga session in Kota, Rajasthan and performed yoga together, earning the city a Guinness World Record.\n\n"}

Carl Linnaeus said he was the \"greatest natural botanist in the world.\"\n\nBartram was born into a Quaker farm family in colonial Pennsylvania. He considered himself a plain farmer, with no formal education beyond the local school. He had a lifelong interest in medicine and medicinal plants, and read widely. His botanical career started with a small area of his farm devoted to growing plants he found interesting; later he made contact with European botanists and gardeners interested in North American plants, and developed his hobby into a thriving business.\n\nHe came to travel extensively in the eastern American colonies collecting plants. In 1743 he visited the shores of Lake Ontario in the north, and wrote \"Observations on the Inhabitants, Climate, Soil, Rivers, Productions, Animals, and other Matters Worthy of Notice, made by Mr. John Bartram in his Travels from Pennsylvania to Onondaga, Oswego, and the Lake Ontario, in Canada\" (London, 1751). During the winter of 1765/66 he visited East Florida in the south, and an account of this trip was published with his journal (London, 1766). He also visited the Ohio River in the west. Many of his acquisitions were transported to collectors in Europe. In return, they supplied him with books and apparatus.\n\nBartram, sometimes called the \"father of American Botany\", was one of the first practicing Linnaean botanists in North America. His plant specimens were forwarded to Linnaeus, Dillenius and Gronovius, and he assisted Linnaeus' student Pehr Kalm during his extended collecting trip to North America in 1748–1750.\n\nBartram was aided in his collecting efforts by colonists. In Bartram's \"Diary of a Journey through the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida\", a trip taken from July 1, 1765, to April 10, 1766, Bartram wrote of specimens he had collected. In the colony of British East Florida he was helped by Dr. David Yeats, secretary of the colony.\n\nHis botanic garden, Bartram's Garden in Kingsessing on the west bank of the Schuylkill, about 3 miles (5 km) from the center of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is frequently cited as the first true botanic collection in North America. He was one of the co-founders, with Benjamin Franklin, of the American Philosophical Society in 1743.\n\nBartram was particularly instrumental in sending seeds from the New World to European gardeners: many North American trees and flowers were first introduced into cultivation in Europe by this route. Beginning ca. 1733, Bartram's work was assisted by his association with the English merchant Peter Collinson. Collinson, himself a lover of plants, was a fellow Quaker and a member of the Royal Society, with a familiar relationship with its president, Sir Hans Sloane. Collinson shared Bartram's new plants with friends and fellow gardeners. Early Bartram collections went to Lord Petre, Philip Miller at the Chelsea Physic Garden, Mark Catesby, the Duke of Richmond, and the Duke of Norfolk. In the 1730s, Robert James Petre, 8th Baron Petre of Thorndon Hall, Essex, was the foremost collector of North American trees and shrubs in Europe. Earl Petre's untimely death in 1743 led to his American tree collection being auctioned off to Woburn, Goodwood and other large English country estates; thereafter Collinson became Bartram's chief London agent.\n\nBartram's Boxes, as they then became known, were regularly sent to Peter Collinson every fall for distribution in England to a wide list of clients, including the Duke of Argyll, James Gordon, James Lee and John Busch, progenitor of the exotic Loddiges nursery in London. The boxes generally contained 100 or more varieties of seeds, and sometimes included dried plant specimens and natural history curiosities as well. Live plants were more difficult and expensive to send and were reserved for Collinson and a few special correspondents.\n\nIn 1765 after lobbying by Collinson and Benjamin Franklin in London, George III rewarded Bartram a pension of £50 per year as King's Botanist for North America, a post he held until his death. With this position, Bartram's seeds and plants also went to the royal collection at Kew Gardens. Bartram also contributed seeds to the Oxford and Edinburgh botanic gardens. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm in 1769.\n\nMost of Bartram's many plant discoveries were named by botanists in Europe. He is best known today for the discovery and introduction of a wide range of North American flowering trees and shrubs, including kalmia, rhododendron and magnolia species; for introducing the \"Dionaea muscipulia\" or Venus flytrap to cultivation; and the discovery of the Franklin Tree, \"Franklinia alatamaha\" in southeastern Georgia in 1765, later named by his son William Bartram. Bartram's name is remembered in the genera of mosses, \"Bartramia\", and in plants such the North American serviceberry, \"Amelanchier bartramiana\", and the subtropical tree \"Commersonia\" \"bartramia\" (Christmas Kurrajong) growing from the Bellinger River in coastal eastern Australia to Cape York, Vanuatu and Malaysia.\n\nBartram was married twice, first in 1723 to Mary Maris (d. 1727), who bore him two sons, Richard and Isaac. After her death, he married Ann Mendenhall (1703–1789) in 1729, who gave birth to five boys and four girls. His third son, William Bartram (1739–1823) was to become a famous botanist, natural history artist and ornithologist in his own right, and was the author of \"Travels Through North & South Carolina, Georgia, East & West Florida,….\" Philadelphia, James & Johnson, 1791.\n\nThe family business in North American plants was continued by Bartram's sons John Bartram, Jr. and William Bartram after the American Revolution, and the botanic garden grew through three generations of the Bartram family. Bartram's Garden remained the major botanic garden in Philadelphia until the last Bartram heirs sold out in 1850. The Darby Friends Cemetery in Darby, Pennsylvania contains his grave.\n\nJohn Bartram High School in Philadelphia is named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

His philosophy combined existentialism, Catholicism, and Lithuanian nationalism. Together with Antanas Maceina and Stasys Šalkauskis, Girnius became a cornerstone of modern Lithuanian philosophy. In 1994, he was awarded the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas.\n\nIn 1932, he enrolled for philosophy studies at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas. He studied at European universities, including Catholic University of Leuven, University of Freiburg, and Collège de France, where he attended lectures by Martin Heidegger. Girnius became interested in existentialism and chose this theme for his graduation thesis, titled \"The Principles of Heidegger's Existential Philosophy\". During 1941–1943 he lectured at Vytautas Magnus University. At the end of World War II, he left Lithuania as a displaced person. While in Germany he published a pamphlet on the Lithuanian character. In this work, Girnius favorably compared the Lithuanians with neighboring nationalities and concluded that they are warmer than the Germans and more open than the Russians. In 1949, Girnius settled in the United States. \n\nIn 1951, Montreal University (Canada) awarded him PhD for his thesis \"Liberty and Being. Existential Metaphysics of Karl Jaspers\" (original in French: \"La metaphysique existentielle de K. Jaspers\"). Thus educated in Lithuania and Western universities, Girnius managed to avoid influence of Russian philosophers, common among other Lithuanian thinkers. In 1964 he published his major work \"A Man Without God\" (original in Lithuanian: \"Žmogus be Dievo\"), a psychological analysis of non-believers. Girnius expressed his concerns regarding spreading atheism. According to him, believers strive for infinity while those who reject god lead empty lives. Later he devoted himself to Lithuanian cultural activity, editing Lithuanian encyclopedias (1953–1969) and \"Aidai\" (1965–1980), participating in various events or organizations, including Ateitininkai (a Lithuanian Catholic organization).\n"}

{"id": "2566535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2566535", "title": "Levee (ceremony)", "text": "Levee (ceremony)\n\nThe levee (from the French word \"lever\", meaning \"getting up\" or \"rising\") was traditionally a daily moment of intimacy and accessibility to a monarch or leader. It started out as a royal custom, but, in America, it later came to refer to a reception by the king’s representatives and, even later, by the president.\n\nIn Einhard's \"Life of Charlemagne\", the author recounts the Emperor's practice, when he was dressing and putting on his shoes, to invite his friends to come in and, in case of a dispute brought to his attention, \"he would order the disputants to be brought in there and then, hear the case as if he were sitting in tribunal and pronounce a judgement.\"\n\nBy the second half of the sixteenth century, it had become a formal event, requiring invitation. In 1563 Catherine de' Medici wrote in advice to her son, the King of France, to do as his father (Henry II) had done and uphold the practice of \"lever\". Catherine describes that Henry II allowed his subjects, from nobles to household servants, to come in while he dressed. She states this pleased his subjects and improved their opinion of him.\n\nThis practice was raised to a ceremonial custom at the court of King Louis XIV. In the court etiquette that Louis formalised, the set of extremely elaborate conventions was divided into the \"grand lever\", attended by the full court in the gallery outside the king's bedchamber, and the \"petit lever\" that transpired in degrees in the king's chamber, where only a very select group might serve the king as he rose and dressed. In fact, the king had often risen early and put in some hours hunting before returning to bed for the start of the \"lever\". Louis's grandson, King Philip V of Spain, and his queen typically spent all morning in bed, as reported by Saint-Simon, to avoid the pestering by ministers and courtiers that began with the lever.\n\nThe king's retiring ceremony proceeded in reverse order and was known as the \"coucher\".\n\nThe successors of Louis XIV were not as passionate about the Sun King's daily routine and, over time, the frequency of the \"lever\" and \"coucher\" decreased, much to the dismay of their courtiers.\n\nWhen the court of Charles II of England adopted the custom, first noted as an English usage in 1672, it was called a \"levée\". In the 18th century, as the fashionable dinner hour was incrementally moved later into the afternoon, the morning reception of the British monarch, attended only by gentlemen, was shifted forward towards noon.\n\nThe practice of holding court levées was continued by the British Monarchy until 1939. These took the form of a formal reception at St James's Palace at which officials, diplomats, and military officers of all three armed services, were presented individually to the sovereign. Full dress uniform or court dress was worn by all participants, who formed a queue in the Throne Room before stepping forward when their names and ranks were called. Each then bowed to the king who was seated on a dais with male members of his family, officials of the Royal Household and senior officers behind him. \n\nLevée ceremonies were held by regal representatives of the British Empire, such as the Viceroy of India, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and the Governor-General or Governors of Australia. The ceremonial event of the Canadian Governor General's New Year's Day reception is still called his levée.\n\nBy the 1760s, the custom was being copied by the colonial governors in British America, but was abandoned in the United States following the American Revolutionary War. Beginning in 1789, President George Washington and First Lady Martha Washington held weekly public gatherings and receptions at the presidential mansion that were called levees. Designed to give the public access to the president and to project a dignified public image of the presidency, they were continued by John and Abigail Adams, but were discarded in 1801 by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe ceremony at Versailles has been described in detail by Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon. Louis XIV was a creature of habit and the inflexible routine that tired or irritated his heirs served him well. Wherever the king had actually slept, he was discovered sleeping in the close-curtained state bed standing in its alcove, which was separated from the rest of the \"chambre du roi\" by a gilded balustrade. He was woken at eight o'clock by his head valet de chambre —Alexandre Bontemps held this post for most of the reign — who alone had slept in the bedchamber. The chief physician, the chief surgeon and Louis' childhood nurse, as long as she lived, all entered at the same time, and the nurse kissed him. The night chamberpot was removed.\n\nThen the curtains of the bed were drawn once again and, at a quarter past eight, the Grand Chamberlain was called, bringing with him the nobles who had the privilege of the \"grande entrée\", a privilege that could be purchased, subject to the king's approval, but which was restricted in Louis' time to the nobles. The King remained in bed, in his nightshirt and a short wig. The Grand Chamberlain of France or, in his absence, the Chief Gentleman of the Bedchamber presented holy water to the king from a vase that stood at the head of the bed and the king's morning clothes were laid out. First, the Master of the Bedchamber and the First Servant, both high nobles, pulled the king's nightshirt over his head, one grasping each sleeve. The Grand Chamberlain presented the day shirt which, according to Saint-Simon, had been shaken out and sometimes changed, because the king perspired freely. This was a moment for any of those with the privilege of the \"grande entrée\" to have a swift private word with the king, which would have been carefully rehearsed beforehand to express a request as deferentially, but in as few words as possible. The King was given a missal and the gentlemen retired into the adjoining \"chambre du conseil\" (the \"council chamber\") while there was a brief private prayer for the King.\n\nWhen the King had them recalled, now accompanied by those who had the lesser privilege of the \"première entrée\", his process of dressing began. Louis preferred to dress himself \"for he did almost everything himself, with address and grace\", Saint-Simon remarked. The King was handed a dressing-gown, and a mirror was held for him, for he had no toilet table like ordinary gentlemen. Every other day the King shaved himself. Now, other privileged courtiers were admitted, a few at a time, at each stage, so that, as the King was putting on his shoes and stockings, \"everyone\" — in Saint-Simon's view — was there. This was the \"entrée de la chambre\", which included the king's readers and the director of the \"Menus Plaisirs\", that part of the royal establishment in charge of all preparations for ceremonies, events and festivities, to the last detail of design and order. At the \"entrée de la chambre\" were admitted the Grand Aumônier and the Marshal of France and the king's ministers and secretaries. A fifth entrée now admitted ladies for the first time, and a sixth entrée admitted, from a privileged position at a cramped backdoor, the king's children, legitimate and illegitimate indiscriminately — in scandalous fashion Saint-Simon thought — and their spouses.\n\nThe crowd in the \"chambre du Roi\" can be estimated from Saint-Simon's remark of the King's devotions, which followed: the King knelt at his bedside \"where all the clergy present knelt, the cardinals without cushions, all the laity remaining standing\".\n\nThe King then passed into the \"cabinet\" where all those who possessed any court office attended him. He then announced what he expected to do that day and was left alone with those among his favourites of the royal children born illegitimately (whom he had publicly recognised and legitimated) and a few favourites, with the valets. These were less pressing moments to discuss projects with the King, who parcelled out his attention with strict regard for the current standing of those closest to him.\nWith the entry of the King into the \"Grande Galerie\", where the rest of the court awaited him, the \"petit lever\" was finished, and with the \"grand lever\" the day was properly begun, as the king proceeded to daily Mass, sharing brief words as he progressed and even receiving some petitions. It was of these occasions that the King habitually remarked, in refusing a favour asked for some noble, \"We never see him\", meaning that he did not spend enough time at Versailles, where Louis wanted to keep the nobility penned up, to prevent them interesting themselves in politics.\n\nAmong the aristocracy, the levée could also become a crowded and social occasion, especially for women, who liked to put off the donning of their uncomfortable formal clothes, and whose hair and perhaps make-up needed prolonged attention. There is a famous depiction of the levée of an 18th-century Viennese lady of the court in Richard Strauss's later opera \"Der Rosenkavalier\", where she has her hair dressed while surrounded by a disorderly crowd of tradesmen touting for work or payment, and other petitioners, followed by a visit from a cousin. The second scene of William Hogarth's \"A Rake's Progress\" shows a male equivalent in 1730s London.\n\nIn the French engraving \"Le Lever\" after Freudenberg, of the 1780s (\"illustration, right\"), gentle social criticism is levelled at the lady of the court; that she slept without unlacing her stays, apparently, perhaps can be seen as artistic licence. Her maids dress her with deference, while the wallclock under the hangings of her \"lit à la polonaise\" appears to read noon.\n\nIn Sophia Coppola's \"Marie Antoinette\" the levée of the French queen, during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI is represented.\n\n\n"}

A date of January 20, 1565 has been suggested, but the source for this is unknown. Likewise nothing is known of his family, except that he was of noble origin, or of his education. He became a member of the Accademia Fiorentina when Francesco Nori was its consul and was also a member of the Consiglio dei Dugento, the advisory body to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He was said to be tall and very thin with a long white beard, a little bald head and sunken eyes. He wore a fleece jacket and a large collar. Because of his appearance and his lonely and melancholy character he was nicknamed 'the Superintendent of Limbo' by the satirical poet Francesco Ruspoli. One of his brothers, Raffaello delle Colombe (1557–1627), was the Dominican Prior of Santa Maria Novella, who denounced Galileo from his pulpit.\n\nIn October 1604, a new star was seen. By night, it was the brightest star in the sky, and it was visible during the day for more than three weeks, before eventually dimming. In 1606, Delle Colombe published his discourse on the phenomenon, dedicated to Alessandro Marzi Medici, the Archbishop of Florence. In his work delle Colombe argued that the star was not new, but permanent, though only occasionally visible. This argument echoed that of Johannes van Heeck in supporting the generally-accepted model of the universe, known as the Aristotelian model or the Ptolmaic system. This held that the stars were fixed in their positions and unchanging; thus if an unusual event took place among the stars, this suggested that they could not be fixed in a 'firmament'. By arguing that the star was permanent rather than new, Delle Colombe defended the Aristotelian view, while suggesting reasons for why it had not previously been observed. In support of these arguments, delle Colombe drew not only on astronomical observations but on the authority of Aristotle, and of many other Peripatetic thinkers, including the Conimbricenses, Gasparo Contarini, and Julius Caesar Scaliger.\n\nGalileo, then a professor at the University of Padua, lectured on the supernova, proposing different possible ways it could have been produced. Galileo was cautious in his views, but did regard the phenomenon as new, and not as a permanent star. A few months after delle Colombe's book appeared, a response to his ideas was published under the title of \"Considerations of Alimberto Mauri on Some Passages in the Discourse of Lodovico delle Colombe\". Alimberto Mauri was a pseudonym and delle Colombe (like most scholars since) believed that the author was Galileo. The book ridiculed many of delle Colombe's views about the star, and belittled him as 'nostro colombo' ('our pigeon'). It asserted that astronomy had no need of Aristotelian philosophy, and should focus on observation and mathematics. The approach of first seeing something in the sky and then developing an elaborate explanation to make that observation fit with Aristotelian cosmology was directly challenged. Delle Colombe himself then responded to 'Mauri' by publishing \"Risposte piacevoli e curiose\" (\"Pleasant and curious replies\") in 1608. In this text delle Colombe not only attacked the ideas of Copernicus, but associated them with Galileo by name.\n\nThe disputes between delle Colombe and Galileo grew more protracted when Galileo first published new findings which challenged Artistotelian cosmology, and then moved from Padua to Florence. In 1609 Galileo had built a telescope, through which he had observed the moons of Jupiter, as well as the mountains and craters on the moon. In March 1610 he published his findings in \"Siderius Nuncius\" (\"The Starry Messenger\"), which he dedicated to Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, naming the moons of Jupiter the 'Medician stars'. He then negotiated with the Grand Duke to secure for himself the position of Philosopher and Chief Mathematician at the court in Florence.\n\nGalileo barely mentioned the motion of the earth in \"Siderius Nuncius\", as its focus was on his new discoveries. Nevertheless in his discussion of earthshine he implied that the earth changes its position rather than remaining static, and then added:\n\n' \"Let these few remarks suffice us here concerning this matter, which will be more fully treated in our System of the World. In that book, by a multitude of arguments and experiences, the solar reflection from the earth will be shown to be quite real-against those who argue that the earth must be excluded from the dancing whirl of stars for the specific reason that it is devoid of motion and of light. We shall prove the earth to be a wandering body surpassing the moon in splendor, and not the sink of all dull refuse of the universe; this we shall support by an infinitude of arguments drawn from nature\" '\n\nGalileo may have been trying to quietly introduce his more speculative ideas about the universe among the empirical observations made with his telescope, but these few sentences gave delle Colombe sufficient grounds to attack him at an apparent weak point, in an attempt to force him to defend the motion of the earth specifically. In 1610, delle Colombe contested Galileo’s views – though he did not mention Galileo by name – in his leaflet \"Contro il Moto della Terra\" (\"Against the Motion of the Earth\"). It was not printed, but circulated in manuscript form, mostly in Florence.\n\nThe text introduced a number of objections to the idea of the earth's motion, which appealed to common sense. He began by pointing out that mathematics was not an adequate tool for describing nature, since it dealt only with abstractions and might therefore predict phenomena which did not actually occur. Then he proceeded to outline some thought experiments. If a cannon was fired due east, the ball moved in the direction of the earth's rotation; if fired to the west, the ball moved against the earth's rotation. Since the ball lands the same distance from the cannon in either case, the earth cannot be moving. Likewise if a crossbow were shot directly upwards, the bolt would land some way from the archer rather than at his feet, if the earth moved.\n\nThe final section of this work marked a shift in the arguments put forward by delle Colombe – instead of simply defending Aristotle or challenging Galileo for empirical proofs, he introduced a series of scriptural and theological objections to his claims. (Galileo appears to have used delle Colombe's arguments as the basis for those of the character Simplicio in his 1632 work Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems). Delle Colombe was the first writer to use biblical text against Galileo.\n\nGalileo decided not to respond to delle Colombe's invitation to argue his case about literal and other readings of holy text, saying that as 'Contra il Moto della Terra' had only been circulated in manuscript and not published, there was no reason for him to reply.\n\nWhile the main arguments in 'Contro il Moto della Terra' are concerned with the earth's motion, delle Colombe also responded to Galileo's claim that the surface of the moon was rough and mountainous. It was a basic tenet of Aristotelian cosmology that the planets were all perfect spheres. He therefore speculated that the apparent mountains Galileo had seen were not mountains at all, but merely dense 'ripples' of matter with a pure and transparent material filling the gaps between them to make a perfect sphere. Once again, he was devising speculative answers to reconcile Aristotelian ideas with empirical observations.\n\nIn 1611 delle Colombe pursued this matter in a letter to Christopher Clavius hoping to enlist his support, but Clavius did not reply. Galileo soon obtained a copy of delle Colombe's letter to Clavius, and responded by writing to a friend, confirming his opinion about the Moon’s surface, emphasising delle Colombe's incompetence in astronomy, and ridiculing him as \"pippione\" (pigeon). However, as delle Colombe's views were not published, Galileo did not publicly respond either. Indeed Galileo, who privately ridiculed delle Colombe mercilessly, never gave him the satisfaction of a formal public response to his challenges. Although delle Colombe enjoyed the support of Archbishop Alessandro Marzi Medici and of Don Giovanni de' Medici, his patron was never the Archduke himself or any other very senior figure, and it may be that Galileo simply refused to engage directly with him for this reason.\n\nIn July 1611 a debate about the nature of cold was held at the house of Galileo's friend Filippo Salviati, with two Aristotelians, Vincenzo di Grazia and Giorgio Coresio. The Aristotelians held that ice was condensed water, which floated because of its flat, thin shape; Galileo, whose view was informed by Archimedes, maintained that ice was rarified water, which floated because it was less dense than the water supporting it. As the discussion developed, Galileo took the position that all bodies denser than water sink, while all lighter than water float, regardless of their shape. Three days after this first encounter, di Grazia visited Galileo, and told him that a friend had volunteered to disprove Galileo's position by demonstration. This was delle Colombe. Galileo signed an agreement setting out the terms of the demonstrations both parties were to prepare, and a date was set for them to meet and present their cases in mid-August at the house of Canon Francesco Nori.\n\nIn the days before this proposed meeting, delle Colombe took his demonstration to the streets and public places of Florence to show how easily he could prove Galileo wrong. As he showed, a thin strip of ebony floated on water, while a sphere of the same material sank. This, he maintained, showed that shape, not density, determined whether an object would float. However delle Colombe never actually appeared on the agreed day for the planned demonstrations, suggesting that he perhaps understood that his demonstration relied on the particular effects of the surface tension of water rather than on the shapes of his pieces of ebony. Galileo then proposed that they meet on a new date at Salviati's house, and that on this occasion the objects to be placed on the water should all be thoroughly wetted first (which would have removed the surface tension effect). However when delle Colombe arrived on the appointed day he found that Galileo was unwilling to proceed as they had agreed. Apparently the Grand Duke had rebuked him for involving himself in a vulgar public spectacle, and Galileo therefore said that he would commit his proofs to writing rather than undertake public demonstrations. After this, delle Colombe seems not to have had any further direct role in public debate on this topic. In September Galileo circulated a manuscript outlining his views, but when Cosimo II staged a public debate on the question of floating bodies, it was Flaminio Papazzoni rather than delle Colombe who argued, and lost, against Galileo.\n\nIn 1612 Galileo formally set out his views on this topic in his \"Discourse on Floating Bodies\" and Delle Colombe swiftly replied with \"Discorso Apologetico\" Galileo did not reply immediately, and indeed when his reply was published, it was over the name of his friend Benedetto Castelli. Galileo may have felt no useful purpose was served by involving himself directly in this debate, and he may simply not have had the time to respond in detail to all the errors in delle Colombe's book. Castelli was able to produce a thoroughly-argued refutation of delle Colombe's points, clearly with help and input from Galileo. Castelli's \"Risposta alle Opposizioni del S. Lodovico delle Colombe\" was published in 1615, marking the end of this particular dispute.\n\nWhile delle Colombe was almost alone in arguing publicly against Galileo, there was a group of scholars and churchmen who supported his Aristotelian views. After Galileo referred disparagingly to delle Colombe as 'pippione' ('pigeon'), his close friend the painter Lodovico Cigoli coined the nickname 'Lega del Pippione' ('The Pigeon League') for delle Colombe's group. (As well as being a play on delle Colombe's name, 'pippione' carried the connotation of 'bird-brained' or 'easily duped'). Among the Pigeon League's members was Delle Colombe's brother Rafaello, a leading Dominican, close to archbishop Marzi Medici, who frequently sermonised against Copernican ideas in general and Galileo in particular. Two others were also Dominicans, Tommaso Caccini and Niccolò Lorini.\n\nIn December 1611, soon after the dispute over floating bodies, Cigoli wrote to Galileo warning him that a group of his enemies were meeting regularly in the house of the Archbishop, \"in a mad quest for any means by which they can damage you.\" They had apparently already tried to persuade someone to attack him from the pulpit. The attack, when it came, was launched by Caccini. He had obtained a copy of Galileo's letter to Benedetto Castelli, which explained how the Copernican system could be reconciled with the book of Joshua. On 20 December 1614, he preached a sermon in Santa Maria Novella in Florence, attacking Galileo and quoting the Acts of the Apostles,\"Viri galilaei, quid statis adspicientes in caelum?\" (\"Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into heaven?\").\n\nSix weeks later, on 7 February 1615, Lorini sent a copy of Galileo's Letter to Castelli to the Roman Inquisition with a written complaint. On 20 March 1615 Caccini followed this up with a second deposition to the Inquisition, accusing him of heresy. The Inquisition thereupon opened an investigation into Galileo. What direct role delle Colombe may have played in these developments is not known.\n\nDelle Colombe is referred to as a living person in Castelli's 1615 book. After this date there are no known works by him and no literary or scientific references to him. In 1623, Lodovico delle Colombe and his brother Corso were elected to the Consiglio dei Dugento. Nothing is known of him after this date.\n"}

{"id": "95601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95601", "title": "Mana", "text": "Mana\n\nMana, in Austronesian languages, means \"power\", \"effectiveness\", and \"prestige\". In most cases, this power and its source are understood to be supernatural and inexplicable. Its semantics are language-dependent. The concept is significant in Polynesian culture and is part of contemporary Pacific Islander culture; it came to the attention of Western anthropologists through reports from island missionaries. Its study was included in cultural anthropology—specifically, the anthropology of religion. Links were seen between \"mana\" and earlier phases of Western religion: animism at first, followed by pre-animism.\n\nAccording to the POLLEX Project, a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for \"mana\"—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-\"—existed in Proto-Oceanic, the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, \"mana\" means \"thunder, storm, or wind\" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant \"powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own.\"\n\nMana is a foundation of the Polynesian worldview, a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred, impersonal force. To have \"mana\" implies influence, authority, and efficacy—the ability to perform in a given situation. The quality of \"mana\" is not limited to individuals; peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects may also possess \"mana\", and its possessors are accorded respect.\n\nIn Hawaiian and Tahitian culture, mana is a spiritual energy and healing power which can exist in places, objects and persons. Hawaiians believe that mana may be gained or lost by actions, and Hawaiians and Tahitians believe that mana is both external and internal. Sites on the Hawaiian Islands and in French Polynesia are believed to possess mana—for example, the top rim of the Haleakalā volcano on the island of Maui and the Taputapuatea marae on the island of Raiatea in the Society Islands.\n\nAncient Hawaiian believed that the island of Molokaʻi possesses mana, compared with its neighboring islands. Before the unification of Hawaii by King Kamehameha I, battles were fought for possession of the island and its south-shore fish ponds which existed until the late 19th century.\n\nA person may gain mana by \"pono\" (right actions). In ancient Hawaii, there were two paths to mana: sexual means or violence. Nature is dualistic, and everything has a counterpart. A balance between the gods Kū and Lono formed, through whom are the two paths to mana (\"ʻimihaku\", or the search for mana). Kū, the god of war and politics, offers mana through violence; this was how Kamehameha gained his mana. Lono, the god of peace and fertility, offers mana through sexuality.\n\nIn Māori, a tribe with \"mana whenua\" must have demonstrated their authority over a territory. In Māori culture, there are two essential aspects of a person's mana: \"mana tangata\", authority derived from whakapapa (genealogy) and \"mana huaanga\", defined as \"authority derived from having a wealth of resources to gift to others to bind them into reciprocal obligations\". Hemopereki Simon, from Ngati Tuwharetoa, asserts that there are many forms of mana in Maori culture. The indigenous word reflects a non-Western view of reality, complicating translation. This is confirmed by the definition of mana provided by Maori Mardsden who states that mana is:Spiritual power and authority as opposed to the purely psychic and natural force — ihi.According to Prof. Margaret Mutu mana in its traditional sense means:Power, authority, ownership, status, influence, dignity, respect derived from the god[/atua].In terms of leadership Ngāti Kahungunu legal scholar Carwyn Jones comments that, \"mana is the central concept that underlies Māori leadership and accountability.\" He also considers mana as a fundamental aspect of the constitutional traditions of Māori society.\n\nAccording to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice:\n\nIn contemporary New Zealand English, the word \"mana\", taken from the Māori, refers to a person or organisation of people of great personal prestige and character. The increased use of the term mana in New Zealand society is as a result of the politicisation of Maori issues stemming from the Māori Renaissance. \n\nLarry Niven adopted the term in his 1969 short story, \"Not Long Before the End\". In this and subsequent stories, \"mana\" was the magical fuel used to cast spells. It was a non-renewable environmental resource; heavy use of magic could deplete the mana in an area.\n\nFollowing on from the idea of mana as something that could be \"used up\", fantasy role-playing games and video games adopted the term to quantify \"magical power.\" Magic points (MPs) were used by \"\" and games influenced by it, and for example the 1987 video game \"Dungeon Master\" replaced \"magic points\" with \"mana points\" as the definition of MPs.\n\nMana was used in a number of early role-playing board games. In 1993, the collectible card game \"\" used mana terminology. Blizzard Entertainment's \"\" called its MPs \"mana\", influenced by \"Magic: The Gathering\". \"Diablo\" (1996) also used mana terminology; the two games' sequels and spin-offs, including \"World of Warcraft\", popularized the term \"mana\".\n\nMissionary Robert Henry Codrington traveled widely in Melanesia, publishing several studies of its language and culture. His 1891 book \"The Melanesians: Studies in their Anthropology and Folk-Lore\" contains the first detailed description of mana. Codrington defines it as \"a force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control\".\n\nHis era had already defined animism, the concept that the energy (or life) in an object derives from a spiritual component. Georg Ernst Stahl's 18th-century animism was adopted by Edward Burnett Tylor, the founder of cultural anthropology, who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 \"Researches into the Early History of Mankind\" and developed them in volumes one (1871) and two (1874) of \"Primitive Culture\".\n\nIn Tylor's cultural anthropology, other primates (from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved) did not appear to possess culture.\n\nTylor did not try to find evidence of a non-cultural human state because he considered it unreachable, \"a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals\" and \"savage life as in some sort representing an early known state.\" He described such a hypothetical state as \"the human savage naked in both mind and body, and destitute of laws, or arts, or ideas, and almost of language\". According to Tylor, speculation about an acultural state is impossible. Using the method of comparative culture, similar to comparative anatomy and the comparative method of historical linguistics and following John Lubbock, he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits (memes and memeplexes): savage and civilised. Tylor wrote, \"From an ideal point of view, civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society ... \" and identified his model with the \"progression-theory of civilization\".\n\nTylor cited a \"minimum definition\" of religion as \"the belief in Spiritual Beings\". Noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of \"Primitive Culture\", Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits. He used the word \"animism\" in two different senses. The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy, shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which comparative religion attempts to reconstruct.\n\nTylor's work predated Codrington's, and he was unfamiliar with the latter. The concept of mana occasioned a revision of Tylor's view of the evolution of religion. The first anthropologist to formulate a revision (which he called \"pre-animistic religion\") was Robert Ranulph Marett, in a series of papers collected and published as \"Threshold of Religion\". In its preface he takes credit for the adjective \"pre-animistic\" but not the noun \"pre-animism\", although he does not attribute it.\n\nAccording to Marett, \"Animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion.\" Tylor had used the term \"natural religion\", consistent with Georg Ernst Stahl's concept of a natural spiritual energy. The soul of an animal, for example, is its vital principle. Marett wrote, \"One must dig deeper\" to find the \"roots of religion\".\n\nDescribing pre-animism, Marett cited the Melanesian mana (primarily with Codrington's work): \"When the science of Comparative Religion employs a native expression such as mana ... it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning ... Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ... \". In Melanesia the \"animae\" are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits \"of ghost-like appearance\" or imitating living people. Spirits can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.\n\nThe most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from, and exists independently of, its source. \"Animae\" act only through mana. It is impersonal, undistinguished, and (like energy) transmissible between objects, which can have more or less of it. Mana is perceptible, appearing as a \"Power of awfulness\" (in the sense of awe or wonder). Objects possessing it impress an observer with \"respect, veneration, propitiation, service\" emanating from the mana's power. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: \"startling manifestations of nature\", \"curious stones\", animals, \"human remains\", blood, thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and the sound of a bullroarer.\n\nIf mana is a distinct power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes spells, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the \"anima\"). An \"anima\" may have departed, leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by magic. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a \"rudimentary religion\" or \"magico-religious\" phase in which the mana figures without \"animae\", \"no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found.\" Like Tylor, he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and pre-animism identified with the supernatural—the \"mysterious\", as opposed to the reasonable.\n\nIn 1936, Ian Hogbin criticised the universality of Marett's pre-animism: \"Mana is by no means universal and, consequently, to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious\". However, Marett intended the concept as an abstraction. Spells, for example, may be found \"from Central Australia to Scotland.\"\n\nEarly 20th-century scholars also saw mana as a universal concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy. In his 1904 essay, \"Outline of a General Theory of Magic\", Marcel Mauss drew on the writings of Codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as \"power \"par excellence\", the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them\". Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the Iroquois orenda and the Algonquian manitou, convinced of the \"universality of the institution\"; \"a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere\".\n\nMauss and his collaborator, Henri Hubert, were criticised for this position when their 1904 \"Outline of a General Theory of Magic\" was published. \"No one questioned the existence of the notion of mana\", wrote Mauss's biographer Marcel Fournier, \"but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension\". Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to Mircea Eliade, the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, not everyone has it, and \"even among the varying formulae (\"mana\", \"wakan\", \"orenda\", etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies\". \"With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research\".\n\n\n\n"}

Mastena fostered a deep devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus and tried to promote that devotion to others in her religious career as a nun. Mastena first desired the contemplative life but was denied this after she entered the convent since it was not a cloister. Instead she dedicated herself to teaching in several Italian cities after having left another convent and another religious order when she deemed contemplative life was not the life she felt God wanted for her. Her labors were dedicated instead to consolidating her new religious order which began to grow after World War II until her sudden death in 1951.\n\nMastena's beatification process opened on 23 June 1990 under Pope John Paul II who later named Mastena as Venerable in 2002 after having confirmed her heroic virtue. Her beatification was celebrated in late 2005.\n\nTeresa Maria Mastena was born in Bovolone on 7 December 1881 as the first of five children to Giulio Mastena and Maria Antonia Casarotti. Her father worked as a small businessman and grocer and her mother served as a teacher. Her siblings were:\nHer baptism was celebrated in the local parish church on 29 December 1881.\n\nMastena received her First Communion on 19 March 1891 and straight after that made a private vow to remain chaste in devotion to God. Her Confirmation was made on 27 August 1891.\n\nMastena began her initial schooling at home in which her mother taught her before she was attended to a kindergarten that the Sisters of Mercy managed. In her adolescence she was active in parish activities and acted as a catechist for the children. It was in 1891 that she reported her first experience that centered on a devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. Mastena later asked to enter the religious life in 1895 as a teenager but was accepted as a postulant much later on 3 September 1901 at the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of Verona. On 29 September 1902 she commenced her novitiate period and assumed the religious habit. 24 October 1903 she professed her perpetual vows and assumed the religious name \"Passitea Maria of the Child Jesus\".\n\nIn October 1905 she completed her studies at the Institute of \"Carlo Montanari\" in Verona and obtained a diploma as a schoolteacher; she received a further teaching qualification on 7 October 1907 and then one as a kindergarten teacher in August-September 1908. In 1905 she began teaching and on 28 October 1908 she began teaching at the new center of the order in Miane (in the hills of Treviso) prior to soon becoming its director. During World War I she continued to be active in Miane and was quite close to the scene of the battle of the Piave. On 7 July 1912 she established an orphanage in Miane as well as a recreational club in 1917-1918. But after the war came events that had a profound impact on her: the death of her mother led her to seek seclusion as a nun which was something that her superiors did not permit. To that end she left the order and on 15 April 1927 entered the San Giacomo di Veglia convent (in Vittorio Veneto) as a Cistercian nun where she assumed the religious name \"Maria Pia\". Mastena was clothed in the Cistercian habit for the first time on 2 June 1927 when she commenced her period of novitiate. In the cloister she became known for her strict adherence to the order's Rule and for her deep devotion to both the Eucharist and the Passion of Jesus.\n\nOn 15 November 1927 the Bishop of Vittorio Veneto Eugenio Beccegato (her spiritual director) asked her to leave the convent and resume teaching after Mastena had doubts as to whether the contemplative life was meant for her. This was something that she had confided prior to Beccegato. Mastena did this from 1927 until 1930 first in Miane (1927-28) before teaching in Follina Carpesica (1928-30) and then in San Fior (1930-36) where she opened a nursery school and a soup kitchen. In this period she began to form the idea of a congregation dedicated to the Face of Christ which was rooted in her devotion to a significant degree. In San Fior in 1930 she organized a small order called Pious Rescue which was aimed at assisting poor children and teaching them a trade. Soon a large number of aspiring sisters began to gather around Mastena and in October 1932 the local bishop approved of this order. From 1935 to 1936 the new order was dissolved twice due to the opposition from some local priests to accept her. But after a trip to Rome on 8 December 1936 she obtained recognition of her congregation on a diocesan level from the local bishop.\n\nTowards the middle of the 1940s the order began establishing small offices in other Italian cities and on 12 May 1940 met Pope Pius XII in a private audience to discuss her work. This was during World War II and Mastena's order participated in relief activities for soldiers and victims of the conflict and fed them free of charge and without distinction between Italians or Germans or Jews since no side existed in their view. The decisive moment for her order came after Pope Pius XII confirmed her order as one of pontifical right on 10 December 1947. The purpose of the order is to aid in the sick in nursing homes as well as to help aspiring priests. On 8 December 1948 - at the order's first General Chapter - she was made the order's first Superior-General and she held that position until her death. In 1949 she decided to also establish clinic in Rome which the Sisters of the Holy Face were to run.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1951 she began to have health problems of a serious nature which included a heart attack and had to suspend her activities and trips to Rome. Her health took a grave turn in March 1951. Mastena's sudden death came the evening on 28 June 1951; her funeral was held both in Rome (on 1 July) and in San Fior (on 4 July). Her remains were first buried in Campo Verano but later moved to the San Fior motherhouse in a chapel on 26 December 1953. In 2005 her order had 143 professed nuns in 22 houses which extend to Brazil and Indonesia.\n\nThe beatification process opened on 23 June 1990 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \"nihil obstat\" (no objections) and titled Mastena as a Servant of God. The diocesan process for the investigation opened in Rome on 24 September 1990 and was closed at a Mass on 30 April 1992. The C.C.S. later validated the process on 30 April 1993 in a decree and received the Positio dossier from the cause's officials (the postulation) in 1994 for additional assessment.\n\nThe theologians tasked to assess the cause approved the dossier's contents on 17 March 2002 while the cardinal and bishop members comprising the C.C.S. agreed with this decision at their meeting on 7 May 2002. Pope John Paul II confirmed that Mastena had lived a model life of heroic virtue and named the late religious as Venerable on 5 July 2002.\n\nMastena's beatification required a miracle to receive papal confirmation in order for beatification to take place. The process for one case was held from 2000 to 2001 though further research in Rome could not occur until Mastena had been named as Venerable. That happened in 2002 at which stage medical experts met to discuss and approve the miraculous nature of the healing on 4 December 2002. Theologians concurred in this verdict on 26 March 2004 and the C.C.S. members also voiced their approval on 1 June 2004. On 22 June the pope provided the final assent needed which confirmed Mastena's beatification to be held.\n\nThe beatification was held on 13 November 2005 in Saint Peter's Basilica with Cardinal José Saraiva Martins presiding on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI who made remarks at the conclusion of the beatification. Benedict XVI stated in his remarks following the beatification Mass:\n\nThe current postulator for this cause is the Passionist priest Giovanni Zubiani.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45637749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45637749", "title": "Mediated stylistics", "text": "Mediated stylistics\n\nMediated stylistics is a new and still emerging approach to the analysis of media texts (e.g. news programs, newspaper articles). It aims to take seriously two ideas: first, that media texts involve 'the construction of stories by other means'; and second, that in an age marked by digital connectivity, media texts are inherently interactive phenomena. To meet this twofold aim, mediated stylistics has brought together the analytic toolkits of discursive psychology—which is finely attuned to the contextual specificities of interaction—and stylistics—which is finely attuned to the grammatical/rhetorical/narratorial specificities of texts as texts. Recent research in which mediated stylistics has been put to work, for instance, has shown how mediated representation of issues like sexism, sexualisation, alleged rape and violence against women can differ, and differ in rhetorically consequential ways, from the original un-mediated source material.\n\nAs a broadly ethnomethodological approach, mediated stylistics is strongly inﬂuenced by discursive psychology (DP), as well as the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK), membership categorization analysis (MCA), and the work of stylisticians like Mick Short, Paul Simpson and Lesley Jeffries, in which the analytic utility of stylistics for an understanding of data other than strictly 'literary' texts becomes immediately apparent. What unites these approaches is their rejection of a particularly widespread understanding of language in which words-in-here-on-a-page name things-out-there-in-the-world. Because this understanding assumes a natural link between descriptions and the events so described it also assumes a non-linguistic sense of the world as the final arbiter of the in/accuracy of descriptions. For DP, SSK and MCA, however, there can be no socially meaningful sense of the non-linguistic without the founding, constitutive force of language. Although language might not be all there is in the world, it is, nevertheless, all there is in the world that allows for the world to become accountable and knowable to ourselves and others. And once you reject—as these approaches reject—the possibility of some non-linguistic arbiter of accuracy, it follows that all descriptions (whether those we decide to treat as accurate or those we do not) have to be understood as the products of particular, locally specific contexts. The issue is no longer whether mediated texts transmit in/accurate in-formation, but how they act as \"vehicles for action\", where such actions might include defending someone, accusing someone, confessing to something, or any number of other things. It is here that we see how an ethnomethodological approach to language opens the possibility for a mediated stylistics; that is, for analytical tools traditionally associated with stylistics to be adopted for use within media studies. A journalist writing a news article about 'real events' and a novelist constructing a plausible-yet-imaginary-world may well be working with different materials, but they are both engaged in essentially the same kind of literary task: building descriptive vehicles with the potential to pull off a certain set of contextually specific actions such as detailing, characterizing, informing, confessing, defending, accusing, and so on, in what constitutes an infinitely extendable list of other such social actions.\n\nSo what does this all of this mean in practice? Traditionally, stylistics has treated literature—whether institutionally sanctioned Literature (with a capital \"L\") or more popular non-canonical forms of literary writing—as its primary focus. Mediated stylistics, however, in taking seriously the idea that journalists are the \"professional storytellers of our age\", orients towards the types of creativity and innovation in language-use that are required in and for the construction of mediated stories. This shift in empirical focus requires a shift in analytic focus. For although literary and mediated texts both tell stories, they do so in differing ways. In that stylistics asks how certain aesthetic effects are achieved through the language of a literary text, it is able to assume that the text in question represents a story in which characters, plot, events, etc. have all been constructed by that text's author (e.g. Burton's analysis of Plath's prose, 1982). Media texts, on the other hand, almost always involve attempts to translate—or recontextualise—characters, plots and events that have already been constructed elsewhere, by others, in a different context. Unlike other forms of stylistics, then, mediated stylistics is interested not in one-off stories, but in the various iterations of a story that are reproduced over time and across various contexts. This contrasts with the extremely insightful, but different, form of stylistics developed by Leslie Jeffries known as critical stylistics.\n\nOne recent example is Attenborough's article 'Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women' (2014). This article studies mediated reportage of the charges of rape and sexual molestation made against Julian Assange, the editor-in-chief of the organisation WikiLeaks, in late 2010. This event was rich with recontextualising possibilities: during the appeal hearing in which Assange's lawyers challenged the warrant for his arrest, transcripts of the witness statements that had led to the warrant being issued were leaked online. Media commentators took this opportunity to build their own recontextualised descriptions of what actually happened as the (apparently) factual starting points for their own, subsequent evaluations of the (un)fairness and/or (il)legitimacy of the allegations. An analysis of media reports in which those witness statements were passed-on to the public subsequently reveals the textual practices through which Assange's allegedly violent actions were often recontextualised such that their status as violent was readably downgraded, mitigated or even deleted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23394699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23394699", "title": "Narhar Ambadas Kurundkar", "text": "Narhar Ambadas Kurundkar\n\nNarhar Ambadas Kurundkar (Devanagari: नरहर अंबादास कुरुंदकर) (15 July 1932 – 10 February 1982) was a Marathi scholar, critic and writer who wrote on political philosophies in general and cultural matters and historical events in Maharashtra, India.\n\nKurundkar was born on 15 July 1932 in the town of Nandapur (Dist. Parabhani) in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra. After his high school education, he joined the \"City College\" in Hyderabad. In his first two years in college, he often skipped classes and spent most of his time at the State Library in Hyderabad, voraciously reading books on History, Culture, Religion, philosophy, Education, Literature, Politics, and Economics. Through inattention to preparations for his college examinations, he failed to pass the second-year college examination even after a few attempts, and he quit his pursuit of a college degree (until some years later).\n\nDeveloping socialist ideas in his mind, Kurundkar became for a while a labour leader of the local rickshaw drivers' union. Later he became, for the rest of his life, an ardent member of \"Rashtra Seva Dal\".\n\nIn 1955, he started his teaching career at Pratibha Niketan high school in Nanded. While teaching, he resumed his pursuit of college degrees in Humanities. After earning in 1963 a master's degree from Marathwada University, he joined the faculty of \"People's College\" in Nanded as a professor of Marathi. He later became principal of that college.\n\nAll of Kurundkar's literary work reflected the idea of supremacy of logical thinking. (He had said that he had imbibed that idea from his father and one of his high school teachers.) Bertrand Russell was his role model: He shared Russell's thinking and reasoning. Besides being a deep thinker and a littérateur, he was a social activist. He was associated with Jayprakash Narayan's \"Total Revolution\"; \"Agitation for the Development of Marathwada\"; Vinoba Bhave's \"Teachers' Congress (आचार्य कुल)\"; and the \"Fear Not\" movement opposing the dictatorial \"national Emergency\" imposed in 1975 by the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\n\nKurundkar was a member of Maharashtra Government Literary Awards Committee. He represented Maharashtra in the Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi.\n\nKurundkar died due to a massive heart attack on 10 February 1982 while giving a public speech on Indian music at Aurangabad.\n\nThe following is a list of some of Kurundkar's works.\n\nAcharya Narhar Kurundkar was a multi-faceted, self-nurtured personality, famous in the entire region of Marathwada as Guruji. He strived all his life to appropriately guide the society as an ideal teacher, principal, philosopher, researcher, critic, orator, author and guide. No subject was outside his scope. He had a command over a wide range of topics, from Bharatmuni's NatyaShastra (science of drama) to Freud's human psychology and from Shankaracharya's philosophy of duality to Marxism.\n\nHis career in teaching began in 1955 at Pratibha Niketan in Nanded. Later in 1963, he became a professor in People's College in Nanded. He was also the external examiner for research papers on Marathi and Political Science. He gave informal guidance for the research on history, music, Sanskrit, poetry and literature. He efficiently handled the responsibility as a Principal of People's College also.\n\nGuru Bhalchandra Maharaj Kahalekar had a significant role to play in Kurundkar's development. Kahalekar was a Marxist patriot and a professor of Marathi. Kurundkar would gratifyingly say about Kahalekar, 'Rather than what to think, he taught me how to think'. As a thinker, his ideologies and behaviour were influenced by the personalities and writings of such great people as Acharya Javdekar, Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Will Durant and Bertrand Russel. Kurundkar was especially influenced by Marxist ideologies. He believed that the foundation of a society is in its wealth. He said 'Materialistic thoughts are always more influential than any other thought'. His thoughts were never merely idealistic and he believed in the practicality of all ideologies. This is why in his book Jaagar, he unmasked the facetious and hypocritical people who talk about progress and idealism, but never walk the talk.\n\nExcellent oration was one among the various roles that Acharya Kurundkar executed. He was known and loved as an inspirational orator among all classes and age groups in society. Like Socrates, he was always surrounded by youth. Some of the most unusual features of his oratory style were his ability to explain a wide variety of the most difficult of subjects in easy simple language, using humour in even the most serious of subjects and keeping the audience attentive by the clever use of wit and sarcasm. Using this style, he enlightened the society on various difficult subjects and thoughts. His writing and oration always followed two main streams:\n\nHe was an active member all his life of the Rashtra Seva Dal. Yadunath Thatte’s words: ‘Kurundkar had a lion’s share in laying the foundation of Rashtra Seva Dal’ gives us an idea of the extent of his contribution to the organisation. Of special significance is Acharya’s book titled Vaataa Tuzhyaa Maazhyaa (Paths – yours and mine) written in the form of questions and answers, that served as a tool for public education.\n\nReading and writing were Acharya Kurundkar’s favourite hobbies – they were his life.\n\nHis writing gave a new direction to the world of Marathi literature, especially to criticism. His critique on subjects like Marathi stories, novels, poems, drama, thought-provoking literature, light literature, Dalit literature, etc. are milestones in Marathi literature. Acharya Kurundkar’s name must be mentioned when talking about criticism of Marathi literature. Roopvedh (1963) is a collection of some of his invaluable freestyle critiques. This publication brought Kurundkar the recognition of best literary work from the government. In Dhaar ani Kaath (Stream and border), published in 1971, Kurundkar has summed up the progress and development of Marathi novels in a comprehensive manner. This book is considered a self-sufficient book for the study of Marathi novels. His Paayvaat (footsteps) published in 1974, contains numerous critiques on different streams of Marathi literature like critique, poems, and drama.\n\nMarathi literature and Acharya Kurundkar have become an inseparable part of each other. He was an active member of the Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad for many years. He was the president of the regional conventions held by the Parishad in Vidharbha, Mumbai and Baroda. He was on the Literary Award Committee of the Government of Maharashtra. At the same time, he was also associated with the activities of organisations like the Sahitya Parishad and National Book Trust as a representative of Maharashtra, especially the Marathwada region.\n\nThere were two prevalent streams of thought at the time. One that believed that art should be pure and exist for art itself, while the other believed that art cannot exist in isolation, but has to connect with the society and social life of the times. Kurundkar was a staunch supporter of the later stream. His articles on Dalit literature amply demonstrate this belief. He also believed in the eternal human values which bound him throughout his life in the different roles that he executed. His thoughts on different social issues continue to inspire people to introspect and provoke action. Dalit literature and the Dalit movement were special subjects of study for him. He often provided guidance to the dalit leaders, encouraging them in building their movement. He was of the opinion that there should be an open exchange of thoughts and ideas between people from different walks of life, across class, castes and sub-castes. He strived hard to promote this through his literature and work. His book Bhajan (1981) contains various articles on Dalit literature and the existing social issues in his time. His Manusmruti (1982) intensely highlights the injustice dealt by society on women and dalits. Status of women in society, social and political relationships between Hindu and Muslim were also subjects for study and writing. He was a supporter of the Muslim Satyashodhak movement started by the social worker Hamid Dalwai.\n\nHis Shivratra (1970) which elucidates the ill effects of caste based and communal politics is relevant even today.\n\nHis method of studying history as a historian is worth learning. He believed that the concepts of nationalism and socialism are complementary. At the same time he was a proponent of democracy. In Chaya Prakash (1975) written during the Emergency, he has expressed his thoughts about democracy and dictatorship.\n\nHe opined that it was necessary to study history to completely understand nationalism, socialism and democracy. Though Kurundkar was not an established historian, Kurundkar determinedly and dedicatedly worked towards finding new horizons in the study and research of history. His most important contribution as a historian is his study of the meanings, concepts and processes involved with the changing meanings of words with time. He proved that research is incomplete and unidimensional without an understanding of this process. He gave a new direction to methods of historical research. His historical books are considered a guide for researchers of history today, chief among which are Magova (1967) – a collection of articles on ancient history, Jaagar (1969) – a profound perspective on Indian history, politics, economics, and religion, and Shivrai, a book that reveals the substance of Shivaji Maharaj’s life. The foreword written by him for the popular book on Shivaji Maharaj, Shriman Yogi, is worth a mention.\n\nHe insisted that it wasn’t enough to merely study political history, and promoted the study of cultural and social history, the importance of art, knowledge and other subjects too. He is considered one of the greatest researchers among the select few diligent researchers of the Marathi language who pursued the rediscovery of the past through oriental research. Along with history he was also a researcher of various subjects like philosophy, physiology, religion, finance, sociology and politics.\n\nIn a span of just fifty years, Acharya Kurundkar made a valuable contribution to Maharashtra’s intellectual world through his exceptional intellect, elocution, knowledge and writing. In Aakalan (1982), Acharya Kurundkar has brought to life the personalities of famous Indian leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Ambedkar, Subhashchandra Bose, Sardar Patel, etc., encompassing their social and political work. This book familiarises us with these personalities, as well as the social and political situation in those times. His autobiography Vaatchaal also familiarises us with many contemporary famous personalities.\n\nTill his last breath, Acharya Kurundkar continued the work of public education through his writing, speeches and discussions. Death struck him on a stage in Udgir, just as he was about to commence his speech. Acharya Kurundkar’s sudden death at such a young age was a big blow to the intellectual world of Maharashtra. It is indeed a strange quirk of faith that this intellectual was struck by death while on his mission, just like a martyr who is struck by death on the battlefield.\n\nThe following translation of a poem written by the senior social worker Baba Amte, eulogising Acharya Kurundkar, says it all:\n\nThe field of thoughts that you sowed\nWere just sprouting stalks afresh.\nAnd the seeds were barely getting enriched with the milk (of knowledge).\nDrawn by the trough filled with this milk\nBirds were beginning to flock from all directions;\nyou collapsed before reaping the harvest of your thoughts.\n\nA lecture series by Kurundkar on Shivaji, the founder of Maratha state is extant and can be accessed here.\n\n"}

{"id": "23664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23664", "title": "Papyrus", "text": "Papyrus\n\nPapyrus is a material similar to thick paper that was used in ancient times as a writing surface. It was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, \"Cyperus papyrus\", a wetland sedge. \"Papyrus\" (plural: \"papyri\") can also refer to a document written on sheets of such material, joined together side by side and rolled up into a scroll, an early form of a book. \nPapyrus is first known to have been used in Egypt (at least as far back as the First Dynasty), as the papyrus plant was once abundant across the Nile Delta. It was also used throughout the Mediterranean region and in the Kingdom of Kush. Apart from a writing material, ancient Egyptians employed papyrus in the construction of other artifacts, such as reed boats, mats, rope, sandals, and baskets.\n\nPapyrus was first manufactured in Egypt as far back as the fourth millennium BCE. The earliest archaeological evidence of papyrus was excavated in 2012 and 2013 at Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor located on the Red Sea coast. These documents date from c. 2560–2550 BCE (end of the reign of Khufu). The papyrus rolls describe the last years of building the Great Pyramid of Giza. In the first centuries BCE and CE, papyrus scrolls gained a rival as a writing surface in the form of parchment, which was prepared from animal skins. Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which book-form codices were fashioned. Early Christian writers soon adopted the codex form, and in the Græco-Roman world, it became common to cut sheets from papyrus rolls to form codices.\n\nCodices were an improvement on the papyrus scroll, as the papyrus was not pliable enough to fold without cracking and a long roll, or scroll, was required to create large-volume texts. Papyrus had the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, but it was fragile and susceptible to both moisture and excessive dryness. Unless the papyrus was of perfect quality, the writing surface was irregular, and the range of media that could be used was also limited.\n\nPapyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper, locally produced products parchment and vellum, of significantly higher durability in moist climates, though Henri Pirenne's connection of its disappearance with the Muslim conquest of Egypt is contested. Its last appearance in the Merovingian chancery is with a document of 692, though it was known in Gaul until the middle of the following century. The latest certain dates for the use of papyrus are 1057 for a papal decree (typically conservative, all papal bulls were on papyrus until 1022), under Pope Victor II, and 1087 for an Arabic document. Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by more inexpensive paper introduced by the Islamic world who originally learned of it from the Chinese. By the 12th century, parchment and paper were in use in the Byzantine Empire, but papyrus was still an option.\n\nPapyrus was made in several qualities and prices. Pliny the Elder and Isidore of Seville described six variations of papyrus which were sold in the Roman market of the day. These were graded by quality based on how fine, firm, white, and smooth the writing surface was. Grades ranged from the superfine Augustan, which was produced in sheets of 13 digits (10 inches) wide, to the least expensive and most coarse, measuring six digits (four inches) wide. Materials deemed unusable for writing or less than six digits were considered commercial quality and were pasted edge to edge to be used only for wrapping.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, only some isolated documents written on papyrus were known, and that museums simply displayed them as curiosities. They did not contain literary works. The first modern discovery of papyri rolls was made at Herculaneum in 1752. Until then, the only papyri known had been a few surviving from medieval times. Scholarly investigations began with the Dutch historian Caspar Jacob Christiaan Reuvens (1793–1835). He wrote about the content of the Leyden papyrus, published in 1830. The first publication has been credited to the British scholar Charles Wycliffe Goodwin (1817–1878), who published for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, one of the Papyri Graecae Magicae V, translated into English with commentary in 1853.\n\nThe English word \"papyrus\" derives, via Latin, from Greek πάπυρος (\"papyros\"), a loanword of unknown (perhaps Pre-Greek) origin. Greek has a second word for it, βύβλος (\"byblos\", said to derive from the name of the Phoenician city of Byblos). The Greek writer Theophrastus, who flourished during the 4th century BCE, uses \"papyros\" when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and \"byblos\" for the same plant when used for nonfood products, such as cordage, basketry, or writing surfaces. The more specific term βίβλος \"biblos\", which finds its way into English in such words as 'bibliography', 'bibliophile', and 'bible', refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant. \"Papyrus\" is also the etymon of 'paper', a similar substance.\n\nIn the Egyptian language, papyrus was called \"wadj\" (\"w3ḏ\"), \"tjufy\" (\"ṯwfy\"), or \"djet\" (\"ḏt\").\n\nThe word for the material papyrus is also used to designate documents written on sheets of it, often rolled up into scrolls. The plural for such documents is papyri. Historical papyri are given identifying names—generally the name of the discoverer, first owner or institution where they are kept—and numbered, such as \"Papyrus Harris I\". Often an abbreviated form is used, such as \"pHarris I\". These documents provide important information on ancient writings; they give us the only extant copy of Menander, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Egyptian treatises on medicine (the Ebers Papyrus) and on surgery (the Edwin Smith papyrus), Egyptian mathematical treatises (the Rhind papyrus), and Egyptian folk tales (the Westcar papyrus). When, in the 18th century, a library of ancient papyri was found in Herculaneum, ripples of expectation spread among the learned men of the time. However, since these papyri were badly charred, their unscrolling and deciphering is still going on today.\n\nPapyrus is made from the stem of the papyrus plant, \"Cyperus papyrus\". The outer rind is first removed, and the sticky fibrous inner pith is cut lengthwise into thin strips of about long. The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for decomposition to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain. The two layers possibly were glued together. While still moist, the two layers are hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The sheet is then dried under pressure. After drying, the sheet is polished with some rounded object, possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood.\n\nSheets could be cut to fit the obligatory size or glued together to create a longer roll. A wooden stick would be attached to the last sheet in a roll, making it easier to handle. To form the long strip scrolls required, a number of such sheets were united, placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll's length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other. Normally, texts were first written on the \"recto\", the lines following the fibres, parallel to the long edges of the scroll. Secondarily, papyrus was often reused, writing across the fibres on the \"verso\". Pliny the Elder describes the methods of preparing papyrus in his \"Naturalis Historia\".\n\nIn a dry climate, like that of Egypt, papyrus is stable, formed as it is of highly rot-resistant cellulose; but storage in humid conditions can result in molds attacking and destroying the material. Library papyrus rolls were stored in wooden boxes and chests made in the form of statues. Papyrus scrolls were organized according to subject or author, and identified with clay labels that specified their contents without having to unroll the scroll. In European conditions, papyrus seems to have lasted only a matter of decades; a 200-year-old papyrus was considered extraordinary. Imported papyrus once commonplace in Greece and Italy has since deteriorated beyond repair, but papyri are still being found in Egypt; extraordinary examples include the Elephantine papyri and the famous finds at Oxyrhynchus and Nag Hammadi. The Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, containing the library of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, Julius Caesar's father-in-law, was preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, but has only been partially excavated.\n\nSporadic attempts to revive the manufacture of papyrus have been made since the mid-18th century. Scottish explorer James Bruce experimented in the late 18th century with papyrus plants from the Sudan, for papyrus had become extinct in Egypt. Also in the 18th century, Sicilian Saverio Landolina manufactured papyrus at Syracuse, where papyrus plants had continued to grow in the wild. During the 1920s, when Egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn lived in Maadi, outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of papyrus, growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen, and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The modern technique of papyrus production used in Egypt for the tourist trade was developed in 1962 by the Egyptian engineer Hassan Ragab using plants that had been reintroduced into Egypt in 1872 from France. Both Sicily and Egypt have centres of limited papyrus production.\n\nPapyrus is still used by communities living in the vicinity of swamps, to the extent that rural householders derive up to 75% of their income from swamp goods. Particularly in East and Central Africa, people harvest papyrus, which is used to manufacture items that are sold or used locally. Examples include baskets, hats, fish traps, trays or winnowing mats, and floor mats. Papyrus is also used to make roofs, ceilings, rope and fences. Although alternatives, such as eucalyptus, are increasingly available, papyrus is still used as fuel.\n\n\n\nOther ancient writing materials:\n\n\n"}

Thagard is currently a professor of Philosophy at the University of Waterloo, with cross appointment to Psychology and Computer Science. He is the director of the Cognitive Science Program. Thagard is a prolific writer, and has contributed to research in analogy and creativity, inference, cognition in the history of science, and the role of emotion in cognition.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, Thagard is enormously well cited for his work on the use of computational models in explaining conceptual revolutions. Perhaps his most distinctive contribution to the field is the concept of explanatory coherence, which he has applied to many historical cases. He is heavily influenced by pragmatists like C. S. Peirce, and has contributed to the refinement of the idea of inference to the best explanation.\n\nIn the philosophy of mind, he is known for his attempts to apply connectionist models of coherence to theories of human thought and action. He is also known for HOTCO, which was his attempt to create a computer model of cognition that incorporated emotions at a fundamental level.\n\nIn his general approach to philosophy, Thagard is sharply critical of analytic philosophy for being overly dependent upon intuitions as a source of evidence.\n\nThagard was born in Yorkton, Saskatchewan on September 28, 1950. He is a graduate of the Universities of Saskatchewan, Cambridge, Toronto (Ph.D. in philosophy, 1977) and Michigan (M.S. in computer science, 1985). He was Chair of the Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society , 1998–1999, and President of the Society for Machines and Mentality , 1997-1998. In 1997 he won a Canada Council Killam Prize, and in 1999 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2003, he received a University of Waterloo Award for Excellence in Research, and in 2005 he was named a University Research Chair.\n\nThagard was married to the psychologist Ziva Kunda. Kunda died in 2004.\n\nThagard has proposed that many cognitive functions, including perception, analogy, explanation, decision-making, planning etc., can be understood as a form of (maximum) coherence computation.\n\nThagard (together with Karsten Verbeurgt) put forth a particular formalization of the concept of coherence as a constraint satisfaction problem. The model posits that coherence operates over a set of representational elements (e.g., propositions, images, etc.) which can either fit together (cohere) or resist fitting together (incohere).\n\nIf two elements p and q cohere they are connected by a positive constraint formula_1, and if two elements formula_2 and formula_3 incohere they are connected by a negative constraint formula_4. Furthermore, constraints are weighted, i.e., for each constraint formula_5 there is a positive weight formula_6.\n\nAccording to Thagard, coherence maximization involves the partitioning of elements into accepted (formula_7) and rejected (formula_8) elements in such a way that maximum number (or maximum weight) of constraints is satisfied. Here a positive constraint formula_9 is said to be satisfied if either both formula_2 and formula_3 are accepted (formula_12) or both formula_2 and formula_3 are rejected (formula_15). A negative constraint formula_16 is satisfied if one element is accepted (say formula_17), and the other rejected (formula_18).\n\nThere has been some decrease in interest in the demarcation problem in recent years. Part of the problem is that many suspect that it is an intractable problem, since so many previous attempts have come up short. For example, many obvious examples of pseudoscience have been shown to be falsifiable, or verifiable, or revisable. Therefore, many of the previously proposed demarcation criteria have not been judged as particularly reliable.\n\nThagard has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if:\nThagard is the author/co-author of 11 books and over 100 peer-reviewed articles.\n\nAnd co-author of:\n\nHe is also editor of:\n\n"}

He was mostly interested in the philosophy of law.\n\nBorg was born in 1843. He became a diocesan priest, and was a Canon of the bishop's Cathedral Chapter. He was a Doctor of Theology and Divinity, and a Doctor of Canon Law. He was a member of the \"Società Storica e Scientifica di Malta\" (Historical and Scientific Society of Malta), and for a time also an Apostolic Prefect.\n\nAssuming his duties as a Catholic priest in a country ruled by a Protestant colonial government, Borg had his eye set on the fine print of enacted legislation, and was particularly apt to read between the lines. Though he investigated all types of laws to detect whether they infringed upon the Catholic privileges and mores of the Maltese, his main concern, given the particular circumstances of his times, was reserved for the contraction of matrimony and, especially, on the problem of mixed or interfaith marriages between Catholics and Protestants. Together with the authorities of the Catholic Church, Borg harboured the suspicion that the Protestant colonial government took a laissez faire attitude towards mixed marriages in order to increase the Protestant population in the Maltese islands and thereby diminish Catholic influence.\n\nBorg was thus part of a defensive strategy of the Catholic Church to preserve the Catholic heritage of the Maltese populace. Nevertheless, his protective stance went farther than this, since it was then equally important to strengthen Catholic traditions from within. Hence Borg was also part of an underlying movement sanctioned by Church authorities to combat and counter, possibly on philosophical grounds, any attempt to merge or compromise Catholic doctrine when efforts were made to bring into closer relations Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThough Borg was a somewhat prolific writer, many of his compositions are of a religious or devotional nature with no interest to philosophy. Nonetheless, some of his publications are relevant to philosophy since Borg proffers arguments from reason to justify his positions. The following, than, are worthy of note:\n\n\nApart from the introductions and documentary evidence at the end, the book is divided into three main parts. The first is historical and critical, the second is theoretical and analytical, and the third part is theoretical and practical.\n\n\n\n"}

He became well-versed in natural science, history, logic, philosophy, and psychology. He also became an instructor in mathematics for two decades.\n\nLavrov joined the revolutionary movement as a radical in 1862. His actions led to his being exiled to the Ural Mountains in 1868 from which he soon escaped and fled abroad. In France, he lived mostly in Paris, where he became a member of the Anthropological Society. Lavrov had been attracted to European socialist ideas early on, though at first he did not know how they applied to Russia. While he was in Paris, Lavrov fully committed himself to the revolutionary socialist movement. He became a member of the Ternes section of the International Workingmen's Association in 1870. He was also present at the start of the Paris Commune, and soon went abroad to generate international support.\n\nLavrov arrived in Zürich in November 1872, and became a rival of Mikhail Bakunin's in the \"Russian Colony\". In Zürich he lived in the Frauenfeld house near the university. Lavrov tended more toward reform than revolution, or at least saw reform as salutary. He preached against the conspiratorial ideology of Peter Tkachev and others like him. Lavrov believed that while a coup d'état would be easy in Russia, the creation of a socialist society needed to involve the Russian masses. He founded the journal \"Forward!\" in 1872, its first issue appearing in August 1873. Lavrov used this journal to publicize his analysis of Russia's peculiar historical development.\n\nLavrov was a prolific writer for more than 40 years. His works include \"The Hegelian Philosophy\" (1858–59) and \"Studies in the Problems of Practical Philosophy\" (1860). While living in exile, he edited his Socialist review, \"Forward!\". A contribution to the revolutionary cause, \"Historical Letters\" (1870) was written under the pseudonym Mirtov. The letters greatly influenced the revolutionary activity in Russia. He was called \"Peter Lawroff\" in \"\" (1899–1900) by K. Tarassoff.\n\nIn Peter Lavrov's view, socialism was the natural outcome of Western European historical development. He believed that the bourgeois mode of production planted the seeds of its own destruction. \"Lavrov began his revolutionary career with the assumption that the future belonged to West European scientific socialism, as created by material conditions of West European civilization.\" Lavrov recognized that Russia's historical development was significantly different from that of Western Europe, though he still maintained hope that Russia might join in the greater European socialist movement.\n\nIn Lavrov's analysis of Russia's historical development, he concluded that the essence of Russia's peculiarity rested on the fact that they had not experienced feudalism and all of its progressive features. Russia had been isolated from European development by the Mongol conquest in the thirteenth century. In 1870, Lavrov published a comparison of the levels of economic, political and social development of several Western European nations and Russia, noting the relatively backward and poor condition of Russia.\n\nDespite Lavrov's historical analysis, he still believed a socialist revolution was possible in Russia. One of his contemporaries, Georgi Plekhanov, believed that a socialist revolution would only come with the development of a revolutionary workers’ party. In other words, he believed that Russia would have to wait for the same historical development experienced by the West. Lavrov rejected this outlook, believing it possible to create socialism by basing revolutionary tactics on Russia's individual history. Almost 90 percent of Russia's population were peasants, and there was also the intelligentsia: a unique bunch of people without any class affiliations, who, \"unlike other elements of Russian society, were unflawed by the past.\"\n\nThus, Lavrov felt that a true socialist revolution would have to integrate the rural population in order to succeed. Lavrov considered the intelligentsia the only portion of society capable of preparing Russia for participation in a worldwide socialist revolution. He gave them the task of compensating for the shortfalls of Russian historical development by organizing the people, teaching them scientific socialism, and finally, preparing to take up arms with the people when the time would come.\n\nIn his “Historical Letters” Lavrov accentuated the indissoluble connection between sociology as a science and basic principles of individual morality. According to him, sociological knowledge always depends upon scholars’ consciously chosen ideals. The majority of researchers stress the heterogeneity of Lavrov’s ideas as well as the fact that a considerable impact was made upon him both by the leaders of the positivist tradition and by Marx. All those impacts were in some way synthesized in Lavrov’s idea of solidarity as the key issue of sociological research. Lavrov defined sociology as a science dealing with forms of social solidarity, which he subdivided into three major types:\n- unconscious solidarity of custom; \n- purely emotional solidarity, based on impulses not controlled by critical reflection;\n- “conscious historical solidarity” resulting from a common effort to attain a consciously selected and rationally justified goal. \nThe latter represented the highest and the most significant type of human solidarity. It developed later than the first two types and proclaimed the conversion of the static “culture” into the dynamic “civilization.” To sum it up, social solidarity in Lavrov’s view is “the consciousness that personal interest coincides with social interest, that personal dignity is maintained only by upholding the dignity of all who share in this solidarity”. Otherwise it is a mere community of habits, interests, affects, or convictions. Thus solidarity is an essential premise of the existence of society. Solidary interaction distinguishes society from a simple gathering of individuals, the latter phenomenon constituting no sociological object. Moreover, the condition of individuals being conscious creatures excludes from the field of sociology forms of solidarity / solidary interaction performed by unconscious organisms, or, in other words, marks the borderline between social and biological phenomena.\n\n"}

It was largely a continuation of the Hamburgische Entreprise, whose dramaturge was Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and whose main owner was Seyler. The Seyler theatrical company became one of the most famous theatrical companies of Europe in the 18th century, attracting some of Germany's leading actors, playwrights and composers. It originally comprised around 60 members, including an orchestra, a ballet, house dramatists and set designers. Between 1777 and 1778 Seyler employed some 230 actors, singers and musicians. The company was originally (from 1769) contracted by the Hanoverian court with performing at Hanover and other cities of the kingdom. The company would eventually perform all across Germany, and performed for three years at the Weimar Schlosstheater, invited by Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. When Anna Amalia succeeded in engaging the Seyler Company, this was \"an extremely fortunate coup. The Seyler Company was the best theatre company in Germany at that time.\" The company had an important role in the development of German opera in the late 18th century.\n\nA number of plays were written for the Seyler theatrical company. For example, the play \"Sturm und Drang\" (which gave its name to the Sturm und Drang period) was written originally for the company by Friedrich Maximilian Klinger (Goethe's childhood friend), then employed as its playwright, and first performed in 1777. In 1789, Abel Seyler's wife, the celebrated actress Friederike Sophie Seyler, published the \"Singspiel\" \"Hüon und Amande\", that was plagiarized by the troupe of Emanuel Schikaneder and also greatly influenced \"The Magic Flute\".\n\nThreatened by bankruptcy in 1770, the company was saved by Seyler's brother-in-law, Johann Gerhard Reinhard Andreae.\n\n\n\n"}

As a celebrated scholastic philosopher and doctor of theology, he is often called Doctor Profundus (medieval epithet, meaning \"the Profound Doctor\").\n\nBradwardine was born in Sussex either at Hartfield or at Chichester, where his family was settled, members of the smaller gentry or burghers.\n\nBradwardine was a precocious student, educated at Balliol College, Oxford where he was a fellow by 1321; he took the degree of doctor of divinity, and acquired the reputation of a profound scholar, a skillful mathematician and an able theologian. He was also a gifted logician with theories on the \"insolubles\" and in particular the liar paradox.\n\nBradwardine subsequently moved to Merton College, Oxford on a fellowship. He was afterwards raised to the high offices of chancellor of the university and professor of divinity. Bradwardine (like his contemporary William of Occam) was a culminating figure of the great intellectual movement at Oxford that had begun in the 1240s.\n\nBradwardine was an ordinary secular cleric, which gave him intellectual freedom but deprived him of the security and wherewithal that the Preaching Orders would have afforded; instead he turned to royal patronage. From being chancellor of the diocese of London as Dean of St Paul's, he became chaplain and confessor to Edward III, whom he attended during his wars in France at the Battle of Crécy, where he preached at the victory Mass, and at the subsequent siege of Calais. Edward repeatedly entrusted him with diplomatic missions. On his return to England, he was successively appointed prebendary of Lincoln and dean (1348). In 1349 the canons of the chapter at Canterbury elected him Archbishop following the death of Archbishop John Stratford, but Edward III withheld his consent, preferring his chancellor John de Ufford, perhaps loth to lose his trusted confessor. After Ufford died of the Black Death, 2 May, Bradwardine went to receive confirmation from Pope Clement VI at Avignon, but on his return he died of the plague at Rochester on 26 August 1349, forty days after his consecration. He was buried at Canterbury.\n\nChaucer in The Nun's Priest's Tale (line 476) ranks Bradwardine with Augustine and Boethius. His great theological work, to modern eyes, is a treatise against the Pelagians, entitled \"De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum\". Bradwardine's major treatise argued that space was an infinite void in which God could have created other worlds, which he would rule as he ruled this one. The \"causes of virtue\" include the influences of the planets, not as predestining a human career, but influencing a subject's essential nature. This astrophysical treatise was not published until it was edited by Sir Henry Savile and printed in London, 1618; its circulation in manuscript was very limited. The implications of the infinite void were revolutionary; to have pursued them would have threatened the singular relationship of man and this natural world to God (Cantor 2001); in it he treated theology mathematically. He wrote also \"De Geometria speculativa\" (printed at Paris, 1530); \"De Arithmetica practica\" (printed at Paris, 1502); \"De proportionibus velocitatum in motibus (1328)\" (printed at Paris, 1495; Venice, 1505); \"De Quadratura Circuli\" (Paris, 1495); and an \"Ars Memorative\", Sloane manuscripts. No. 3974 in the British Museum—earning from the Pope the title of the Profound Doctor. Another text, \"De Continuo\" is more tenuously credited to him and thought to be written sometime between 1328 and 1325.\n\nMerton College sheltered a group of dons devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, rivals of the intellectuals at the University of Paris. Bradwardine was one of these Oxford Calculators, studying mechanics with William Heytesbury, Richard Swineshead, and John Dumbleton. The Oxford Calculators distinguished kinematics from dynamics, emphasising kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the mean speed theorem: a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body. They also demonstrated this theorem — the foundation of \"The Law of Falling Bodies\" — long before Galileo, who is generally credited with it.\n\nThe mathematical physicist and historian of science Clifford Truesdell, wrote:\n\nIn \"Tractatus de proportionibus\" (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of Eudoxus of Cnidus to anticipate the concept of exponential growth, later developed by the Bernoulli and Euler, with compound interest as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern mathematical concept of limit, so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian Carl Benjamin Boyer writes, \"Bradwardine developed the Boethian theory of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call 'n-tuple' proportion\".\n\nBoyer also writes that \"the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of trigonometry gleaned from Muslim sources\". Yet \"Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science\" (Cantor 2001, p. 122). The most essential missing tool was calculus.\n\nBradwardine was also a practitioner and exponent of the art of memory, a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques used to organise memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. His \"De Memoria Artificiali\" (\"c.\" 1335) discusses memory training current during his time.\n\nBradwardine's theories on the \"insolubilia\" including the liar paradox were a great influence on the work of Jean Buridan. Bradwardine's work on kinematics was also influential to Buridan.\n\nHis \"De Causa Dei\" influenced the theology of John Wycliffe on grace and predestination.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to Pauler, the reductive method, unlike induction and deduction, does not determine what entities there are but rather can determine the conditions of possibility of valid thought itself. He also associates the reductive method with Plato's dialectic, even suggesting that reduction can ultimately lead to knowledge of the Form of the Good.\n\n"}
