Chumakov (; born on October 1, 1950) is a Russian philosopher, theoretician of science, scientific community organizer, and specialist in the fields of philosophy and the theory of globalistics.\n\nAlexander N. Chumakov was born in 1950 to a fisherman's family of Severnoe village, Caspian District, Astrakhan region, USSR. In 1972, he graduated from an industrial, technical college in the city of Khadyzhensk in Krasnodar Krai. Between 1972 and 1975, he worked as a bore-hole drilling master in the nuclear testing areas in Semipalatinsk and Novaya Zemlya. In 1975, he was accepted into the preparatory division of the Department of Philosophy of Moscow State University (MSU), from which he graduated cum laude in 1981. He also completed his postgraduate studies at MSU, receiving his Candidate of Sciences in 1984 and his Doctor of Sciences in 1991. Chumakov's doctoral dissertation was on the topic of \"Social and Philosophical Aspects of Global Problems.\" Since 1990, Chumakov has been the leading research fellow and head of the group \"Global Studies\" at the Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences. He became a full professor in 1993, and since 2008, has worked as a professor of the Department of Global Processes at MSU. He currently teaches several specialized courses at the university, including a course entitled \"Globalistics\" (Глобалистика, \"global studies\"). Since 2009, Chumakov has also worked as the chair of the Department of Philosophy at the Finance University under the Government of the Russian Federation.\n\nThere are four main schools philosophical thought in post-Soviet Russia, namely, Marxism, postmodernism, liberal Orthodoxy, and globalism. Alexander Chumakov is the leading Russian spokesman for globalism, which he writes \"represents a secular stream of thought that aims to formulate a worldview transcending the division between Russia and the West by providing a new philosophical basis for their integration and ultimate unity.\" A book review of his book, \"Philosophy of Globalization\", writes that Chumakov \"devoted his career in philosophy to the study of globalization and authored more than 550 scientific works and seven scholarly books that have been published in Russian, English, German, French, Chinese, Polish and Czech.\"\n\nIn his writings, Chumakov \"formulated the fundamental principles, which constitute the philosophical foundation of globalistics as a special field of philosophical knowledge.\" His analysis of globalization reveals that it \"represents an objective historical process and does not depend on the positive (or negative) intentions of separate countries or nations.\" It centers on the conceptual triad of culture, civilization, and globalization, which in Chumakov's works \"are analyzed as fundamental characteristics of various cultural civilizational systems, characteristics that are closely connected with each other.\" Chumakov argues that real and productive dialogue among different nations is possible because the universal character of civilization serves as the unifying factor for humanity, \"while cultural diversity is the basis of differentiation of various countries and nations.\"\n\nChumakov has devoted a great deal of time to administrative and organizational activities in the fields of philosophy, culture, and education. Since 1991 he has served as the first vice-president of the Russian Philosophical Society. He has also been a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association of Professors of Philosophy since 2012, as well as an acting member of the Presidium of Russian Ecological Academy since 2013.\n\nIn 2003, Chumakov organized a philosophical action that had great cultural significance in Russia and was widely publicized by the Russian media. During the 1920s the Soviet government expelled hundreds of prominent Russian intellectuals from the newly created Soviet Union, including many philosophers. Most of them were transported by boat to Germany and Turkey. In Russian historiography, this event is known as the \"philosophers' ships.\" Eighty years following the event, Chumakov organized a symbolic return of the \"philosophers' ships\" back to the motherland, which became open to freedom of expression and independent investigation of truth. To this end, he rented a ship, the Maria Ermolova, which sailed on route from Novorossiysk to Istanbul and back to Novorossiysk with hundreds of Russian philosophers on board to take part in the XXI World Congress of Philosophy in Istanbul in 2003.\n\nChumakov participated in the last six World Congresses of Philosophy, in Brighton in 1988, in Moscow in 1993, in Boston in 1998, in Istanbul in 2003, in Seoul in 2008, and in Athens in 2013. Throughout the events, he delivered scholarly presentations, including plenary addresses, and also served as chair of various roundtables, panels, and sections. Chumakov was also one of the initiators and main organizers of the Russian philosophical congresses that have taken place every three years, starting in 1997 and up to the latest in 2015, which took place in Ufa.\n\nChumakov was named laureate in the 2003 Russian publishers' \"Book of the Year\" contest in the nomination category of \"Encyclopedist\". He was awarded for the publication of his international encyclopedia, \"Global Studies\", which had been published in Russian and English languages.\n\nIn 2004, he was also named laureate of the international award named after N. K. Ba'bakov, bestowed by the International Fuel and Power Association (IFPA) \"for great accomplishments in resolving the problems of stable development of the power engineering and society.\"\n\nIn 2006, Chumakov received a diploma for co-authoring the fourth edition of the textbook \"Philosophy\", one of the \"300 best textbooks for higher education in honor of the 300th anniversary of Saint-Petersburg.\"\n\nIn 2015, Chumakov became Doctor Emeritus of the Bashkir State University. In 2015 Chumakov also became a recipient of the International Gusi Peace Prize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was elected Superior General by the Society's 36th General Congregation on 14 October 2016, succeeding Adolfo Nicolás. As a Venezuelan, he is the first Latin American person to lead the Jesuits.\n\nArturo Marcelino Sosa Abascal was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on 12 November 1948, the son of a Christian Socialist finance minister. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1966 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1977. He earned a licentiate in philosophy from the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello in 1972, and a doctorate in political science from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 1990.\n\nSosa has held a number of positions in various universities. He was a professor and member of the Council of the foundation for the Andrés Bello Catholic University, and rector of the Catholic University of Tachira, both Jesuit universities. He was also the Chair of Contemporary Political Theory and the Department of Social Change at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Venezuela. He published a number of works, mainly about the history and politics of Venezuela. He was also was coordinator of the social apostolate and director of Centro Gumilla in Venezuela, a centre of research and social action for the Jesuits in Venezuela, as well as editor-in-chief of \"Revista SIC\" magazine for Catholic social ethics and politics from 1976 to 1996. In 2004, he was professor of Venezuelan political thinking at the Catholic University of Tachira and was invited to Georgetown University Center for Latin American Studies as a visiting professor to give a lecture.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2004, Sosa was Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in Venezuela. During the 35th General Congregation in 2008, he was appointed Counselor General by then-Superior General Adolfo Nicolás. In 2014, he joined the General Curia of the Society of Jesus in Rome as Delegate for Interprovincial Roman Houses of the Society of Jesus in Rome, which include institutions such as the Pontifical Gregorian University, the Pontifical Biblical Institute, the Pontifical Oriental Institute, the Vatican Observatory, and \"La Civiltà Cattolica\".\n\nIn Venezuela, he was strongly committed to left-wing politics, and was critical of the country's representative democracy in the 1990s. He supported the two coups d'état of Hugo Chavez, though he later distanced himself from Chavez following human rights violations.\n\nSosa speaks Spanish, Italian and English, and understands French.\n\nOn 14 October 2016, during the thirty-sixth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus, the assembly elected Sosa as the Order's thirty-first Superior General to succeed Adolfo Nicolás. He became the first Latin American to head the Jesuits. In his first address as Superior General, he said that Jesuits should look for \"alternatives to overcome poverty, inequality and oppression\" and also to collaborate with others \"inside and outside the Church\".\n\nIn 2017, in a visit to the Jesuit mission in Cambodia, Sosa met with a group of Buddhist monks in the Buddhist-majority country. In 2018, commenting on the Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Sosa disagreed with the synod's description of secularization as \"a dark phase that is in the process of being overcome\", instead calling secularization a \"sign of the times\" for the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The Catholic Herald\" criticised Sosa for being one of over 1,000 signatories of a 1989 letter welcoming Cuban President Fidel Castro to Venezuela in 1989, having repressed the Catholic Church in Cuba during his time in power. Pope Francis biographer George Neumayr described Sosa as a \"Marxist\", \"a Venezuelian communist, and modernist\".\n\nIn February 2017, in response to Cardinal Müller's argument that permitting the reception of Communion by the remarried contradicts Jesus's words in the Bible that marriage is indissoluble and Müller's insistence that those words are unchangeable, Sosa argued for a \"reflection on what Jesus really said\", and described the Gospel as \"relative\", being \"written by human beings\" and \"accepted by (...) human beings\". Sosa also argued that that the doctrine of the Church is in \"continuous development\", and \"never in white and black\". Sosa's remarks drew criticism. Priest and consulting editor of \"The Catholic Herald\" Alexander Lucie-Smith disagreed with Sosa, arguing that the Church's teaching on the indissolubility of marriage has been historically consistent, and that there was no precedent set in the Bible to interpret these words otherwise. Theologian Chad Pecknold criticised Sosa's views as \"reflect[ing] a profound skepticism about Holy Scripture\", countering that although a variety of interpretations are allowed, they must \"fit with the established doctrine of the Church and do not contradict the deposit of the Faith\". Contradicting Sosa's own claim that his views were \"not relativism\", Pecknold characterised Sosa's remarks as \"historicist relativizing\". Catholic author Vittorio Messori accused Sosa of \"'liquefying' the Gospel itself\" by suggesting that the Gospel should be adapted according to the times on the basis that Jesus’s words were not recorded verbatim or \"on tape\".\n\nIn June 2017, in an interview with \"El Mundo\", Sosa said, “We have formed symbolic figures such as the devil to express evil. Social conditioning can also represent this figure, since there are people who act [in an evil way] because they are in an environment where it is difficult to act to the contrary.” This was criticised as contradicting the Catechism of the Catholic Church which teaches that the Devil is a real creature. A spokesman for Sosa later argued that Sosa was not denying church teaching, saying, \"to say the devil symbolizes evil is not to deny the existence of the devil.\"\n\nIn October 2018, in an interview with EWTN, Sosa argued that \"the pope is not the chief of the Church, he's the Bishop of Rome\". This was opposed by Pecknold, who argued that it would be wrong to believe that Pope was \"merely 'first among equals'\", and insisted that the pope has \"supreme authority\" over all bishops and faithful.\n\nSosa has authored about a dozen books on politics and on the history of Venezuela, including:\n\n"}

{"id": "601880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601880", "title": "Bolesław Prus", "text": "Bolesław Prus\n\nBolesław Prus (pronounced: ]; 20 August 1847 – 19 May 1912; actual name, Aleksander Głowacki) is a leading figure in the history of Polish literature and philosophy and a distinctive voice in world literature. He is generally known by his pen name, Bolesław Prus.\n\nAs a 15-year-old Głowacki joined the Polish 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia. Shortly after his 16th birthday, he suffered severe battle injuries. Five months later he was imprisoned for his part in the Uprising. These early experiences may have precipitated the panic disorder and agoraphobia that would dog him through life, and shaped his opposition to attempting to regain Poland's independence by force of arms.\n\nIn 1872 at age 25, in Warsaw, he settled into a 40-year journalistic career that highlighted science, technology, education, and economic and cultural development. These societal enterprises were essential to the endurance of a people who had in the 18th century been partitioned out of political existence by Russia, Prussia and Austria. Głowacki took his pen name \"Prus\" from the appellation of his family's coat-of-arms.\n\nAs a sideline he wrote short stories. Succeeding with these, he went on to employ a larger canvas; over the decade between 1884 and 1895, he completed four major novels: \"The Outpost\", \"The Doll\", \"The New Woman\" and \"Pharaoh\". \"The Doll\" depicts the romantic infatuation of a man of action who is frustrated by his country's backwardness. \"Pharaoh\", Prus' only historical novel, is a study of political power and of the fates of nations, set in ancient Egypt at the fall of the 20th Dynasty and New Kingdom.\n\nAleksander Głowacki was born 20 August 1847 in Hrubieszów, now in southeastern Poland, very near the present-day border with Ukraine. The town was then in the Russian-controlled sector of partitioned Poland, known as the \"Congress Kingdom\". Głowacki was the younger son of Antoni Głowacki, an estate steward at the village of Żabcze, in Hrubieszów County, and Apolonia Głowacka, \"née\" Trembińska. In 1850, when the future \"Bolesław Prus\" was three years old, his mother died; the child was placed in the care of his maternal grandmother, Marcjanna Trembińska of Puławy, and, four years later, in the care of his aunt, Domicela Olszewska of Lublin. In 1856 Prus was orphaned by his father's death. In 1862 Prus' brother Leon, a teacher thirteen years his senior, took him to Siedlce, then to Kielce.\n\nSoon after the outbreak of the Polish January 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia, 15-year-old Prus ran away from school to join the insurgents. He may have been influenced by his brother Leon, who subsequently became one of the insurrection's leaders. During the Uprising, Leon developed a mental illness that he would suffer from until his death in 1907.\n\nOn 1 September 1863, twelve days after his sixteenth birthday, Prus took part in a battle against Russian forces at a village called Białka, four kilometers south of Siedlce. He suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce. This experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong agoraphobia.\nFive months later, in early February 1864, Prus was arrested and imprisoned at Lublin Castle for his role in the Uprising. In early April a military court sentenced him to forfeiture of his nobleman's status and resettlement on imperial lands. On 30 April, however, the Lublin District military head credited Prus' time spent under arrest and, on account of the 16-year-old's youth, decided to place him in the custody of his uncle Klemens Olszewski. On 7 May Prus was released and entered the household of Katarzyna Trembińska, a relative and the mother of his future wife, Oktawia Trembińska.\n\nPrus enrolled at a Lublin \"gymnasium\" (secondary school, where he was a student of Józef Skłodowski, grandfather of the future Nobel laureate Maria Skłodowska-Curie). Graduating on 30 June 1866, at nineteen he matriculated in the Warsaw University Department of Mathematics and Physics. In 1868, poverty forced him to break off his university studies.\n\nIn 1869 he enrolled in the Forestry Department at the newly opened Agriculture and Forestry Institute in Puławy, a historic town where he had spent some of his childhood and which, 15 years later, would be the setting for his striking 1884 micro-story, \"Mold of the Earth\", comparing human history with the mutual aggressions of blind, mindless colonies of molds that cover a boulder adjacent to the Temple of the Sibyl. Aleksander was soon expelled from the Institute for his attitude toward the martinet Russian-language instructor.\n\nHenceforth he studied on his own while supporting himself mainly as a tutor. As part of his program of self-education, he translated and summarized John Stuart Mill's \"Logic\".\n\nIn 1872 he embarked on a career as a newspaper columnist, while working several months at the Evans, Lilpop and Rau Machine and Agricultural Implement Works in Warsaw. In 1873 Prus delivered two public lectures which illustrate the breadth of his scientific interests: \"On the Structure of the Universe,\" and \".\"\n\nAs a newspaper columnist, Prus commented on the achievements of scholars and scientists such as John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and Henry Thomas Buckle; urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce; encouraged the establishment of charitable institutions to benefit the underprivileged; described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow writers such as H.G. Wells; and extolled man-made and natural wonders such as the Wieliczka Salt Mine, an 1887 solar eclipse that he witnessed at Mława, planned building of the Eiffel Tower for the 1889 Paris Exposition, and Nałęczów, where he vacationed for 30 years.\n\nHis \"Weekly Chronicles\" spanned forty years (they have since been reprinted in twenty volumes) and would help prepare the ground for the 20th-century blossoming of Polish science and especially mathematics. \"Our national life,\" wrote Prus, \"will take a normal course only when we have become a useful, indispensable element of civilization, when we have become able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free.\" The social importance of science and technology would recur as a theme in his novels \"The Doll\" (1889) and \"Pharaoh\" (1895).\n\nOf contemporary thinkers, the one who most influenced Prus and other writers of the Polish \"Positivist\" period (roughly 1864–1900) was Herbert Spencer, the English sociologist who coined the phrase, \"survival of the fittest.\" Prus would call Spencer \"the Aristotle of the 19th century\" and write: \"I grew up under the influence of Spencerian evolutionary philosophy and heeded its counsels, not those of Idealist or Comtean philosophy.\" Prus interpreted \"survival of the fittest,\" in the societal sphere, as involving not only competition but also cooperation; and he adopted Spencer's metaphor of society as organism. He would use this metaphor to striking effect in his 1884 micro-story \"Mold of the Earth,\" and in the introduction to his 1895 historical novel, \"Pharaoh\".\n\nAfter Prus began writing regular weekly newspaper columns, his finances stabilized, permitting him on 14 January 1875 to marry a distant cousin on his mother's side, Oktawia Trembińska. She was the daughter of Katarzyna Trembińska, in whose home he had lived, after release from prison, for two years in 1864–66 while completing secondary school. The couple adopted a boy, Emil Trembiński (born 11 September 1886, the son of Prus' brother-in-law Michał Trembiński, who had died on 10 November 1888). Emil would be the model for Rascal in chapter 48 of Prus' 1895 novel, \"Pharaoh\". On 18 February 1904, aged seventeen, Emil fatally shot himself in the chest on the doorstep of an unrequited love.\n\nIt has been alleged that in 1906, aged 59, Prus had a son, Jan Bogusz Sacewicz. The boy's mother was Alina Sacewicz, widow of Dr. Kazimierz Sacewicz, a socially conscious physician whom Prus had known at Nałęczów. Dr. Sacewicz may have been the model for Stefan Żeromski's Dr. Judym in the novel, \"Ludzie bezdomni\" (Homeless People)—a character resembling Dr. Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's play, \"An Enemy of the People\". Prus, known for his affection for children, took a lively interest in little Jan, as attested by a prolific correspondence with Jan's mother (whom Prus attempted to interest in writing). Jan Sacewicz would become one of Prus' major legatees and an engineer, and die in a German camp after the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising of August–October 1944.\n\nThough Prus was a gifted writer, initially best known as a humorist, he early on thought little of his journalistic and literary work. Hence at the inception of his career in 1872, at age 25, he adopted for his newspaper columns and fiction the pen name \"Prus\" (\"Prus I\" was his family coat-of-arms), reserving his actual name, Aleksander Głowacki, for \"serious\" writing.\n\nAn 1878 incident illustrates the strong feelings that can be aroused in susceptible readers of newspaper columns. Prus had criticized the rowdy behavior of some Warsaw university students at a lecture about the poet Wincenty Pol. The students demanded that Prus retract what he had written. He refused, and on 26 March 1878 several of them surrounded him outside his home, where he had returned shortly before in the company (for his safety) of two fellow writers; one of the students, Jan Sawicki, slapped Prus' face. Police were summoned, but Prus declined to press charges. Seventeen years later, during his 1895 visit to Paris, Prus' memory of the incident was still so painful that he may have refused (accounts vary) to meet with one of his assailants, Kazimierz Dłuski, and his wife Bronisława Dłuska (Marie Skłodowska Curie's sister who 19 years later, in 1914, would scold Joseph Conrad for writing his novels and stories in English, rather than in Polish for the benefit of Polish culture). These curiously interlinked incidents involving the Dłuskis and the two authors perhaps illustrate the contemporary intensity of aggrieved Polish national pride.\n\nIn 1882, on the recommendation of an earlier editor-in-chief, the prophet of Polish Positivism, Aleksander Świętochowski, Prus succeeded to the editorship of the Warsaw daily \"Nowiny\" (News). The newspaper had been bought in June 1882 by financier Stanisław Kronenberg. Prus resolved, in the best Positivist fashion, to make it \"an observatory of societal facts\"—an instrument for advancing the development of his country. After less than a year, however, \"Nowiny\"—which had had a history of financial instability since changing in July 1878 from a Sunday paper to a daily—folded, and Prus resumed writing columns. \n\nIn time, Prus adopted the French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality, and he devoted more attention to his sideline of short-story writer. Prus' stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction would also be influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Émile Zola.\n\nPrus wrote several dozen stories, originally published in newspapers and ranging in length from micro-story to novella. Characteristic of them are Prus' keen observation of everyday life and sense of humor, which he had early honed as a contributor to humor magazines. The prevalence of themes from everyday life is consistent with the Polish Positivist artistic program, which sought to portray the circumstances of the populace rather than those of the Romantic heroes of an earlier generation. The literary period in which Prus wrote was ostensibly a prosaic one, by contrast with the poetry of the Romantics; but Prus' prose is often a poetic prose. His stories also often contain elements of fantasy or whimsy. A fair number originally appeared in New Year's issues of newspapers.\n\nPrus long eschewed writing historical fiction, arguing that it must inevitably distort history. He criticized contemporary historical novelists for their lapses in historic accuracy, including Henryk Sienkiewicz's failure, in the military scenes in his \"Trilogy\" portraying 17th-century Polish history, to describe the logistics of warfare. It would only be in 1888, when Prus was forty, that he would write his first historical fiction, the stunning short story, \"A Legend of Old Egypt.\" This story would, a few years later, serve as a preliminary sketch for his only historical novel, \"Pharaoh\" (1895).\n\nEventually Prus would compose four novels on what he had referred to in an 1884 letter as \"great questions of our age\": \"The Outpost\" (\"Placówka\", 1886) on the Polish peasant; \"The Doll\" (\"Lalka\", 1889) on the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms; \"The New Woman\" (\"Emancypantki\", 1893) on feminist concerns; and his only historical novel, \"Pharaoh\" (\"Faraon\", 1895), on mechanisms of political power. The work of greatest sweep and most universal appeal is \"Pharaoh\". Prus' novels, like his stories, were originally published in newspaper serialization.\n\nAfter having sold \"Pharaoh\" to the publishing firm of Gebethner and Wolff, Prus embarked, on 16 May 1895, on a four-month journey abroad. He visited Berlin, Dresden, Karlsbad, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and Rapperswil. At the latter Swiss town he stayed two months (July–August), nursing his agoraphobia and spending much time with his friends, the promising young writer Stefan Żeromski and his wife Oktawia. The couple sought Prus' help for the Polish National Museum, housed in the Rapperswil Castle, where Żeromski was librarian.\n\nThe final stage of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was prevented by his agoraphobia from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in \"The Doll\" had been on the mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at Nałęczów from his journey, the last that he would make abroad.\n\nOver the years, Prus lent his support to many charitable and social causes. But there was one event he would come to rue for the broad criticism it brought him: his participation in welcoming Russia's tsar during Nicholas II's 1897 visit to Warsaw. As a rule, Prus did not affiliate himself with political parties, as this might compromise his journalistic objectivity. His associations, by design and temperament, were with individuals and select worthy causes rather than with large groups.\n\nThe disastrous January 1863 Uprising had persuaded Prus that society must advance through learning, work and commerce rather than through risky social upheavals. He departed from this stance, however, in 1905, when Imperial Russia experienced defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and Poles demanded autonomy and reforms. On 20 December 1905, in the first issue of a short-lived periodical, \"Młodość\" (Youth), he published an article, \"Oda do młodości\" (\"Ode to Youth\"), whose title harked back to an 1820 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. Prus wrote, in reference to his earlier position on revolution and strikes: \"with the greatest pleasure, I admit it—I was wrong!\"\n\nIn 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw \"Tygodnik Ilustrowany\" (Illustrated Weekly), his novel \"Dzieci\" (Children), depicting the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists of the day — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, \"Przemiany\" (Changes), was to have been, like \"The Doll\", a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911-12 the novel had barely begun serialization in the \"Illustrated Weekly\" when its composition was cut short by Prus' death.\n\nNeither of the two late novels, \"Children\" or \"Changes\", is generally regarded as part of the essential Prus canon, and Czesław Miłosz has called \"Children\" one of Prus' weakest works.\n\nPrus' last novel to meet with popular acclaim was \"Pharaoh\", completed in 1895. Depicting the demise of ancient Egypt's Twentieth Dynasty and New Kingdom three thousand years earlier, \"Pharaoh\" had also reflected Poland's loss of independence a century before in 1795—an independence whose post-World War I restoration Prus would not live to see.\n\nOn 19 May 1912, in his Warsaw apartment at 12 Wolf Street (\"ulica Wilcza 12\"), near Triple Cross Square, Prus' forty-year journalistic and literary career came to an end.\n\nThe beloved agoraphobic author was mourned by the nation he had striven, as soldier, thinker and writer, to rescue from oblivion. Thousands attended his 22 May 1912 funeral service at St. Alexander's Church on nearby Triple Cross Square (\"Plac Trzech Krzyży\") and his interment at Powązki Cemetery.\n\nPrus' tomb was designed by his nephew, the noted sculptor Stanisław Jackowski. On three sides it bears, respectively, the novelist's name, \"Aleksander Głowacki\", his years of birth and death, and his pen name, \"Bolesław Prus\". On the fourth side is the Polish-language inscription \"Serce serc\" (\"Heart of hearts\"), borrowed from the Latin \"Cor cordium\" on the tomb of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in Rome's Protestant Cemetery. Below this inscription stands the figure of a little girl embracing the tomb — a figure emblematic of Prus' well-known empathy and affection for children.\n\nOn 3 December 1961, nearly half a century after Prus' death, a museum devoted to him was opened in the 18th-century Małachowski Palace at Nałęczów, near Lublin in eastern Poland. Outside the palace is a sculpture of Prus seated on a bench. Another statuary monument to Prus at Nałęczów, sculpted by Alina Ślesińska, was unveiled on 8 May 1966. It was at Nałęczów that Prus vacationed for thirty years from 1882 until his death, and that he met the young Stefan Żeromski. Prus stood witness at Żeromski's 1892 wedding and generously helped foster the younger man's literary career.\n\nWhile Prus espoused a positivist and realist outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-1863-Uprising Polish Romantic literature. Indeed, he held the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz in high regard. Prus' novels in turn, especially \"The Doll\" and \"Pharaoh\", with their innovative composition techniques, blazed the way for the 20th-century Polish novel.\n\nPrus' novel \"The Doll\", with its rich realistic detail and simple, functional language, was considered by Czesław Miłosz to be the great Polish novel.\n\nJoseph Conrad, during his 1914 visit to Poland just as World War I was breaking out, \"delighted in his beloved Prus\" and read everything by the ten-years-older, recently deceased author that he could get his hands on. He pronounced \"The New Woman\" (the first novel by Prus that he read) \"better than Dickens\"—Dickens being a favorite author of Conrad's. Miłosz, however, thought \"The New Woman\" \"as a whole... an artistic failure...\" Zygmunt Szweykowski similarly faulted \"The New Woman\"'s loose, tangential construction; but this, in his view, was partly redeemed by Prus' humor and by some superb episodes, while \"The tragedy of Mrs. Latter and the picture of [the town of] Iksinów are among the peak achievements of [Polish] novel-writing.\"\n\"Pharaoh\", a study of political power, became the favorite novel of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, prefigured the fate of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and continues to point analogies to more recent times. \"Pharaoh\" is often described as Prus' \"best-composed novel\"—indeed, \"one of the best-composed [of all] Polish novels.\" This was due in part to \"Pharaoh\" having been composed complete prior to newspaper serialization, rather than being written in installments just before printing, as was the case with Prus' earlier major novels.\n\n\"The Doll\" and \"Pharaoh\" are available in English versions. \"The Doll\" has been translated into sixteen languages, and \"Pharaoh\" into twenty. In addition, \"The Doll\" has been filmed several times, and been produced as a 1977 television miniseries, \"Pharaoh\" was adapted into a 1966 feature film.\n\nIn 1897-99 Prus serialized in the Warsaw \"Daily Courier\" (\"Kurier Codzienny\") a monograph on \"\" (\"Najogólniejsze ideały życiowe\"), which systematized ethical ideas that he had developed over his career regarding \"happiness\", \"utility\" and \"perfection\" in the lives of individuals and societies. In it he returned to the society-organizing (i.e., political) interests that had been frustrated during his \"Nowiny\" editorship fifteen years earlier. A book edition appeared in 1901 (2nd, revised edition, 1905). This work, rooted in Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarian philosophy and Herbert Spencer's view of society-as-organism, retains interest especially for philosophers and social scientists.\n\nAnother of Prus' learned projects remained incomplete at his death. He had sought, over his writing career, to develop a coherent theory of literary composition. Notes of his from 1886-1912 were never put together into a finished book as he had intended. His precepts included the maxim, \"Nouns, nouns and more nouns.\" Some particularly intriguing fragments describe Prus' combinatorial calculations of the millions of potential \"individual types\" of human characters, given a stated number of \"individual traits.\"\n\nA curious comparative-literature aspect has been noted to Prus' career, which paralleled that of his American contemporary, Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914). Each was born and reared in a rural area and had a \"Polish\" connection (Bierce, born five years before Prus, was reared in Kosciusko County, Indiana, and attended high school at the county seat, Warsaw, Indiana). Each became a war casualty with combat head trauma—Prus in 1863 in the Polish 1863-65 Uprising; Bierce in 1864 in the American Civil War. Each experienced false starts in other occupations, and at twenty-five became a journalist for the next forty years; failed to sustain a career as editor-in-chief; achieved celebrity as a short-story writer; lost a son in tragic circumstances (Prus, an adopted son; Bierce, both his sons); attained superb humorous effects by portraying human egoism (Prus especially in \"Pharaoh\", Bierce in \"The Devil's Dictionary\"); was dogged from early adulthood by a health problem (Prus, agoraphobia; Bierce, asthma); and died within two years of the other (Prus in 1912; Bierce presumably in 1914). Prus, however, unlike Bierce, went on from short stories to write novels.\n\nIn Prus' lifetime and since, his contributions to Polish literature and culture have been memorialized without regard to the nature of the political system prevailing at the time. His 50th birthday, in 1897, was marked by special newspaper issues celebrating his 25 years as a journalist and fiction writer, and a portrait of him was commissioned from artist Antoni Kamieński.\n\nThe town where Prus was born, Hrubieszów, near the present Polish-Ukrainian border, is graced by an outdoor sculpture of him.\n\nA 1982 plaque on Warsaw University's administration building, the historic Kazimierz Palace, commemorates Prus' years at the University in 1866-68. Across the street (\"Krakowskie Przedmieście\") from the University, in Holy Cross Church, a 1936 plaque by Prus' nephew Stanisław Jackowski, featuring Prus' profile, is dedicated to the memory of the \"great writer and teacher of the nation.\"\n\nOn the front of Warsaw's present-day \"ulica Wilcza 12\", the site of Prus' last home, is a plaque commemorating the earlier, now-nonexistent building's most famous resident. A few hundred meters from there, \"ulica Bolesława Prusa\" (Bolesław Prus Street) debouches into the southeast corner of Warsaw's Triple Cross Square. In this square stands St. Alexander's Church, where Prus' funeral was held.\n\nIn 1937, plaques were installed at Warsaw's \"Krakowskie Przedmieście\" \"4\" and \"7\", where the two chief characters of Prus' novel \"The Doll\", Stanisław Wokulski and Ignacy Rzecki, respectively, were deduced to have resided. On the same street, in a park adjacent to the Hotel Bristol, near the site of a newspaper for which Prus wrote, stands a twice-life-size statue of Prus, sculpted in 1977 by Anna Kamieńska-Łapińska; it is some 12 feet tall, on a minimal pedestal as befits an author who walked the same ground with his fellow men.\n\nConsonant with Prus' interest in commerce and technology, a Polish Ocean Lines freighter has been named for him.\n\nFor 10 years, from 1975 to 1984, Poles honored Prus' memory with a 10-\"złoty\" coin featuring his profile. In 2012, to mark the 100th anniversary of his death, the Polish mint produced three coins with individual designs: in gold, silver, and an aluminum-zinc alloy.\n\nPrus' fiction and nonfiction writings continue relevant in our time.\n\nFollowing is a chronological list of notable works by Bolesław Prus. Translated titles are given, followed by original titles and dates of publication.\n\n\n\n\nPrus' writings have been translated into many languages — his historical novel \"Pharaoh\", into twenty; his contemporary novel \"The Doll\", into at least sixteen. Works by Prus have been rendered into Croatian by a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Stjepan Musulin.\n\n\n\na. In a January 1909 newspaper column, Prus discussed H.G. Wells' 1901 book, \"Anticipations\", including Wells' prediction that by the year 2000, following the defeat of German imperialism \"on land and at sea,\" there would be a European Union that would reach eastward to include the western Slavs—the Poles, Czechs and Slovaks. The latter peoples, along with the Hungarians and six other countries, did in fact join the European Union in 2004.\n\nb. Prus was not alone in advocating the development of science and technology. It was part of the spirit of the times. The great Polish mathematician Kazimierz Kuratowski writes that in the period when Poland was under complete foreign rule (1795–1918) \"It was a common belief that the cultivation of science and the growth of its potential would somehow guarantee the [survival] of the [Polish] nation.\"\n\nc. In 1890 Prus wrote: \"When I was starting out as a writer, I wrote in part instinctively, in part by inadvertent imitation. My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt against the backdrop of what I had read. Every beginning author does the same. To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then [about 1880], brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. I expect that it will contain some fairly new things.\" \n\n"}

{"id": "169305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169305", "title": "Cognitive dissonance", "text": "Cognitive dissonance\n\nIn the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. This discomfort is triggered by a situation in which a person’s belief clashes with new evidence perceived by that person. When confronted with facts that contradict personal beliefs, ideals, and values, people will find a way to resolve the contradiction in order to reduce their discomfort.\n\nIn \"A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance\" (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance, by making changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance, or by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.\n\nTo function in the reality of a modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:\n\nThe reduction of the psychological stress of cognitive dissonance is a function of the magnitude of the dissonance caused by the existential inconsistency, between two contradictory beliefs held by the person; or by the contradiction between the person's beliefs and an action he or she has taken. Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:\n\nCognitive dissonance theory proposes that people seek psychological consistency between their personal expectations of life and the existential reality of the world. To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions.\n\nThe creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen his or her mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realised either by changing with or by justifying against, or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress. In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:\n\nThree cognitive biases in particular are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is \"better, kinder, smarter, more moral, and nicer than average,\" and confirmation bias.\n\nThat a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of \"The Psychology of Prejudice\" (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.\n\nLikewise, the study \"Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey\" (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking tobacco.\n\n\nTo reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:\n\n\nThere are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs, ideals, or values; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her prior intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.\n\nThe disconfirmation (contradiction) of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the belief under contradiction; yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person, by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction; seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs; or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.\n\nThe early hypothesis of belief disconfirmation presented in \"When Prophecy Fails\" (1956) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth, to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The disconfirmed prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance, between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, material reality, most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to hold a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing. That the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism; social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. Moreover, upon overcoming the disconfirmed belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers, by successful proselytism.\n\nThe study of \"The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference\" (2008) reported the belief disconfirmation occurred to the \"Chabad\" Orthodox Jewish congregation who believed that their Rebbe (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was the Messiah. Yet, when he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregants proved indifferent to that contradictory fact and continued claiming that Schneerson was the Messiah, and that he would soon return from the dead.\n\nIn the \"Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance\" (1959), the investigators Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith asked students to spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject.\n\nAt the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: \"I told someone that the task was interesting\" and \"I actually found it boring.\" Moreover, the subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the \"interesting task\" mental attitude because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the \"interesting task\" mental attitude and, thus, experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.\n\nIn the \"Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior\" (1963), a variant of the induced-compliance paradigm, by Elliot Aronson and Carlsmith, examined self-justification in children. In the experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy; and told the second half of the group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).\n\nLater, when the children were told that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of mild punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.\n\nIn \"The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance\" (2012), a variant of the forbidden-toy paradigm, indicated that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance. Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy; however, in the variable group, classical music played in the background, while the children played alone. In that group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.\n\nMoreover, music is a stimulus that can diminish post-decisional dissonance; in an earlier experiment, \"Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance\" (2010), the researchers indicated that the actions of hand-washing might inhibit the cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.\n\nIn the study \"Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives\" (1956) 225 female students rated a series of domestic appliances and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift. The results of a second round of ratings indicated that the women students increased their ratings of the domestic appliance they had selected as a gift and decreased their ratings of the appliances they rejected.\n\nThis type of cognitive dissonance occurs to a person faced with making a difficult decision, wherein there always exist aspects of the rejected-object not chosen, which appeal to the person making the choice. The action of deciding provokes the psychological dissonance consequent to choosing X instead of Y, despite little difference between X and Y; thus, the decision \"I chose X\" is dissonant with the cognition that \"There are some aspects of Y that I like.\" Moreover, the study \"Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys\" (2010) reports similar results in the occurrence of cognitive dissonance in human beings and in animals.\n\n\"Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?\" (2013) indicated that, in addition to internal deliberation, the structuring of decisions among people can influence how a person acts individually. That social preferences and social norms are related, and function in line with wage-giving among three persons. The actions of the first person influenced the wage-giving actions of the second person. That inequity aversion is the paramount concern of the participants.\n\nCognitive dissonance occurs to a person when he or she voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) unpleasant activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In \"The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group\" (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.\n\nBoth groups then were given headphones to unknowingly listen to a recorded discussion about animal sexual behaviour, which the researchers designed to be dull and banal. As the subjects of the experiment, the groups of people were told that the animal-sexuality discussion actually was occurring in the next room. The subjects whose strong initiation required reading aloud obscene words evaluated the people of their group as more-interesting persons than the people of the group who underwent the mild initiation to the discussion group.\n\nMoreover, in \"Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing\" (2006), the results indicated that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical–moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment.\nLikewise, the study \"The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making\" (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the names and paintings. To give meaning to the decisions, the participants were asked to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.\n\nThe results indicated that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based on his or her attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.\n\nIn the study \"Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings \" (2016), the researchers Michael R. Ent and Mary A Gerend informed the study participants about a discomforting test for a specific (fictitious) virus called the \"human respiratory virus-27\". The study used a fake virus to prevent participants from having thoughts, opinions, and feeling about the virus that would interfere with the experiment. The study participants were in two groups; one group was told that they were actual candidates for the virus-27 test, and the second group were told they were not candidates for the test. The researchers reported, \"We predicted that [study] participants who thought that they were candidates for the unpleasant test would experience dissonance associated with knowing that the test was both unpleasant and in their best interest—this dissonance was predicted to result in unfavorable attitudes toward the test.\"\n\nCognitive dissonance may also occur when people seek to:\n\nThe management of cognitive dissonance readily influences the motivation of a student to pursue education. The study \"Turning Play into Work: Effects of Adult Surveillance and Extrinsic Rewards on Children’s Intrinsic Motivation\" (1975) indicated that the application of the effort justification paradigm increased student enthusiasm for education with the offer of an external reward for studying; students in pre-school who completed puzzles based upon an adult promise of reward were later less interested in the puzzles than were students who completed the puzzle-tasks without the promise of a reward.\n\nThe incorporation of cognitive dissonance into models of basic learning-processes to foster the students’ self-awareness of psychological conflicts among their personal beliefs, ideals, and values and the reality of contradictory facts and information, requires the students to defend their personal beliefs. Afterwards, the students are trained to objectively perceive new facts and information to resolve the psychological stress of the conflict between reality and the student's value system. Moreover, educational software that applies the derived principles facilitates the students’ ability to successfully handle the questions posed in a complex subject. Meta-analysis of studies indicates that psychologic interventions that provoke cognitive dissonance in order to achieve a directed conceptual change do increase students’ learning in reading skills and about science.\n\nThe general effectiveness of psychotherapy and psychological intervention is partly explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance. In that vein, social psychology proposed that the mental health of the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance. That effective phenomenon was indicated in the results of the study \"Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children\" (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.\n\nIn the study \"Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction \" (1980), people afflicted with ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) who invested much effort in activities of little therapeutic value for them (experimentally represented as legitimate and relevant) showed improved alleviation of the symptoms of their phobia. Likewise, the results of \"Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss\" (1985) indicated that the patient felt better in justifying his or her efforts and therapeutic choices towards effectively losing weight. That the therapy of effort expenditure can predict long-term change in the patient's perceptions.\n\nCognitive dissonance is used to promote positive social behaviours, such as increased condom use; other studies indicate that cognitive dissonance can be used to encourage people to act pro-socially, such as campaigns against public littering, campaigns against racial prejudice, and compliance with anti-speeding campaigns. The theory can also be used to explain reasons for donating to charity.\nCognitive dissonance can be applied in social areas such as racism and racial hatred. Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group will develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015).\n\nThree main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii) The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer. The consumer is free to select from the alternatives, and the decision to buy is irreversible.\n\nThe study \"Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices \" (2003), indicated that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ a strategy of continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii) Engage in minimisation. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and substitute products consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re-evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces the importance of the elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal.\n\nCognitive dissonance theory might suggest that since votes are an expression of preference or beliefs, even the act of voting might cause someone to defend the actions of the candidate for whom they voted, and if the decision was close then the effects of cognitive dissonance should be greater.\n\nThis effect was studied over the 6 presidential elections of the United States between 1972 and 1996, and it was found that the opinion differential between the candidates changed more before and after the election than the opinion differential of non-voters. In addition, elections where the voter had a favorable attitude toward both candidates, making the choice more difficult, had the opinion differential of the candidates change more dramatically than those who only had a favorable opinion of one candidate. What wasn't studied were the cognitive dissonance effects in cases where the person had unfavorable attitudes toward both candidates. Since the U.S. 2016 election held historically high unfavorable ratings for both candidates, it might be a good case study to examine the cognitive dissonance effects in these instances.\n\nIn \"The Gestalt Theory of Motivation\" (1960), the social psychologist Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby people do not think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.\n\nAs such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (\"Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance\", 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: \"Did you find the task interesting?\", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.\n\nThe theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant arousal, of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments.\n\nIn \"The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective\" (1969), Elliot Aronson linked cognitive dissonance to the self-concept: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person's positive self-image. This reinterpretation of the original Festinger and Carlsmith study, using the induced-compliance paradigm, proposed that the dissonance was between the cognitions \"I am an honest person.\" and \"I lied about finding the task interesting.\"\n\nThe study \"Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle?\" (1971) reported that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, is how a person protects his or her public self-image. Moreover, the results reported in the study \"I’m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors\" (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.\n\nFritz Heider proposed a motivational theory of attitude change that functions on the idea that humans are driven to establish and maintain psychological balance. This drive is known as the consistency motive—the urge to maintain one's values and beliefs over time.\nAccording to balance theory there are three things interacting: (1) you (P), (2) another person (O), and (3) an element (X). These are each positioned at one point of a triangle and share two relations:\n\nAs people, human beings seek a balanced state of relations among three positions; 3 positives or 2 negatives, 1 positive:\n\nPeople also avoid unbalanced states of relations; 3 negatives or 2 positives, 1 negative)\n\nIn the study \"On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works\" (1969), Jules Dupuit reported that behaviors and cognitions can be understood from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic processing of comparing the costs and benefits of a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.\n\nE. Tory Higgins proposed that people have three selves, to which they compare themselves:\n\n\nWhen these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results. People are motivated to reduce self-discrepancy (the gap between two self-guides).\n\nDuring the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that dissonance was caused by aversive consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they feel they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.\n\nIn the study \"How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm\" (2010) the researchers criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate for the study of cognitive dissonance. That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.\n\nAlthough the results of some follow-up studies (e.g. \"Do Choices Affect Preferences? Some Doubts and New Evidence\", 2013) presented evidence of the unreliability of the rank-choice-rank method, the results of studies such as \"Neural Correlates of Cognitive Dissonance and Choice-induced Preference Change\" (2010) have not found the Choice-Rank-Choice method to be invalid, and indicate that making a choice can change the preferences of a person.\n\nThe action–motivation model proposes that inconsistencies in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency interferes with the person's functioning in the real world. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with his or her current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.\n\nThe occurrence of cognitive dissonance produces a state of negative affect, which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behaviour, in order to resolve the psychologic inconsistency that caused the mental stress. As the afflicted person works towards a behavioural commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left frontal cortex of the brain.\n\nThe predictive dissonance model proposes that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the predictive coding (or predictive processing) model of cognition. A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a Bayesian hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming proprioceptive, interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory inputs. Therefore, the brain is an inference machine which attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of prediction error. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the overfitting of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizable conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.\n\nThe study \"Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance\" (2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.\n\nThe results of the neural scan experiment support the original theory of Cognitive Dissonance proposed by Festinger in 1957; and also support the psychological conflict theory, whereby the anterior cingulate functions, in counter-attitudinal response, to activate the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insular cortex; the degree of activation of said regions of the brain is predicted by the degree of change in the psychological attitude of the person.\nAs an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study \"How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome\" (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected. Moreover, studies such as \"The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making\" (2010) and \"How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification\" (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.\n\n\"The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making\" (2010) applied the free-choice paradigm to fMRI examination of the brain's decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-inferior frontal gyrus, in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the ventral striatum, and that neural activity decreased in the anterior insula. That the neural activities of rationalization occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions.\n\nThe results reported in \"Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity\" (2004) indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the left frontal cortex, a brain structure also associated with the emotion of anger; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex. Applying a directional model of Approach motivation, the study \"Anger and the Behavioural Approach System\" (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, he or she is without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe anterior cingulate cortex activity increases when errors occur and are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept as a form of higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.\n\nThe results reported in \"The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys\" (2007) indicated that there might be evolutionary force behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and Capuchin monkeys when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object instead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value.\n\nThe hypothesis of \"An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes\" (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts that interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked psychological stress when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.\n\nThe study \"Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude\" (2014) identified neural correlations to specific social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) as a measure of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of Envy (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person's self-concept was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and \"Schadenfreude\" (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).\n\nArtificial neural network models of cognition provide methods for integrating the results of empirical research and of cognitive dissonance and attitudes into a single model that explains the formation of psychological attitudes and the mechanisms to change such attitudes. Among the artificial neural-network models that predict how cognitive dissonance might influence a person's attitudes and behavior, are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18382367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18382367", "title": "Divine Action and Modern Science", "text": "Divine Action and Modern Science\n\nDivine Action and Modern Science (2002) is a book written by Nicholas Saunders. It looks at Near Eastern biblical and modern theological approaches to the idea of divine action, covering such questions as how divine action occurs, what its effects are, the relationship between divine and finite causation and complementarity versus mutual exclusivity. Saunders concludes that God is active in the physical world, but not as described by traditional accounts.\n\nThrough this book, Saunders differentiates between general and special divine action, with the former referring to the actions of God concerning the entirety of the natural order (initial creation and continual sustenance), and the latter pointing to the actions of God with regards to a particular time and place (such as a particular divine intervention or responses to prayer).\n\nThe author’s categorical disagreement with current endeavors to bring together special divine action (SDA) with quantum assumptions and chaos theory is reflected in the book, saying that people are still remotely far from a reasonable hypothesis of divine action in a world that is consonant with contemporary science. Nonetheless, Saunders presumes that God exists and is currently active in the world in a specific sense setting off new fundamental interactions in nature. The book’s writer further concedes that while people cannot ever seek to have inclusive comprehension of God’s action within the world, this should not be a reason for anyone to go to the opposite extreme and assert that God’s transcendence prohibits any evocative discussions of His actions.\n\nEssentially, \"Divine Action and Modern Science\" attempted to reconcile God and his actions with science. The book's main thesis is that Divine action should be considered an action upon and within nature. This being said, it is part of nature and, therefore, \"the mechanics of describing such action, in some way, correlate with the mechanics of describing nature herself.\"\n\nSaunders also drew from several theories on Divine Action such as those put forward by thinkers William Pollard, Nancey Murphy, and Thomas Tracy, among others. In his discourse, the author – through the evidence provided by these scholars – concluded that for each Divine action, there is a scientific feasibility.\n\nUltimately, the book claimed that a scientific explanation of the Divine action could revolutionize theological traditions, making it more relevant and tenable in light of our modern understanding of the natural sciences.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Lowestoft in the county of Suffolk and raised in the Exclusive Plymouth Brethren, a Christian sect, from which he apostatised at the age of 21.\n\nIn 1943, aged 34, after some ten years of intense self-enquiry, study and writing, Harding had worked out that he was made of layers, like an onion. In other words, what he was depended on the range of the observer. As a result of his studies, Harding was convinced that he was human only at a certain range. Closer to, he was cellular, molecular, atomic... Further away he appeared as the human species, Life, the planet, the star, the galaxy... At very close range, therefore, he was almost nothing. It made sense to him therefore that at centre he was a mysterious 'nothingness'. Then, in 1943, he stopped thinking and speculating and simply looked back at himself. He noticed that from his own point of view he was headless. He was looking not out of two eyes but a 'single eye', a boundless openness – an openness that was self-evidently aware, and was also full of the whole world. Here was direct experience of his central identity, his True Self. No longer did he have to rely on speculation. Following this he spent the next 8 years exploring the scientific, philosophical, psychological, religious... implications of his discovery, presented in his book The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth, described by C. S. Lewis (who wrote the preface) as \"a work of the highest genius\". This book was published by Faber & Faber in 1952. After taking time off from his profession, Harding then returned to architecture. \n\nHarding continued to write, however, but it was not until 1964 that he clearly shared the experience of 'headlessness' with another person - his secretary. Following this, Harding gradually began to share 'Seeing' more widely. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Harding developed his 'experiments'. Harding described these experiments as 'a breakthrough' in terms of making easily available the experience of 'who we really are', our True Nature - which is No-thing and Everything. Harding was emphatic that people tested out his claims for themselves - \"you are the sole and final authority on you\". He rejected the role of 'guru', always pointing others back to themselves. \"Look for yourself\". \n\nAs well as writing many books and articles, and developing his experiments, Harding also designed his Youniverse Explorer model, which beautifully and elegantly models the layers of our body/mind, from the galaxy to particles, and includes at the centre of all these layers a clear sphere, symbolising one's True Nature - one's No-face. \n\nHarding travelled widely, sharing Seeing. In the 1990s and early 2000s he travelled and gave workshops with his second wife, Catherine. \n\nHarding was married twice and had two sons and a daughter. He died at Nacton near Ipswich, England.\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the age of fifteen he began an affair with his high school philosophy teacher, René Scherer. They remained lifelong friends. His participation in the May 1968 student rebellion in France formed his allegiance to the Communist Party, which later expelled him because of his homosexuality.\n\nHocquenghem taught philosophy at the University of Vincennes-Saint Denis, Paris and wrote numerous novels and works of theory. He was the staff writer for the French publication \"Libération\". Hocquenghem was the first gay man to be a member of the Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire (FHAR), originally formed by lesbian separatists who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France in 1971. With filmmaker Lionel Soukaz (b. 1953), Hocquenghem wrote and produced a documentary film about gay history, \"Race d'Ep!\" (1979) the last word of the title being a play on the word \"pédé\", a French slur for gay men.\n\nThough Hocquenghem had a significant impact on leftist thinking in France, his reputation has failed to grow to international prominence. Only the first of his theoretical tracts, \"Homosexual Desire\" (1972) and his first novel, \"L'Amour en relief\" (1982) have been translated into English. Although \"Race d'Ep!\" was shown at Roxie Cinema in San Francisco in April 1980 and released in America as \"The Homosexual Century\", like Hocquenghem, the film is virtually unknown.\n\nGuy Hocquenghem's \"Homosexual Desire\" (1972, English translation 1978) may be the first work of Queer Theory. Drawing on the theories of desiring-production developed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in their \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\" project (1972-1980), Hocquenghem critiqued the influential models of the psyche and sexual desire derived from the psychoanalysts Jacques Lacan and Sigmund Freud. The author also addressed the relation of capitalism to sexualities, the dynamics of desire, and the political effects of gay group-identities. Moreover, he repudiated the prospect of a new gay 'social organisation' of politics, along with the injunction to sacrifice oneself in the name of future generations.\n\nThe sociologist Jeffrey Weeks's 1978 preface to the first English translation of \"Homosexual Desire\" situates the essay in relation to the various, mostly French, theories of subjectivity and desire surrounding and influencing Hocquenghem's thought.

One, \"A Plea for Philosophy\", rebutted objections to the study of philosophy including those who were worried that the study of philosophy would \"be antagonistic to the Christian faith\". The second piece, \"The Study of Mental Philosophy\", also broadly advocated the study of philosophy and rebutted criticisms from those who said the endeavour was \"useless or impossible\".

{"id": "16028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16028", "title": "Jan Hus", "text": "Jan Hus\n\nJan Hus (; ; – 6 July 1415), sometimes Anglicized as John Hus or John Huss, also referred to in historical texts as \"Iohannes Hus\" or \"Johannes Huss\") was a Czech theologian, philosopher, master, dean, and rector of the Charles University in Prague who became a church reformer, an inspirer of Hussitism, a key predecessor to Protestantism and a seminal figure in the Bohemian Reformation.\n\nAfter John Wycliffe, the theorist of ecclesiastical reform, Hus is considered the first church reformer, as he lived before Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli. His teachings had a strong influence on the states of Western Europe, most immediately in the approval of a reformed Bohemian religious denomination, and, more than a century later, on Martin Luther himself.\nHe was burned at the stake for heresy against the doctrines of the Catholic Church, including those on ecclesiology, the Eucharist, and other theological topics.\n\nAfter Hus was executed in 1415, the followers of his religious teachings (known as Hussites) rebelled against their Catholic rulers and defeated five consecutive papal crusades between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the Hussite Wars. Both the Bohemian and the Moravian populations remained majority Hussite until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the Battle of the White Mountain resulted in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown coming under Habsburg dominion for the next 300 years and being subject to immediate and forced conversion in an intense campaign of return to Catholicism.\n\nJan Hus was born in Husinec, Bohemia, c. 1369. At an early age he traveled to Prague, where he supported himself by singing and serving in churches. His conduct was positive and his commitment to his studies was remarkable.\n\nIn 1393, Hus earned the degree of Bachelor of Arts at the University of Prague, and he earned his master's degree in 1396. In 1400, he was ordained as a priest. In 1402 Hus began preaching inside the city demanding a reformation of the Church. He served as rector of the University of Prague in 1402–03. He was appointed a preacher at the newly built Bethlehem Chapel around the same time. Hus was a strong advocate for the Czechs and the Realists, and he was influenced by the writings of John Wycliffe. Although church authorities banned many works of Wycliffe in 1403, Hus translated \"Trialogus\" into Czech and helped to distribute it.\n\nHus attacked the Church by denouncing the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit. Archbishop Zbyněk Zajíc tolerated this, and even appointed Hus a preacher at the clergy's biennial synod. On 24 June 1405, Pope Innocent VII, however, directed the Archbishop to counter Wycliffe's teachings, especially the doctrine of impanation in the Eucharist. The archbishop complied by issuing a synodal decree against Wycliffe, as well as forbidding any further attacks on the clergy.\n\nIn 1406, two Bohemian students brought to Prague a document bearing the seal of the University of Oxford and praising Wycliffe. Hus proudly read the document from his pulpit. Then in 1408, Pope Gregory XII warned Archbishop Zajic that the Church in Rome had been informed of Wycliffe's heresies and of the sympathies of King Wenceslaus IV for non-conformists. In response, the king and university ordered all of Wycliffe's writings surrendered to the archdiocesan chancery for correction. Hus obeyed, declaring that he condemned the errors in those writings.\n\nIn 1408, the Charles University in Prague was divided by the Western Schism, in which Gregory XII in Rome and Benedict XIII in Avignon both claimed the papacy. Wenceslaus felt Gregory XII might interfere with his plans to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. He denounced Gregory, ordered the clergy in Bohemia to observe a strict neutrality in the schism, and said that he expected the same of the University. Archbishop Zajíc remained faithful to Gregory. At the University, only the scholars of the Bohemian \"nation\" (one of the four governing sections), with Hus as their leader, vowed neutrality.\n\nAt the urging of Hus and other Bohemian leaders, Wenceslaus the Idle decreed in the Czech city of Kutná Hora that the \"Bohemian nation\" would have three votes in University affairs, while the Bavarian, Saxon, and Polish \"nations\" would have only one vote in total. As a consequence, between five thousand and twenty thousand foreign doctors, masters, and students left Prague in 1409. This exodus resulted in the founding of the University of Leipzig, among others. Thus Charles University lost its international importance and became a strictly Czech school. The emigrants also spread news of the Bohemian heresies throughout the rest of Europe. Archbishop Zajíc became isolated, while Hus was at the height of his fame, becoming Rector of the University and enjoying the favour of the court. Wycliffe's doctrines also regained favour in Prague.\n\nIn 1409, the Council of Pisa tried to end the schism by electing Alexander V as Pope, but Gregory and Benedict did not submit. (Alexander was declared an \"antipope\" by the Council of Constance in 1418.)\n\nHus, his followers, and Wenceslaus IV transferred their allegiance to Alexander V. Under pressure from king Wenceslaus IV, Archbishop Zajíc did the same. Zajíc then lodged an accusation of \"ecclesiastical disturbances\" against Wycliffites in Prague with Alexander V.\n\nOn 20 December 1409, Alexander V issued a papal bull that empowered the Archbishop to proceed against Wycliffism in Prague. All copies of Wycliffe's writings were to be surrendered and his doctrines repudiated, and free preaching discontinued. After the publication of the bull in 1410, Hus appealed to Alexander V, but in vain. The Wycliffe books and valuable manuscripts were burned, and Hus and his adherents were excommunicated by Alexander V.\n\nArchbishop Zajíc died in 1411, and with his death the religious movement in Bohemia entered a new phase, where the disputes concerning indulgences assumed great importance.\n\nAlexander V died in 1410 and was succeeded by John XXIII (also later declared an antipope). In 1411, John XXIII proclaimed a crusade against King Ladislaus of Naples, the protector of rival Pope Gregory XII. This crusade was preached in Prague as well. John XXIII also authorized indulgences to raise money for the war. Priests urged the people on and these crowded into churches to give their offerings. This traffic in indulgences was to some a sign of the corruption of the church needing remediation.\n\nHus spoke out against indulgences, but he could not carry with him the men of the university. In 1412, a dispute took place, on which occasion Hus delivered his address \"Quaestio magistri Johannis Hus de indulgentiis\". It was taken literally from the last chapter of Wycliffe's book, \"De ecclesia\", and his treatise, \"De absolutione a pena et culpa\". Hus asserted that no Pope or bishop had the right to take up the sword in the name of the Church; he should pray for his enemies and bless those that curse him; man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money. The doctors of the theological faculty replied, but without success. A few days afterward, some of Hus's followers, led by Vok Voksa z Valdštejna, burnt the Papal bulls. Hus, they said, should be obeyed rather than the Church, which they considered a fraudulent mob of adulterers and Simonists.\n\nIn response, three men from the lower classes who openly called the indulgences a fraud were beheaded. They were later considered the first martyrs of the Hussite Church. In the meantime, the faculty had condemned the forty-five articles and added several other theses, deemed heretical, which had originated with Hus. The king forbade the teaching of these articles, but neither Hus nor the university complied with the ruling, requesting that the articles should be first proven to be un-scriptural. The tumults at Prague had stirred up a sensation; papal legates and Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.\n\nKing Wenceslaus IV made efforts to harmonize the opposing parties. In 1412, he convoked the heads of his kingdom for a consultation and, at their suggestion, ordered a synod to be held at Český Brod on 2 February 1412. It did not take place there, but in the palace of the archbishops at Prague, in order to exclude Hus from participation. Propositions were made to restore peace in the Church. Hus declared that Bohemia should have the same freedom in regard to ecclesiastical affairs as other countries and that approbation and condemnation should therefore be announced only with the permission of the state power. This was the doctrine of Wycliffe (\"Sermones\", iii. 519, etc.).\n\nThere followed treatises from both parties, but no harmony was obtained. \"Even if I should stand before the stake which has been prepared for me,\" Hus wrote at the time, \"I would never accept the recommendation of the theological faculty.\" The synod did not produce any results, but the King ordered a commission to continue the work of reconciliation. The doctors of the university demanded approval of their conception of the Church, according to which the Pope is the head, the Cardinals are the body of the Church, from Hus and his followers. Hus protested vigorously. The Hussite party seems to have made a great effort toward reconciliation. To the article that the Roman Church must be obeyed, they added only \"so far as every pious Christian is bound\". Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán Páleč protested against this addition and left the convention; they were exiled by the king, with two others.\n\nBy this time, Hus' ideas had become widely accepted in Bohemia, and there was broad resentment against the Church hierarchy. The attack on Hus by the Pope and Archbishop caused riots in parts of Bohemia. King Wenceslaus IV and his government took the side of Hus, and the power of his adherents increased from day to day. Hus continued to preach in the Bethlehem Chapel. The churches of the city were put under the ban, and the interdict was pronounced against Prague. To protect the city, Hus left and went into the countryside, where he continued to preach and write.\n\nBefore Hus left Prague, he decided to take a step which gave a new dimension to his endeavors. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an ineffective Council. On 18 October 1412 he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church. For the Bohemian Reformation, this step was as significant as the 95 theses posted in Wittenberg by Martin Luther in 1517.\n\nAfter Hus left Prague for the country, he realized what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation on one hand, and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care on the other. Therefore, he started to write many texts in Czech, such as basics of the Christian faith or preachings, intended mainly for the priests whose knowledge of Latin was poor.\n\nOf the writings occasioned by these controversies, those of Hus on the Church, entitled \"De Ecclesia\", were written in 1413 and have been most frequently quoted and admired or criticized, and yet their first ten chapters are but an epitome of Wycliffe's work of the same title, and the following chapters are but an abstract of another of Wycliffe's works (\"De potentate papae\") on the power of the Pope. Wycliffe had written his book to oppose the common position that the Church consisted primarily of the clergy, and Hus now found himself making the same point. He wrote his work at the castle of one of his protectors in Kozí Hrádek, and sent it to Prague, where it was publicly read in the Bethlehem Chapel. It was answered by Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán z Pálče with treatises of the same title.\n\nAfter the most vehement opponents of Hus had left Prague, his adherents occupied the whole ground. Hus wrote his treatises and preached in the neighborhood of Kozí Hrádek. Bohemian Wycliffism was carried into Poland, Hungary, Croatia, and Austria. But in January 1413, a general council in Rome condemned the writings of Wycliffe and ordered them to be burned.\n\nKing Wenceslaus' brother Sigismund of Hungary, who was \"King of the Romans\" (that is, head of the Holy Roman Empire, though not then Emperor), and heir to the Bohemian crown, was anxious to put an end to religious dissension within the Church. To put an end to the papal schism and to take up the long desired reform of the Church, he arranged for a general council to convene on 1 November 1414, at Konstanz (Constance). The Council of Constance (1414–1418) became the 16th ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church. Hus, willing to make an end of all dissensions, agreed to go to Constance, under Sigismund's promise of safe conduct.\n\nIt is not known whether Hus knew what his fate would be, but he made his will before setting out. He started on his journey on 11 October 1414; on 3 November 1414, he arrived at Constance, and on the following day, the bulletins on the church doors announced that Michal z Německého Brodu would be opposing Hus. In the beginning, Hus was at liberty, under his safe-conduct from Sigismund, and lived at the house of a widow. But he continued celebrating Mass and preaching to the people, in violation of restrictions decreed by the Church. After a few weeks on 28 November 1414, his opponents succeeded in imprisoning him, on the strength of a rumor that he intended to flee. He was first brought into the residence of a canon and then, on 6 December 1414, into the prison of the Dominican monastery. Sigismund, as the guarantor of Hus's safety, was greatly angered and threatened the prelates with dismissal; however, the prelates convinced him that he could not be bound by promises to a heretic.\n\nOn 4 December 1414, John XXIII entrusted a committee of three bishops with a preliminary investigation against Hus. As was common practice, witnesses for the prosecution were heard, but Hus was not allowed an advocate for his defense. His situation became worse after the downfall of John XXIII, who had left Constance to avoid abdicating. Hus had been the captive of John XXIII and in constant communication with his friends, but now he was delivered to the bishop of Constance and brought to his castle, \"Gottlieben on the Rhine\". Here he remained for 73 days, separated from his friends, chained day and night, poorly fed, and ill.\n\nOn 5 June 1415, he was tried for the first time, and for that purpose was transferred to a Franciscan monastery, where he spent the last weeks of his life. Extracts from his works were read, and witnesses were heard. He refused all formulae of submission, but declared himself willing to recant if his errors should be proven to him from the Bible. Hus conceded his veneration of Wycliffe, and said that he could only wish his soul might some time attain unto that place where Wycliffe's was. On the other hand, he denied having defended Wycliffe's doctrine of The Lord's Supper or the forty-five articles; he had only opposed their summary condemnation. King Sigismund admonished him to deliver himself up to the mercy of the Council, as he did not desire to protect a heretic.\n\nAt the last trial, on 8 June 1415, thirty-nine sentences were read to him, twenty-six of which had been excerpted from his book on the Church (\"De ecclesia\"), seven from his treatise against Palecz (Contra Palecz), and six from that against Stanislav ze Znojma (\"Contra Stanislaum\"). The danger of some of these doctrines to worldly power was explained to Sigismund to incite him against Hus. Hus again declared himself willing to submit if he could be convinced of errors. This declaration was considered an unconditional surrender, and he was asked to confess:\n\nHe asked to be exempted from recanting doctrines which he had never taught; others, which the assembly considered erroneous, he was not willing to revoke; to act differently would be against his conscience. These words found no favourable reception. After the trial on 8 June, several other attempts were purportedly made to induce him to recant, which he resisted.\n\nThe condemnation took place on 6 July 1415, in the presence of the assembly of the Council in the Cathedral. After the High Mass and Liturgy, Hus was led into the church. The Bishop of Lodi (then Giacomo Balardi Arrigoni) delivered an oration on the duty of eradicating heresy; then some theses of Hus and Wycliffe and a report of his trial were read.\n\nAn Italian prelate pronounced the sentence of condemnation upon Hus and his writings. Hus protested, saying that even at this hour he did not wish anything, but to be convinced from Scripture. He fell upon his knees and asked God with a soft voice to forgive all his enemies. Then followed his degradation — he was dressed in priestly vestments and again asked to recant; again he refused. With curses, Hus' ornaments were taken from him, his priestly tonsure was destroyed, and the sentence of the Church was pronounced, stripping him of all rights, and he was delivered to secular authorities. Then a tall paper hat was put upon his head, with the inscription \"\"Haeresiarcha\" (i.e., the leader of a heretical movement). Hus was led away to the stake under a strong guard of armed men.\n\nAt the place of execution, he knelt down, spread out his hands, and prayed aloud. The executioner undressed Hus and tied his hands behind his back with ropes, and bound his neck with a chain to a stake around which wood and straw had been piled up so that it covered him to the neck. At the last moment, the imperial marshal, von Pappenheim, in the presence of the Count Palatine, asked Hus to recant and thus save his own life. Hus declined thus:\n\nAnecdotally, it has been claimed that the executioners had trouble intensifying the fire. An old woman then came to the stake and threw a relatively small amount of brushwood on it. Upon seeing her act, a suffering Hus then exclaimed, \"Sancta Simplicitas!\". The phrase's Czech equivalent, \"Svatá prostota!\" (vocative form: \"Svatá prostoto!\", Translated \"Holy simplicity!\"\") is still used today when commenting on a person's foolish action coming from the belief that s/he is doing something righteous.\nIt is said that when he was about to expire, he cried out, \"Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on us!\" (a variant of the Jesus Prayer). Hus' ashes were later thrown into the Rhine River (as a means of preventing the veneration of his remains).\n\nResponding with horror to the execution of Hus, the people of Bohemia moved even more rapidly away from Papal teachings, provoking Rome to pronounce a crusade against them (1 March 1420): Pope Martin V issued a Papal bull authorising the execution of all supporters of Hus and Wycliffe. King Wenceslaus IV died in August 1419 and his brother, Sigismund of Hungary, was unable to establish a real government in Bohemia due to the Hussite revolt.\n\nThe Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia, and became a major military power. Under the leadership of Jan Žižka (c. 1360–1424) and later of Prokop the Great (ca. 1380 – 1434) - both excellent commanders—the Hussites defeated the crusade and the three crusades that followed (1419–1434). Fighting ended after a compromise between the Utraquist Hussites and the Catholic Council of Basel in 1436. It resulted in the Basel Compacts, in which the Catholic Church officially allowed Bohemia to practice its own version of Christianity (Hussitism). A century later, as much as ninety percent of the inhabitants of the Czech Crown lands still followed Hussite teachings.\n\nHus left only a few reformatory writings in the proper sense of the word, most of his works being polemical treatises against Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán Páleč. He translated Wycliffe's \"Trialogus\", and was very familiar with his works on the body of the Lord, on the Church, on the power of the pope, and especially with his sermons. There are reasons to suppose that Wycliffe's doctrine of the Lord's Supper (consubstantiation rather than transubstantiation) had spread to Prague as early as 1399, with strong evidence that students returning from England had brought the work back with them. It gained an even wider circulation after it had been prohibited in 1403, and Hus preached and taught it, although it is possible that he simply repeated it without advocating it. But the doctrine was seized eagerly by the radical party, the Taborites, who made it the central point of their system. According to their book, the Church is not the clerical hierarchy which was generally accepted as ‘the Church;’ the Church is the entire body of those who from eternity have been predestined for salvation. Christ, not the pope, is its head. It is no article of faith that one must obey the pope to be saved. Neither internal membership in the Church nor churchly offices and dignities are a surety that the persons in question are members of the true Church.\n\nTo some, Hus's efforts were predominantly designed to rid the Church of its ethical abuses, rather than a campaign of sweeping theological change. To others, the seeds of the Reformation are clear in Hus's and Wycliffe's writings. In explaining the plight of the average Christian in Bohemia, Hus wrote, \"One pays for confession, for mass, for the sacrament, for indulgences, for churching a woman, for a blessing, for burials, for funeral services and prayers. The very last penny which an old woman has hidden in her bundle for fear of thieves or robbery will not be saved. The villainous priest will grab it.\" (Macek, 16) After Hus's death, his followers, known as Hussites, split off into several groups including the Utraquists, Taborites and Orphans.\n\nNearly six centuries later in 1999, Pope John Paul II expressed \"deep regret for the cruel death inflicted\" on Hus and added \"deep sorrow\" for Hus' death and praised his \"moral courage\". Cardinal Miloslav Vlk of the Czech Republic was instrumental in crafting John Paul II's statement.\n\nA century after the Hussite Wars began, as many as 90% of inhabitants of the Czech lands were Hussites (although in the Utraquist tradition following a joint Utraquist—Catholic victory in the Hussite Wars). Although Bohemia was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, there are only few Protestant adherents remaining in modern times; mainly due to historical reasons such as persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, particularly after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620; restrictions during the Communist rule; and also the ongoing secularization.\n\nJan Hus was a key contributor to Protestantism, whose teachings had a strong influence on the states of Europe and on Martin Luther. The Hussite Wars resulted in the Basel Compacts which allowed for a reformed church in the Kingdom of Bohemia—almost a century before such developments would take place in the Lutheran Reformation. The Unitas Fratrum (or Moravian Church) considers itself a spiritual heir to many of Hus' followers. Hus' extensive writings earn him a prominent place in Czech literary history.\n\nJan Hus introduced improvements into medieval Czech language, such as the diacritic including the \"hook\" háček (č,ě,š,ř,ž) (instead of digraph like \"cz\", \"ie\", \"sch\", \"rz\", \"zs\"), the \"dot\" above letters for strong accent, as well as the acute accent to mark long vowels (á,é,í,ó,ú), in order to represent each sound by a single symbol. Some sources mention documented use of the special symbols in Bible translations (1462), the Schaffhausen Bible, and handwritten notes in the bible. The symbol \"ů\" (instead of \"uo\") came later. The book \"Orthographia Bohemica\" (1406) may have been written by Jan Hus, or by another author from Charles University.\n\nToday, the Jan Hus Memorial is located at the Prague Old Town Square (Czech \"Staroměstské náměstí\"), and there are many smaller memorials in other towns throughout the Czech Republic.\n\nIn New York City, a church in Brooklyn (located at 153 Ocean Avenue), and a church and a theatre in Manhattan (located at 351 East 74th Street) are named for Hus: respectively the John Hus Moravian Church, the Jan Hus Presbyterian Church and the Jan Hus Playhouse. Although the Manhattan's church and theatre share a single building and management, the Playhouse's productions are usually non-religious or non-denominational.\n\nA statue of Jan Hus was erected at the Union Cemetery in Bohemia, New York (on Long Island) by Czech immigrants to the New York area in 1893.\n\nIn contrast to the popular perception that Hus was a proto-Protestant, some Eastern Orthodox Christians have argued that his theology was far closer to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Jan Hus is considered as a martyr saint in some jurisdictions of the Orthodox Church. The Czechoslovak Hussite Church claims to trace its origin to Hus, to be \"neo-Hussite\", and contains mixed Eastern Orthodox and Protestant elements. Hus has forever left his impact as a man whose life, teachings and beliefs transformed the church.\n\nHus was voted the greatest hero of Czech nation in a 2015 survey by Czech Radio. He received 19% of votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33591594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33591594", "title": "John Caruana", "text": "John Caruana\n\nGiovanni Caruana (1866–1923) was a Maltese lawyer and minor philosopher. He was mostly interested in the philosophy of law and in political economy. At least two portraits of Caruana exist, both by the renowned early 20th century Maltese artist Edward Caruana Dingli. Both were displayed at an exhibition on Caruana Dingli at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Valletta, Malta, in 2010.\n\nCaruana was likely born at his father's Valletta house at 266, St Paul's Street, in 1866. He was the son of an influential man, Prof. Antonio Annetto Caruana, who was an archeologist, librarian, Director of Education, and Rector of the University of Malta.\n\nCaruana studied law at the University of Malta, and continued his studies in England and in Italy. He became professor of political economy at the University of Malta in 1889, and later Professor of Constitutional Law. In 1895 he was also appointed Professor of Civil Law. His teaching career spanned over thirty years. He retired in 1921.\n\nIntellectually, liberalism was what seemed to preoccupy Caruana most. Amongst his various works, one is noteworthy for its philosophical value. It is Dell’Influsso della Filosofia Moderna (On the Influence of Modern Philosophy). This 28-page booklet in Italian was published in Malta in 1889 (Tipografia Industriale di Giov. Muscat, Salita Guardanmangia, Pietà). The title is augmented with the qualification \"sulla Scienza e le Discipline Economico-sociali e della loro presente direzione\" (on Science and the Economic-Social Disciplines, and their present direction).\n\nThe publication reproduces a talk which Caruana delivered at the opening of the academic year 1889/90 of the University of Malta and the Lyceum. The talk was made on October 1, 1889, at the National Library of Malta, Valletta, when he was only 23 years old.\n\nCaruana’s talk is an outright attack on liberalism. The writing has no divisions, and continuously cites Aristotle and various political economists. Cicero is cited too. Caruana exemplifies his arguments by drawing upon the situation in England. He explains how there liberalism was arresting the development of science, the economy, and the social studies. Caruana exults England as the bulwark of civilisation, and castigates liberalism for failing to keep England’s scientific, economic and social pre-eminence on an upward and forward trajectory.\n\nCaruana was married to Giovanna Galizia, a daughter of the celebrated Victorian architect and civil engineer Emanuele Luigi Galizia. E.L. Galizia was a personal friend of Caruana's father, the archaeologist Antonio Annetto Caruana. One of Giovanna's brothers, Major James Galizia CBE, was Director of Public Works and then Treasury Secretary in Malta's early 20th century imperial administration. Another brother, Godwin Galizia, was a noteworthy neo-Romanesque and neo-classical architect. Caruana had ten children with Giovanna Galizia. Their first son, Anton Caruana Galizia, a prominent Maltese lawyer, was killed outside the Casino Maltese in a German bombing raid in 1942, that left 40 others dead. Daphne Caruana Galizia, the Maltese journalist assassinated in a car bomb in 2017, was married to their grandson, Peter Caruana Galizia.\n\n"}

{"id": "4419644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4419644", "title": "Nishi Amane", "text": "Nishi Amane\n\nNishi was born in Tsuwano Domain of Iwami Province (present day Tsuwano city, Shimane Prefecture) as the son of a \"samurai\" physician who practiced Chinese medicine. In 1853, after studying Confucianism at his domain school and in Osaka, Nishi was sent to Edo to study \"rangaku\", with the goal of becoming an interpreter for conducting business with the outside world via Dutch traders based at Dejima in Nagasaki, his duties also included the translation of European books into Japanese for review by a select group of government officials within the Tokugawa bakufu. In 1854 Nishi, as well as several fellow Japanese intellectuals of the time, denounced the Japanese feudal system and their \"samurai\" status in favor of a pursuit of Western studies, as these intellectuals believed that the Japanese feudal system was incompatible with Western studies. Nishi was then appointed by the government as a \"Yogakusha\" or specialist scholar of Western learning. Aside from Nishi, the Yogakusha included Fukuzawa Yukichi, Mori Arinori, and Nakamura Masanao, who were all schooled in kangaku, a kind of traditional Chinese learning. Later, in 1857, Nishi was appointed a professor at the \"Bansho Shirabesho\".\n\nWith increasing foreign pressure on Japan to end its national isolation policy, in 1862 the Shogunate decided to send Nishi and Tsuda Mamichi to the Netherlands to learn western concepts of political science, constitutional law, and economics. They departed in 1863 with a Dutch physician Dr. J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort, who had set up the first teaching hospital for western medicine in Nagasaki.\n\nThe two Japanese students were put in the care of Professor Simon Vissering, who taught Political Economy, Statistics and Diplomatic History at the University of Leyden. They developed a genuine friendship with Vissering who was conscious of the long-standing friendship between Japan and the Netherlands. He felt that the students' desire for knowledge would make them likely future participants in Japan's modernization. Vissering, a member of \"La Vertu\" Lodge No, 7, Leyden introduced them to Freemasonry, of which they became the first Japanese adherents on October 20, 1864.\n\nNishi returned to Japan in 1865, and was an active participant in the Meiji Restoration. He promoted contact with the West and Western intellectualism because he feared that in the long run, a domestic resistance to modernization and change in relation to contact with the West would be more destructive to Japan than any plausible repercussions of contact with the West. While abroad, Nishi became enthralled with Western philosophy and discerned that this intellectual pursuit subsisted at the foundation of Western civilization, and thus upon his return, he aimed to spread the Western Philosophy he came into contact with in order to help bridge the intellectual gap between the East and the West. Nishi brought back to Japan the philosophies of positivism, utilitarianism and empiricism, which he transmitted through his writing, lectures and participation in Mori Arinori's \"Meirokusha\", and contributed numerous articles to its journal. Through Nishi’s transmissions, positivism was able to thrive in Meiji Japan because it gave the Japanese people a chance for stabilization and understanding in a society and culture that was undergoing rapid revolutionary change. To Nishi, positivism was the Western counterpart to Eastern practical studies \"(jitsugaku)\", with an emphasis on a hierarchy of knowledge similar to that of Confucianism. Nishi’s translations of utilitarianism were also taken to well during the restoration period because utilitarianism promotes the social over the individual, which is a concept that is easily reconcilable with a Confucian-trained mind in Meiji Japan. Utilitarianism also assisted Japanese modernization because Nishi and others have applied it to the justification of an industrial and commercial economy. As for empiricism, Nishi and the rest of the Yogakusha intellectuals became leading figures in the Meiji Enlightenment (\"bummei kaika\", i.e. \"civilization and enlightenment\" ), in which they promoted empiricism and practical studies instead of abstract reasoning in order for each person to attain an understanding of truth.\n\nIn 1868, Nishi translated and published \"International Law\". He also published an encyclopedia, The \"Hyakugaku Renkan,\" patterned after the French encyclopedia of Auguste Comte, while promoting the teachings of John Stuart Mill. Nishi’s encyclopedia essentially classified and categorized the intellectual realm of Western civilization, including topics such as literature, natural sciences, mathematics, theology, and politics. One of Nishi’s most significant topics in his encyclopedia was the importance of the study of history, as he believed history was an objective, scholarly discipline that was necessary for the understanding of all human relations and interactions. In this way, learning should not just be for learning’s sake, as it does not serve a greater purpose if it is just to learn. This argument stood in direct contradiction to the Confucian denial of the study of history as a progress of human events. Subsequently, the most distinguished topic of Nishi’s encyclopedia is his elaboration on philosophy. Nishi split the study philosophy into numerous subtopics, citing logic as the most important. He rejected the deductive method traditionally used by Confucian scholars in favor of inductive logic as a more scientific way of learning. \nIn 1873, Nishi helped to found Japan’s first scholarly society for solely academics (and not politics) known as the Meiji Six Society. The goals of this society were to educate and enlighten the people because they believed Japan needed an enlightened populace in order to understand and live up to its political and moral responsibilities of modernization and restoration. Nishi felt that if the new state were to become enlightened as it should be, there would be no more conflict between political and scholarly obligations within the Meiji Six Society, and within Japanese society in general. Nishi was unique in this society in that he maintained a view of Japanese modernization in which he reconciled traditional Confucianism with Western Philosophy and pragmatism together in order to ascertain the correct path for Japan to take.\n\nIn his \"Hyakuichi-Shinron\", published in 1874, he went so far as to reject Confucian ethics altogether as no longer appropriate for Japan, but was careful not to reject Japanese heritage. This publication was an original piece of Nishi scholarship that dealt with two main topics: the separation of politics and morals, and the distinction between human and physical principles. In regards to the first topic, Nishi felt that the later Confucians who presumed that self-cultivation was all that was necessary for ruling society were wrong, but that the original Confucians who proclaimed that the morality taught had practical application in society were right. What is more is that Nishi portrayed Confucius as a teacher of politics with a sideline of morality. Nishi attempted to sever the philosophical connection between morality and politics because he thought that although they obtained the same objective – to better people’s lives – they used different methods to obtain this objective, stemming from his belief that rightness was at the base of law, whereas goodness was at the base of morality. To Nishi, morality is an omnipresent thing existing within every human activity, but law is strictly limited to its defined aspects of human relations. Though morality must rely on the law within politics to keep order, it is morality, rather than the law, that will eventually penetrate and shape the people’s minds and values. Nishi concludes this first topic with the idea that when it comes to civilization, politics is the machinery and morality is the lubricant that is responsible for keeping the machinery running and intact. In the second topic, Nishi determines, for the first time in the East, the relationship and differences between human principles and physical principles. He discerns that physical principles and laws are \"a priori\" prerequisites for the existence of society, whereas human principles and laws are \"a posteriori\" devices derived from these physical principles and laws. Because human principles are \"a posteriori\", they have infinite possibilities of distinctions and greater flexibility in premonitions. Nishi considers morality and law to be human principles; however, that does not mean that he deems morality man-made; rather, there are feelings (not unlike the Mencian Sprouts) that exist in all humans, and it is up to human will to act upon those feelings of morality that are constant in human nature. What Nishi’s discernment led to was the first expression in the East that human society was not, in fact, a product of the invariable structure of the universe. In this way, Nishi opened up room for humans to divert the inevitability of the social hierarchy.\n\nIn \"Jinsei Sampo Setsu\" (1875) he urged all Japanese to seek the goals of health, knowledge and wealth, or what he called the “three treasures,\"in place of Confucian subservience and frugality. In order for society to maintain a balance of these three treasures, Nishi felt that individuals should not disrespect others’ treasures, and that individuals should assist others in acquiring their treasures, thus, if the three treasures were honored and preserved, all of society would be independent and free. Moreover, Nishi thought that the Japanese government should be responsible for promoting the pursuit of these three treasures in society as well, and in turn, the political and national strengthening within the Meiji Enlightenment would not require Western rule or governmental tactics. Nishi promoted that if policy were structured based on enhancing general happiness through an equal balance of domestic enforcement of law, diplomacy and military defense of society, encouragement of industry and finance, and obtainment of the state’s own three treasures, this would be the key to good government.\n\nWhile working at the Ministry of Military Affairs, Nishi helped in drafting the Conscription Ordinance of 1873, which introduced universal conscription and laid the foundation for the Imperial Japanese Army. In his lectures to the military, he emphasized discipline and obedience over seniority and hierarchy. These ideals found their way into the subsequent Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors in 1882.\nIn 1879 Nishi was made the head of the Tokyo Academy, and by 1882 was a member of the \"Genrōin.\" He became a member of the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan after the Japanese general election, 1890.\n\nHe was ennobled with the title of \"danshaku\" (baron) in the \"kazoku\" peerage system. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.\n\nNishi Amane is considered to be the father of Western philosophy in Japan. Nishi was a tireless advocate of Western civilization as a role model for Japan's modernization, stressing the need to evolve without losing the Japanese character. He was responsible for using classical Chinese terminology to translate and/or transmit common terms used in Western Philosophy into Eastern dialect, and many of these philosophical words are currently in use today. By using classical Chinese terminology, that is, something of cultural importance and tradition to Meiji Japan, Nishi was able to generate enthusiasm for reform, as traditional Chinese characters were seen by the Eastern population as a notion of authority. Furthermore, it is the nature of Chinese characters to be combined in various ways to form neologisms, as the characters often obtain multiple meanings and are capable of interchangeability. The most notable term that Nishi was responsible for is the term (in Japan, or \"zhéxué\" in China), which he coined in 1873, taken from the characters meaning \"wisdom\" and \"learning\". \"Tetsugaku\" is the first known recording of an Eastern term representing the notion of philosophy, which Nishi referred to as “the study of human nature and the principles of things.”;). Nishi originally used , or \"(the science of) seeking clarity\", as opposed to the classical Chinese term , which means \"to seek wisdom\" (\"xīxián\", in Chinese, more specifically means “learning to become a wise and knowledgeable person.”) Though Nishi felt that Confucius for the East was comparable to Socrates for the West, in creating this term \"tesugaku\", Nishi was actually attempting to separate the notion of Western philosophy from the notion of Eastern thought, as he believed the two to entail two different things. Moreover, Nishi did not concur that philosophy even existed in the East, as he studied philosophy solely in the context of the Western style. However, regardless of Nishi’s personal beliefs on the definition of “philosophy”, it is still because of him that China and Japan have even been able to engage in the discourse of “philosophy.” In \"Hyakugaku Renkan\", Nishi concluded that because the discourse of philosophy is innately concerned with addressing and attacking theories of past writers and philosophers in order to portray new discoveries, the field of philosophy is constantly being made over. Under this light, Nishi opens up the possibility of vast Eastern participation in the discourse of philosophy, regardless of whether or not Eastern thought can be reconciled with Western Philosophy. During his time, Nishi concurred that although the West was superior in the realm of philosophy, the East still had the means to become better equipped in philosophy, as he professed that philosophy was essential for making the East intellectually modernized.\n\nHe was honored on a 10-yen commemorative postage stamp in Japan in 1952.\n\n\n\n"}

Today there are organizations that provide services and products, or at least instructions for building such services or products, that use an open-source economic model.\n\nThe structure of open-source is based on user participation. \"Networked environment makes possible a new modality of organizing production: radically decentralized, collaborative, and non-proprietary; based on sharing resources and outputs among widely distributed, loosely connected individuals who cooperate with each other without relying on either market signals or managerial commands.\"\n\nWhile initially it might seem that contributing to open-source software goes against basic economic principles, there are several ways in which people are incentivized to contribute to open-source projects. Some reasons are not strictly economically beneficial to the contributor, but are related to leisure activities. People program as a hobby and are incentivized to contribute to open-source projects simply because they enjoy it. There are also altruistic reasons, such as creating a better world and donating one's time to a project one believes in. \n\nThere are also several economic arguments for producing open-source software. A potential economic benefit is the enhancement of a person's reputation or resume. A top contributor to open-source software may get easier access to venture capital money or better access to jobs. Further, developing open-source software can be cheaper than purchasing commercial software, thereby saving a contributor money.\n\nCorporations have several incentives to contribute to open-source projects, including talent acquisition. Some software developers are huge proponents of open-source software, and if they have used a company’s open-source software, or are aware of it, they may be more interested in working for that company. For example, Twitter created Bootstrap, an easy-to-use framework for designing websites. Bootstrap is very popular and is used by many people. Therefore, by open-sourcing Bootstrap, Twitter is able to increase brand awareness due to the large amount of people developing products with their software, which should help them attract talent. \n\nIt is common for companies to not open-source core parts of their products that are critical for business, but helpful auxiliary processes and infrastructure. This way, through open sourcing they get all the positive aspects of talent acquisition and branding, and do not give up market share. \n\nBy making a product open-source, more people can contribute. These contributions can help develop the software faster, so it may also be beneficial for companies to open-source to get free help.\n\nOpen-source software can help protect against monopolies. For example, the rise of Linux, an open-source computer operating system, helped prevent Microsoft from being considered a monopolist. Microsoft considered Linux to be their main competitor during the 1990s. Many computer makers offer Linux or Windows for their users, and a large percentage of mobile phone and tablet operating systems are Android, which is a Linux variant. Not only are monopolies affected, but several other businesses with strongholds are affected. Microsoft office has open-source competitors such as Libre Office. Internet Explorer has Chrome and Firefox as open-source competitors.\n\nNumerous companies have created businesses around open-source software. They do this by publishing all of their code open-source, then charging for training, certifications, add-ons, and other services. One example is Red Hat, which produces operating systems. Red Hat sells services such as 24/7 support, integration into company's products, and training. Red Hat was the pioneer for the open source business model, and was valued at approximately $16 billion as of April 2017. Other examples include Mozilla, which created the web browser Firefox, and Google, which created Android, an open-source mobile operating system based on Linux.\n\n\n"}

Pastors, theologians, and biblical scholars from every mainline denomination, with degrees from major seminaries and divinity schools, added input. The first published commentary on The Phoenix Affirmations appeared in 2006 (Jossey-Bass), written by Dr. Eric Elnes. According to Phyllis Tickle, author of The Great Emergence, Elnes’ The Phoenix Affirmations: A New Vision for the Future of Christianity stands today as the clearest, most articulate presentation of Progressive Christianity. The Phoenix Affirmations have been widely adopted by Christian organizations who identify themselves as \"progressive.\" \n\nThe Phoenix Affirmations take on a threefold structure, based on the Three Great Loves identified by Jesus and affirmed within Judaism: Love of God, Love of Neighbor, and Love of Self. \nThe Phoenix Affirmations are not meant to be a static set of principles to stand for all time. The authors attached a version number to them—currently 3.8—indicating that the Affirmations are the product of continual modification and may be amended in the future in light of new awareness and deeper understanding of what is believed to be God’s call. In contrast to a Creed, the Affirmations are not meant to serve as a test of faith against which a person’s Christian commitments are to be verified. Diana Butler Bass described the Phoenix Affirmations as follows: \"Together, they spell out the theological basis of Protestant liberality: being open and humble, yet grounded in the biblical story of God's dream for humankind.\"\n\nIn 2006, some members of an organization called CrossWalk America spent 5 months, walking 2,500 miles from Phoenix, AZ, to Washington, D.C., to deliver a set of The Phoenix Affirmations as part of a Labor Day Rally. This walk was the subject of the feature length film, The Asphalt Gospel as well as the book, Asphalt Jesus: Finding A New Christian Faith Along the Highways of America, which also contains specific commentary on the Affirmations.\n\nJ. Shelby Spong, theologian and author, was present in Washington at the end of the walk. Spong wrote: “The Phoenix Affirmations call on Christians to love God in all of God’s expressions, to love our neighbors, including our neighbors who call God by a different name and even our neighbors who use the literal texts of the Bible as a weapon with which to attack the objects of their prejudice, and finally to love ourselves, just as we are, male, female, black, white, brown, gay, straight, transgender, bisexual, learned and unlearned, left-handed and right-handed, indeed in all of the rich variety of the human family. We are to stand as one against any religious system that encourages self-hatred, that manipulates through guilt, or that presents God as a punishing parent who delights in our groveling before the throne of grace.” \n\nTHE PHOENIX AFFIRMATIONS\nVersion 3.8\n\nCHRISTIAN LOVE OF GOD INCLUDES:\n\n1. Walking fully in the Path of Jesus without denying the legitimacy of other paths that God may provide for humanity.\n\n2. Listening for God’s Word, which comes through daily prayer and meditation, studying the ancient testimonies which we call Scripture, and attending to God’s present activity in the world.\n\n3. Celebrating the God whose Spirit pervades and whose glory is reflected in all of God’s Creation, including the earth and its ecosystems, the sacred and secular, the Christian and non-Christian, the human and non-human.\n\n4. Expressing our love in worship that is as sincere, vibrant, and artful as it is scriptural.\n\nCHRISTIAN LOVE OF NEIGHBOR INCLUDES:\n\n5. Engaging people authentically, as Jesus did, treating all as creations made in God’s very image, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental ability, nationality, or economic class.\n\n6. Standing, as Jesus does, with the outcast and oppressed, the denigrated and afflicted, seeking peace and justice with or without the support of others.\n\n7. Preserving religious freedom and the church’s ability to speak prophetically to government by resisting the commingling of church and state.\n\n8. Walking humbly with God, acknowledging our own shortcomings while honestly seeking to understand and call forth the best in others, including those who consider us their enemies.\n\nCHRISTIAN LOVE OF SELF INCLUDES:\n\n9. Basing our lives on the faith that in Christ all things are made new and that we, and all people, are loved beyond our wildest imaginations—for eternity.\n\n10. Claiming the sacredness of both our minds and our hearts, and recognizing that faith and science, doubt and belief serve the pursuit of truth.\n\n11. Caring for our bodies and insisting on taking time to enjoy the benefits of prayer, reflection, worship, and recreation in addition to work.\n\n12. Acting on the faith that we are born with a meaning and purpose, a vocation and ministry that serve to strengthen and extend God’s realm of love.\n"}

He spent his early years as a teacher and a village organist. At the outbreak of the French Revolution he viewed it with favor, but was soon disgusted at the violence of its methods. A critical pamphlet drew upon him the hatred of the revolutionists, and it was not until 1806 that he was able to settle in Paris. In 1809 he published his great work, \"Des Compensations dans les destines humaines\" (5th ed. 1846), which pleased Napoleon so much that he made its author professor at St Cyr. In 1811 he became inspector of the public library at Avignon, and from 1812 to 1815 he held the same position at Nancy. The Restoration government at first suspected him as a Bonapartist, but at length granted him a pension. From that time he occupied himself in lecturing and the publication of philosophical works.\n\nIn the \"Compensations\" he sought to prove that, on the whole, happiness and misery are equally balanced, and therefore that men should accept the government which is given them rather than risk the horrors of revolution. \"Le principe de l'inégalité naturelle et essentielle dans les destinées humaines conduit inevitablement au fanatisme revolutionnaire ou au fanatisme religieux.\"; The principles of compensation and equilibrium are found also in the physical universe, the product of matter and force, whose cause is God. Force, naturally expansive and operating on the homogeneous atoms which constitute elemental matter, is subject to the law of equilibrium, or equivalence of action and reaction. The development of pheaomena under this law may be divided into three stagesthe physical, the physiological, the intellectual and moral. The immaterial in man is the expansive force inherent in him. Moral and political phenomena are the result of the opposing forces of progress and preservation, and their perfection lies in the fulfilment of the law of equilibrium or universal harmony. This may be achieved in seven thousand years, when man will vanish from the world. In an additional five thousand, a similar equilibrium will obtain in the physical sphere, which will then itself pass away.\n\nIn addition to his philosophical work, Azaïs studied music under his father, Pierre Hyacinthe Azaïs (1743-1796), professor of music at Sorèze and Toulouse, and composer of sacred music in the style of Gossec. He wrote for the \"Revue musicale\" a series of articles entitled \"Acoustique fondamentale\" (1831), containing an ingenious, but now exploded, theory of the vibration of the air.\n\nThe son's other works are: \"Système universel\" (8 vols., 1812); \"Du Sort de l'homme\" (3 vols., 1820); \"Cours de philosophie\" (8 vols., 1824), reproduced as \"Explication universelle\" (3 vols., 1826–1828); \"Jeunesse, maturité, religion, philosophie\" (1837); \"De la phrénologie, du magnétisme, et de la folie\" (1843).\n\n"}

It is intended to protect the rights provided by the United States Constitution for all individuals regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, etc. It is fundamentally based on the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, intended to secure rights for former slaves. The Constitution is claimed to uphold racial and gender equality, but until the 1950s, enforcing slavery, segregation, and gender inequality were major aspects of the history of the American federal government.\n\nIn 1896, the United States Supreme Court determined that the \"separate but equal\" doctrine was constitutional in the case \"Plessy v. Ferguson.\" Although the Fourteenth Amendment abolished slavery, and intended to end racial segregation, the Southern States initiated Jim Crow Laws, which segregated people of color in public schools, public transportation, restaurants, etc. The ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson meant that as long as facilities for both colored and white individuals were equal, it was constitutional. In 1954, the ruling of Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned in the Supreme Court case \"Brown v. Board of Education. \"The Supreme Court determined that the establishment of separate schools for whites and blacks inherently unequal, and as a result unconstitutional. This ruling put an end to segregation on the basis of equal rights of protection.\n\nThese court cases however had no bearing on women's suffrage or equality. The Nineteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution legislates that neither the individual states of the United States nor its federal government may deny a citizen the right to vote because of the citizen's sex.\n\nIn recent years equal protection of citizens within the workplace has become a major issue. As a result of various amendments, citizens can not be discriminated against in work places based on terms of gender, ethnicity, race, height, or other similar differences. For example, a potential employee who is unusually short and weak can not be denied a job in a police force based upon his size.\n\nAn Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which would grant equal rights to women, has been a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution since 1972. Having failed to meet the deadline requirements for passage incorporated into the original proposed amendment, efforts to reintroduce and ratify similar amendments have come before Congress every year since 1982.\n\nThe very existence of equal rights, however, is controversial because it sets boundaries and makes clear the differences among citizens. In order to declare something as equal, there must exist a comparison to something that is unequal. In doing this, people are forced to compare equality in terms of education, wage, and many other controversial considerations.\n"}
{"id": "567475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=567475", "title": "Rudolf Otto", "text": "Rudolf Otto\n\nRudolf Otto (25 September 1869 – 6 March 1937) was an eminent German Lutheran theologian, philosopher, and comparative religionist. He is regarded as one of the most influential scholars of religion in the early twentieth century and is best known for his concept of the \"numinous\", a profound emotional experience he argued was at the heart of the world's religions. While his work started in the domain of liberal Christian theology, its main thrust was always apologetical, seeking to defend religion against naturalist critiques. Otto eventually came to conceive of his work as part of a science of religion, which was divided into the philosophy of religion, the history of religion, and the psychology of religion.\n\nBorn in Peine near Hanover, Otto was raised in a pious Christian family. He attended the Gymnasium Andreanum in Hildesheim and studied at the universities of Erlangen and Göttingen, where he wrote his dissertation on Martin Luther's understanding of the Holy Spirit (\"Die Anschauung von heiligen Geiste bei Luther: Eine historisch-dogmatische Untersuchung\"), and his habilitation on Kant (\"Naturalistische und religiöse Weltansicht\"). By 1906, he held a position as extraordinary professor, and in 1910 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Giessen.\n\nOtto's fascination with non-Christian religions was awakened during an extended trip from 1911-1912 through North Africa, Palestine, British India, China, Japan, and the United States. He cited a 1911 visit to a Moroccan synagogue as a key inspiration for the theme of the Holy he would later develop. Otto became a member of the German parliament in 1913 and retained this position through the First World War. In 1917, he spearheaded an effort to simplify the system of weighting votes in Prussian elections. He then served in the post-war constituent assembly in 1918, and remained involved in the politics of the Weimar Republic.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1915, he became ordinary professor at the University of Breslau, and in 1917, at the University of Marburg's Divinity School, then one of the most famous Protestant seminaries in the world. Although he received several other calls, he remained in Marburg for the rest of his life. He retired in 1929 but continued writing afterward. On 6 March 1937, he died of pneumonia, after suffering serious injuries falling about twenty meters from a tower in October 1936. There were lasting rumors that the fall was a suicide attempt but this has never been confirmed. He is buried in the Marburg cemetery.\n\nIn his early years Otto was most influenced by the German idealist theologian and philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher and his conceptualization of the category of the religious as a type of emotion or consciousness irreducible to ethical or rational epistemologies. In this, Otto saw Schleiermacher as having recaptured a sense of holiness lost in the Age of Enlightenment. Schleiermacher described this religious feeling as one of absolute dependence; Otto eventually rejected this characterization as too closely analogous to earthly dependence and emphasized the complete otherness of the religious feeling from the mundane world (see below). In 1904, while a student at the University of Göttingen, Otto became a proponent of the philosophy of Jakob Fries along with two fellow students.\n\nOtto's first book, \"Naturalism and Religion\" (1904) divides the world ontologically into the mental and the physical, a position reflecting Cartesian dualism. Otto argues consciousness cannot be explained in terms of physical or neural processes, and also accords it epistemological primacy by arguing all knowledge of the physical world is mediated by personal experience. On the other hand, he disagrees with Descartes' characterization of the mental as a rational realm, positing instead that rationality is built upon a nonrational intuitive realm.\n\nIn 1909, he published his next book, \"The Philosophy of Religion Based on Kant and Fries\", in which he examines the thought of Kant and Fries and from there attempts to build a philosophical framework within which religious experience can take place. While Kant's philosophy said thought occurred in a rational domain, Fries diverged and said it also occurred in practical and aesthetic domains; Otto pursued Fries' line of thinking further and suggested another nonrational domain of the thought, the religious. He felt intuition was valuable in rational domains like mathematics, but subject to the corrective of reason, whereas religious intuitions might not be subject to that corrective.\n\nThese two early works were influenced by the rationalist approaches of Immanuel Kant and Jakob Fries. Otto stated that they focused on the rational aspects of the divine (the \"Ratio aeterna\") whereas his next (and most influential) book focused on the nonrational aspects of the divine.\n\nOtto's most famous work, \"The Idea of the Holy\", was first published in German in 1917 as \"Das Heilige - Über das Irrationale in der Idee des Göttlichen und sein Verhältnis zum Rationalen\". It was one of the most successful German theological books of the 20th century, has never gone out of print, and is now available in about 20 languages. The first English translation was published in 1923 under the title \"The Idea of the Holy: An Inquiry into the Non-Rational Factor in the Idea of the Divine and its Relation to the Rational\". Otto felt people should first do serious rational study of God, before turning to the non-rational element of God as he did in this book.\n\nIn \"The Idea of the Holy\", Otto writes that while the concept of \"the holy\" is often used to convey moral perfection – and does entail this – it contains another distinct element, beyond the ethical sphere, for which he coined the term \"numinous\" based on the Latin word numen (\"divine power\"). (The term is etymologically unrelated to Immanuel Kant's \"noumenon\", a Greek term which Kant used to refer to an unknowable reality underlying sensations of the thing.) He explains the numinous as a \"non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self\". This mental state \"presents itself as \"ganz Andere\", wholly other, a condition absolutely \"sui generis\" and incomparable whereby the human being finds himself utterly abashed.\" Otto argues that because the numinous is irreducible and \"sui generis\" it cannot be defined in terms of other concepts or experiences, and that the reader must therefore be \"guided and led on by consideration and discussion of the matter through the ways of his own mind, until he reach the point at which 'the numinous' in him perforce begins to stir... In other words, our \"X\" cannot, strictly speaking, be taught, it can only be evoked, awakened in the mind.\" Chapters 4 to 6 are devoted to attempting to evoke the numinous and its various aspects. He writes:\n\nHe describes it as a mystery () that is at once terrifying (\"tremendum\") and fascinating (\"fascinans\"). Otto felt that the \"numinous\" was most strongly present in the Old and New Testaments, but that it was also present in all other religions.\n\nAccording to Mark Wynn in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", \"The Idea of the Holy\" falls within a paradigm in the philosophy of emotion in which emotions are seen as including an element of perception with intrinsic epistemic value that is neither mediated by thoughts nor simply a response to physiological factors. Otto therefore understands religious experience as having mind-independent phenomenological content rather than being an internal response to belief in a divine reality. Otto applied this model specifically to religious experiences, which he felt were qualitatively different from other emotions.\n\nIn \"Mysticism East and West\", published in German in 1926, Otto compares and contrasts the views of the medieval German Christian mystic Meister Eckhart with those of the influential Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara, the key figure of the Advaita Vedanta school.\n\nOtto left a broad influence on theology, religious studies, and philosophy of religion in the first half of the 20th century and beyond.\n\nKarl Barth, an influential Protestant theologian contemporary to Otto, acknowledged Otto's influence and approved a similar conception of God as \"ganz Andere\" or \"totaliter aliter\", that fits into the apophatic theology tradition. Otto was also one of the very few modern theologians to whom C. S. Lewis indicates a debt, particularly to the idea of the \"numinous\" in \"The Problem of Pain\". In that book Lewis offers his own description of the numinous:\n\nGerman-American theologian Paul Tillich acknowledged Otto's influence on him, as did Otto's most famous German pupil, Gustav Mensching (1901–1978) from Bonn University. Otto's views can be seen in the noted Catholic theologian Karl Rahner's presentation of man as a being of transcendence. More recently, Otto has also influenced the American Franciscan friar and inspirational speaker Richard Rohr.\n\nOtto's ideas have also exerted an influence on non-Christian theology and spirituality. They have been discussed by Orthodox Jewish theologians including Joseph Soloveitchik and Eliezer Berkovits. The Iranian-American Sufi religious studies scholar and public intellectual Reza Aslan understands religion as \"an institutionalized system of symbols and metaphors [...] with which a community of faith can share with each other their numinous encounter with the Divine Presence.\" Further afield, Otto's work received words of appreciation from Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi. Aldous Huxley, a major proponent of perennialism, was influenced by Otto; in \"The Doors of Perception\" he writes:\nIn \"The Idea of the Holy\" and other works, Otto set out a paradigm for the study of religion that focused on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was heavily criticized between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has seen a resurgence since then, as its phenomenological aspects have become more apparent. The eminent Romanian-American historian of religion and philosopher Mircea Eliade used the concepts from \"The Idea of the Holy\" as the starting point for his own 1954 book, \"The Sacred and the Profane\".\n\nCarl Gustav Jung, the founder of analytic psychology, applied the concept of the \"numinous\" to psychology and psychotherapy, arguing it was therapeutic and brought greater self-understanding, and stating that to him religion was about a \"careful and scrupulous observation... of the \"numinosum\"\". The American Episcopal priest John A. Sanford applied the ideas of both Otto and Jung in his writings on religious psychotherapy.\n\nThe philosopher and sociologist Max Horkheimer, a member of the Frankfurt School, has taken the concept of \"wholly other\" in his 1970 book \"Die Sehnsucht nach dem ganz Anderen\" (\"longing for the entirely Other\"). Other philosophers to acknowledge Otto were, for instance, Martin Heidegger, Leo Strauss, Hans-Georg Gadamer (who was critical when younger but respectful in his old age), Max Scheler, Edmund Husserl, W. T. Stace, Joachim Wach, and Hans Jonas. The war veteran and writer Ernst Jünger and the historian and scientist Joseph Needham also cited his influence.\n\nOtto was heavily involved in ecumenical activities between Christian denominations and between Christianity and other religions. He experimented with adding a time similar to a Quaker moment of silence to the Lutheran liturgy as an opportunity for worshipers to experience the numinous.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Books\" of the Seminar are edited by Jacques-Alain Miller.\n\nIn 1951, Lacan, then a member of the Paris Psychoanalytic Society, initiated a series of weekly Wednesday meetings in his apartment on Rue de Lille, Paris. In 1952, the meetings were transferred to the Sainte-Anne Hospital where Lacan worked as a consultant psychiatrist. \"Book I\" of the seminar is the edited transcription of the 1953-1954 weekly lessons at Sainte-Anne, where the Seminar would be held until 1963.\n\nThe final seminar to be held at Sainte-Anne is published as \"Book X\" (\"Anxiety\", 1962-1963). The single lesson delivered on 20 November 1963 and published as \"Introduction to the Names-of-the-Father Seminar\" is the introduction to a seminar that was never delivered, and which has thus been dubbed \"The Inexistent Seminar\". Indeed, the night before this lesson, Lacan had been informed that the SFP \"had voted, in a complicated procedure, to refuse to ratify the motion striking Lacan's name from the list of the training analysts\", thus stripping Lacan of the right to continue as a training analyst within the International Psychoanalytical Association. This institutional manoeuvre effectively brought to a close the early period of Lacan's teaching.\n\nThe middle period of Lacan's teaching began two months later with \"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis\". Hosted by the École Normale Supérieure, under the patronage of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, the Seminar now enjoyed \"a much larger audience\" and represented a \"change of front\". This series of lessons, now edited as \"Book XI\" of the Seminar, opens with the lesson \"Excommunication\" in which Lacan expands on the circumstances and implications of his exclusion from the IPA. The second lesson, \"The Freudian Unconscious and Ours\" sets the tone of his ensuing teaching by indicating potential points of discontinuity with respect to Freud's oeuvre.\n\nLacan's yearly Seminar continued at the École normale supérieure until 1969. From autumn 1969 onwards, it was hosted by the Law Faculty at Place du Panthéon. This series of seminars, the late period of Lacan's teaching, opened with \"The Other Side of Psychoanalysis\", now edited as \"Book XVII\" of the Seminar, and continued until the late seventies.\n\nAs Lacan's teaching moved into the phase known as the \"very late teaching of Lacan\", his declining health led to less regular appointments. Lacan's final public delivery on 12 July 1980, sometimes referred to as \"The Caracas Seminar\" was not, as this title indicates, part of the Parisian series.\n\nFrom the very first seminar at Sainte-Anne, the weekly sessions were recorded by a shorthand typist. For two decades, copies of these typescripts were the only available record of Lacan's oral teaching, Lacan himself having declined the various offers extended to him to have the typescripts edited into publishable volumes.\n\nIn the early seventies, Jacques-Alain Miller offered some indications as to what would constitute an effective editorial strategy and at Lacan's invitation drew up a transcription of the twenty lessons that made up the eleventh seminar, \"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis\" delivered in 1964. The result pleased Lacan, and François Wahl at Éditions du Seuil was happy to publish.\n\nSeminar XI was published in 1973. In his \"Postface\", Lacan writes: \"A transcription, now here is a word I am discovering thanks to the modesty of J. A. M., Jacques-Alain Miller by name: what gets read passes through the writing whilst surviving there intact\". Lacan had said to Miller, \"we will sign it together\", but Miller had preferred to opt for a more discreet \"Text established by…\", a nod to the editing credits to the Greek and Latin texts in the Collection Budé.\n\nBoth Lacan and Wahl were keen for more seminars to be published and Lacan entrusted the task to Miller. Four more books of the Seminar were published during Lacan's lifetime. The first to be translated into English was \"Book XI\", published by Hogarth Press in 1977 with a specially written preface. To date (2015), seventeen of the seminars have been published in French, several of which have also appeared in English translation. The remaining seminars have all been established by Miller and are currently awaiting publication. As of 2013, the Books of the Seminar will be published by Éditions de la Martinière.\n\n"}

The retreating 'Vellala caunter' (a group of cultivators) from the warring soldiers of Tipu Sultan's army in the seventeenth century made the plateau of Yelagiri their home. Another native tribal groups are the Irular.\n\nMost of the Tamil people are Hindus. They commonly worship Shiva in the name of 'Nachiappan' and Parvati in the name of 'Nachiamma'. A temple for Murugan (son of Shiva and Parvati) was built in the 1960s. Recently more Churches were also established by the Christian missionary. Mosques are also available in the area.\n\nEarlier only a few Christian missionary schools were available for primary school education, but now more Residential schools have come up in this region.\n\nEducational Institutions: There are schools in the various hamlets around Elagiri including the Government School and St. Charles School which are primarily for day scholars. There are also three residential schools - Ebenezer Matriculation and Higher Secondary School (Residential), Peace Garden Matriculation School and Samaritan Residential Schools.
