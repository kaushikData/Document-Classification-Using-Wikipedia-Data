Translated as \"act of being\", the expression \"actus essendi\" refers to a fundamental metaphysical principle discovered by Aquinas in his Christianizing of Aristotle. \n\nAquinas saw that in any subsisting extramental thing one finds a couplet of metaphysical principles: one is the ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is, the other is the \"actus essendi\" which gives to the thing and to its ‘essence’ actual existence. \n\nThe observation that individual things display instantiations of a particular ‘essence’ led Aquinas to postulate that what gives actual existence to a thing and to its ‘essence’ — the \"actus essendi\" — is unique, in the sense that the perfection of \"actus essendi\" cannot be said to be common in the way an ‘essence’ is said to be common. \n\nThings instantiating the essence of horseness, for example, are said to be similar because of their horseness. The essence of horseness is what makes horses to be the same under a common category.\n\nBut things instantiating the perfection of \"actus essendi\", are said to be different on account of their \"actus essendi\". The possession of \"actus essendi\" is what makes things unique and distinct from all other things. \n\nThus in what actually exists as a subsisting extramental thing, there is an ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is (a horse, for example), and the \"actus essendi\" which makes the thing to be a real, individual, existing thing.\n\nAristotle didn’t have the notion of \"actus essendi\". In fact, the contribution of Aquinas to the philosophy of being is precisely this, that he discovered that all Aristotelian acts were in reality ‘potency’ with respect to the \"actus essendi\". \n\nAquinas saw that the metaphysical principle of \"actus essendi\" is the \"act of all acts, the perfection of all perfections\", and \"a proper effect of God\". The metaphysics of Aristotle did not reach that far.\n\nAccordingly, Pope John Paul II stresses in his teachings that the philosophy of Aquinas is the philosophy of \"actus essendi\", \"whose transcendental value paves the most direct way to rise to the knowledge of subsisting Being and pure Act, namely to God.\" Aquinas defined God as the ‘\"Ipse Actus Essendi subsistens\"’, subsisting act of being.\n\n"}

{"id": "10492233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10492233", "title": "Alejandro Korn", "text": "Alejandro Korn\n\nAlejandro Korn (3 May 1860 – 9 October 1936) was an Argentine psychiatrist, philosopher, reformist and politician. For eighteen years, he was the director of the psychiatry hospital in Melchor Romero (a locality of La Plata in Buenos Aires). He was the first university official in Latin America to be elected thanks to the student's vote. He is considered to be the pioneer of Argentine philosophy. Along with Florentino Ameghino, Juan Vucetich, Almafuerte and Carlos Spegazzini, he is considered to be one of \"the five wise men\" of La Plata.\n\nAlejandro Korn was born in San Vicente, Buenos Aires. His father, Carlos Adolfo Korn, was a liberal German-Prussian doctor and soldier, who had refused to take part in the repression that followed the worker's strike in the textile sector during the Social Revolution in 1848. Sentenced to death, he fled to Switzerland on horseback. There, he studied Medicine and met his future wife, María Verena Meyer. He decided to migrate to Argentina, and there they got married. He settled down in San Vicente (Buenos Aires), where he worked as a doctor and a judge. He promoted the construction of the first flour mill and the lengthening of the railroad tracks to reach the city. He distinguished for his remarkable work fighting the cholera epidemics, and, for that reason, he was awarded by the president Domingo F. Sarmiento. When he died, in 1905, the city of San Vicente paid him homage.\n\nAlejandro Korn was the eldest of eight siblings. His only brother, Mauricio, would also become a doctor. In his youth, Alejandro showed an interest in culture and sport. In 1877 he settled down in Buenos Aires to study, first at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and later at the Universidad de Buenos Aires's College of Medicine.\n\nAfterwards, he met and married María Villafañe, and settled in La Plata. They had seven children, four of which survived childhood. One of them, Alejandro Korn Villafañe, was instrumental in the University Reform and is distinguished for his insights into catholic doctrine and his teaching position at the modern Escuela de La Plata. His other son, Guillermo Korn, was a left-wing reformer and student leader, journalist, leader of the Socialist Party and national deputy, as well as a playwright and the founder of the \"Teatro del Pueblo\" in La Plata.\n\nHe graduated in 1882, with his thesis \"Locura y crimen\" (“Insanity and crime”). He worked in the small towns of Navarro and Ranchos, where he was living at the time.\n\nIn 1888 he was appointed to police doctor. In 1897 he was appointed to director of the Hospital Provincial de Melchor Romero, a hospital-colony with a surface of 80 hectares (which he would afterwards increase to 180 hectares), designed by his lodge mate Pedro Benoit, placed 10 kilometers away from La Plata city, where Benoit lived.\n\nIt was inaugurated as a hospital in 1884, but then it specialized in treating mental diseases. It was the first hospital of its kind in Argentine, and, probably, in Latin America. Korn acted as director of Melchor Romero Hospital until 1916, when he resigned from the title in order to devote all his time and energies to philosophy. From 1900 onwards, his brother Mauricia Korn also worked there.\n\nIn 1910 he founded the \"Medical Association of La Plata\" where he acted as its president.\n\nAlejandro Korn entered in the Argentine Freemasonry on 15 June 1881, aged 21, in the Germania Nº 19 lodge. His father had entered the same lodge in Germany, and was a long-standing and influential member, who had in fact helped his lodge establish in Argentina, with the help of his Freemason Brothers in the country.\n\nWhen he was 23 years old, Alejandro was appointed to Venerable Maestro (“Venerable Master”) of his lodge. Later, he entered the La Plata Nº 80 lodge, which included other influential inhabitants of La Plata such as Carlos Spegazzini and Pedro Benoit.\n\nHe was a member of Unión Cívica Radical (“Radical Civic Union”) since its foundation in 1891, and, in the 1893 Revolution, he was appointed by the Revolutionary Junta to La Plata's Intendant, a title that he held for some days until the defeat of the Revolution. In 1894, he was elected as a deputy of the UCR. He resigned from the title in 1897, to express his disapproval of a series of acts of corruption in the “Banco Hipotecario”, in which several other members he knew where involved.\n\nIn 1917 he was elected as a deputy of La Plata again as part of UCR, and he opted to the title of national deputy in 1918. In that year, he left the UCR, embraced the socialist beliefs and wrote \"Socialismo ético\" (“Ethical socialism”) and \"Incipit Vita Nova\":\nThe new philosophy will liberate us from the nightmare of mechanic automatism, and will give us back the dignity of our conscious free personality, free and master of its own destiny…If we want a better world, we will build it… Socialism itself, beyond Marx’s well-known theorem, asks for solidarity, that is to say, a theoretical feeling.\nIn 1931 he entered the Socialist Party (Argentina). In 1934 he gave a much-praised series of lectures in the “Casa del Pueblo de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires” (“Buenos Aires’s People’s House”). The lectures were titled \"Jean Jaurés\", \"Hegel y Marx\" (“Hegel and Marx”), and \"Antimarx\", and were published by the \"Revista Socialista\" (“Socialist magazine”) in February 1935.\n\nIn 1934 he was elected to be a “convencional constituyente” to help rewrite the Constitution of the Buenos Aires Province, but he resigned from that title as a protest for the fraud that the government had committed in those elections, as did Alfredo Palacios and his son Guillermo Korn.\n\nAlejandro Korn was not only a teacher, but a high-level official in La Plata's and Buenos Aires's Universities as well. He was also involved in the students’ reformist movement. In fact, both of his sons were leaders of students’ groups, though different ones.\n\nIn 1903 he entered in the National University of La Plata as councillor and vice-rector, when it was still a provincial one and Dardo Rocha was its rector. From that moment, he was the associate professor of the History of Philosophy Cathedra. The Obstetrics School was created thanks to his initiative.\n\nIn 1919, in a moment of social unrest, the students’ movement chose him to be responsible for the University, together with Carlos Spegazzini and Edelmiro Calvo.\nIn 1906 he entered as a teacher of the History of Philosophy Cathedra in Buenos Aires's University's Philosophy Faculty. In 1912 he was elected Faculty councillor, a title he held until 1918. That year, with the University Reform as background, he was elected dean by the students of the Philosophy Faculty in the University of Buenos Aires, a title he held until 1921.\n\nIn 1918, Korn was one of the professors, together with José Ingenieros, Alfredo Palacios and José Vasconcelos, to be taken as a model by the students’ organization that promoted the University Reform throughout Latin America. Unlike the situation in Cordoba, where the movement was basically antischolastic, La Plata's reformism was marked by a strong antipositivism because clericalism was almost completely inexistent in La Plata. This antipositivistic reaction was guided by Alejandro Korn. Between 1919 and 1922, he wrote several articles about the impact of the University Reform in the cultural renovation of Latin America.\n\nHis most remarkable work, \"La Libertad creadora\" (“The creative freedom”) was written as a request from the “Centro de Estudiantes”, a Buenos Aires Law Student's Association, to be published in their magazine \"Verbum\", in order to give basis to the transforming activities in which the reformist youth was embarked upon. It was written under the concepts that inspired his vision of an “ethical socialism”. The former Guatemala president Juan José Arévalo, former pupil of Korn in National University of La Plata defined him as \"the professor par excellence\".\n\nDeputy Silvia Augsburger claimed that Korn was the main thinker of the University Reform, in what concerns new syllabuses and modern teaching methods. Those aspects had also an important role in the agitated public debates in which Korn participated. Ahead of his time, following educationalist concepts that would be universally acknowledged in the 1950s, he remarked the need of make the student, as an active and creative subject, the center of the educationalist process. In \"La Reforma Universitaria\" (1919), he wrote:\n\nThe Reform is a dynamic process, and its purpose is creating a new University spirit and giving the University back its lost prestige, being conscious of its mission and dignity. In order to attain so, the student’s participation in the University’s government is essential. They, and only they, represent the propulsion force, the efficient action, capable of moving inertia and avoid stagnation. Without them, nothing has been done, and nothing would have been done. The way in which they must intervene, that’s a secondary issue; the important thing is to make sure that they constitute such a power, that nothing will be done without it. We have announced the advent of an intense ethical and aesthetical culture, purely Argentine, noble because of its yearning of social justice; a culture meant to exceed, without harming Science, an intellectualist and utilitarianist age. It is pleasing to observe the youth looking for the light of new ideals through different paths. A free cathedra surrounded by free students, who own and are responsible for their acts, will contribute towards forging the national character in a better way than the wordy tutelage of those who never even had strength of character themselves.\nKorn practiced sport, especially fencing, and helped spread it in Argentina, when it wasn’t the popular activity it is today.\n\nIn 1891, with an economic, political and social crisis started in 1890 as background, he was elected President of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, a title he held until 1894. His most remarkable work, together with other leaders, was getting the estate enclosed by the streets Nº 1 and Nº 47 in order to build there the first sport's field of the club.\n\nTogether with José Ingenieros, Alejandro Korn is considered to be the pioneer in Argentine philosophical thinking, and part of the foundational group of Latin American philosophy, together with Cuban Enrique José Varona, Mexican José Vasconcelos and Antonio Caso, Peruvian Alejandro Desutúa, Uruguayan Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Brazilian Raimundo Farías Brito and Chilean Enrique Molina.\n\nAlejandro Korn's thinking inspired a profound renovation of Latin American philosophy, under the principles of the continental University Reform democratizing movement, in a moment when Argentina was experiencing a clash in order to exceed the “oligarchic republic”, which was based on electoral fraud and “voto cantado” (“spoken vote”), and establish a democratic system that had respect for the general will as its core. The people who read his works were mainly young reformist students and left-center political and social activists. The central theme of his work was the study of values and freedom. Two notable works are \"La libertad creadora\" (1922) and \"Axiología\" (1930).\n\nThe crux of Alejandro Korn's philosophy is the criticism towards positivism and naïve realism, that is to say, the principles and conclusions, usually spontaneous, that are considered evident in each age, and which are present in every philosophical system, often as items from the rational analysis that are considered obvious.\n\nKorn conceives philosophy as thought intimately related to the culture of the moment, and the moment itself, a reflexion that comes as a by-product of a praxis linked to the problems and will of the specific individuals and democratic communities.\n\nLa Plata was conceived in 1882 as a cultural excellence center, open to the world, and specially open to Latin America. From its notable urbanistic design to its University and its famous Natural Sciences Museum, all the way up to the city's historical theaters and its extensive students’, teachers’ and researchers’ communities, with people from several regions and countries, La Plata established itself as an educational and scientific center, often called one of the \"Latin American cultural beacons\".\n\nKorn was part of the core of that beacon, together with four other La Plata's citizens known as \"the five wise men\": poet Almafuerte, paleontologist and anthropologist Florentino Ameghino, philosopher Alejandro Korn, biologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini and criminologist Juan Vucetich.\n\n\"The five wise men\" were broadly the same sage: the two eldest ones, Ameghino and Almafuerte, were born in 1854, and the youngest, Korn himself, was born in 1860. Korn was, in addition, the last to die, in 1936; the first had been Ameghino in 1911.\n\n\"The Creative Freedom\" is a paper first published in 1920, by the \"Verbum\" magazine, by the Law Students Centre of the University of Buenos Aires. It was the time of the University Reform, started in 1918 in Córdoba and spread afterwards throughout Latin America, which sought the generalization of the Latin American university kind that was found under a principle of autonomy, and with student participation in its government, as well as cathedra freedom. Korn had a decisive role in the University Reform, as a protagonist (he was the first dean to be elected by the students), and also as a thinker of the movement. In that way, \"The creative freedom\" is a profound philosophical reflexion about freedom, that sought boosting the role of the common man and woman, the “free subject”, as Korn called it, in the voluntarily transformation of the world.\n\nEugenio Pucciarelli wrote in the prologue to \"The creative freedom\" that “freedom is experienced as a liberation, as an emancipation from servitude, as an overcoming of an obstacle, as a triumph over resistance”. Korn himself stated that “our freedom would plunge if it were not leaning on the resistance that opposes it”.\n\nThe dynamics of antinomies is a fundamental trait of Alejandro Korn's thought. With the same approaching method, Korn stated that justice itself doesn’t exist, that there's only injustice and the constant fight against it towards the ideal of justice.\n\nIn order to understand the dynamics of freedom, Alejandro Korn started from the comprehension of “I” and the “subject” as active entities, bestowed with their own initiative.\nThe subject does not stand before the world in a contemplative attitude, he is not, in any way, a disinterested spectator. Consciousness is the theater for the conflicts and harmonies between the subject that feel, judges and wants, and the object that adjusts and resists.\nKorn gave priority to the concept of \"present time\" over the concept of \"reality\". Reality, defined from the idea of \"thing\", tends to form a static and passive field, whereas present time, defined from the idea of \"act\", tends to form dynamic processes, always changing and influenced by human decisions. From this theory, Korn outlined a criticism for language when he says:\nA philosophy treatise, in order to be logical, should be written using verbs and not a single noun. We never use a verb without referring it to a noun or a pronoun that substitutes it. This way of using the language, suggested by the relative stagnancy of things, derives from naïve realism and leads us towards mistakes.\nKorn approached the concept of \"creative freedom\" through the antinomy of the objective world and the subjective world. The objective world, he said, obeys necessary rules, whereas the subjective world has no rules, it's free.\nKant’s third antinomy states, in a concise way, the philosophical problem par excellence: the joint affirmation of necessity and freedom.\nFrom this conflict between freedom and necessity emerges a permanent process of both scientific and technical development that seeks obtaining power over the objective world and ethical self-domain of the subjective world that seeks subjugating necessity to freedom, thus reaching freedom itself in its uttermost development, dynamically linking power and will (desire).\n\nFreedom, thus understood, as an action, transformation and taking of an ethical position by an autonoumus subject, is referred to as \"creative freedom\" by Alejandro Korn\n\nThe following items hold his name:\n\n\nIn La Plata, opposite the Natural Sciences Museum, there is a monument, called \"Monument to the Five Wise Men\" by sculptor Máximo Maldonado.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41286780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41286780", "title": "Anavastha", "text": "Anavastha\n\nAnavastha (Sanskrit: अनवस्था) is a Sanskrit nominal compound derived from the verb \"Stha\" (meaning \"standing\", \"resting\", \"grounded\" or \"founded\"). The expression literally means: that which does not stand down, non-resting, unstable, holding no definite position, un-grounded or without foundation. It can also mean unsettled condition or character or absence of finality or conclusion. As a philosophical term it refers to the non-finality of a proposition or endless series of statements or \"regressus ad infinitum\" (infinite regress). In the Hindi language, as a noun Anavastha means Nothingness.\n\nIn Indian thought and Indian logic \"Anavastha\" is an important doctrine. All major schools of philosophy have examined and commented upon this concept and laid down guidelines so as to avoid the endless series of statements and propositions and the non-finality of those propositions. Certain aphorisms of Pāṇini, in his Ashtadhyayi indicate that \"asiddhatva\" leads to \"anavastha\" since rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there because application of a rule should certainly result in finality. The word अत्र \"atra\" of Sutra 6.4.22 indicates that two rules must have the same आश्रय \"āśraya\" or place of operation but where their places of operation are different they are not \"asiddha\" to each other.\n\nThe automatic application of \"sutras\" (rules of grammar) to take place without generating unintended results requires the establishment of a particular sequence among the rules and also the provision for cyclical application as well as blocking of some rules whenever it is desirable to do so. Panini orders rules and methods for their activation, reactivation and non-activation, and provides that the results brought about by some rules will not be 'known' to certain other rules, so that the question of these other rules becoming activated does not arise. The best example of the application of this method is known as \"Asiddhatva\". He uses the concept of \"Asiddhatva\" to prevent the application of a rule on the substitute, to enable its application on a substituent and to mandate its application. According to Kiparsky’s definitions, \"Asiddhatva\" implies 'no order of taking effect' since \"asiddha\" means 'not having taken effect'.\n\nThe Upanishads speak about the two-fold Brahman, the one with attributes called the \"Saguna Brahman\", and the other without attributes called the \"Nirguna Brahman\" only to deny and accept these two to state that Brahman is One. Brahman is called\n\"Nirguna\" because Brahman has not the three \"Gunas\" of \"Prakrti\", and not because Brahman has got no \"gunas\" absolutely; in order to prove the substantive existence of Brahman (\"prameya\"), Brahman is called \"Saguna\" even though there is absence of \"Gunas\" in Brahman (\"aprameya\"). Brahman is One, and Oneness cannot be confounded with non-oneness; also oneness does not require another oneness to differentiate through second oneness or a third to differentiate the second oneness, otherwise there will be no end or conclusion. This fallacy is \"Anavastha\" or infinite regress. The Vedas advise that Brahman must be looked at in one and one mode only. In created things differences are of three kinds – 1) Existing in oneself, 2) difference in species and 3) difference in genus. In three words denoting a) 'oneness of Brahman', the \"svajatiya-bheda\", b) 'restriction', the \"svagata-bheda\" and 3) 'rejection of duality', the \"vijatiya-bheda\", these three differences are negated by the Sruti texts (Panchadasi Stanzas II.20&21). The created things are many, a chain of causes and effects is also present, but to avoid the fallacy of \"anavastha\", it is necessary to consider Brahman as the root cause.\n\nVedanta does not admit the existence of the relation of \"samvaya\" (the inseparable inherence or concomitant cause or combining force) as subsisting between two different entities such as substance and qualities. In his Brahmasutra-bhashya II.ii.13, Sankara explains that if a \"samvaya\" relation is to be admitted to connect two things, then another \"samvaya\" would be necessary to connect it with either of the two entities that it intended to connect. Thus,there are two kinds of \"Anavastha\" - the \"Pramaniki\", the valid infinite, and the \"Apramaniki\", the vicious infinite. Knowledge is \"Chaitanya\" (\"anubhuti\") i.e. Consciousness, and consciousness reveals the reality of objects. An object cannot be talked about if it does not exist. Any attempt to find out whether the second knowledge that reveals the first knowledge identical with it is a separate knowledge or not leads to \"anavastha\". Because the first knowledge is a revelation, there is no second knowledge that reveals the first knowledge. Consciousness cannot be perceived, it perceives itself and is not perceived by any greater source; the logical fallacy of \"Anavastha\" (an endless series of cause and effect) would exist if it were to be said that Consciousness requires another source of perception (Devi GitaIV.12-13). If there is no eternal First Cause, the logical fallacy of \"Anavastha Dosha\" is inevitable. Brahman, the First cause, has no origin (Brahma Sutra II.3.9) Thus, a thing cannot be at the same time the object and the subject of action. Consciousness i.e. Chaitanya, is self-illuminating and it illuminates others by its own illumination. Kumārila Bhaṭṭa enquires, if an omniscient person exists that person can become comprehensible only to some other omniscient personality, and so on.\n\nIn Yoga, Ecstasy is the yogic visualization of a deity. And, the beginning five states of ecstasy induced by \"Cakra\" are – birth, childhood, youth, maturity and adulthood; the 6th is \"unmana\" ( also said to denote the dreaming state) meaning agitation or excitement when the devotee often swoons; and when this occurs and when the strong desire to experience the ultimate \"parabrahman\" holds complete sway then the 7th state i.e. \"manollasa\" (extreme exhilaration) or anavastha (the state beyond states or state without qualities or locale)(also said to denote the dreamless sleep) is reached (Kularnava-tantra. Stanza 82). Patanjali calls the unsteadiness of intelligence as the unsettled state of \"anavastha\" because due to \"vritti\" the tracing of the steady state of the Self is difficult and therefore the splendour of the Self is doubted.\n\nAccording to Hemachandra, Anavastha is a \"Dosha\", a defect or fault along with \"virodha\", \"vaiyadhikarana\", \"samkara\", \"samsaya\", \"vyatikara\", \"apratipatti\" and \"abhava\". It is also one of the dialectical principles applied alongside \"atmasraya\", \"anyonyasraya\", \"cakraka\", \"atiprasanga\", \"ubhayatahspasa\" and the like employed by logicians from very early times. Sriharsa explains that dialectical reasoning, which has its foundation in pervasion, can lead to contradiction when the reasoning becomes fallacious, it is the limit of doubt; and since differing unwanted contrary options create new doubts difficult to resolve which lead to \"anavastha\" or infinite regress and there is the absence of finality. The argument that contradiction cannot block an infinite regress is rejected; it is the doubter’s own behaviour that process the lie to the doubt, that blocks it (\"pratibandhaka\"). According to the Jains, in the \"Jiva\" five states are possible which can manifest themselves simultaneously of these the \"Audayika-bhava\" is the state which is the consequence of the unhindered realization of the \"Karman\", which state comprises all accidental attributes of the \"Jiva\" which become apparent with the \"udaya\" of \"karman\". This particular state has 21 sub-species beginning with \"asiddhatva\", which is the state of unholiness, when the spiritual perfection is lacking.\n\nNagarjuna states that if there is a characteristic of the conditioned other than origination (\"utpada\"), existence (\"stithi\"), and destruction (\"bhanga\"), there would be infinite regress (\"anavastha\"). If there is no such characteristic, these are not conditioned (\"na samskrta\"). The quest to find the origination of origination which originations are all conditioned by \"dharma\" is a never-ending cycle and leads to infinite regress. And that, whenever one wants to know how cognitions are grasped by other cognitions that attempt will lead to \"anavastha\" i.e. infinite regress, because if anything in objective experience with the particular property of acting on itself cannot be cited one has no grounds to assert that something that cannot be experienced has that unthinkable property. If \"pramanas\" are established through other \"pramanas\" it would result in infinite regress, then nothing can be established. Negation can be of an existent self-nature, if that self-nature does not exist it cannot be negated; the negation of non-existent entity is established without words.(Vigrha-vyartani Karika Stanza 11). The \"Abhidharma system\" which attributes \"svabhava\" to \"dharma\" because dharmas, the foundational components of the world, are independent of causes and conditions in a specific sense, retains the concept that dependently originated entities (\"pratityasamutpanna\") are separate from the dependently designated entities (\"prajnaptisat\"). Nagarjuna tends to equate lack of \"svabhava\" with dependence on causes and conditions and not with parts, and his argument that dependently originated things lacked \"svabhava\" and were \"prajnaptisat\" or conventionally existing entities, and that all \"dharmas\" are \"prajnapisat\" does lead to an infinite regress or \"anavastha\" and is, therefore, not valid. \"Samyutta Nikaya\" summarises the doctrine of 'dependent-origination' in terms of the necessary conditions for something to be, which doctrine is applied by \"Sarvastivadins\" to determine whether or not an entity ultimately existed.\n"}

Under it are the \"sephirot\" of Chesed and Netzach. It commonly has four paths going to Keter, Binah, Tifereth, and Chesed. (Some kabbalists attribute a path between Chokhmah and Gevurah.)\n\nProverbs personifies Divine Wisdom, which existed before the world was made, revealed God, and acted as God's agent in creation ( cf. 3:19; ; ). Wisdom dwelt with God (; cf. ; ) and being the exclusive property of God was as such inaccessible to human beings (). It was God who \"found\" wisdom () and gave her to Israel: \"He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men.\" (; ). As a female figure (Sir. 1:15; Wis. 7:12), wisdom addressed human beings (Prov. 1:20–33; 8:1–9:6) inviting to her feast those who are not yet wise (Prov. 9:1-6). \nWisdom 7:22b-8:1 is a famous passage describing Divine Wisdom, including the passage:\n\"For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.\" (). \nSolomon, as the archetypal wise person, fell in love with Wisdom: \"I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.\" ().\n\nAccording to the Bahir: \"The second (utterance) is wisdom, as is written: 'Y-H-W-H acquired me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old' (Prov 8:22). And there is no 'beginning' but wisdom.\"\n\nChokhmah, the second of the ten sefirot, is the first power of conscious intellect within Creation, and the first point of 'real' existence, since Keter represents emptiness. According to the book of Job, \"Wisdom comes from nothingness\". This point is both infinitely small, and yet encompasses the whole of being, but it remains incomprehensible until it is given shape and form in Binah.\n\nThe name of God associated with Chokhmah is Yah.\n\nChokhmah appears in the configuration of the \"sefirot\" at the top of the right axis, and corresponds in the \"tzelem Elokim\" (\"the Divine image\") to the right eye, or right hemisphere of the brain.\n\nIn its fully articulated form, Chokhmah possesses two \"partzufim\" (\"faces\" or \"features\"): the higher of these is referred to as \"Abba Ila'ah\" (\"the higher father\"), whereas the lower is referred to as Yisrael Saba (\"Israel, the Elder\"). These two \"partzufim\" are referred to jointly as \"Abba\" (\"father\").\n\nChokhmah is associated in the soul with the power of intuitive insight, flashing lightning-like across consciousness. The \"partzuf\" of \"Abba Ila'ah\" is associated with the power to spontaneously extract such insight from the superconscious realm, whereas the \"partzuf\" of \"Yisrael Saba\" is associated with the power to subsequently direct it into consciousness.\n\nThe \"wisdom\" of Chokhmah also implies the ability to look deeply at some aspect of reality and abstract its conceptual essence till one succeeds in uncovering its underlying axiomatic truth. These seeds of truth can then be conveyed to the companion power of Binah for the sake of intellectual analysis and development.\n\nChokhmah is the primary (\"beginning\") force in the creative process, Creativity, as it is said: \"You have made them all with Chokhmah.\" (Psalms 104:24) The first word of the Torah in Genesis, \"Breishit\" means \"In the beginning (God created the heavens and the earth)\", is translated (Targum Yonatan) as \"With Chokhmah (God created…).\"\n\nChokhmah is also called Fear, 'because it has no measure of boundary, and therefore the mind does not have the power to grasp it'. The book of Job states 'Behold the fear of God is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding' (Job 28:28).\n\nIn the array of sefirot in three columns (\"gimel kavim\"), Chokmah is situated at the top of the right column, and corresponds to the right hemisphere of the brain. There are several aspects of Chokhmah:\n\nThe word Chokhmah itself may be broken into two words -- \"koach\" (\"potential\") and \"ma\" (\"what is\"). Thus, Chokhmah means \"the potential of what is\", or, \"the potential to be.\" This aspect of Chokhmah describes the state of Chokhmah in relation to the sefira of Keter. As Chokhmah emanates from Keter, the first dawning of the \"Infinite Light\", it \"appears\" in an obscure and undefined state that is a virtual non-being. Thus the verse states, \"and Chokhmah emerges from nothingness\" (Job 28:12, see Zohar II, 121a, Zohar III, 290a, commentaries). The light of the Ein Sof becomes unified in the world of \"Atziluth\" through clothing itself first in the sefira of Chokhmah. In the soul, Chokhmah is associated with the power of intuitive insight.\n\nIn the Zohar Chokhmah is the primordial point which shines forth from the will of God and thus, is the starting point of Creation. All things are still undifferentiated at this point and only become intelligible at Binah.\n\nAccording to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the name of God associated with Chokmah is Jehovah, the archangel that presides over it is Raziel, the order of angels that reside in it are the Ophanim (the wheels), the Heaven of Assiah associated with it is called Mazloth, implying the fulfillment of destiny, and the mundane chakra associated with it is the Zodiac.\n\nIn Aleister Crowley's \"Liber 777\", Chokhma is represented as The Four twos of the Tarot, Illuminating, Thoth, Vishnu, Joy, Odin, Uranus, Athena, God the Father, Man, Amaranth, Lingam, Hashish, Phosphorus, Musk, and Yang (not a complete list).\n\n\n\n"}

Only works of special importance have had concordances prepared for them, such as the Vedas, Bible, Qur'an or the works of Shakespeare, James Joyce or classical Latin and Greek authors, because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-computer era. \nA concordance is more than an index; additional material make producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers, such as commentary, definitions, and topical cross-indexing.\n\nIn the precomputing era, search technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for. Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as latent semantic indexing have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.\n\nA bilingual concordance is a concordance based on aligned parallel text.\n\nA topical concordance is a list of subjects that a book covers (usually The Bible), with the immediate context of the coverage of those subjects. Unlike a traditional concordance, the indexed word does not have to appear in the verse. The best-known topical concordance is Nave's Topical Bible.\n\nThe first Bible concordance was compiled for the Vulgate Bible by Hugh of St Cher (d.1262), who employed 500 monks to assist him. In 1448, Rabbi Mordecai Nathan completed a concordance to the Hebrew Bible. It took him ten years. A concordance to the Greek New Testament was published in 1599 by Henry Stephens, and the Septuagint was done a couple of years later by Conrad Kircher in 1602. The first concordance to the English Bible was published in 1550 by Mr Marbeck. According to Cruden, it did not employ the verse numbers devised by Robert Stephens in 1545, but \"the pretty large concordance\" of Mr Cotton did. Then followed Cruden's Concordance and Strong's Concordance.\n\nConcordances are frequently used in linguistics, when studying a text. For example:\n\nConcordancing techniques are widely used in national text corpora such as American National Corpus, British National Corpus, and Corpus of Contemporary American English available on-line. Stand-alone applications that employ concordancing techniques are known as concordancers or more advanced corpus managers. Some of them have integrated part-of-speech taggers and enable the user to create his/her own POS-annotated corpora to conduct various type of searches adopted in corpus linguistics.\n\nThe reconstruction of the text of some of the Dead Sea Scrolls involved a concordance.\n\nAccess to some of the scrolls was governed by a \"secrecy rule\" that allowed only the original International Team or their designates to view the original materials. After the death of Roland de Vaux in 1971, his successors repeatedly refused to even allow the publication of photographs to other scholars. This restriction was circumvented by Martin Abegg in 1991, who used a computer to \"invert\" a concordance of the missing documents made in the 1950s which had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team, to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original text of 17 of the documents. This was soon followed by the release of the original text of the scrolls.\n\n\n"}

Action in Contemplation is the concept of Darsanalaya Ashram. People from all walks, irrespective of caste, creed and faith are behind the functions of the Darsanalaya and the peaceful ambiance of Ashram. All those who visit Darsanalaya are well absorbed into this ambiance irrespective of age / health. Hope radiates in the gentle, calm and serene surroundings. Darsanalaya Ashram is committed to the Vision ‘With the People for Goodness’ and Mission to ‘Create Equality, Solidarity and Friendship among People’.\n\nSH Province has acquired about of land in 1996 to set up a mission (Catholic missions) centre at Chandpur Village of Faridabad District, Haryana. After six years of initiation, the centre has introduced a dynamic new approach to serve the people. Compassionate and friendly organizational skills of the missionaries well accepted by the people and Darsanalaya Ashram become an intimate centre for the local community. They have long years of reflection, meditation and knowledge of herbal treatment. They can easily adopt and practice social work, community development, a Students' Scholarship Program, an AIDS Awareness Campaign, yoga therapy, herbal treatment, etc.\n\nDarsanalaya Ashram started with the same spirit of Jesus Christ and Blessed Chavara. It is a place of silence and solitude. The Ashram vicinity is powered with spiritual vibrations. This is an Ashram where people can come from all lifestyles irrespective of caste and creed. It is an Indian Christian Ashram for the search and social reformation in collaboration with other religions and religious sects.\n\nDarsanalaya Ashram is located in a village area on the banks of the Yamuna River. It is in a village called Chandpur, at and about 20 km away from Faridabad city of Haryana state in India. It is bounded by the National Capital Territory of Delhi National Capital Territory of Delhi on its north, Gurgaon Gurgaon District on the west, and Uttar Pradesh Uttar Pradesh State on its east across the Yamuna River. There are around 27 villages around this ashram.\n\nThe village population consists of different castes and traditions. The main classes of people in this area are Jats, Rajputs, Brahmins, Ahirs, Banias, Harijans and Gujars. Almost all belong to agricultural communities. There are also categories like village artisans, craftsmen and certain other menials who helped in the agricultural operations. These included the village blacksmith, the carpenter, the oil man, the barber, the washer man, the village potter and some others.\n\nDarsanalaya keeps an atmosphere of silence in and around the ashram vicinity. The people who visit the ashram enjoy the simple vegetarian food and fresh air with yoga and meditation in the atmosphere of silence. The ashram has developed an idea of \"Garbhagraha Anubhava\" meditation (Womb Experience). Dr. Aji Sebastian the visionary and the Acharya (Director) of the Ashram were in silence for a year in Saccidananda Ashram, at Narsinghpur, M.P. state of India, for the experiment of \"Garbhagraha Anubhava\".\n\nIn this busy world, people are in stress and confusion and they always run here and there for solace. When a human being was in the womb of its mother, it was alone in its solitude. In this busy world, people forget the cause of their life, i.e. solitude and silence. Darsanalaya Ashram is a place to repose in the busy schedule of this world.\n\nAshram inmates observe and study the problems and issues of the world. The problems relate to children, women, rich and poor, healthy and weak, family and society; each individual in the community is responsible for the things that happen in the society.\n\nDarsanalaya promotes the eco-friendly life style and raises a voice against social evils like child labor, HIV/AIDS discrimination and its stigma, sex imbalance, abortion, women feticide, poverty, and sexual abuse, while trying to promote value-based education in rural and urban areas, religious harmony and ecumenical fellowship, creating equality, solidarity and friendship among people.\n\nDarsanalaya Ashram and its activities originate from the deeper levels of meditation in solitude and silence. The divine energy that proceeds from meditation moves to social activities. Many people from far and near are members of the Darsanalaya family, and behind the Darsanalaya Ashram's humanitarian and developmental activities. The vision of the ashram been fulfilled, ‘with the people for the goodness’.\n\nActivities of Darsanalaya Ashram are governed by the registered body of the Darsanalaya Society, which is a Charitable Society registered under the Societies Registration Act, XXI of 1860 (Reg. No. S-55211 of 2006) by the Darsanalaya Ashram with a view to plan, organize, unify and implement socio-economic, educational and healthcare activities of the Darsanalaya Ashram. The all-round welfare of those who depend on agriculture, the working class, the poor and the indigent, irrespective of caste, creed or religion is the goal of the society.\n\nThe society had registered for the smooth functions of the Darsanalaya Ashram's charitable and humanitarian activities. The society tries its best to collaborate with like-minded people in this field and cherish the activities of society by teamwork. Darsanalaya is associating with government and other local NGOs of the area for social enhancement. The society is involved in different types of awareness programs through art and media, especially on HIV/AIDS discrimination and its stigma, sex imbalance, abortion, women feticide, poverty, and sexual abuse, and trying to promote value based education in rural and urban areas, religious harmony etc. The society is involved in medical promotion through giving awareness training and treating people with different types of herbs. It is also involved in the construction of a new generation through classes, and academic support to children. It is actively involved in inter-religious and ecumenical programs.\n\nDarsanalaya Institute of Alternative Medicines and Research is an innovation of Darsanalaya Society and it is for promotion and research on herbal medicines. It has affiliated with the Indian Board of Alternative Medicines. As part of the propagation of healing power of herbal medicines, it arranges training programs in the Institute and in different states in association with local NGOs and government agencies.\n\nDarsana Arogalaya is a 15-bedded Arogalaya (hospital) where an herbal system of medicine (Sheethali Chikithsa) is practiced. People from different parts of the country and abroad visit the Arogalaya for treatment. It has consulting centers in different parts of the country.\n\nThe inspiration for Nava Darsan is from the words of APJ Abdul Kalam, former President of India.\n\n\"Dream, Dream, Dream\" \n\"Dreams transform into thoughts\"\n\"And thoughts result in action\" (Ignited Minds, P.1)\nThe idea of the Nava Darsan (New Vision), value-added education program originates from the group discussion of experts in the field of academics, social scientists, social workers, educators, artists, film directors, politicians and principals of CBSE schools. The discussion resulted in formulating the objectives for the Nava Darshan Education Program.\n\nThe aims and objectives of the Nava Darshan Education Program:\n\n\"• To promote value based classes.\n\"• To give clear cut sex education.\n\"• To find out the leadership qualities of the children.\n\"• To create a stage for interaction and to widen their world.\n\"• To create a sensitive generation for the future.\n\"• To shape the youngsters into persons with a strong character and outgoing personality.\n\"• To give dreams for the youngsters.\n\"• To find out the talents of students.\n\"• To provide counseling, yoga Training, and Meditation techniques to the children to reduce the stress and to increase the concentration and meaning in life.\n\"• To make a better rapport between the parents, teachers and children.\n\"• To conduct animation programs for teachers and parents through the schools.\"\n\nThere are thousands of schools in government and private sectors. Years of experience with the students and parents made a few issues clear, related to this field. Stress among the students, identity crisis, broken family relationships, emotionally imbalanced teachers, the aimless life etc. were a few burning issues of study findings.\n\nThe society sponsors over a hundred brilliant and poor children from the villages. It is not only to provide a little financial support, but to give formation to these children though seminars, talent shows, sports and games etc. Darsanalaya provides sponsorship to one hundred and thirty students for their studies from 13 schools around the Ashram. Nava Darshan aspirants have regular get-togethers, classes, seminars, sport and literary competitions etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "56133469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56133469", "title": "Dualism (Indian philosophy)", "text": "Dualism (Indian philosophy)\n\nDualism in Indian philosophy refers to the belief held by certain schools of Indian philosophy that reality is fundamentally composed of two parts. This mainly takes the form of either mind-matter dualism in Buddhist philosophy or consciousness-matter dualism in the Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy. These can be contrasted with mind-body dualism in Western philosophy of mind, but also have similarities with it.\n\nAnother form of dualism in Hindu philosophy is found in the Dvaita (\"dualism\") Vedanta school, which regards God and the world as two realities with distinct essences; this is a form of theistic dualism. By contrast, schools such as Advaita (\"nondualism\") Vedanta embrace absolute monism and regard dualism as an illusion (\"maya\").\n\nDuring the classical era of Buddhist philosophy in India, philosophers such as Dharmakirti argued for a dualism between states of consciousness and Buddhist atoms (the basic building blocks that make up reality), according to the \"standard interpretation\" of Dharmakirti's Buddhist metaphysics.\n\nWhile Western philosophical traditions, as exemplified by Descartes, equate mind with the conscious self and theorize on consciousness on the basis of mind/body dualism; some Eastern philosophies provide an alternate viewpoint, intimately related to substance dualism, by drawing a metaphysical line between consciousness and matter — where matter includes both body and mind.\n\nIn Samkhya and Yoga, two of the six orthodox (āstika) schools of Hindu philosophy, \"there are two irreducible, innate and independent realities: 1) consciousness itself (Purusha), and 2) primordial materiality (Prakriti)\". The unconscious primordial materiality, Prakriti, contains 23 components including intellect (buddhi, mahat), ego (ahamkara) and mind (manas). Therefore, the intellect, mind and ego are all seen as forms of unconscious matter. Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from Purusha. Consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or 'shapes' assumed by the mind. So intellect after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness creates thought structures that appear to be conscious. Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them. But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates.\n\nBy including mind in the realm of matter, Samkhya-Yoga avoids one of the most serious pitfalls of Cartesian dualism, the violation of physical conservation laws. Because mind is an evolute of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy and are therefore able to initiate bodily motions.\n\nThe Dvaita Vedanta school of Indian philosophy espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the more important reality is that of Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu or Brahman. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme Self, God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul (Jiva), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to Advaita Vedanta (monistic conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe. Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. Salvation therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2614324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2614324", "title": "Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law", "text": "Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law\n\nThe exhaustion doctrine, also referred to as the first sale doctrine, is a U.S. common law patent doctrine that limits the extent to which patent holders can control an individual article of a patented product after a so-called authorized sale. Under the doctrine, once an authorized sale of a patented article occurs, the patent holder's exclusive rights to control the use and sale of that article are said to be \"exhausted,\" and the purchaser is free to use or resell that article without further restraint from patent law. However, under the repair and reconstruction doctrine, the patent owner retains the right to exclude purchasers of the articles from making the patented invention anew (i.e., making another article), unless it is specifically authorized by the patentee to do so.\n\nProcedurally, the patent exhaustion doctrine operates as an affirmative defense, shielding authorized purchasers from infringement claims concerning the sale or use (including repair and modification) of a patented product after the patent owner authorized its sale.\n\nBecause only an \"authorized\" sale triggers the doctrine, it may be difficult or at least controversial to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine applies in a particular case: for example, when the patentee purports to restrict or condition the use or resale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user (post-sale restrictions); or when the patentee licenses another to manufacture and use or sell the patented product only in a particular field. The 2008 Supreme Court decision in \"Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.\", arguably leaves unclear the extent to which patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by means of so-called limited licenses (licenses limited to a specified field of use). Since its development by the courts in the late 19th century, the patent exhaustion doctrine has raised questions regarding the scope of exclusive rights granted by patents and the extent to which a patent owner may extend those rights to control downstream use and sales of patented articles.\n\nA patent gives the patent owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing into the U.S. the patented invention (i.e., a product embodying the invention) during the term of the patent. The constitutional rationale behind providing these exclusive rights is to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts\" by providing inventors the incentive to invest their time, labor, and funds in researching and developing innovative technology. Providing these protections, however, comes with social costs (monopoly rents) and limits the public's ability to freely alienate patented goods. Thus, public policy dictates that the patent owner's exclusive rights be limited in scope. Generally, when a patent owner receives compensation for the use of his or her invention through sale of a patented product, the purpose of patent law is fulfilled with respect to that product. Upon receiving compensation, the patent owner's rights to exclude others are exhausted and \"the patent law affords no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold.\" Accordingly, a patent owner's voluntary introduction of a patented product into commerce without restriction prevents the patent owner from exercising any claimed right to exclude others from using or reselling the sold product.\n\nUnlike the analogous first-sale doctrine in copyright, the patent exhaustion doctrine has not been codified into the patent statute, and is thus still a common law doctrine. It was first explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in 1873 in \"Adams v. Burke\". In that case, the patentee Adams assigned to another the right to make, use, and sell patented coffin lids only within a ten-mile radius of Boston. Burke (an undertaker), a customer of the assignee, bought the coffin lids from the manufacturer-assignee within the ten-mile radius, but later used (and effectively resold) the patented coffin lids outside of the ten-mile radius, in his trade in the course of burying a person. The patentee Adams sued the undertaker Burke for patent infringement, but the Supreme Court found no infringement liability: Once the coffin lids were lawfully made and sold, \"there is no restriction on their use to be implied for the benefit of the patentee or his assignees or licensees.\" Because the sale was authorized (bought from an authorized seller within the ten-mile radius), the defendant acquired the right to use the coffin lids free from any claim of the patentee, even though he carried it outside the ten-mile radius to use it.\n\nThe exhaustion doctrine is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder. Thus, there are circumstances where it may be difficult to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine is triggered, in light of restrictions that the patentee has purported to place on the sale or use of the patented invention. Two general questions arise in these situations: (1) Was the sale authorized by the patentee? This can often be a complex factual question. (2) Regardless of whether authorized by the patentee, are those restrictions valid and recognizable under the law?\n\nGenerally, these cases involve one or more of the following scenarios: the patent owner: (1) sells one or more components of a multi-component patented product; (2) licenses another to make and sell patented product with certain restrictions on field in which the sale may be made; or (3) sells the article with restrictions directly on the purchasers or end-users (post-sale restraint).\n\nOne scenario in which the exhaustion doctrine may or may not be triggered is when the patent holder sells an incomplete article or precursor or ingredient that does not directly practice or embody the patent in suit. In this situation, exhaustion is triggered by the authorized sale of the incomplete article if: (1) its \"only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent, and (2) it \"embodies essential features\" of the patented invention. Even if the exhaustion doctrine is applicable to the sale of an incomplete article, however, there is a separate analysis of whether the sale of that article was actually authorized, and therefore whether exhaustion was actually triggered.\n\nThe applicability of exhaustion to the sale of an incomplete article was recognized by the Supreme Court in 1942 in \"United States v. Univis Lens Co.\". In that case, the patent holder sold lens blanks which had to be ground into finished lenses — the patented invention. The Court held that this sale exhausted the patents on the finished lenses because the lens blanks substantially \"embodi[ed] essential features of the patented device and [were] without utility until . . . ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.\" The Court noted that the grinding process was standard (conventional) and not central to the patents, indicating further that the lens blanks constituted a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practiced the patent, since only conventional further processing steps were needed to complete the invention.\n\nIn \"Quanta\", the Supreme Court applied the same test to determine whether exhaustion is triggered by the licensing of a portfolio of product and method patents. In that case, the patent holder (LGE) authorized the licensee (Intel) by cross-license to manufacture and sell microprocessors and chipsets that (unless licensed) would infringe LGE product and method patents, as well as patents on computer systems containing the licensed microprocessors and chipsets. The Court found that, even though these Intel products did not directly practice the system patents, they sufficiently embodied the inventions of those patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable. First, the Court found that there was no reasonable use for the Intel products other than incorporating them into a computer system that practiced the LGE system patents. Second, the Intel products embodied essential features of the patented processes because the only necessary step to practice the patents was the addition of such standard computer parts as memories and buses. In addition, there was nothing inventive about the systems other than that they contained the inventive microprocessors and chipsets. Thus, under the \"Univis\" test, the Intel products sufficiently embodied the patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable.\n\nAnother scenario in which it may be difficult to determine if the sale of a patented article was authorized, and therefore if exhaustion is triggered, occurs when the patentee grants a license to make and sell with specific limitations on the field in which the seller may operate, such as sales to particular types of customer, specified territories, or other field-of-use limitations. If these limitations (or \"restrictions\") have been imposed, the licensee's sale to a purchaser exhausts only the patentee's rights to restrict use and resale when the restrictions have not been exceeded (\"violated\"). The theory is that if Alice owns Blackacre but not Whiteacre, she cannot convey good title to Bob by purporting to sell him Whiteacre. She can sell only what she owns. If the license limitations (\"restrictions\") are exceeded (\"violated\"), then exhaustion cannot occur and therefore is not triggered, and the patentee can successfully sue the licensee and any downstream customers for patent infringement.\n\nThe Supreme Court in \"General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.\" has specifically upheld the legitimacy of field-of-use limitations in patent licenses to manufacture patented products. A licensee who exceeds (\"violates\") a field-of-use limitation by selling an article outside of the permissible field commits patent infringement. The exhaustion doctrine would provide no protection because the \"violation\" makes the sale \"unauthorized\" for the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine.\n\nThe field-of-use limitations on sale (those imposed on the licensee in selling the patented articles) are different from post-sale restrictions or limitations (those that purpose to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user). Patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by imposing the former, but it is questionable that patentees can do so through the latter.\n\nLimitations on sale must very explicitly bind the licensee or seller. For example, in \"Quanta\", LGE licensed Intel to make products using LGE's patents. The license expressly stated that LGE was not licensing third parties to combine licensed products with any non-Intel products (i.e., microprocessors and chipsets purchased from a third party), and LGE required Intel to notify customers of that. Intel sold products to Quanta, who combined the Intel products with non-Intel products. LGE sued Quanta for patent infringement. The Supreme Court found that the licensing agreement failed to explicitly impose a field-of-use limitation, and therefore found that there were no conditions limiting to whom Intel could sell. The sale was thus \"authorized,\" and exhaustion was triggered. In the Court's words, \"The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the patents. No conditions limited Intel's authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. . . . Intel's authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta.\"\n\nBecause the contractual documents in the \"Quanta\" case were insufficiently explicit, the Court applied the exhaustion doctrine, finding the sale \"authorized\" and unconditional, even though LGE attempted to impose some restrictions on use of the products. Therefore, purchasers of the patented product were free to use them without restrictions that the patentee sought to have imposed on them. The Court found that the licensing agreement did not impose any limitations on whom the licensee could sell to. The \"Quanta\" Court did not address, however, whether the restriction in the licensing agreement could be enforced by contract. In fact, the Court pointedly said it was not addressing that issue.\n\nThe most difficult and unsettled area of the law regarding patent exhaustion involves cases in which a patentee purports to impose post-sale restrictions. Post-sale restrictions are those that purport to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user customer, rather than similar limitations on a manufacturer-licensee. Common post-sale restrictions include \"single use only\" and \"refill only with proprietary ink\" notices. Whether violations of such restrictions make a sale \"unauthorized,\" and therefore make patent exhaustion inapplicable, is still unclear or at least controversial.\n\nIn 1992, the Federal Circuit approved the use of post-sale restrictions in \"Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.\". Specifically, the court held that patent owners could condition the sale of patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the exception of such antitrust law violations as price-fixing and tie-in restrictions, or violations of \"some other law or policy.\" The plaintiff in the case owned a patent on a medical device, which it sold to hospitals with a \"single use only\" notice label. The defendant purchased the used devices from hospitals, refurbished them, and resold them to hospitals. The Federal Circuit held that the single-use restriction was enforceable in accordance with the 1926 \"General Electric\" case, because the restriction was \"reasonably within the patent grant. . . .\"\n\nThe Supreme Court did not discuss the \"Mallinckrodt\" case in \"Quanta\". As one commentator noted: \"The Supreme Court, in \"Quanta\", was widely expected to rule on whether \"Mallinckrodt\" was good law. But the Court sidestepped the issue by narrowly interpreting the license agreement so that it was not a conditional license. . . . Because the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue, it remains unclear to what extent a patentee can use a conditional license to impose restrictions on downstream purchasers.\"\n\nAt least two district courts have concluded that \"Mallinckrodt\" is no longer good law after \"Quanta\". In \"Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.\", the court concluded that the Supreme Court's \"Quanta\" decision implicitly overruled \"Mallinckrodt\". At issue in \"Static Control\" was Lexmark's so called \"prebate\" program, in which customers could buy cartridges that were subject to a single use for a 20 percent discounted price. In its original order, before \"Quanta\" was decided, the court rejected Static Control's argument that Lexmark's patent rights were exhausted as a result of the authorized sale of the cartridges. Relying heavily on \"Mallinckrodt\", the court found that the sales were valid post-sale restrictions that avoided exhaustion. After \"Quanta\" was decided, however, the court reversed its original order and concluded that Lexmark's single use restriction was not enforceable under patent law because the court was \"persuaded that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio.\" The court explained, \"The Supreme Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the \"Quanta\" holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on \"Mallinckrodt\" in reaching its decision in \"LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc.\", 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in \"Quanta\". It is also worth noting that the \"Quanta\" decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case.\"\n\nThe district court's conclusion, however, that \"Quanta\" overruled \"Mallinckrodt\" reflects the ambiguity in \"Quanta\" itself. The \"Static Control\" court noted that \"[s]ales of Lexmark Prebate cartridges were unconditional\" because \"[n]o potential buyer was required to agree to abide by the Prebate terms before purchasing a cartridge. Thus, sales of Lexmark's Prebate toner cartridges were authorized and unconditional, just like sales of LGE's patented products in \"Quanta\".\"\n\nTherefore, both \"Quanta\" and \"Static Control\" can be seen as either cautionary tales about failed attempts to comply with the General Talking Pictures doctrine or to explicitly condition sales, without need to rule on whether the post-sale restrictions were valid, or as overruling \"Mallinckrodt\"'s approval of post-sale restrictions. Which interpretation is correct remains to be seen. The Federal Circuit's decision in the \"en banc\" reargument of \"Lexmark Int'l v. Impression Prods.\" should provide a more definitive answer, subject of course to possible further review in the Supreme Court.\n\nAn emerging issue is whether U.S. patent exhaustion is international or strictly national. Until recently, or at least since the formation of the Federal Circuit in 1982 until recently, most U.S. courts simply assumed that a sale outside the United States, even if made by the U.S. patent owner or its parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, or by the U.S. patent owner's licensee, did not trigger the exhaustion doctrine within the United States. Usually, the basis for the assumption was (1) the Supreme Court allegedly so held in \"Boesch v. Graff\",; (2) a foreign patent is a different property right that is not the same as a corresponding U.S. patent because foreign patent law is different from U.S. patent law and gives different scope to such a foreign patent; and (3) many cases hold that U.S. patent law has no \"extraterritorial\" application.\n\nNone of these points is on firm, sound ground. In the \"Boesch\" case, a seller entirely unrelated to the U.S. patent owner made the sale in Germany; the German seller had a right to sell the product under German law because it had begun preparation to manufacture the product before the U.S. patent owner applied for its German patent. The U.S. company (the patentee) had no complicity in the sale and did not profit from it, and could not possible be accused of \"double dipping.\" This is quite unlike the usual U.S. situation, such as that in the \"Lexmark\" and \"Jazz\" cases, in which the U.S. patent owner was responsible for the foreign sale, and therefore profited from it. The \"Boesch\" case is therefore not a proper precedent to support the general international exhaustion situation.\n\nWhether foreign patents are comparable to U.S. patents is a factual issue that may differ from case to case, or nation to nation, and cannot be assumed one way or the other. Furthermore, 35 U.S.C. § 119(a), the U.S. patent statute governing when a U.S. patent can be based on a filing of a foreign patent application, provides that the U.S. patent and the corresponding foreign patent must be \"for the same invention.\" Therefore, there may be far more similarity than the cases assume.\n\nFinally, the statement that U.S. patent law is without extraterritorial application occurs universally in cases holding that liability for patent infringement under U.S. law should not be based on acts and conduct occurring outside the United States. And even that generality is suspect, for sometimes patent infringement liability in the United States is based on conduct outside the United States. Applying exhaustion on an international basis does not regulate acts and conduct performed outside the United States; it defines infringement remedies against importation into and sale in the United States on the basis of acts and conduct performed outside the United States.\n\nThe point is now pending decision in the Federal Circuit, because that court has ordered \"en banc\" rehearing on that issue in the \"Lexmark\" case. The reason that the issue has come to the fore is that the Supreme Court, in its recent copyright decision in \"Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\", held that a foreign sale authorized by the copyright owners exhausts U.S. copyright. The Supreme Court rested its decision mainly on common-law authority, quoting extensively from Coke's Institutes (Coke on Littleton), and saying that this stated the general rule from which any exception must be proved. Some have thought, therefore, that the same principle applies at least as forcefully in patent law as in copyright law, so that patent exhaustion should be international just as copyright exhaustion is.\n\nIn Europe and Japan, a regime of absolute or modified international exhaustion of patent rights is followed. Australia, New Zealand, and Norway also adopt international patent exhaustion.\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) explicitly leaves to each member state the freedom to address exhaustion of intellectual property. A World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report in 2010 provides a listing of various countries' statutory provisions on international exhaustion.\n\nAnother emerging issue under the exhaustion doctrine is what persons may assert the exhaustion doctrine as a defense to a claim of patent infringement. In most of the exhaustion cases discussed earlier in this article, the facts of the case follow what may be termed a \"straight line\" pattern: A patentee \"A\" (or its licensee) makes and sells a product \"a\" covered by patent \"P1\" to customer \"C\". \"C\" then does something with \"a\" that \"A\" has ordered (by some sort of agreement or putative agreement) \"C\" not to do. A patent infringement suit, \"A v. C\", follows. Diagrammatically, this fact pattern may be represented as:\n\" A → a (P1) → C \"\nNew information-technology inventions can lead to exhaustion suits following a different fact pattern, because of peculiarities of information technology and present U.S. patent law. An information-technology invention may involve several aspects each of which has a separate stakeholder. For example, a smartphone, TV set, or set-top box may be economically important to both equipment manufacturers and content providers, as well as the end user public (i.e., consumers). A license or sale to one stakeholder may or may not trigger the exhaustion doctrine with respect to conduct by another stakeholder, perhaps depending on how relevant business transactions are structured.\n\nUnder present U.S. patent law, a method claim of a patent is infringed only when a single actor performs each step of the claim. Similarly, induced infringement of a method claim has the same requirement. System claims raise more complicated issues. One can make the system only by placing each element into combination with the others, but it is possible to be liable for using a system invention merely by commercially exploiting the system. Therefore, when both the relevant equipment manufacturer and content provider utilize aspects of the invention in a method claim, whether infringement liability attaches to them may depend on both how the relevant claim is written and how licenses or sales are structured. This is illustrated in pending smartphone litigation, in which structure dictated the legal outcome.\n\nIn \"Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC v. New York Times Co.\", the Federal Circuit overturned a district court's summary dismissal on exhaustion grounds of a patent infringement suit against content providers. The invention concerns methods and systems for alerting smartphone users to content that may be of interest to them, for example, breaking news stories. The way the invention works is along these lines: A content provider such as the New York Times sends a text message to its online subscribers' smartphones. The message might consist of a headline and the lead to a story, together with a hyperlink to the story as stored in the online database of the New York Times. A subscriber interested in reading the story clicks on the link and thus causes the browser for the smartphone to retrieve and display the story.\n\nThe way the claims were drafted is very important to the outcome. There are two relevant types of claim, One set considers only smartphone manufacturers, and the claims describe only acts performed in the smartphone (receiving signals, clicking on hyperlinks, etc.). The other set of claims considers only acts that the content providers perform (sending the text message alert, storing the news story, sending it out over the Internet in response to a hyperlink click, etc.). Thus, it is possible to infringe one set of these single-actor claims without infringing the other.\n\nThe patentee licensed substantially all smartphone manufacturers in the United States under the first set of patents. It then sought to license content providers. When some content providers, including the New York Times, refused to take licenses under the second set of patents, claiming that under the exhaustion doctrine they needed no licenses, the patentee sued them. Instead of the \"straight line\" fact pattern described above for prior exhaustion cases, this case has a different, bi-directional pattern. Diagrammatically, the fact pattern of this type of case is as follows:\n\" P → lic (P1) → A, a \"\n\n\" A → a (P1) → C ← i (P2) ← B \"\nOn appeal from the district court's summary judgment ruling, the Federal Circuit held that the structure of the patent licensing arrangement avoided the exhaustion doctrine. The court ruled that the exhaustion doctrine may be asserted only by an \"authorized acquirer\" — one who purchases the patented article from the patentee or its authorized seller. The court further explained this, using slightly different terminology:\n\n[It is a] core notion that exhaustion lifts legal restrictions on an authorized acquirer. The doctrine has never applied unless, at a minimum, the patentee's allegations of infringement . . . entail infringement of the asserted claims by authorized acquirers . . . Here, as noted, that is not so, because infringement of the content claims has not been . . . shown to require that [the authorized] handset acquirers are practicing those claims.\n\nAs the patentee put it in its brief, and the court accepted, \"the exhaustion doctrine protects only the ability of a purchaser (or other lawful possessor) of an article to use and sell the article.\" The content providers were not parties to the transaction that triggered whatever exhaustion there was — that transaction was the sale of smartphones by manufacturers to consumers. The exhaustion doctrine exists to protect the interests of purchasers, not third parties. The patentee told the Federal Circuit, and it apparently agreed, that the exhaustion doctrine does not immunize the conduct of the content providers, \"regardless of the effect on the amount of licensed content available to their subscribers' handsets.\"\n\nMoreover, the patent claims licensed to the manufacturers (the \"P1\" of the diagram above) are not infringed by the conduct of the content providers accused of infringement. Their conduct infringes the \"P2\" patent claims that were not licensed to the manufacturers. The only sale in the case was by the licensed smartphone manufacturers to the consumer end users, and that sale exhausted only the \"P1\" claims. The Federal Circuit said exhaustion cannot occur as to unrelated patent claims. The court added that the content providers had not shown that the licensed \"P1\" claims embodied substantially the same invention as the \"P2\" patent claims under which the content providers were sued, so that the doctrine of the \"Univis\" and \"Quanta\" cases did not apply to expand the scope of the exhaustion.\n\nThere is another possible way to analyze cases of this type, but the parties did not raise it and the court did not address it. That would be to make an equitable estoppel analysis as to whether smartphone purchasers had reasonable expectations at the time of purchase and whether the result reached in the case unfairly and substantially derogated from the rights the purchasers expected to enjoy, as a result of conduct by the plaintiff. That is an approach similar to one of those that the House of Lords considered in the \"British Leyland\" case.\n\nOther countries recognize legal doctrines comparable to the exhaustion doctrine of U.S. patent law.\n\nIn \"Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc.\", the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the principle that sale of a patented article exhausts the patentee's right in that article. In the \"Eli Lilly\" case the Supreme Court also took the position that subsequent purchasers are not bound by any contractual limitations imposed by the patentee, unless they are brought to their attention at the time of sale: \"restrictive conditions imposed by a patentee on a purchaser or licensee do not run with the goods unless they are brought to the attention of the [subsequent] purchaser at the time of their acquisition.\" This principle appears to differ somewhat from U.S. patent law, in which bringing the restriction to the attention of the purchaser is generally immaterial.\n\nApproximately 60 percent of European patent litigation is in German courts. German law has long recognized the exhaustion doctrine. In the \"Fullplastverfahren\" case, the German Federal Supreme Court stated:\n\nThe doctrine [of exhaustion] finds its justification in the argument that the holder of the rights who puts into circulation the product produced under the application of the protected procedure has had the opportunity to avail himself of the advantages granted by the patent.\nA commentator asserts that the decision of the German Federal Supreme Court in the \"Brochure Rock\" case would require a contrary result as to the fact pattern of the U.S. \"Quanta\" case (discussed above). The sale of the chips would \"not\" exhaust the patent rights to the computer systems containing the chips, so that LG in that case would have been entitled to a further royalty payment from Quanta despite LG's license to the chip manufacturer Intel.\n\nA recent decision of the Düsseldorf District Court, however, perhaps points to greater similarity between German and U.S.; patent law. The case had facts almost identical to those of the \"Quanta\" case. The court held that the sale of the component did not exhaust the patent rights on the system because, among other things, the components sold by the suppliers did not make use of the teachings of the system patent.\n\nAs for using the doctrine of the U.S. \"Quanta\" case, the Düsseldorf District Court stated that the rationale for such an \"extended exhaustion doctrine\" could only be to prevent the patent owner from enjoying the advantages of the patent more than once, that is, \"double dipping\" or \"double charging.\" The court said that such a danger of double charging at different stages of the distribution chain and, thus, a rationale for an \"extended exhaustion doctrine,\" might exist if, in one and the same patent, there is a claim to the overall device and a claim to an individual component of the overall device. That was not the case here.\n\nA second basis for an \"extended exhaustion doctrine\" \"might\" exist if the overall device and its individual components are protected by different patents (as here), but only when the inventive concept of the two patents is the same and is substantially embodied in the component. But that was not true here, as it was in the \"Quanta\" case. This is the point of possible similarity to \"Quanta,\" but it is entirely in the form of \"obiter dicta\",\n\nThe court ruled that the fact that the component had no reasonable use except in making the patented system (which was so in the \"Quanta\" case) did not matter, because that raised an implied license issue rather than an exhaustion issue. The component manufacturer's license expressly disclaimed any such implied license as to the system (as in the \"Quanta\" case).\n\n"}
{"id": "1440536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1440536", "title": "Fact–value distinction", "text": "Fact–value distinction\n\nThe fact–value distinction is the distinction between things that can be known to be true and things that are the personal preferences of individuals.\n\nThe fact–value distinction emerged in philosophy in the Enlightenment. In particular, David Hume (1711–1776) argued that human beings are unable to ground normative arguments in positive arguments, that is, to derive \"ought\" from \"is\". Hume was a skeptic, and although a complex and dedicated philosopher, he shared a political viewpoint with early Enlightenment philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) and John Locke (1632–1704). Specifically, Hume, at least to some extent, argued that religious and national hostilities that divided European society were based on unfounded beliefs. In effect, Hume contended that such hostilities are not found in nature, but are a human creation, depending on a particular time and place, and thus unworthy of mortal conflict.\n\nThe fact–value distinction is closely related to the naturalistic fallacy, a topic debated in ethical and moral philosophy. G. E. Moore believed it essential to all ethical thinking. However, contemporary philosophers like Phillipa Foot have called into question the validity of such assumptions. Others, such as Ruth Anna Putnam, argue that even the most \"scientific\" of disciplines are affected by the \"values\" of those who research and practice the vocation. Nevertheless, the difference between the naturalistic fallacy and the fact–value distinction is derived from the manner in which modern social science has used the fact–value distinction, and not the strict naturalistic fallacy to articulate new fields of study and create academic disciplines.\n\nThe fact–value distinction is also closely related to the moralistic fallacy, an invalid inference of factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises. For example, an invalid inference \"Because everybody ought to be equal, there are no innate genetic differences between people\" is an instance of the moralistic fallacy. As for the naturalistic fallacy one attempts to move from an \"is\" to an \"ought\" statement, with the moralistic fallacy one attempts to move from an \"ought\" to an \"is\" statement.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" said that a table of values hangs above every great people. Nietzsche points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of \"esteeming\", of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to act on those values. The \"willing\" is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. \"A thousand goals have there been so far,\" says Zarathustra, \"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \"On The Thousand And One Goals.\" The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. Max Weber and Martin Heidegger absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical endeavor, as well as their political understanding.\n\nVirtually all modern philosophers affirm \"some\" sort of fact–value distinction, insofar as they distinguish between science and \"valued\" disciplines such as ethics, aesthetics, or the fine arts. However, philosophers such as Hilary Putnam argue that the distinction between fact and value is not as absolute as Hume envisioned. Philosophical pragmatists, for instance, believe that true propositions are those that are \"useful\" or \"effective\" in predicting future (empirical) states of affairs. Far from being value-free, the pragmatists' conception of truth or facts directly relates to an end (namely, empirical predictability) that human beings regard as \"normatively\" desirable. Other thinkers reject an absolutist fact–value distinction by contending that our senses are imbued with prior conceptualizations, making it impossible to have any observation that is totally value-free, which is how Hume and the later positivists conceived of facts.\n\nSeveral counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an evaluative statement does indeed logically follow from a factual statement. A. N. Prior points out, from the statement \"He is a sea captain,\" it logically follows, \"He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do.\" Alasdair MacIntyre points out, from the statement \"This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably,\" the evaluative conclusion validly follows, \"This is a bad watch.\" John Searle points out, from the statement \"Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars,\" it logically follows that \"Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars.\" The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.\n\nPhilippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a \"committal in a new dimension\". She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word \"injury\". Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?\n\nFoot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.\n\n"}
{"id": "885667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=885667", "title": "Gilbert de la Porrée", "text": "Gilbert de la Porrée\n\nGilbert de la Porrée (after 1085 – 4 September 1154), also known as Gilbert of Poitiers, Gilbertus Porretanus or Pictaviensis, was a scholastic logician and theologian.\n\nHe was born in Poitiers, and completed his first studies there. He was then educated at Chartres under Bernard of Chartres, where he learned the differences between Aristotle and Plato and later at Laon under Anselm of Laon and Ralph of Laon, where he studied biblical scriptures. After his education, he returned to Poitiers, where its believed he taught. He then returned to Chartres to teach logic and theology and took over Chancellor after Bernard from 1126-1140. It is in Paris where we also know he gave lectures. From a passage from the text, Dialogue with Ratius and Everard, by the Cistercian Everardus, we learn that Gilbert was more popular in Paris than in Chartres. Everardus writes that he was fourth to attend Gilberts lectures in Chartres and three hundredth to attend in Paris. In Paris, John of Salisbury attended Gilbert's lectures in 1141 and was greatly influenced by them. John of Salisbury would later become chancellor of Chartres and also wrote over Gilbert saying: He taught grammar and theology, would whip a student who made a grammatical error, if he believed a student was wasting time in class he would suggest they take up bread making, and last when he lectured he used philosophers, orators and as well as poets to help interpret.\n\nSometime in the 1140s, Gilbert published his Commentary on Boethius's, Opuscula Sacra. Although intended as an explanation of what Boethius meant, it interpreted the Holy Trinity in such a way that it went against the teachings of the church. In 1142, Gilbert became Bishop of Poitiers, and within the same year two archdeacons, Arnaud and Calon, denounced Gilbert for his ideas on the Trinity. It was also in 1142 when Gilbert's teaching position was taken over in Chartres. By 1147, in Paris, Peter Lombard attacked Gilbert for his trinitarian beliefs. In 1148, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, known as the great detector of heresies, brought Gilbert to trial. Saint Bernard had previous reasons to believe Gilbert was a heretic because when Abelard was tried and condemned, the school of Chartres}--where Gilbert was chancellor at that moment—backed Abelard. Pope Eugene III presided over the trial. During the trial, Gilbert and Bernard were asked to recite and speak of specific biblical scriptures. Bernard, being nowhere near as well versed as Gilbert, was not able to condemn him. It was decided however that in order to make the church happy, Gilbert had to change parts of his book that were not in accordance with the official position on faith. Gilbert died in 1154.\n\n\n\nGilbert is almost the only logician of the 12th century who is quoted by the greater scholastics of the succeeding age. The \"Liber sex principiorum\", attributed to him, but of an anonymous author, was regarded with a reverence almost equal to that paid to Aristotle, and furnished matter for numerous commentators, amongst them Albertus Magnus. Owing to the fame of this work, he is mentioned by Dante as the \"Magister sex principiorum\". The treatise itself is a discussion of the Aristotelian categories, specially of the six subordinate modes.\nThe author distinguishes in the ten categories two classes, one essential, the other derivative. Essential or inhering (formae inhaerentes) in the objects themselves are only substance, quantity, quality and relation in the stricter sense of that term. The remaining six, when, where, action, passion, position and habit, are relative and subordinate (formae assistantes). This suggestion has some interest, but is of no great value, either in logic or in the theory of knowledge. More important in the history of scholasticism are the theological consequences to which Gilbert's realism led him.\n\nIn the commentary on the treatise \"De Trinitate\" of Boethius he proceeds from the metaphysical notion that pure or abstract being is prior in nature to that which is. This pure being is God, and must be distinguished from the triune God as known to us. God is incomprehensible, and the categories cannot be applied to determine his existence. In God there is no distinction or difference, whereas in all substances or things there is duality, arising from the element of matter. Between pure being and substances stand the ideas or forms, which subsist, though they are not substances. These forms, when materialized, are called \"formae substantiales\" or \"formae nativae\"; they are the essences of things, and in themselves have no relation to the accidents of things. Things are temporal, the ideas perpetual, God eternal. The pure form of existence, that by which God is God, must be distinguished from the three persons who are God by participation in this form. The form or essence is one, the persons or substances three. This distinction clearly goes against the church's tenet of divine simplicity. It was this distinction between \"Deitas\" or \"Divinitas\" and \"Deus\" that led to the condemnation of Gilbert's doctrine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1892836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892836", "title": "Hayashi Razan", "text": "Hayashi Razan\n\n, also known as Hayashi Dōshun, was a Japanese Neo-Confucian philosopher, serving as a tutor and an advisor to the first four \"shōguns\" of the Tokugawa \"bakufu\". He is also attributed with first listing the Three Views of Japan. Razan was the founder of the Hayashi clan of Confucian scholars.\n\nRazan was an influential scholar, teacher and administrator. Together with his sons and grandsons, he is credited with establishing the official neo-Confucian doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate. Razan's emphasis on the values inherent in a static conservative perspective provided the intellectual underpinnings for the Edo bakufu. Razan also reinterpreted Shinto, and thus created a foundation for the eventual development of Confucianised Shinto in the 20th century.\n\nThe intellectual foundation of Razan's life's work was based on early studies with Fujiwara Seika (1561–1619), the first Japanese scholar who is known for a close study of Confucius and the Confucian commentators. This \"kuge\" noble had become a Buddhist priest; but Seika's dissatisfaction with the philosophy and doctrines of Buddhism led him to a study of Confucianism. In due course, Seika drew other similarly motivated scholars to join him in studies which were greatly influenced by the work of Chinese Neo-Confucianist Zhu Xi, a Sung-dynasty savant. Zhu Xi and Seika emphasized the role of the individual as a functionary of a society which naturally settles into a certain hierarchical form. He separated people into four distinct classes: samurai (ruling class), farmers, artisans and merchants.\n\nRazan developed a practical blending of Shinto and Confucian beliefs and practices. In particular, he argued that Shinto was a provisional and local form of Confucian ideas, enabling a Confucian interpretation of Shinto shrine rituals. This coherent construct of inter-related ideas lent themselves to a well-accepted program of samurai and bureaucrat educational, training and testing protocols. In 1607, Hayashi was accepted as a political adviser to the second \"shōgun\", Tokugawa Hidetada.\n\nRazan became the rector of Edo's Confucian Academy, the Shōhei-kō (afterwards known at the Yushima Seidō) which was built on land provided by the \"shōgun\". This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the Tokugawa shogunate. Razan had the honorific title \"Daigaku-no-kami,\" which became hereditary in his family. It also happened that the position as head of the Seidō became hereditary in the Hayashi family. \"Daigaku-no-kami\", in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as \"Head of the State University.\n\nIn the elevated context his father engendered, Hayashi Gahō (formerly Harukatsu), worked on editing a chronicle of Japanese emperors compiled in conformance with his father's principles. \"Nihon Ōdai Ichiran\" grew into a seven-volume text which was completed in 1650. Gahō himself was accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period; but the Hayashi and the Shōhei-kō links to the work's circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity. Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this summary drawn from historical records.\n\nThe narrative of \"Nihon Ōdai Ichiran\" stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime. Gahō's text did not continue up through his present day; but rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler. This book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, \"perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials\".\n\nRazan's successor as the Tokugawa's chief scholar was his third son, Gahō. After Razan's death, Gahō finished work his father had begun, including a number of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history. In 1670, the Hayashi family's scholarly reputation was burnished when Gahō published the 310 volumes of \"The Comprehensive History of Japan\" (本朝通鑑, \"Honchō-tsugan\").\n\nRazan's writings were compiled, edited and posthumously published by Hayashi Gahō and his younger brother, Hayashi Dokkōsai (formerly Morikatsu):\n\nRazan's grandson, Hayashi Hōkō (formerly Nobuatsu) would head the Yushima Seidō and he would bear the inherited title \"Daigaku-no kami\". Hōkō's progeny would continue the work begun in the 18th century by the scholarly Hayashi patriarch.\n\nAs a political theorist, Hayashi lived to witness his philosophical and pragmatic reasoning become a foundation for the dominant ideology of the \"bakufu\". The political dominance of Hayashi's ideas lasted until the end of the 18th century. This evolution developed in part from Razan's equating samurai with the cultured governing class. Razan helped to legitimize the role of the militaristic \"bakufu\" at the beginning of its existence. His philosophy moreover encouraged the samurai class to cultivate themselves, a trend which became increasingly widespread over the course of his lifetime and after his death. Razan's aphorism encapsulates this view:\nHayashi Razan and his family played a significant role is helping to crystallize the theoretical underpinnings of the Tokugawa regime.\n\nIn January 1858, Hayashi Akira, the hereditary \"Daigaku-no-kami\" descendant of Hayashi Razan, headed the bakufu delegation that sought advice from the emperor in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers. This was the first time the Emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. The most obvious consequence of this transitional overture was the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade. In the 19th century, this scholar-bureaucrat found himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change, moving arguably \"by the book\" through uncharted waters with Razan's well-settled theories as the only guide.\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Harvard University in 1854, then studied in Germany. After returning to the United States, he was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1859, but his growing deafness interfered with the practice of law.\n\nIn 1860, he joined the Shakspere Society of Philadelphia, an amateur study group that took its scholarship seriously. As he later wrote:\n\n\"Every member had a copy of the Variorum of 1821, which we fondly believed had gathered under each play all Shakespearian lore worth preserving down to that date. What had been added since that year was scattered in many different editions, and in numberless volumes dispersed over the whole domain of literature. To gather these stray items of criticism was real toil, real but necessary if we did not wish our labour over the text to be in vain.\"\n\nAs editor of the \"New Variorum\" editions of Shakespeare—also called the \"Furness Variorum\"—he collected in a single source 300 years of references, antecedent works, influences and commentaries. He devoted more than forty years to the series, completing the annotation of sixteen plays. His son, Horace Howard Furness, Jr. (1865–1930), joined as co-editor of the Variorum's later volumes, and continued the project after the father's death, annotating three additional plays and revising two others.\n\nHe was a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, a long-serving trustee (1880–1904), and chairman of the building committee for its library. Designed by his brother Frank, Horace selected the Shakepearean quotes for the 1891 building's leaded glass windows. He was the advisor for doctoral student Emily Jordan Folger who, with her husband Henry Clay Folger, would co-found the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC. \n\nAn 1890 review in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" may indicate the esteem in which British critics held Furness's scholarship:\n\n\"In what is called 'The Variorum Edition of Shakespeare,' America has the honor of having produced the very best and most complete edition, so far as it has gone, of our great national poet. For text, illustration (happily, not pictorial), commentary and criticism, it leaves nothing to be desired. The editor combines with the patience and accuracy of the textural scholar, an industry which has overlooked nothing of value that has been written about Shakespeare by the best German and French, as well as English commentators and critics; and what is of no less moment he possesses in himself a rare delicacy of literary appreciation and breadth of judgment, disciplined by familiarity with all that is best in the literature of antiquity as well as of modern times, which he brings to bear on his notes with great effect.\"\n\nMany of these publications went through a number of 'editions' (or perhaps reprints): this list attempts to detail the last online edition available.\n\n\nThe Modern Language Association of America continues the \"New Variorum\" project with the goal of definitively annotating all 38 of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n\nIn 1860 he married Helen Kate Rogers (1837–1883), sister of Fairman Rogers and heir to an ironmaking fortune. She compiled a concordance to Shakespeare's poems, published in 1874. They had four children: \n\nFurness was elected to membership in the American Philosophical Society on April 16, 1880. He was the recipient of honorary degrees from Harvard University, University of Halle, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, and University of Cambridge. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1905.\n\n\n\n"}

The philosophical system developed by J.C. Baudet is known as editology.\n\nScience-Technics-Industry (STI) is a philosophical concept proposed by the Belgian philosopher Jean C. Baudet. The objective of STI is to distinguish the rational cultural productions from the emotional or imaginary ones. Emotional and imaginary cultural productions lead to ideologies and/or ethical and politically illusive constructions. STI is a key-concept in editology. It may be seen as an elaborate philosophical generalization of the economical notion of \"science and industry\". In the STI, technics are the interface between science and industry, and thus between knowledge (truth) and practice (efficiency).\n\nEditology (in French: \"éditologie\") is the epistemological system developed by Baudet. The main characteristic of the editology is to define the knowledge as a set of texts, discourses (and thus \"terms\"), and to assign the scientificity of those texts to the very conditions of their edition - the manner they are accepted by the international scientific community. It has two purposes: understand the terms (terminology) and analyze the edition (editology \"sensu stricto\").\n\nThis philosophical approach leads to a conception of the knowledge (an truth) which admits that the hard core of rationalism (logic) is the epistemological complex STI (Science-Technics-Industry). An important consequence of the editological thought is to establish an historical critic of the successive discourses which characterize the milestones of the human thinking: literature, religion, and later philosophy. In that sense, the philosophy is defined as a discourse rejecting all the discourses.\n\n\n"}

He was the fourth child, but the eldest son, and he had nine brothers and sisters. He was only twelve when he entered the University of Glasgow, and continued to attend various classes for six years, mostly under Professor George Jardine, with whose family he lived. During this period Wilson excelled in sport as well as academic subjects, and fell in love with Margaret Fletcher, who was the object of his affections for several years. Fellow student Alexander Blair became a very close friend.\n\nIn 1803 Wilson was entered as a gentleman commoner at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was inspired by Oxford, and in much of his later work, notably in the essay called \"Old North and Young North\", he expresses his love for it. But his Magdalen days were not altogether happy, though he obtained a brilliant first class degree. His love affairs did not go happily, his \"Margaret\" eloped to New York with his younger brother, Charles and he made no close friends at his own college and few in the university. He took his degree in 1807, and at twenty-two was his own master, with a good income, no guardian to control him, and no need to work for a living. Instead, his occupation was an estate on Windermere called Elleray, ever since connected with his name. Here he built, boated, wrestled, shot, fished, walked and amused himself for four years, besides composing or collecting from previous compositions a considerable volume of poems, published in 1812 as \"The Isle of Palms\". He became intimate with William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey and Thomas de Quincey.\nIn 1811 he married Jane Penny, daughter of the Liverpool merchant and slave trader James Penny, and they were happy for four years, until the event which made a working man of letters of Wilson, and without which he would probably have produced a few volumes of verse and nothing more. Most of his fortune was lost by the dishonest speculation of an uncle, in whose hands Wilson had carelessly left it. His mother had a house in Edinburgh, in which she was able and willing to receive her son and his family; he was not forced to give up Elleray, though he was no longer able to live there.\nHe read law and was elected to the Faculty of Advocates in 1815, still with many outside interests, and in 1816 produced a second volume of poems, \"The City of the Plague\". In 1817, soon after the founding of \"Blackwood's Magazine\", Wilson began his connection with the Tory monthly and in October 1817 he joined with John Gibson Lockhart in the October number working up James Hogg's MS a satire called the \"Chaldee Manuscript\", in the form of biblical parody, on the rival \"Edinburgh Review\", its publisher and his contributors. He became the principal writer for \"Blackwood's\", though never its nominal editor, the publisher retaining supervision even over Lockhart's and \"Christopher North's\" contributions, which were the making of the magazine.\n\nIn 1822 began the series of \"Noctes Ambrosianae\", after 1825 mostly Wilson's work. These are discussions in the form of convivial table-talk, including wonderfully various digressions of criticism, description and miscellaneous writing. There was much ephemeral, a certain amount purely local, and something occasionally trivial in them. But their dramatic force, their incessant flashes of happy thought and happy expression, their almost incomparable fulness of life, and their magnificent humour give them all but the highest place among genial and recreative literature. \"The Ettrick Shepherd,\" an idealised portrait of James Hogg, one of the talkers, is a most delightful creation. Before this, Wilson had contributed to \"Blackwood's\" prose tales and sketches, and novels, some of which were afterwards published separately in Lights and \"Shadows of Scottish Life\" (1822), \"The Trials of Margaret Lyndsay\" (1823) and \"The Foresters\" (1825); later appeared essays on Edmund Spenser, Homer and all sorts of modern subjects and authors.\nWilson left his mother's house and established himself (1819) in Ann Street, Edinburgh, with his wife and five children. His election to the chair of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh (1820) was unexpected, and the best qualified man in the United Kingdom, Sir William Hamilton, was also a candidate. But the matter was made a political one; the Tories still had a majority in the burgh council; Wilson was powerfully backed by friends, Sir Walter Scott at their head; and his adversaries played into his hands by attacking his moral character, which was not open to any fair reproach.\n\nWilson made a very excellent professor, never perhaps attaining to any great scientific knowledge in his subject or power of expounding it, but acting on generation after generation of students with a stimulating force that is far more valuable than the most exhaustive knowledge of a particular topic.\n\nHis duties left him plenty of time for magazine work, and for many years his contributions to Blackwood were voluminous, in one year (1834) amounting to over fifty separate articles. Most of the best and best known of them appeared between 1825 and 1835.\n\nIn his last thirty years, he oscillated between Edinburgh and Elleray, with excursions and summer residences elsewhere, a sea trip on board the Experimental Squadron in the English Channel during the summer of 1832, and a few other unimportant diversions. The death of his wife in 1837 was an exceedingly severe blow to him, especially as it followed within three years that of his friend Blackwood.\n\nJohn Wilson died at home in Gloucester Place in Edinburgh.\n\nHe is buried beneath a large red granite obelisk of simple design on the southern side of Dean Cemetery.\n\nIn 1865 a statue by Sir John Steell was erected to his memory in Princes Street Gardens. The bronze figure stands on a substantial stone pedestal and is located between the Royal Scottish Academy and the Scott Monument.\n\nA scene from his play \"A City of Plague\" was adapted by Alexander Pushkin as \"A Feast in Time of Plague\" and become a subject of a number of adaptations, including operas and a TV movie \"Little Tragedies\" (featuring Ivan Lapikov as The Priest).\n\nHis brother James Wilson (1795–1856), was known as a zoölogist.\n\nOn 11 May 1811 Wilson married Jane Penny, the daughter of a Liverpool merchant and \"the leading belle of the lake country\". They had children.\n\nWilson left two sons, John and Blair, one a clergyman of the church of England, the other for a time secretary to the university of Edinburgh;vand had three daughters:\n\nHe was cousin to Very Rev Matthew Leishman and they lived side by side during their childhood in Paisley. Wilson was also the great great great uncle of Ludovic Kennedy.\n\nPublications include the \"Works\" of John Wilson, edited by P. J.

The only son of simple country people, he was a delicate child and received no regular schooling, but read the books belonging to his father again and again, so that, when only twelve years old, he had read the entire Holy Scripture several times. Religiously inclined from childhood, he early desired to enter the clerical state, and after many entreaties his parents permitted him to begin his studies at the abbey school of Einsiedeln. When the storms of the French Revolution crossed the Rhine, Abbot Beatus, the religious, and students, in May, 1798, went to the Abbey of St. Gerold, and at the end of the year Gügler was sent to Petershausen, near Constance. In 1800 he continued his classical course at Solothurn. In 1801 he began philosophy, which he finished with great credit at Lucerne according to Immanuel Kant and Jacobi. Even as a student he showed those opposite traits of character, for which he was noted all through life: a courage ready to overcome any obstacles and fearing no consequences in the defence of right, with at the same time an unobtrusive, almost shrinking nature; a very comprehensive knowledge of men and affairs together with a dread of showing it. During this period he became acquainted with Joseph Widmer, a fellow-student, the acquaintance ripening into a lifelong friendship. Through the influence of Widmer, Gügler, who had become undecided as to his future career, took up the study of theology, which both pursued at Landshut under Sailer and Zimmer. Shortly before his ordination to the priesthood he was appointed professor of exegesis at the lyceum in Lucerne. After he had received Holy orders, 9 March 1805, at the hands of Testa Ferrata, the papal legate, he was made a canon of the collegiate church of St. Leodegar (Saint-Léger), retaining his position as professor of exegesis. Later he also taught pastoral theology, and 1822-24 acted as prefect of the lyceum. \n\nGügler and Widmer, who had also been made a professor at Lucerne, put new life into the study of the Scriptures, theology, and cognate branches. Students were encouraged to drop antiquated notions, to think and investigate for themselves, to gain solid knowledge, and to avoid superficiality. The methods of the new teachers brought them into conflict, as well with the supporters of the old school, as with the followers of Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg and the \"Illuminati\" of Switzerland who accused the professors of unchristian mysticism. A controversy followed between Gügler and Thaddæus Müller, city pastor of Lucerne, during which appeared, among other writings, Gügler's \"Geist des Christentums und der Literatur im Verhältniss zu den Thaddæus Müllerschen Schriften\". Müller made a formal demand to the municipal authorities for the removal of Gügler from the professorship, which was decreed 12 Dec., 1810. Immediately Widmer handed in his resignation, a large number of students threatened to leave, and even the majority of citizens sided with Gügler. Müller saw his mistake, and, at his special request Gügler was reinstated 23 Jan., 1811. Gügler had also a dispute with Marcus Lutz, pastor at Leufelfingen, and issued the sarcastic pamphlet \"Chemische Analyse und Synthese des Marcus Lutz zu Leufelfingen\" (1816). Another controversy was with Troxler, who later became known as a philosopher. Gügler devoted his time chiefly to teaching and to literary work, but he frequently preached, and he wrote a poem for the twenty-fifth anniversary of Sailer's ordination. To his scholars he was a true friend, adviser, and consoler. Perhaps the last literary work of Gügler was a protest against the admission of non-Catholics to the Canton of Lucerne, as he wished to preserve for the people the inestimable boon of unity in faith. He died at Lucerne. His career, though short, was a source of great blessing to his country. Sketches of his life were written by Widmer and Geiger, and his biography was prepared by Joseph L. Schiffmann, \"Lebensgeschichte des Chorherrn und Professors Aloys Gügler\" (Augsburg, 1833); a lengthy article on Gügler and his exegetical works appeared in the \"Katholik\" (1829), XXXIV, 53, 196. \n\nHis principal work is: \"Die hl. Kunst oder die Kunst der Hebräer\" (1814, 1817, 1818), 3 vols. It is a philosophical exposition of Old Testament Revelation undertaken by a mind which gives full credence to the truth of Revelation, and under the veil of the letter sees hidden treasures of wonderful wisdom which it considers the highest achievement of human investigation to find and give to the world. In 1819 Widmer published the continuation of this work in relation to the New Testament: \"Ziffern der Sphinx oder Typen der Zeit und ihr Deuten auf die Zukunft\" (Solothurn, 1819). This wishes to show the divine order of current events which are presented in grand pictures and prophetic visions. A periodical founded by Gügler in 1823, \"Zeichen der Zeit im Guten und Bösen\", was continued by Dr. Segesser. Among Gügler's published works is a volume entitled \"Privatvorträge\", lectures on the Gospel of St. John, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Christian doctrine of St. Augustine, together with a brief sketch of the sacred books of the Old Testament (Sarmenstorf, 1842). His posthumous works were edited by Widmer between 1828 and 1842. A complete list of all his printed works is given in the \"Thesaurus librorum rei catholicæ\" (Würzburg, 1856), I, 337. \n"}

His father, Shaikh Abdul Latif Siddiqi, was a descendant of first Rashidun Caliph Abu Bakr. Their forefathers had moved to Sindh in Abbasid era.\n\nShaikh Abdul Latif was follower of the Naqshbandi sufi sect so Muhammad Zaman learned Quran and Sufi teachings from his father. Then he was sent to Thatta to study further in the Madrassa of Shaikh Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi who was a follower of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. During this time he met Khawaja Abul Masakin, who was a sufi saint and a follower of the Sirhandi saints, and left the madrassa of Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi to start sufi training under Abul Masakin from whom he later earneded the title of Sultan Al Aoliya (Master of Sufis). After some time Abul Masakin appointed him his successor and himself went to Mecca for Hajj where he died shortly afterwards. Muhammad Zaman then started preaching sufism, training people in the path of divine love. By this time he was a complete Sheikh. Later, Muhammad Zaman moved to his home town Luari and continued his preachings, where he attracted masses of people around him.\n\nShah Abdul Latif Bhittai, a sufi poet himself, once came to Luari to meet Muhammad Zaman. After the meeting Latif is said to have repeatedly recited this verse in praise of Muhammad Zaman:\nHe died on January 6, 1775 AD (Dhul-Qadh 4, 1188 AH), and his tomb is in Luari, Sindh.\n\nMuhammad Zaman was also a sufi poet. Though he is said to have said hundreds of poems but only 85 have been available in written form. A collection of these poems is \"Abyat Sindhi\" (Sindhi poems). Shaikh Abdul Rahim Garhori, one of his disciples, has written a comprehensive commentary and explanation of these poems, called \"Sharah Abyat Sindhi\". They reflect deep mysteries of sufism and general common sense. Though he was a Naqshbandi and all Naqshbandi sufis follow Wahdat-ash-Shuhūd he seems to have merged Wahdat-ash-Shuhūd and Wahdat-al-Wujūd in his poerty. He says:\nThis implies that claim of Mansoor \"Ana-al-Haqq\" (I am God : Haqq is a name of God in Islam) was not pointless as he had discovered the fact that his existence and that of universe was nothing but the manifestation of God's attributes, as yarn is nothing but cotton, therefore Mansoor should not be killed. At some other point he says in favour of Shuhūd:\nMeans waves have no real existence of their own and are merely movement in water, in the same way, while the universe does not have its own existence, it is not the same as God. But generally it is considered that he was neither on side of Wahdat-al-Shuhūd completely nor in complete favour of Wahdat-al-Wujūd, instead he combined both ideologies to show that the differences in between them were merely of words and not real.\n\n"}

Since his new public appearance in June 2015 in London[5], Marc Jean-Bernard returned successfully to the concert halls in Europe and South America, as a conductor, soloist and a lecturer in the frame of Concert-Lectures.\n\nHaving been also trained with American composers and virtuosos, his strong interest and competencies in South American Music, Literature and Culture led him to investigate in a Wittgenstein's way -and interpret as well- narrative and mythical dimensions of Latin American Music. His life took on a Latin-American flavor with a move to Colombia, where he combined the teaching of \"Philosophy of Language\" at the Public University with the post of Dean of the Music Faculty at a leading Conservatory. Until 2004, Marc Jean-Bernard's professional life was divided between the worlds of philosophy and music. In that year, a third world was added to them with his nomination as ad honorem Consul of France in Puerto Rico. \nCurrently, Professor of Humanities at the University of Puerto Rico, he maintains his interests in the Culture Theory and the \"Philosophy of the Arts\", the subjects of many essays and papers in French, English, and Spanish. He also pursues his musical activities, some of which have been recorded on French labels. He is also active in his consular mission, which is particularly involved in the development of European Studies, through bilateral agreements with overseas universities. Since 2009, Dr. Marc Jean-Bernard is the Director of an International Studies Program at the University of Puerto Rico. His current investigations and publications on this subject are dedicated to the dialogue between Europe and America, with a topical emphasis on Latin America from a perspective articulating International Relations and Culture. Dr. Marc Jean-Bernard published in 2012 an extent essay: \"Tractatus Musico Philosophicus, I. Filosofía y Estética Musical\", Ed. Posdata, 522 p. He is preparing a French, Spanish and English full publication of his Essays. His extensive research on the theory of diplomatic dialogue conducted him to privilege the diplomacy of Charles de Gaulle in several articles and a new essay on de Gaulle's foreign policy and diplomacy, to be issued in French, English, and Spanish. The French original version of this new philosophical essay, the first volume of an extent \"Phenomenology of Dialogue\", has been published in September 2018: \"Phénoménologie du dialogue, I.-Charles de Gaulle,une pensée diplomatique en acte. Amérique Latine.\" /\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Jean-Bernard has been elected Dean of the Consular Corps of Puerto Rico.\n\nIn July 2014, Dr. Jean-Bernard founded the first 'Institute of International Relations of Puerto Rico' (Non-Profit Corporation), a think tank dedicated to the offering, far from the ideologies, independent scientific and specialized contributions to concrete governance, democracy, and peace. http://iripr.weebly.com\n\nHe has been elected member of the \"Academy of the Arts and Sciences\" of Puerto Rico, between other academical and official distinctions.\n\nMarc Jean-Bernard's Philosophy could be accurately described as a musico-philosophical investigation of \"understanding\" and \"interpreting\", following the tradition of thinkers such as Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein, Ernst Bloch, Adorno and Jankélévitch. Such a philosophical perspective assume -after Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein-, that the blurring of the original unity between Philosophy and Music has to be rethought and overcome. This assumption, equally relevant for the Indo- Iranian, Japanese and Chinese cosmologies, is grounded, in western culture, on the constructive acknowledgment of the internal relation between the general theory of \"Lógos\", and the theory of \"αρμονια\" for which the concept of \"musiké\" is one of the major dimensions. This theoretical and dialogical perspective, with its stress on the relevance of cultural hermeneutics, aesthetics and musical thinking for the problematic of unity and diversity in culture(s), entail several methodological demands. These tasks can be equally formulated from a phenomenological, hermeneutical, or grammatical point of view. This open hermeneutics is focused by Marc Jean-Bernard on both practical and theoretical dimensions:\n\nEpistemic Perspective\n\nThe Greek locution \"Dialegein\" synthesizes a theoretic set of axiological investigations, corresponding to a unified epistemic methodology which embraces Cultural Hermeneutics, specifically Aesthetics and Ethics. His construction of ethical and aesthetical responsibility stands as a philosophical \"cantus firmus\" for the understanding of cultural polyphony. \nIntentionality and Cognition\nFirstly, Marc Jean-Bernard seeks to provide a philosophical account of cognitive sciences in the field of culture. The extension of research in Philosophy of Mind and Continental Philosophy assigns a theoretical imperative to ethical and cultural investigations, in order to grammatically fix the amphibology of explanation. In contrast to the anti-functionalism and anti- physicalism of phenomenology and hermeneutics, his research on intentionality and subjectivity induces a deep revision of the dichotomy between the transcendental and analytical accounts of phenomenology. He starts with a clear grammar of the term intentionality, unifying its phenomenological and cognitive meaning. Then, a \" non-reductive\" perspective on Mind and Psychism examines cognitive intentionality (representational consciousness of cognition) and affective intentionality (non-representational consciousness and non-affective connaturality), following both the phenomenological description of consciousness and the legacy of Wittgenstein’s investigations on perception, knowledge, and psychology.\n\nAesthetic experience as axiology\n\nIn his musical or philosophical essays and papers, he stressed the relevance of \"values\" in the aesthetic experience considered as a counterpoint of hermeneutic gestures. This insight on symbolic consciousness and truth-content of art is exemplified throughout two ontologically interconnected main fields: Music and Architecture. Considering non- representational and representational semantics of Music and Architecture, the temporalization and spatialization gestures implied in design and composition embrace the entire sphere of dwelling in a given world, what we call an aesthetical \"oikonomia\". This connection between temporality and spatiality is exposed through recent examples, where axiological and \"immunological\" claims of a harmonic world are creatively expressed. These paradigmatic topics, focused on architectural design and musical compositions, are chosen between contemporary works from European, Japanese, North and South American cultures.\n\nKnowledge, Art, and Responsibility\n\nCorrespondingly, he crystallizes the claim for \"dialogue\" between cognitive and hermeneutics in Art, Ethics and Education. His dialogical perspective entails new methodological demands applied to cultural diversity. Phenomenological, grammatical, and cognitive approaches of today’s Aesthetic Endeavour induce a corresponding insight of the role of affective intentionality in Ethics. He assumes that we are led to a synoptic view of Responsibility, within a non reductive frame. Responsibility, linking Wittgenstein to Levinas, and phenomenological to cognitive descriptions, emphasizes the exigent core of a philosophical telos. This Duty reaffirms Malraux’s meditation in \"The Twilight of the Absolute\", through the infinite epiphany of Autrui.\n\nPHÉNOMÉNOOLOGIE DU DIALOGUE, I.-Charles de Gaulle,une pensée diplomatique en acte.

He also served as a \"Dean of the Faculty of Humanities\" from 1995 to 2000.\n\nMarcelo Dascal graduated from a philosophy and electrical engineering faculty at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. He studied linguistics and epistemology in Aix-en- Provence (France) and obtained his Ph.D. at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of Yehoshua Bar-Hillel. \n\nIn Israel he became a teacher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. At this university he founded and lead the Department of Philosophy. \n\nAbroad, he taught at different well-known educational institutions such as the University of São Paulo, Brasília, Campinas and Unisinos (Brazil), Lisboa (Portugal), Lugano (Switzerland), Massachusetts (Amherst), California (Berkeley), Monash (Melbourne, Australia), UNAM and UAM (Mexico), Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris), Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris III), Università degli Studi di Bologna (Italy), and others.\nIn addition to his undergraduate teaching, he has supervised thirteen completed Ph.D. dissertations.\n\nHe took part in a lot of scientific meetings all around the world, often being invited there as a keynote speaker.\n\nHe is currently a member of the board of many scientific associations and journals and the President of the New Israeli Philosophical Association and of the International Association for the Study of Controversies. \n\nHe has held research positions at the universities of Indiana, Stuttgart, Bochum, Technische Univ. Berlin, UNED (Madrid) and the Centre d'Etudes de la Philosophie Moderne (CNRS, Paris), and conducted research on the pragmatics of native languages in the Amazon area. In 1985-1986 he was a Fellow of the Netherlands Institute of Advanced Studies (Wassenaar) and in 1994-1995 he was a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the winter term of 2002/3, he was granted the Leibniz Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Studies of Leipzig University (Germany), where he was the first Leibniz scholar to hold this position.\n\nIn 1995/6 Dascal coordinated in Jerusalem an international research project called \"Leibniz the Polemicist\", which was aimed to find new ways to develop an understanding of the importance of debate in shaping knowledge. It was inspired in Leibniz's eclectic and pluralistic approach, according to which knowledge arises out of the synthesis of the \"grains of truth\" present in every doctrine, a synthesis that is to be achieved through rational controversy governed by a notion of rationality not reducible to logical deduction and yet not arbitrary. One of the results of this project was the creation of the International Association for the Study of Controversies (IASC, read I ASK). The association has conducted since 1996 yearly workshops and conferences.\n\nAnother result was a joint German-Israeli research project on the evolution of scientific, philosophical and theological controversies in the 17th and 18th centuries. This project received a three-year grant (1999–2001) from the German-Israeli Foundation. It was conducted by a team of ten Israeli and German Post-Doctoral and Doctoral researchers, and published four reports.\n\nDascal has published several articles on the topic, and co-founded (along with Gerd Fritz) a new book series called \"Controversies\", whose first three volumes were published in 2005.\n\nDascal is a Leibniz scholar. He has published \"La Sémiologie de Leibniz\" (Paris, 1978), \"Leibniz: Language, Signs and Thought\" (Amsterdam, 1987), and has co-edited \"Leibniz and Adam\" (Tel Aviv, 1991) which was selected by the Leibniz Gesellschaft as a special gift for its members. He published many articles on Leibniz, his contemporaries, and his influence. Dascal is co-founder of the Israel Leibniz Association (in Hebrew: \"Agudat Leibniz Israel\") and a member of the Leibniz Association of America and of the Leibniz Gesellschaft.\n\nIn his earlier work, Dascal focused mainly on Leibniz's philosophy of language, and established the now accepted view that natural languages and other semiotic systems play, for Leibniz, a crucial role in our mental life, and therefore cannot be overlooked in understanding his epistemology. In his recent work, Dascal has been emphasizing the fact that, alongside Leibniz's well known and advertised idea of a formal semiotic system, the \"Universal Characteristic\", which would be the ideal tool for human cognition, based on a strictly deductive or \"calculation\" model of rationality, Leibniz was also concerned with those aspects of rational thought and action which were not accountable for in terms of such a model. Accordingly, he developed a model of what came to be known later as \"soft\" rationality. Dascal has conducted intensive research on this rather underestimated aspect of Leibniz's rationalism.\n\nIn the philosophy of language, Dascal's work focuses on the theory of language use, i.e., pragmatics. He has contributed both to sociopragmatics and to psychopragmatics (a concept he created) , as well as securing a proper philosophical foundation for these two branches and for their distinction from other components of a theory of meaning. His contributions to the cognitive sciences are closely related with his work on the mental use of language.\n\nHe has published \"Pragmatics and the Philosophy of Mind\" (Amsterdam, 1983), and has edited the relevant volume of the \"Enciclopedia IberoAmericana de Filosofia\", (Madrid, 1999) and \"Misunderstanding\" (a special issue of the \"Journal of Pragmatics\", 1999). He has also co-edited the trilingual, two volume, two-thousand page \"Philosophy of Language: A Handbook of Contemporary Research\" (Berlin, 1992, 1995), and, more recently; \"Negotiation and Power in Dialogic Interaction\". A Portuguese translation of his book \"Interpretation and Understanding\" (2003) was published in 2006.\n\nIn order to foster the study of the relationship between the use of language (and other semiotic systems) and cognition (and other kinds of mental life) Dascal founded and edits the interdisciplinary journal \"Pragmatics & Cognition\" (Amsterdam). Since 2005, the journal publishes an annual Special Issue devoted to Cognition & Technology.\n\nHe has been living in Israel since 1965. He is married to Varda. They have 3 children - Hagit, Shlomit and Tamar and eight grandchildren - Adi, Lior, Ohad, Noga, Jonathan, Gilead, Almog, and Naomi. .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1219340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1219340", "title": "Megarian school", "text": "Megarian school\n\nThe Megarian school of philosophy, which flourished in the 4th century BC, was founded by Euclides of Megara, one of the pupils of Socrates. Its ethical teachings were derived from Socrates, recognizing a single good, which was apparently combined with the Eleatic doctrine of Unity. Some of Euclides' successors developed logic to such an extent that they became a separate school, known as the Dialectical school. Their work on modal logic, logical conditionals, and propositional logic played an important role in the development of logic in antiquity.\n\nThe Megarian school of philosophy was founded by Euclides of Megara, who had been one of the pupils of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. His successors, as head of the school in Megara, were said to have been Ichthyas (mid 4th century BC), and Stilpo (late 4th century BC). It is unlikely, however, that the Megarian school was a genuine institution, nor did it have a unified philosophical position. It was said that the philosophers of the school were first called \"Megarians\" and that later they were called \"Eristics\", and then \"Dialecticians\", but it is probable that these names designated splinter groups distinct from the Megarian school. Besides Ichthyas, Euclides' most important pupils were Eubulides of Miletus and Clinomachus of Thurii. It seems to have been under Clinomachus that a separate Dialectical school was founded, which placed great emphasis on logic and dialectic, and Clinomachus was said to have been \"the first to write about propositions and predicates.\" However, Euclides himself taught logic, and his pupil, Eubulides, who was famous for employing celebrated paradoxes, was the teacher of several later dialecticians.\n\nVia Stilpo, the Megarian school is said to have influenced Pyrrho, the Eretrian school under Menedemus and Asclepiades, and Zeno, the founder of Stoicism. Zeno was said to have studied under Stilpo and Diodorus Cronus, and to have disputed with Philo the Dialectician. It was perhaps the Dialecticians, Diodorus and Philo, who were the biggest influence on the development of Stoic logic, and that Zeno studied under Stilpo to learn his moral teachings, although Stilpo, too, is said to have excelled \"in the invention of arguments and in sophistry.\"\n\nEuclides had been a pupil of Socrates, but ancient historians regarded him as a successor to the Eleatics, hence his philosophy was seen as a fusion of Eleatic and Socratic thought. Thus the Eleatic idea of \"The One\" was identified with the Socratic \"Form of the Good,\" and the opposite of Good was regarded by Euclides as non-existent. But the emphasis of his thought is not on \"being\" but on the \"good\", and idea that what is opposite to the good does not exist arises from the understanding of the good's unity. This theme is typically Socratic, what matters is the moral good and the will of the good person to strive towards it. Stilpo is said to have continued the Eleatic tendency, by asserting a strict monism and denying all change and motion, and he also rejected Plato's Theory of Forms. In ethics, Stilpo taught freedom, self-control, and self-sufficiency, approaching the teachings of the Cynics, another Socratic school.\n\nBesides studying logical puzzles and paradoxes, the Dialecticians made two important logical innovations, by re-examining modal logic, and by starting an important debate on the nature of conditional statements. This was the work of Diodorus Cronus and Philo the Dialectician, the only two members of the Dialectical school we have detailed information about. Through their development of propositional logic, the Dialectical school played an important role in the development of logic, which was an important precursor of Stoic logic.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3280782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3280782", "title": "Neoabolitionism", "text": "Neoabolitionism\n\nNeoabolitionist (or neo-abolitionist or new abolitionism) is a term used in historiography to characterize historians of race relations motivated by the spirit of racial equality typified by the abolitionists who fought to abolish slavery in the mid-19th century. They write especially about African-American history, slavery, the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era.\n\nAs abolitionists had worked in the 19th century to end slavery and provide equal rights under the US Constitution to blacks, the new activists worked to enforce constitutional rights for all citizens and restore equality under the law for African Americans, including suffrage and civil rights.\n\nIn the late 20th century some historians emphasized the worlds of African Americans in their own words, in their own communities, to recognize them as agents, not victims. Publishing in the mid-1960s and through the 20th century, a new generation of historians began to revise traditional accounts of slavery in the United States, reconstruction, racial segregation and Jim Crow laws. Some major historians began to apply the term \"neoabolitionist\" to such historians, and some of this group identified as such.\n\nMany early 20th-century histories of the abolitionists and of the Reconstruction Era gave harsh assessments to the movement and the attempts by the federal government to force a transition in the South to a new social system. For instance, what was called the Dunning School, an influential group of white historians led by William Archibald Dunning at Columbia University, assessed Reconstruction as marred by African-American participation, saying that all the state legislatures were dominated by freedmen, that they were incompetent to govern; that they had been misled by northern carpetbaggers; and that these governments of the postwar decades were unusually corrupt.\n\nIn the 19th century after Reconstruction, former abolitionists, especially African Americans such as Frederick Douglass, presented positive views of its achievements: gaining of civil rights for African Americans, and expanded suffrage to include poor whites. In the early 20th century, Fisk University historian Alrutheus Taylor described the period of Reconstruction in North Carolina and Tennessee in several books and articles. W. E. B. Du Bois, a leading Marxist historian, published his \"Black Reconstruction in America\" in 1935, challenging the Dunning School. Du Bois stressed biracial cooperation and noted the achievements of biracial Reconstruction legislatures: establishment of public education in the South for the first time, founding of hospitals, asylums, and charitable institutions to improve general welfare. He said the higher taxes were needed to finance the new infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, historians writing about slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, emphasized the human advancement achieved by the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of those who had been enslaved. Historians such as James McPherson and Martin Duberman admired the abolitionists and wrote studies of them. Through the later 20th century, such historians as David W. Blight, Michael Les Benedict, James McPherson, John Hope Franklin, and Steven Hahn marshalled documentation to reject the Dunning School notion that the Reconstruction era was overwhelmingly corrupt. They evaluated the postwar period as not more corrupt than many times of social change and turmoil in American history.\n\nJohn Hope Franklin argued that Reconstruction had positive elements: most significantly, the enfranchisement of African Americans, both those already free before the war and former slaves; the extension of citizenship and civil rights to four million African Americans; and the introduction of public schools throughout the South where such schools generally had not existed. Franklin, for example, points to the founding of Howard and Fisk, historically black universities that educated generations, as two major successes of Reconstruction.\n\nThey went far beyond that in looking at slavery in detail, with changes in ideas about relations between masters and enslaved, and the various forms of resistance the latter used. The development of African-American communities, education and political culture has been intensively studied.\n\nHistorians argued that depriving African Americans of suffrage and civil rights, as was done in the South following Reconstruction, was itself a terrible form of corruption. They considered it a violation of the tenets of representative government, as African Americans had been effectively excluded from political participation and public life for decades.\n\nIn his 1988 book Eric Foner dated the beginning of Reconstruction in 1863, emphasizing the significance of emancipation and the Emancipation Proclamation. His title, \"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877\" (1988), emphasized the \"unfinished\" theme in its subtitle, explicitly connecting Reconstruction to the American Revolution, which had been based on ideas about human liberty and equality. His work suggested that Reconstruction had not completed the work of providing equality and rights to all American citizens, even after constitutional amendments to provide freedmen with citizenship. That work was continuing in the 20th century. His book was published after the civil rights movement gained federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights of suffrage and equal treatment under the law for African Americans and overturn state discrimination. Foner did not identify as a \"neoabolitionist\" in this work, nor did he refer to other historians by that term.\n\n\n\n"}

Fellow Tantric practitioners Tibetan Buddhists practice Clear Light yoga based on a similar concept.\n\n\"Prakāśa\" is considered supreme, ultimate, unsurpassable, but as such it cannot be described as pure transcendence, because even though it is above all, it is still present in the manifestation, in every aspect of it.

The family had probably originally come from Maida, which it left to escape the feudal domination of the House of Caracciolo, and moved into the Palazzo Bongiovanni, home to the Vianeo brothers, pioneering surgeons, who were also from Maida. Quinzio finished his studies in medicine and philosophy under Giovan Bernardino Longo and Giovan Girolamo Polverino in Naples. In 1571 he published the work for which he is principally remembered, \"Peripateticarum disputationum de principiis naturae\" (Venice 1571), dedicated to Cardinal Carafa. He was a member Accademia degli Affaticati ('Academy of the Weary') in his home town of Tropea.\n\nSome time before 1583 he was appointed Protomedico (Chief Physician) to the King (Philip II of Spain), a position which required him to licence and regulate all healers, surgeons, midwives and alchemists in the kingdom. He insisted that apothecaries be prevented from preparing herbal remedies before being properly inspected, otherwise 'they make the compositions up in their own way, without fear of God or justice, and to the detriment of human bodies, which for this reason are daily made to suffer.' He apparently also worked for a time for the Prince of Bisignano. He returned to Naples in 1588 and was appointed Reader in Philosophy and Medicine at the university. He later became Professor of Medicine, and Archiater to Popes Pius V and Gregory XIII. Among his most distinguished pupils were Marco Aurelio Severino and Giovanni Battista Cavallari.\n\nIn 1608 the German medic Giovanni Custode reported to his colleague Giovanni Faber the opinion of Bongiovanni that in Rome 'doctors are princes, but in Naples they are paupers, poorly-considered and working very hard to earn anything.'\n\nOne story about Buongiovanni suggests that he was firmly in the Aristotelian camp in the discussions about nature, sensation, and the order of the universe. In 1571 Telesio was debating with his student Antonio Persio the nature of light, and whether or not the sun was hot. Buongiovanni joined the discussion, arguing it could not be hot, because it was beyond the moon and therefore, in traditional Aristotelian cosmology, beyond the realm of the senses; Telesio argued that the sun's rays both illuminate and heat the earth. When the argument could not be resolved, Telesio took him out into the street in the midday sun and stood with him. 'Can't you feel it?' he asked, but Buongiovanni refused to accept this evidence.\n\nBongiovanni died in Naples on 5 June 1612, bequeathing part of his estate to the two sons of his brother Flaminio, Giovancola and Quinzio (junior).

Ratnakīrti studied at Vikramashila university under Jñanasrimitra (975–1025).\n\nRatnakīrti's 'Refutation of Other mindstreams' (\"Saṃtãnãntaradusana\"), argued that knowledge of external streams of consciousness (citta-santāna) is a form of inference (anumāna), not a direct perception (pratyakṣa). Ratnakīrti introduced the two truths doctrine as key to the nature of the discussion. Since inference deals with conceptual universals, the proof of the mindstreams of others, whilst empirically valid in relative truth (saṃvṛtisatya), does not hold ultimate metaphysical certainty in absolute truth (paramārthasatya). Ratnakīrti therefore argued for the ultimate truth of \"one mind\" (ekacitta). By establishing the impossibility of external mindstreams, Ratnakīrti was also arguing for the non-dualism of Yogacara \"consciousness-only\". Ratnakīrti argued that from an ultimate point of view, the distinctions between a subject and object, the observer and the observed, all disappear. Ratnakīrti's theory states then, that there is no logical foundation for individuating mindstreams, and that there are no boundaries between minds from the perspective of ultimate truth. This sub school of Yogacara Cittamatra (mind only) has been called the \"Citradvaitavada\" school (non-dual mind) or \"Vijñanadvaitavada\" school (non-dual consciousness).\n\nRatnakīrti's \"Refutation of Arguments Establishing Īśvara\" (Īśvara-sādhana-dūṣaṇa) argued against the Hindu concept of a creator God.\n\nRatnakīrti also wrote the \"Proof of Momentariness\" (\"Kṣānabhaṅgasiddhi\"), where he defended the theory of momentariness, the view that dharmas last only for a moment.\n\n"}

Natural ecosystems provide ecosystem services in the form of resources such as food, fuel, and timber; the purification of air and water; the detoxification and decomposition of wastes; the regulation of climate; the regeneration of soil fertility; and the pollination of crops. These ecosystem processes have been estimated to be worth trillions of dollars annually. There is consensus in the scientific community that the current environmental degradation and destruction of many of the Earth's biota is taking place on a \"catastrophically short timescale\". Scientists estimate that the current species extinction rate, or the rate of the Holocene extinction, is 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the normal, background rate.Habitat loss is the leading cause of both species extinctions and ecosystem service decline. Two methods have been identified to slow the rate of species extinction and ecosystem service decline, they are the conservation of currently viable habitat, and the restoration of degraded habitat. The commercial applications of ecological restoration have increased exponentially in recent years.\n\nRestoration ecology is the academic study of the process, whereas ecological restoration is the actual project or process by restoration practitioners. The Society for Ecological Restoration defines \"ecological restoration\" as an \"intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability\". Ecological restoration includes a wide scope of projects including erosion control, reforestation, removal of non-native species and weeds, revegetation of disturbed areas, daylighting streams, reintroduction of native species (preferably native species that have local adaptation), and habitat and range improvement for targeted species.\n\nE. O. Wilson, a biologist, states, \"Here is the means to end the great extinction spasm. The next century will, I believe, be the era of restoration in ecology.\"\n\nRestoration ecology emerged as a separate field in ecology in the late twentieth century. \"Restoration ecology\" was not first formally identified as a distinct scientific field until the late twentieth century. The term was coined by John Aber and William Jordan III when they were at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. However, indigenous peoples, land managers, stewards, and laypeople have been practicing ecological restoration or ecological management for thousands of years.\n\nConsidered the birthplace of modern ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum. Civilian Conservation Corps workers replanted nearby prairie species onto a former horse pasture, overseen by university faculty including renowned ecologist Aldo Leopold, botanist Theodore Sperry, mycologist Henry C. Greene, and plant ecologist John T. Curtis. Curtis and his graduate students surveyed the whole of Wisconsin, documenting native species communities and creating the first species lists for tallgrass restorations. Existing prairie remnants, such as locations within pioneer cemeteries and railroad rights-of-way, were located and inventoried by Curtis and his team. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm, and pioneering techniques like prescribed burning.\n\nThe latter-half of the 20th century saw the growth of ecological restoration beyond Wisconsin borders. The 285-hectare Green Oaks Biological Field Station at Knox College began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologist Paul Shepard. It was followed by the 40-hectare Schulenberg Prairie at the Morton Arboretum, started in 1962 by Ray Schulenberg and Bob Betz. Betz then worked with The Nature Conservancy to establish the 260-hectare Fermi National Laboratory tallgrass prairie in 1974. These major tallgrass restoration projects marked the growth of ecological restoration from isolated studies to widespread practice.\n\nAustralia has also been the site of historically significant ecological restoration projects. In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 Albert Morris and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the \"Broken Hill regeneration area\".\n\nRestoration ecology draws on a wide range of ecological concepts.\n\nDisturbance is a change in environmental conditions that disrupts the functioning of an ecosystem. Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities. For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement fire as a natural disturbance regime. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystems.\n\nEcological succession is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with a few dominant pioneer species to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance. Following mild to moderate natural and anthropogenic disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (i.e. physical or chemical alteration of the environment), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes.\n\nHabitat fragmentation describes spatial discontinuities in a biological system, where ecosystems are broken up into smaller parts through land use changes (e.g. agriculture) and natural disturbance. This both reduces the size of the populations and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases quality of the habitat. The edge of a fragment has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating habitat corridors that link isolated fragments. Reversing the effects of fragmentation is an important component of restoration ecology.\n\nEcosystem function describes the most basic and essential foundational processes of any natural systems, including nutrient cycles and energy fluxes. An understanding of the complexity of these ecosystem functions is necessary to address any ecological processes that may be degraded. Ecosystem functions are emergent properties of the system as a whole, thus monitoring and management are crucial for the long-term stability of ecosystems.A fully functional ecosystem that is completely self-perpetuating is the ultimate goal of restorative efforts.\n\nCommunity assembly \"is a framework that can unify virtually all of (community) ecology under a single conceptual umbrella\". Community assembly theory attempts to explain the existence of environmentally similar sites with differing assemblages of species. It assumes that species have similar niche requirements, so that community formation is a product of random fluctuations from a common species pool. Essentially, if all species are fairly ecologically equivalent, then random variation in colonization, and migration and extinction rates between species, drive differences in species composition between sites with comparable environmental conditions.\n\nGenetic diversity has shown to be as important as species diversity for restoring ecosystem processes. Hence ecological restorations are increasingly factoring genetic processes into management practices. Population genetic processes that are important to consider in restored populations include founder effects, inbreeding depression, outbreeding depression, genetic drift, and gene flow. Such processes can predict whether or not a species successfully establishes at a restoration site.\n\nSpatial heterogeneity of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity, and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated soil resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass prairie restoration project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which on its own was insufficient to insure species diversity in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings were consistent with the theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, best adapted to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure.\n\nRestoration is used as a tool for reducing the spread of invasive plant species in a number of ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread. As this approach emphasizes control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects. The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat. These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density. They are not always actively managed following seeding. The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a sustainable solution long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding.\n\nRestoration projects are also used as a way to better understand what makes an ecological community resistant to invasion. As restoration projects have a broad range of implementation strategies and methods used to control invasive species, they can be used by ecologists to test theories about invasion. Restoration projects have been used to understand how the diversity of the species introduced in the restoration affects invasion. We know that generally higher diversity prairies have lower levels of invasion. Incorporation of functional ecology has shown that more functionally diverse restorations have lower levels of invasion. Furthermore, studies have shown that using native species functionally similar to invasive species are better able to compete with invasive species. Restoration ecologists have also used the variety of strategies employed at different restoration sites to better understand the most successful management techniques to control invasion.\n\nProgress along a desired successional pathway may be difficult if multiple stable states exist. Looking over 40 years of wetland restoration data, Klötzli and Gootjans (2001) argue that unexpected and undesired vegetation assemblies \"may indicate that environmental conditions are not suitable for target communities\". Succession may move in unpredicted directions, but constricting environmental conditions within a narrow range may rein in the possible successional trajectories and increase the likelihood of a desired outcome.\n\nFor most restoration projects it is generally recommend to source material from local populations, to increase chance of restoration success and minimize the effects of maladaptation. However the definition of local can vary based on species. habitat and region. US Forest Service recently developed provisional seed zones based on a combination of minimum winter temperature zones, aridity, and the Level III ecoregions. Rather than putting strict distance recommendations, other guidelines recommend sourcing seeds to match similar environmental conditions. For example, sourcing for \"Castilleja levisecta\" found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations.\n\nThere are many reasons to restore ecosystems. Some include:\n\n\nThere exist considerable differences of opinion in how to set restoration goals and how to define their success among conservation groups. Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as rewilding. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, \"ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium…. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target.\"\n\nSome conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable than its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987). One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. Afforestation involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. Carbon dioxide is a leading cause of global warming (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities.\nSome view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals. Hilderbrand et al. point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for 'complete' restoration are unreasonably short, while other critical markers for full-scale restoration are either ignored or abridged due to feasibility concerns. In other instances an ecosystem may be so degraded that abandonment (allowing a severely degraded ecosystem to recover on its own) may be the wisest option. Local communities sometimes object to restorations that include the introduction of large predators or plants that require disturbance regimes such as regular fires, citing threat to human habitation in the area. High economic costs can also be perceived as a negative impact of the restoration process.\n\nPublic opinion is very important in the feasibility of a restoration; if the public believes that the costs of restoration outweigh the benefits they will not support it.\n\nMany failures have occurred in past restoration projects, many times because clear goals were not set out as the aim of the restoration, or an incomplete understanding of the underlying ecological framework lead to insufficient measures. This may be because, as Peter Alpert says, \"people may not [always] know how to manage natural systems effectively\". Furthermore, many assumptions are made about myths of restoration such as carbon copy, where a restoration plan, which worked in one area, is applied to another with the same results expected, but not realized.\n\nOne of the struggles for both fields is a divide between restoration ecology and ecological restoration in practice. Currently, many restoration practitioners as well as scientists feel that science is not being adequately incorporated into ecological restoration projects. In a 2009 survey of practitioners and scientists, the \"science-practice gap\" was listed as the second most commonly cited reason limiting the growth of both science and practice of restoration.\n\nThere are a variety of theories about the cause of this gap. However, it has been well established that one of the main issues is that the questions studied by restoration ecologists are frequently not found useful or easily applicable by land managers. For instance, many publications in restoration ecology characterize the scope of a problem in depth, without providing concrete solutions. Additionally many restoration ecology studies are carried out under controlled conditions and frequently at scales much smaller than actual restorations. Whether or not these patterns hold true in an applied context is often unknown. There is evidence that these small-scale experiments inflate type II error rates and differ from ecological patterns in actual restorations.\n\nThere is further complication in that restoration ecologists who want to collect large-scale data on restoration projects can face enormous hurdles in obtaining the data. Managers vary in how much data they collect, and how many records they keep. Some agencies keep only a handful of physical copies of data that make it difficult for the researcher to access. Many restoration projects are limited by time and money, so data collection and record keeping are not always feasible. However, this limits the ability of scientists to analyze restoration projects and give recommendations based on empirical data.\n\nRestoration ecology may be viewed as a sub-discipline of conservation biology, the scientific study of how to protect and restore biodiversity. Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting conservation movement.\n\nBoth restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, conservation biology is primarily rooted in population biology. Because of that, it is generally organized at the population genetic level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. endangered species). Restoration ecology is organized at the community level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems.\n\nIn addition, conservation biology often concentrates on vertebrate animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on plants. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have \"poster species\" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects. For example, the Monarch butterfly is a poster species for conserving and restoring milkweed plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on soils, soil structure, fungi, and microorganisms because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nThe UK Natural Capital Committee (NCC) made a recommendation in its second State of Natural Capital report published in March 2014 that in order to meet the Government's goal of being the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it was inherited, a long-term 25-year plan was needed to maintain and improve England's natural capital. The UK Government has not yet responded to this recommendation.\n\nThe Secretary of State for the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson, described his ambition for the natural environment and how the work of the Committee fits into this at an NCC event in November 2012: \"I do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. I want us to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC's innovative work is geared towards\".\n\n\n"}

It is a concept that can be found in Dharmic traditions and Abrahamic traditions as a theological concept. For example, from various perspectives in Hinduism, Christianity, and Judaism it is considered an attribute that implies that a person's actions are justified, and can have the connotation that the person has been \"judged\" or \"reckoned\" as leading a life that is pleasing to God.. It is also found in tamil literature in the name of அறம்(aram).Tamil Custom known for it's righteousness.In Tamil literature there is separate section called அற நூல்கள் righteous books for example thirukkural nalatiyar and many more books.tirukkural dedicated 1-38 chapters Book of aram for righteousness.A poem in purananuru written by kaniyanpoongundranar it showcases the practice of righteousness leads to worldpeace and harmony in society.\n\nWilliam Tyndale (Bible translator into English in 1526) remodelled the word after an earlier word \"rihtwis\", which would have yielded modern English *\"rightwise\" or *\"rightways\". He used it to translate the Hebrew root צדקים (\"TzDYQ\"), \"tzedek\", which appears over five hundred times in the Hebrew Bible, and the Greek word (\"dikaios\"), which appears more than two hundred times in the New Testament.\n\nIn the word \"righteousness,\" the suffix \"-ness\" modifies the adjective \"righteous,\" which is \"right\" modified by \"-ous.\" Righteousness is a phenomenon or state or condition of: resembling or displaying the nature of moral, good, correct, true, factual, excellent, just, virtuous, natural, morally upright, correct for situations, balanced, and honorable being or being in such a state. \n\nOrigin\nOld English rihtwīs, from riht ‘right’ + wīs ‘manner, state, condition’ (as opposed to \"wrangwise\", \"wrongful\"). The change in the ending in the 16th century was due to association with words such as bounteous.\n\nEthics is a major branch of philosophy, encompasses right conduct and good living.\n\" Rushworth Kidder states that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'\".[3] Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define ethics as \"a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures\".[4] The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the word ethics is \"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' ... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual.\"\n\nRighteousness is one of the chief Attributes of God as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible.\n\"Eusebeia\" enters the New Testament in later writings, where it is typically translated as \"godliness,\" a vague translation that reflects uncertainty about its relevant meaning in the New Testament. In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker,[34] on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In common parlance, dharma means ‘\"right\" way of living’, 'laws of nature' and ‘path of \"rightness\"’.\n\n\"The word εὐσέβεια as it is used in the Greek New Testament carries the meaning of \"godliness\", and is distinct from θρησκεία (thrēskeia), \"religion\". Eusebeia relates to real, true, vital, and spiritual relation with God, while thrēskeia relates to the outward acts of religious observances or ceremonies, which can be performed by the flesh. The English word \"religion\" was never used in the sense of true godliness. It always meant the outward forms of worship. In 1Ti 3:16, the Mystery, or secret connected with true Christianity as distinct from religion, it is the Genitive of relation. (This specific meaning occurs only in Act 3:12.)] This word arises in the Greek New Testament in 1 Tim 2:2, 1 Tim 3:16, 1 Tim 4:7, 1 Tim 4:8, 1 Tim 6:3, 1 Tim 6:5, 1 Tim 6:6, 1 Tim 6:11, 2 Tim 3:5, Tit 1:1, 2 Pt 1:3, 2 Pt 1:6, 2 Pt 1:7, 2 Pt 3:11.[7]\"\n\nYi, (Chinese: 義; simplified Chinese: 义; traditional Chinese: 義; pinyin: yì; Jyutping: Ji6; Zhuyin Fuhao: ㄧˋ), literally \"justice, righteousness; meaning,\" is an important concept in Confucianism. It involves a moral disposition to do good, and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently. Yi resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (ren) and skillful practice (li). Yi represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the \"creative insights\" necessary to apply virtues \"with no loss of sight of the total good. Yi represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision-generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation.\" \n\nDharma is a key concept with multiple meanings. There might not be a single-word translation for dharma in Western languages. \"Dharma\" धर्म can be translated as righteousness, religion, faith, duty, law, and virtue. Connotations of dharma include rightness, good, natural, morality, righteousness, and virtue. It means moral, right, just, balanced, or natural etc. In common parlance, dharma means ‘\"right\" way of living’ and ‘path of \"rightness\"’. Dharma encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or \"morally upright\". It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to satya (truth, Sanskrit: satya सत्यं). \"...when a man speaks the Truth, they say, \"He speaks the Dharma\"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, \"He speaks the Truth!\" For both are one.\" — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 1.4.xiv\n\nBhagavad Gita Chapter 4: TEXT 7\n\n\"Whenever there is decay of righteousness, O Bharata, \nAnd there is exaltation of unrighteousness, then I Myself come forth\"\nWhenever and wherever there is a decline in righteousness/religious practice, Oh descendant of Bharata, and a rise of evil/irreligion— Then at that time I manifest Myself.\n\nIn Hindu philosophy and/or religion, major emphasis is placed on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.. Including duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ‘‘right way of living’. The Sanskrit epics contain themes and examples where right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. \n\nIn mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker, on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In his 250 BCE Edicts used the word \"eusebeia\" as a Greek translation for the central Buddhist and Hindu concept of \"dharma\". This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,[34] suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of \"right,\" of \"good\", of one’s duty.\n\nFor Sikhs, the word Dharm means the path of \"righteousness\" and proper religious practice.\n\nThe major Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra mentions Das-dharma with the meaning of \"ten righteous virtues\".\nRighteousness is one of the chief attributes of God as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible. Its chief meaning concerns ethical conduct (for example, Leviticus 19:36; Deuteronomy 25:1; Psalm 1:6; Proverbs 8:20). In the Book of Job the title character is introduced to us as a person who is perfect in righteousness.\n\nThe New Testament continues the Hebrew Bible's tradition of the ethical () and legal () aspects of righteousness. William Lane Craig argues that we should think of God as the paradigm, the locus, the source of all righteousness. Matthew's gospel contains the most utterances of the word. In Matthew's account of the baptism encounter Jesus tells the prophet \"it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness\" as Jesus requests that John perform the rite for him. The Sermon of the Mount contains the memorable commandment \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\". The Greek word \"dikaiosune\" also means justice and the sole translation using this rendering for is the New English Bible.\n\nJesus asserts the importance of righteousness by saying in Matthew 5:20, \"For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.\" Jesus also re-affirms the Laws of Moses by saying in Matthew 5:19, \"Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\nHowever, Paul the Apostle speaks of two ways, at least in theory, to achieve righteousness: through the Law of Moses (or Torah); and through faith in the atonement made possible through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (). Some interpret that he repeatedly emphasizes that faith is the only effective way. Reference (). (). For example, just a few verses earlier, he states the Jews did not attain the law of righteousness because they sought it not by faith, but by works (). The New Testament speaks of a salvation founded on God's righteousness, as exemplified throughout the history of salvation narrated in the Old Testament ().\nPaul writes to the Romans that righteousness comes by faith: \"...a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'\" ()\n\nIn II Cor. 9:9 the New Revised Standard Version has a footnote that the original word has the meaning of 'benevolence' and the Messianic Jewish commentary of David Stern affirms the Jewish practice of 'doing \"tzedakah\"' as charity in referring to the Matt. 6 and II Cor. 9 passages. \n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, \"Righteous\" is a type of saint who is regarded as a holy person under the Old Covenant (Old Testament Israel) but also sometimes used for married saints of the New Covenant (the Church). According to Orthodox theology, the Righteous saints of the Old Covenant were not able to enter into heaven until after the death of Jesus on the cross (), but had to await salvation in the Bosom of Abraham (see: Harrowing of Hell).\n\nRighteousness is mentioned several times in the Qur'an. The Qur'an says that a life of righteousness is the only way to go to Heaven.\n\n"}

The machismo of the pelado, he argues, is the result of an inferiority complex (based on Alfred Adler's concept) and, since the pelado represents the entire country, the \"character study\" is extended to all of Mexico, and was one of the first post-Revolutionary attempts to define and assess the national character.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37756305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37756305", "title": "Secondary causation", "text": "Secondary causation\n\nSecondary Causation is the philosophical proposition that all material and corporeal objects, having been created by God with their own intrinsic potentialities, are subsequently empowered to evolve independently in accordance with natural law. Traditional Christians would slightly modify this injunction to allow for the occasional miracle as well as the exercise of free will. Deists who deny any divine interference past the creation event would only accept free will exceptions. That the physical universe is consequentially well-ordered, consistent, and knowable subject to human observation and reason, was a primary theme of Scholasticism and further molded into the philosophy of the Western Tradition by Augustine and later by Aquinas.\n\nSecondary causation has been suggested as a necessary precursor for scientific inquiry into an established order of natural laws which are not entirely predicated on the changeable whims of a supernatural Being. Nor does this create a conflict between science and religion for, given a Creator, it is not inconsistent with the paradigm of a clockwork universe. It does however remove logical contradictions concerning the unfettered expression of man’s free will which would otherwise require not just God’s acquiescence but rather His direct intervention to implement.\n\nAccording to the Jewish Torah which brought down the original idea in Genesis, the phrase \"free will\" is a mistranslation from the Torah, rather what humans are given is \"freedom to choose\".\nFreedom to choose to do God's Will at all times even though God gave us a good inclination and a not-good inclination to use in choosing, we are told \"Therefore choose life\".\n\nOccasionalism itself was derived from the earlier school of thought of “volunteerism” emanating from Al-Ash'ari who held that every particle in the universe must be constantly recreated each instant by God’s direct intervention.\n\nAccording to the Kabbalah and brought down in Chasidic philosophy in the book \"Tania, the Book of Intermediates\" composed by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (Russia) at the beginning of the 19th century, \nthe will and desire to create the universe is integral to the Creator's very essence & thought this being the source for all the physical and spiritual worlds.\n\nOnce the Creator has created the universe and God knows & wants the Creation as the One who created it in His very essence, God then enlivens and vivifies all parts of the universe at every moment or the physical universe & the many spiritual worlds would revert instantly to their source in the Creator from where they came.\nAt the same time as molecules move, human cells divide the Creator must know the Creation as it was a moment ago and makes allowance for the finite Creations to grow and later slowly wither, and by the evaporation of water, the wearing down of rocks and soil, the birth, growth and weakening of the flesh of fish, animals and humans all Creations as they are built from the 4 main spiritual worlds which also break down, they have a mirror on earth of air, fire, water, dust and slowly all created beings wear down by God's constant enlivening of them until each of the 4 elements return to their spiritual source which mirror the 4 elements. This is not an independent of God activity, rather it is all controlled by God's Will.\n\nTorah explains that before Creation there was only God and nothing else as is seen in the highest Name the letter \"Yud\".\nWhen it came time for Creation the want and will of God to Create a universe\nwhich meant expansion of the Holy Name the Holy Name Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey how this Creation came about by G-D's use of the 10 Sefirot would be too great a task to explain here but basically we find \"And God said let there be...\"\n\nThe Creation made no change in the Creator God was, is and always will be but the Creation is available to those Created as an order always vivified by God since God must know the Creation in order to keep it as it is, yet allow for His change according to his will. The body sees a Creation while the soul sees only The Infinite One God.\n\nHaving the gift from God, \"the Freedom to choose\" to serve God and always do God's Will here on earth makes us partners in creation. Being that God's Will was revealed to the People of Israel on Mount Sinai and spread to the world in the Torah we have Freedom to choose to do so. If a human does the opposite of God's Will it is in God's realm to alter the cosmic plan of Creation that He Himself devised, that He Himself wants but since nothing exists but God, including the universe and this \"nothing\" is not above the knowledge that \"nothing is too hard for God\" and \"Our wisdom is not His Wisdom\", it is a fundamental theme in Torah that we must do God's will yet we have Freedom to serve or not and if we go against God's will, it is still a lack on our part as partners with God here on earth but this itself is God's Will and will not upset the cosmic original plan.\n\nWe see this when Shimi cursed King David and threw stones at him that King David did not get angry since he realized that Shimi was an agent from God himself or Shimi could not possibly use his physical God given talents to speak or throw stones if God did not want. Even though Shimi was not told by God, Shimi used his Freedom to Serve in the wrong way, but if Shimi had not cursed David at God's Will, \"God has many messengers to do His will\"\n\nIn fact, with Adam and Eve there in, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was created before Adam himself by God and this is all part of His plan, to turn away from evil.\n\nThe concept of there being two distinct truths, even concerning the same object or phenomena, was most notably developed by Averroes (1126-1198 from Spain). By thus separating the sanctity of religious revelation from the practical world of physical observation, it was an attempt to circumvent proscriptions on the discredited rationalist heresy of Muʿtazila, which had heretofore not gained traction in any venue.\n\nFollowing Augustine and many others, this concept of double truth was soundly rejected by Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae which reiterated the long established view in the West that there can be only one truth. The original quote from Augustine was\n\n\"In matters that are obscure and far beyond our vision, even in such as we may find treated in Holy Scripture, different Interpretations are sometimes possible without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such a case, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture.\" \nThe assignment of intrinsic qualities to objects which can mutate and evolve of their own accord without divine intervention was a crucial step in the transformation of the rational logic of the Greeks into the scientific method in the Western Tradition of the late Middle Ages. Because man could thus observe and characterize the natural flow of events without impugning the prerogatives of supernatural forces, burgeoning philosopher-scientists became free to experiment and especially to question and debate the results.\n\nIn Western Europe this rationale was further strengthened by the motivation that science was uniquely able not only to efficiently manage the world as charged to do so in Genesis but also to be able to distinguish miracles from natural occurrences.\n\nOne of the first to take advantage of this opportunity was Albertus Magnus of Cologne (1193-1206), who wrote\n\"In studying nature we have not to inquire how God the Creator may, as He freely wills, use His creatures to work miracles and thereby show forth His power; we have rather to inquire what Nature with its immanent causes can naturally bring to pass.\"\nThis sentiment was echoed in various European forums of the day notably by the secular Professor of Theology at the University of Paris, John Buridan (1300-1361) who liberally commented on the works of Aristotle.\n“It should also be noted that [when we ask whether metaphysics is the same as wisdom,] we are not comparing metaphysics to theology, which proceeds from beliefs that are not known, because although these beliefs are not known per se and most evident, we hold without doubt that theology is the more principal discipline and that it is wisdom most properly speaking. In this question, however, we are merely asking about intellectual habits based on human reason, [i.e.,] those discovered by the process of reasoning, which are deduced from what is evident to us. For it is in this sense that Aristotle calls metaphysics ‘theology’ and ‘the divine science’. Accordingly, metaphysics differs from theology in the fact that although each considers God and those things that pertain to divinity, metaphysics only considers them as regards what can be proved and implied, or inductively inferred, by demonstrative reason.”\n"}

{"id": "25269475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25269475", "title": "Sense data", "text": "Sense data\n\nIn the philosophy of perception, the theory of sense data was a popular view held in the early 20th century by philosophers such as Bertrand Russell, C. D. Broad, H. H. Price, A. J. Ayer, and G. E. Moore. Sense data are taken to be mind-dependent objects whose existence and properties are known directly to us in perception. These objects are unanalyzed experiences inside the mind, which appear to subsequent more advanced mental operations exactly as they are.\n\nSense data are often placed in a time and/or causality series, such that they occur after the potential unreliability of our perceptual systems yet before the possibility of error during higher-level conceptual analysis and are thus incorrigible. They are thus distinct from the 'real' objects in the world outside the mind, about whose existence and properties we often \"can\" be mistaken.\n\nTalk of sense-data has since been largely replaced by talk of the closely related qualia. The formulation \"the given\" is also closely related. None of these terms has a single coherent and widely agreed-upon definition, so their exact relationships are unclear. One of the greatest troubling aspects to 20th century theories of sense data is its unclear rubric nature.\n\nBertrand Russell heard the sound of his knuckles rapping his writing table, felt the table's hardness and saw its apparent colour (which he knew 'really' to be the brown of wood) change significantly under shifting lighting conditions.\n\nH. H. Price found that although he was able to doubt the presence of a tomato before him, he was unable to doubt the existence of his red, round and 'somewhat bulgy' sense-datum and his consciousness of this sense-datum.\n\nWhen we twist a coin it 'appears' to us as elliptical. This elliptical 'appearance' cannot be identical with the coin (for the coin is perfectly round), and is therefore a sense datum, which somehow represents the round coin to us.\n\nConsider a reflection which appears to us in a mirror. There is nothing corresponding to the reflection in the world external to the mind (for our reflection appears to us as the image of a human being apparently located inside a wall, or a wardrobe). The appearance is therefore a mental object, a sense datum.\n\nThe idea that our perceptions are based on sense data is supported by a number of arguments. The first is popularly known as the argument from illusion. From a subjective experience of perceiving something, it is theoretically impossible to distinguish perceiving something which exists independently of oneself from an hallucination or mirage. Thus, we do not have any direct access to the outside world that would allow us to reliably distinguish it from an illusion that caused identical experiences. Since (the argument claims) we must have direct access to some specific experiential entity in order to have the percepts that we do, and since this entity is not identical to the real object itself, there must be some sort of internal mental entity somehow correlated to the real world, about which we afterwards have perceptions, make judgments, etc. This entity is a sense-datum.\n\nAbstract sense data is sense data without human judgement, sense data without human conception and yet evident to the senses, found in aesthetic experience. As opposed to; imaginary sense data which is more like a quasi substance and does not really exist; Imaginary sense data is abstract sense data as presented from the aestheticized senses to consciousness; i.e. imagination, power of reason and inner subjective states of self-awareness including: emotion, self-reflection, ego, and theory. The theory of abstract and imaginary sense data operates on the tacit definition of imagination as \"a power mediating between the senses and the reason by virtue of representing perceptual objects without their presence\". Imaginary sense data are 'imaginary' per Immanuel Kant's analysis that imagination is the primary faculty of mind capable of synthesizing input from the senses into a world of objects. Abstract and imaginary sense data are key to understanding abstract art's relationship with the conscious and unconscious mind.\n\nSense data theories have been criticised by philosophers such as J. L. Austin and Wilfrid Sellars (Sellars diagnosing in them The Myth of the Given), and more recently by Kevin O'Regan, Alva Noë and Daniel Dennett. Much of the early criticism may arise from a claim about sense data that was held by philosophers such as A. J. Ayer. This was that sense data really do have the properties they appear to have. Thus, in this account of sense data, the sense data that are responsible for the experience of a red tomato really \"are red\".\n\nIn one sense this is ridiculous, since there is nothing red in a brain to act as a sense datum. However, in another sense it is perfectly consistent—in the sense that the data \"are red\" when experienced directly, even though the physical processes of perception may not appear red if they were experienced in a contrived and inappropriately indirect way, such as by examining the brain of the experiencer with scientific instruments.\n\nOn some theories, the tomato itself is not red except in the eyes of a red-seeing being. Thus when one says that a neural state is or is not 'red' without referring the judgement of redness to the owner of the neurons concerned, there is an assumption that things can have innate appearances without reference to perceivers—which is implicitly denied by the sense data theory. Thus the criticism that sense data cannot really be red is made from a position of presupposition inconsistent with a theory of sense data—so it is bound to seem to make the theory seem wrong. More recent opposition to the existence of sense data appears to be simply regression to naïve realism.\n\nBy objectifying and partially externalising a Subject's basic experiences of the world as 'sense-data', positing their necessity for perception and higher order thinking and installing them permanently between the perceiving Subject and the 'real world', sense-data theories tend towards Solipsism. Attempts to repair this must avoid both obscurantism and over-dependence on psychology (and therefore empiricism, and potentially circularity).\n\n"}

{"id": "1743598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1743598", "title": "Sophia (wisdom)", "text": "Sophia (wisdom)\n\nSophia ( \"sophía\" \"wisdom\") is a central idea in Hellenistic philosophy and religion, Platonism, Gnosticism, and Christian theology. Originally carrying a meaning of \"cleverness, skill\", the later meaning of the term, close to the meaning of \"Phronesis\" (\"wisdom, intelligence\"), was significantly shaped by the term \"philosophy\" (\"love of \"sophia\"\") as used by Plato.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic churches, Holy Wisdom ( \"Hagía Sophía\") is an expression for God the Son (Jesus) in the Trinity (as in the dedication of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople) and, rarely, for the Holy Spirit.\n\nReferences to \"Sophia\" in Koine Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible translate to the Hebrew term \"Chokhmah\".\n\nThe Ancient Greek word \"sophia\" (, ) is the abstract noun of (), which variously translates to \"clever, skillful, intelligent, wise\". These words share the same Proto-Indo-European root as the Latin verb (), whence . The noun as \"skill in handicraft and art\" is Homeric and in Pindar is used to describe both Hephaestos and Athena.\n\nBefore Plato, the term for \"sound judgement, intelligence, practical wisdom\" and so on, such qualities as are ascribed to the Seven Sages of Greece, was \"phronesis\" (, ), from \"phren\" (, , ), while \"sophia\" referred to technical skill. \n\nThe term \"philosophia\" (, , ) was primarily used after the time of Plato, following his teacher Socrates, though it has been said that Pythagoras was the first to call himself a philosopher. This understanding of \"philosophia\" permeates Plato's dialogues, especially the \"Republic\". In that work, the leaders of the proposed utopia are to be philosopher kings: rulers who are lovers of wisdom. According to Plato in \"Apology\", Socrates himself was dubbed \"the wisest [, ] man of Greece\" by the Pythian Oracle. Socrates defends this verdict in \"Apology\" to the effect that he, at least, knows that he knows nothing. Socratic skepticism is contrasted with the approach of the sophists, who are attacked in \"Gorgias\" for relying merely on eloquence. Cicero in later criticized Plato for his separation of wisdom from eloquence. \"Sophia\" is named as one of the four cardinal virtues (in place of \"phronesis\") in Plato's \"Protagoras\".\n\nPhilo, a Hellenized Jew writing in Alexandria, attempted to harmonize Platonic philosophy and Jewish scripture. Also influenced by Stoic philosophical concepts, he used the Koine term \"logos\" (, ) for the role and function of Wisdom, a concept later adapted by the author of the Gospel of John in the opening verses and applied to Jesus as the Word (Logos) of God the Father.\n\nIn Gnosticism, Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the soul, but also simultaneously one of the emanations of the Monad. Gnostics held that she was the syzygy of Jesus (i.e. the Bride of Christ) and was the Holy Spirit of the Trinity. She is occasionally referred to by the Hebrew equivalent of (; , ) and as ().\n\nChristian theology received the Old Testament personification of Divine Wisdom (Septuagint \"Sophia\", Vulgate \"Sapientia\"). The connection of Divine Wisdom to the concept of the Logos resulted in the interpretation of \"Holy Wisdom\" (\"Hagia Sophia\") as an aspect of Christ the Logos.\nThe expression itself is not found in the New Testament, even though passages in the Pauline epistles equate Christ with the \"wisdom of God\" (). The clearest form of the identification of Divine Wisdom with Christ comes in 1 Corinthians 1:17-2:13. In 1 Cor. 2:7, Paul speaks of the Wisdom of God as a mystery which was \"ordained before the world unto our glory\". \n\nFollowing 1 Corinthians, the Church Fathers named Christ as \"Wisdom of God\".\nTherefore, when rebutting claims about Christ's ignorance, Gregory of Nazianzus insisted that, inasmuch as he was divine, Christ knew everything: \"How can he be ignorant of anything that is, when he is Wisdom, the maker of the worlds, who brings all things to fulfilment and recreates all things, who is the end of all that has come into being?\" (\"Orationes\", 30.15). Irenaeus represents another, minor patristic tradition which identified the Spirit of God, and not Christ himself, as \"Wisdom\" (\"Adversus haereses\", 4.20.1–3; cf. 3.24.2; 4.7.3; 4.20.3). He could appeal to Paul's teaching about wisdom being one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:8). However, the majority applied to Christ the title/name of \"Wisdom\". \nConstantine the Great set a pattern for Eastern Christians by dedicating a church to Christ as the personification of Divine Wisdom. In Constantinople, under Justinian I, the Hagia Sophia (\"Holy Wisdom\") was rebuilt, consecrated in 538, and became a model for many other Byzantine churches. \nIn the Latin Church, however, \"the Word\" or \"Logos\" came through more clearly than \"the Wisdom\" of God as a central, high title of Christ. \n\nIn the theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Holy Wisdom is understood as the Divine Logos who became incarnate as Jesus; this belief being sometimes also expressed in some Eastern Orthodox icons. In the Divine Liturgy of the Orthodox Church, the exclamation \"Sophia!\" or in English \"Wisdom!\" will be proclaimed by the deacon or priest at certain moments, especially before the reading of scripture, to draw the congregation's attention to sacred teaching.\n\nThere is a hagiographical tradition, dating to the late sixth century, of a Saint Sophia and her three daughters, Saints Faith, Hope and Charity. This has been taken as the veneration of allegorical figures from an early time, and the group of saints has become popular in Russian Orthodox iconography as such (the names of the daughters rendered as ). The veneration of the three saints named for the three theological virtues probably arose in the 6th century.\n\nThe Christological identification of Christ the Logos with Divine Wisdom (\"Hagia Sophia\") is strongly represented in the iconographic tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church. A type of icon of the Theotokos is \"Wisdom hath builded Her house\" (), a quote from Proverbs 9:1 (\"Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars\") interpreted as prefiguring the incarnation, with the Theotokos being the \"house\" chosen by the \"hypostatic Wisdom\" (i.e. \"Wisdom\" as a person of the Trinity).\n\nIn Russian Orthodox mysticism, \"Sophia\" became increasingly indistinguishable from the person of the \"Theotokos\" (rather than Christ), to the point of the implication of the \"Theotokos\" as a \"fourth person of the Trinity\".\n\nSuch interpretations became popular in the late nineteenth to early twentienth century, forwarded by authors such as Vladimir Solovyov, Pavel Florensky, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Sergei Bulgakov.\nBulgakov's theology, known as \"Sophianism\", presented Divine Wisdom as \"consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity\", operating as the aspect of consubstantiality (ousia or physis, substantia or natura) or \"hypostaticity\" of the Trinity of the three hypostases, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, \"which safeguards the unity of the Holy Trinity\". It was the topic of a highly political controversy in the early 1930s and was condemned as heretical \nin 1935.online [ Intratext.com]</ref>\n\nWithin the Protestant tradition in England, Jane Leade, seventeenth-century Christian mystic, Universalist, and founder of the Philadelphian Society, wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the \"Virgin Sophia\" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the Universe.\nLeade was hugely influenced by the theosophical writings of sixteenth century German Christian mystic Jakob Böhme, who also speaks of the Sophia in works such as \"The Way to Christ\" (1624). Jakob Böhme was very influential to a number of Christian mystics and religious leaders, including George Rapp and the Harmony Society.\n\n\"Sophia\" is not a \"goddess\" in classical Greek tradition; Greek goddesses associated with wisdom are Metis and Athena (Latin Minerva). By the Roman Empire, it became common to depict the cardinal virtues and other abstract ideals, as female allegories. Thus, in the Library of Celsus in Ephesus, built in the 2nd century, there are four statues of female allegories, depicting wisdom (Sophia), knowledge (Episteme), intelligence (Ennoia) and valour (Arete). In the same period, \"Sophia\" assumes aspects of a goddess or angelic power in Gnosticism.\n\nIn Christian iconography, Holy Wisdom or \"Hagia Sophia\" was depicted as a female allegory from the medieval period. In Western (Latin) tradition, she appears as a crowned virgin; in Russian Orthodox tradition, she has a more supernatural aspect of a crowned woman with wings in a glowing red colour.\nThe virgin martyrs Faith Hope and Charity with their mother Sophia are depicted as three small girls standing in front of their mother in widow's dress.\n\n\"Allegory of Wisdom and Strength\" is a painting by Paolo Veronese, created circa 1565 in Venice. It is a large-scale allegorical painting depicting Divine Wisdom personified on the left and Hercules, representing Strength and earthly concerns, on the right.\n\nA goddess \"Sophia\" was introduced into Anthroposophy by its founder, Rudolf Steiner, in his book \"The Goddess: From Natura to Divine Sophia\" and a later compilation of his writings titled \"Isis Mary Sophia.\" Sophia also figures prominently in Theosophy, a spiritual movement which Anthroposophy was closely related to. Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, described it in her essay \"What is Theosophy?\" as an esoteric wisdom doctrine, and said that the \"Wisdom\" referred to was \"an emanation of the Divine principle\" typified by \"...some goddesses—Metis, Neitha, Athena, the Gnostic Sophia...\"\n\nSince the 1970s, Sophia has also been invoked as a goddess in Dianic Wicca and related currents of feminist spirituality.\n\nThe 1979 installation artwork \"The Dinner Party\" features a place setting for Sophia.\n\nThere is a monumental sculpture of Holy Wisdom depicted as a \"goddess\" in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria (the city itself is named after Saint Sofia Church). The sculpture was erected in 2000 to replace a statue of Lenin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "856265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=856265", "title": "Tripartite classification of authority", "text": "Tripartite classification of authority\n\nMax Weber distinguished three ideal types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority. He wrote about these three types of domination in both his essay \"The Three Types of Legitimate Rule\" which was published in his masterwork \"Economy and Society\" (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic speech \"Politics as a Vocation\" (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138).\n\nThese three types are ideal types and rarely appear in their pure form.\n\nAccording to Weber, authority is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. These three forms of authority are said to appear in an \"hierarchical development order\". States progress from \"charismatic authority\", to \"traditional authority\", and finally reach the \"state of rational-legal authority\" which is characteristic of a modern liberal democracy.\n\nCharismatic authority grows out of the personal charm or the strength of an individual personality. It was described by Weber in a lecture as \"the authority of the extraordinary and personal gift of grace (charisma)\"; he distinguished it from the other forms of authority by stating \"Men do not obey him [the charismatic ruler] by virtue of tradition or statute, but because they believe in him.\" Thus the actual power or capabilities of the leader are irrelevant, as long as the followers believe that such power exists. Thus, according to Weber, it is particularly difficult for charismatic leaders to maintain their authority because the followers must continue to legitimize the authority of the leader.\n\nCharismatic domination is insofar different from legal-rational and traditional power as it does not develop from established tradition but rather from the belief the followers have in the leader.\n\nAccording to Weber, once the leader loses his charisma or dies, systems based on charismatic authority tend to transform into traditional or legal-rational systems.\n\nIn traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition or custom; Weber described it as \"the authority of the eternal yesterday\" and identified it as the source of authority for monarchies. In this type of domination, the traditional rights of a powerful individual or group are accepted by the subordinate, or at least not challenged. The dominant individual could be a clan leader, eldest, the head of a family, a patriarchal figure or dominant elite. Historically this has been the most common type of government.\n\nAccording to Weber, inequalities are created and preserved by traditional authority. Should this authority not be challenged, the dominant leader or group will stay in power. For Weber, traditional power blocked the development of rational-legal authority.\n\nLegal authority, also known as rational-legal authority, is where an individual or institution exerts power by virtue of the legal office that they hold. It is the authority that demands obedience to the office rather than the officeholder; once they leave office, their rational-legal authority is lost. Weber identified \"rationally-created rules\" as the central feature of this form of authority. Modern democracies contain many examples of legal-rational regimes. There are different ways in which legal authority can develop. Many societies have developed a system of laws and regulations and there exist many different principles of legality. With the development of a legal-rational system, the political system is likely to be rationalized similarly. Constitutions, written documents, established offices and regular elections are often associated with modern legal-rational political systems. These in the past have tended to develop in opposition to earlier traditional systems such as monarchies, where the set of rules are not well developed. As these systems develop in a rational manner, authority takes on a legal-rational form. Those who govern have the legitimate legal right to do so and those subordinated accept the legality of the rulers.\n\nAlbeit rational-legal authority may be challenged by those subordinated, it is unlikely to result in a quick change in the nature of the system. Such power struggles, according to Weber, are mostly political struggles and may be based on nationalism or ethnicity.\n\nWeber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones, because the instability of charismatic authority inevitably forces it to \"routinize\" into a more structured form of authority. Likewise he notes that in a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a master can lead to a \"traditional revolution\". Thus he alludes to an inevitable move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilizing a bureaucratic structure. This ties to his broader concept of rationalization by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory.\n\nIn traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition, in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual (charisma), and in legal (or rational-legal) authority from powers that are bureaucratically and legally attached to certain positions. A classic example of these three types may be found in religion: priests (traditional), Jesus (charismatic), and the Roman Catholic Church (legal-rational). Weber also conceived of these three types within his three primary modes of conflict: traditional authority within status groups, charismatic authority within class, and legal-rational authority within party organizations.\n\nIn his view every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained elements that can be analyzed on the basis of the above distinction.\n\n\nWeber, Max (1978/1922). \"Economy and Society\", edited by Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich.

{"id": "44978473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44978473", "title": "Vibhu", "text": "Vibhu\n\nVibhu (Sanskrit:विभु) means – 'mighty', 'powerful', 'eminent', 'supreme', 'able to', 'capable of', 'self-subdued', 'firm' or 'self-controlled'; in Nyaya philosophy, it means – 'eternal', 'existing everywhere', 'all-pervading', 'pervading all material things'. This word also refers to \"manas\" or mind. This word has its root in the term, bhū ( भू), meaning – 'become', 'arise', 'come into existence'; thus \"vibhu\" means – 'expand', 'become manifest', 'appear', 'pervade'.\n\nFrom Atharvaveda it is learnt that Sudhanvan Angirasa had three sons, Ribhu, Vibhu and Vaja, collectively known as Ribhus who were intelligent sages. They carried the luminous power of knowledge to this world, which knowledge pervaded the world as nectar. Ribhu or Ribhukshan was skillful at handling knowledge; Vibhu or Vibhawa was skillful in pervading and diffusing, and Vaja handled embodied plenitude with similar skill; all three dwelled in the solar-region and are considered to be the rays of the sun. They are the three leaders of rites and the possessors of opulence, and the three deities of several Rig Vedic hymns.\n\nA mantra of the Rig Veda reads as follows:-\n\nIn the Rig Veda, the word, \"vibhu\", means – 'all-pervading unified entity that permeates or extends throughout a spatial expanse', as is in the afore-cited mantra wherein the phrase - एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजः which means - \" Though I be but one, let my might be extensive. \" Though the words, \"vibhu\" and \"prabhu\", appear in the Rig Veda but these words have a fixed psychological significance – \"vibhu\" means - 'coming into existence to pervade the whole being as \"ānanda\", and \"prabhu\" means - 'coming into existence as a specific object or particular experience within the range of one’s consciousness'. A sage of the Rig Veda (II.xxiv.11) asserts that:-\n\nBrihaspati, the lord of the heaven of light and the guardian of \"rta\", is present in all things and beings (\"vibhu\") same as the Brahman of the Vedanta.\n\nIn the Kaushitaki Upanishad, while describing the world of Brahman, there is the mention of the hall of Brahman called \"Vibhu\" (or built by \"Vibhu\" here meaning – 'egoism') arriving at which hall the glory of Brahman reaches the one who seeks liberation, where the seeker thinks himself to be Brahman, and thinking thus approaches the throne \"Vikakshanā\" ('perception'), in other words, the seeker having become liberated experiences Brahman, his own true nature. Gaudapada in his \"kārikā\" on the Mandukya Upanishad stating:-\n\ndescribes the fourth state (\"turiya\") as the ordainer (\"iśana\"), as the supreme lord (\"prabhu\"), as the non-dual (\"advaita\") and the all-pervading (\"vibhu\") god (\"devata\") of all beings. Here, the word, \"avyaya\", means that which is not subject to change; and \"turiya\" is \"vibhu\" because it pervades all the three states.\n\nAccording to all six orthodox Vedic \"darśanas\" which comprise Hindu philosophy, with the exception of Ramanuja’s 'theory of atomic dimensionless soul', the \"ātmān\" is \"vibhu\" ('omnipresent'). The followers of Jainism, who believe that the \"ātmān\" assumes the size corresponding to the size of the body it occupies, also believe that in the final state of liberation it remains unalterable, but they reject the Hindu theory of \"vibhu\" which to them does not explain if the soul is same at all times everywhere why for is there the experience individual self. Vedāntists argue that for the atman to be unchangeable in the state of liberation then it must be regarded either as \"anu\" ('minute') or as \"vibhu\" ('pervasive'). The contention of the Yoga school that the \"jivatman\" and the \"paramatman\" are both mere consciousnesses and both are all-pervading (\"vibhu\") and that \"moksha\" is merely the cessation of pain is also refuted – एतेन योगः प्रत्युक्तः (Brahma Sutras II.i.3).\n\nAdvaita Vedanta rests on the premise that only the substratum (Brahman) is real, the phenomenal world all with its properties and relations is unreal and due to \"maya\". Substance, in its pure subtle state is the constitutive cause of things, and in its rational state it is the substratum of qualities, actions, etc., and exists in nine forms – earth (\"prithivi\"), water (\"jala\"), fire (\"agni\"), air (\"vayu\"), space (\"akasha\") ('which five constitute the physical world'), direction (\"disha\") ('without which no movement is not possible'), time (\"kaal\") ('the substratum and the causal factor of all psycho-physical product and worldly behaviour'), mind (\"manas\") and self (\"ātmān\"); the first four and mind are \"paramanus\" ('infinitesimal') and the rest are \"vibhu\" ('ubiquitous'), simple and infinite. Vindhyāvāsī, giving up the doctrine of the three psychical organs, associates the processes of the faculty of knowledge (\"buddhi\") and I-consciousness with the thinking organ (\"manah\") which three were the great all –penetrating \"vibhu\". Vyasa too held mind (\"citta\") to be all-penetrating (\"vibhu\"). Shankara explains that \" the Self (Brahman), which is by nature all-pervasive (\"vibhu\") assumes the form and qualities of the \"buddhi\" when apparently moving in the cycle of empirical existence. \" Brahman, who is omnipresent (\"sarvagata\"), is without attributes; Brahman with attributes is Ishvara, who is \"vibhu\" possessing \"mahāmāyā\", and who through his diverse powers creates all this diversity experienced through the senses.\n"}
