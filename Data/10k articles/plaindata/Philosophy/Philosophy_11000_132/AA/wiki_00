He is also one of the \"Seven Saints\" (Sabʿatou Rijal) of the city. His festival was founded by Abu Ali al-Hassan al-Yusi at the instigation of Moulay Ismael.\n\nAl-Abbas was born in Ceuta, but moved to Marrakesh in 1145-6, during the final weeks of the Almohad siege of the city. For a number of years he lived in a cave on the hill of Igilliz outside Marrakesh, only coming into town on Fridays for the communal prayer.\n\nThe Almohad sultan Yaqub al-Mansur was a disciple of al-Abbas. He asked him to come and live in the city and provided him a house, a hostel for his disciples as well as a madrasa for study. Teaching was maintained by the sultan's own funds. Whenever Yaqub al-Mansur visited al-Abbas he made a point of behaving in a humble manner and acting \"as a servant\".\n\nTo al-Abbas, every act of human mercy (\"rahma\") evoked a merciful response from the all-merciful God (\"ar-Rahim\"). Al-Abbas summed up his theory of reciprocity with the maxim: \"[Divine] Being is actualised by generosity\" (al-wujud yanfa ilu bi'l-jud). The Andalusian philosopher Ibn Rushd visited al-Abbas several times in Marrakesh.\n\nWhen al-Abbas died in 1204, he was buried at the graveyard of Sidi Marouk, near Bab Taghzout. In 1605, the Saadian sultan Abu Faris erected a mausoleum for al-Abbas, hoping that the saint's power would help him recover from his epilepsy. In 1998, sultan Hassan II improved the sanctuary. It is also the place of his zawiyya.\n\nAl-Abbas's hagiography, \"Akhbar Abi'l-Abbas as-Sabti\", written by Abu Ya’qub Yusuf ibn Yahya at-Tadili, was in part composed by al-Abbas himself and contains many autobiographical passages.\n\n"}

He is also known for a quintessential book on human sexuality he took thirty years of his life to write, 'Tantra: The Cult of the Feminine'.\n\nAndré Van Lysebeth worked most of his life in a publishing house, in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. He is one of the first Westerners to have practiced and taught yoga. Soon enough, he heard about a famous Indian yoga teacher, Swami Sivananda. He read the books he could find and started to save money to visit him in India. When World War II was over, he traveled to India by car (from Belgium) with his wife and his children. In Rishikesh, he met Shivananda and attended his classes in his yoga institute, today known as the Sivananda Ashram. Upon André's return to Europe, he opened a yoga studio and became a yoga instructor. \n\nDuring the following years, he went back to the school of his Master several times, again driving his car all the way to India and then, as the flights became cheaper, by plane. He became a popular teacher and wrote a book, \"Yoga Self-Taught\". This book was published in Paris in 1968 and became a yoga bestseller.\n\nIn the seventies, he started a new project, \"the Yoga Vacation\", that consisted in holidaying in a pleasant place, such as in a quiet resort in Spain or in Italy, and twice a day or more meeting for a yoga practice, a pranayama practice or another suchlike practice. This became popular and led him to a new project, \"the Yoga Teacher Training\". In turn, these trainings became popular and André Van Lysebeth became one of the most influential teacher of teachers in Europe. In the yoga field, everybody knew him. \n\nFrom then to his death, he kept teaching yoga classes and teacher training courses during the year and animating yoga vacations during the summertime. But it isn't all yet: he published a yoga magazine every month all by himself and sold it to his numerous students. This magazine was simply called \"Yoga\". He wrote it singlehandedly from 1968 to 2004.\n\nShivananda wasn't his only yoga teacher. He met and learned with countless others he met during one of his trips to India, where he went at least once a year from 1950 to his death. Among the other teachers, let us mention K. Pattabhi Jois. Van Lysebeth's book “Yoga Self-Taught” (“J'apprends le yoga”) helped bring western attention to Pattabhi Jois and his ashtanga vinyasa system.\n\n\n"}

According to one story, at the age of three Hakuseki managed to copy a Confucian book written in Kanji, character by character. Because he was born on the same year as the Great Fire of Meireki and because he was hot tempered and his brow would crease looking like 火 or \"fire\", he was affectionately called \"Hi no Ko\" (火の子) or \"child of fire\". He was a retainer of Hotta Masatoshi, but after Masatoshi was assassinated by Inaba Masayasu, the Hotta clan was forced to move from Sakura to Yamagata then to Fukushima and the domain's income declined. Hakuseki offered to leave, becoming a \"rōnin\" and studied under Confucianist Kinoshita Jun'an. He was offered a post by the largest \"han\", that of Kaga Domain, but he offered the position to a fellow samurai.\n\nIn 1693, Hakuseki was called up to serve by the side of Manabe Akifusa as a \"brain\" for the Tokugawa shogunate and shogun Tokugawa Ienobu. He went on to displace the official Hayashi advisers to become the leading confucianist for Ienobu and Tokugawa Ietsugu. While some of Hakuseki's policies were still carried out after Ienobu's death, after the 6th shogun, Tokugawa Ietsugu, died and Tokugawa Yoshimune's rule began, Hakuseki left his post to begin his career as a prolific writer of Japanese history and Occidental studies.\n\nHe was buried in Asakusa (current day Taitō, Tokyo), Hoonji temple but was later moved to Nakano, Tokyo, Kotokuji temple.\n\nUnder the top Rōjū, Abe Seikyo, with strong support from Ienobu, he launched Shōtoku no chi, a series of economic policies designed to improve the shogunate's standing. By minting new and better quality currency, inflation was controlled. Calculating from trade records, Hakuseki deduced that fully 25% of gold and 75% of silver in Japan had been spent on trades with foreign countries. Concerned that Japan's national resources were at risk, he implemented a new trade policy, the \"Kaihaku Goshi Shinrei\" (海舶互市新例), to control payments to Chinese and Dutch merchants by demanding that instead of precious metals, products like silk, porcelain, and dried seafoods should be used for trading. However, the beneficial effects of this policy were limited as the trade of precious metals from Tsushima and Satsuma was uncontrolled by the \"bakufu\".\n\nHe also simplified rituals for welcoming the Joseon dynasty's ambassadors, in the face of opposition from the Tsushima Confucianist Amenomori Hōshu.\n\nHakuseki applied the mandate of heaven to both the emperor and the \"shōgun\". Since there had been no revolution to change Japan's basic institutions, he argued that the shogun was subordinate to the emperor and that in showing good governance, moral fortitude and respect to the emperor a shogun proved that he held divine right. He also traced Tokugawa family roots back to the Minamoto clan and thus to a line of imperial descent in order to show that Ieyasu's political supremacy had been fitting. To strengthen the shogun's power and maintain national prestige he proposed changing the title to koku-ō – nation-king.\n\nHakuseki's published writings encompass 237 works in 390 publications in 6 languages and 3,163 library holdings.\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes treated as a kriya or 'cleansing action' along with kapalabhati to clear the airways in preparation for other pranayama techniques. Bhastrika involves a rapid and forceful inhalation and exhalation powered by the movement of the diaphragm. The movement of air is accompanied by an audible sound. One inhale and exhale equals one round of bhastrika and it may be repeated for many consecutive rounds. B. K. S. Iyengar explains that the similar \"process or kriyā of \"kapālabhāti\" is a milder form of Bhastrikā Prāṇāyāma. Swami Sivananda describes the process: \"inhale and exhale quickly ten times like the bellows of the blacksmith. Constantly dilate and contract. When you practise this Pranayama a hissing sound is produced. The practitioner should start with rapid expulsions of breath following one another in rapid succession. When the required number of expulsions, say ten for a round, is finished, the final expulsion is followed by a deepest possible inhalation. The breath is suspended as long as it could be done with comfort. Then deepest possible exhalation is done very slowly. The end of this deep exhalation completes one round of Bhastrika\".\n"}

In Korean, \"dahn\" means \"primal, vital energy\", and \"hak\" means \"study of a particular theory or philosophy\". News sources have described its exercises as \"a blend of yoga, tai chi, and martial arts exercises\". Dahn Yoga is taught through for-profit and non-profit studios as well as community centers. Ilchi Lee's brain education is considered pseudoscience.\n\nAccording to \"Dahn Yoga Basics\", a book published by Dahn Yoga Education, Dahn Yoga has \"three unique characteristics\": \"the mastery and use of energy\", \"enhancing the body-brain connection\", and \"self-managed, holistic health care\". The practice draws upon traditional notions of ki, also known as chi or qi. A typical class begins with what is called \"Meridian Stretching\" exercise, which is believed to stimulate the energy in the body. After these stretching exercises, practitioners normally follow a sequence of postures. Classes often include elements of meditation, as well.\n\nAn article by three physicians from Weill Cornell Medical College published in the \"Journal of General Internal Medicine\" reported the conclusions of a 3-month study of community-based mind-body training methods. The study surveyed 171 adults enrolled at various Body & Brain Centers in the New York City area. All of the participants had taken ten or fewer classes at the beginning of the study. The article concludes that participants reported \"moderate improvements after 3 months of practice\" with increased scores \"in all [of the surveyed] domains of health-related quality of life, fewer depressive symptoms, less trait anxiety, and greater self-efficacy\".\n\n\"Brain Wave Vibration\" is promoted as a mental and physical health enhancement technique developed by Ilchi Lee. According to Lee, brain waves are a type of vibration that has a significant effect on a person’s health and outlook on life. A form of moving meditation (head-shaking), the technique was described by one Body & Brain instructor: \"By shaking your head and vibrating your body, you bring healing energy. You just need to close your eyes and turn your head right and left, right and left, focusing on the center of your brain and keeping a rhythm. Afterwards, you feel very rejuvenated!\" As part of CNN's three-part investigation into controversy and lawsuits surrounding Dahn Yoga, Neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta was asked about testimonials that Brain Wave Vibration \"lowered blood pressure, corrected lazy eyes, [and] even reduced symptoms of multiple sclerosis.\" Gupta stated that the notion of vibrating the brain or other parts of the body to turn parts of the brain on and off is not grounded in science and that anecdotes are not empirically verifiable.\n\nIn 2010 a study sponsored by Ilchi Lee's Korean Institute of Brain Science (KIBS) and published in \"Neuroscience Letters\" examined the impact of Brain Wave Vibration training. The study showed subjects who engaged in Dahn Yoga led meditation reported lower levels of stress compared to the control group, which did not practice any sort of meditation. Another KIBS-sponsored study published in \"Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" showed that Brain Wave Vibration meditation reduced stress similarly to Iyengar Yoga and Mindfulness meditation.\n\nThe tradenames \"Brain Education\", and \"Brain Education Systems Training\" (or BEST), refer to a set of exercises developed and promoted by Ilchi Lee subsequent to his \"Brain Respiration\" and \"Dahnhak.\" According to Body & Brain's Web site, after more than 27 years of practice, Lee had developed a system of exercises, breathing, and stretches “to activate the natural healing rhythms of the brain and body.” Brain Education is described as consisting of five separate steps: brain sensitizing, brain versatilizing, brain refreshing, brain integrating, and brain mastering. Dr. Ben Goldacre of the U.K. lambasted Ilchi Lee's brain education claims as pseudoscience in his Guardian column \"Bad Science\" in 2004.\n\nIn 1985 the first Dahn Yoga Center opened in downtown Seoul. By 1990, fifty locations were teaching Dahn Yoga in South Korea. In 1991, the first U.S. Dahn Yoga Center was opened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1997 the Sedona Ilchi Meditation Center (SIMC) was established, hosting specialized programs open to Dahn yoga members for a fee. Over the next ten years Dahn yoga focused on expanding its operations globally.\n\nThe Dahn Yoga Foundation was created in 2006, offering classes for free or at reduced rates in senior centers, community centers, churches, public parks, offices, schools and hospitals. In addition to the outreach classes, Dahn Yoga Foundation volunteers participate in community service projects.\n\nIn late 2015, Dahn Yoga changed its name to Body & Brain.\n\nThere have been accusations that the organization operates a manipulative \"cult\" that uses coercive persuasion and thought reform methods to create deeply devoted Dahn masters (teachers) who persuade others to devote all their time, energy, and money to Body & Brain programs, events, and ceremonies, and to become loyal Dahn masters themselves.\n\nIn 2002, a former Body & Brain employee filed a civil lawsuit in Alameda County, California, for Unfair Business Practices and Undue Influence against Seung Heun Lee, et al. The case was reportedly settled out of court with no admission of guilt.\n\nSeveral popular media outlets reported on the plaintiffs' allegations, including Glamour Magazine, WE tv, and CNN; WBZ Channel 4 News in Boston interviewed two of the claimants on June 11, 2009.\n\nOn January 5, 2010, CNN broadcast a critical report about the organization with interviews of former Brain & Body members alleging severe physical, mental and financial abuse by Brain & Body personnel and staff, including one former member stating she was coerced into donating funds to the organization by taking out student loans totalling over US$40,000. Allegations were dismissed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona August 25, 2010.\n\nRolling Stone Magazine published an article in March 2010 entitled \"The Yoga Cult\" alleging that \"Dahn's calling itself 'yoga' is just a marketing ploy to enhance its appeal to Americans;\" that instead it is a mind control cult designed to part people from their money. According to the article, the group brought in $30 million in the U.S. in 2009 and charges as much as $100,000 for a seminar.\n\nAn article in Forbes magazine in July 2009 contained similar allegations against Body & Brain. It reported allegations by former members that they were pressured to train to become paid “Dahn Masters,” paying up to $10,000 each for workshops that lasted as long as three weeks. If students could not afford the training, the article states, they were encouraged to take out loans and carry credit card debt. Plaintiffs in a suit against the group claim that once they became \"Dahn Masters\" they were then given recruitment and revenue quotas that had them working up to 120 hours per week.\n\nAmong other media reports, a 2006 CBS news report and the Village Voice described a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Body & Brain's founder and related entities. According to the lawsuit, Julia Siverls, 41, died in 2003 from heat stroke and dehydration during a master training hike at the Ilchi Meditation Center in Sedona. The lawsuit also accuses the Lee of \"breaking wage and immigration laws, evading taxes and sexually abusing female disciples.\" According to a document filed by the Southern District of New York of the United States District Court, the case was dismissed on August 1, 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "1421820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1421820", "title": "Catholic Charismatic Renewal", "text": "Catholic Charismatic Renewal\n\nCatholic Charismatic Renewal is a spiritual movement within the Catholic Church that incorporates aspects of both Catholic and Charismatic Movement practice. It is influenced by some of the teachings of Protestantism and Pentecostalism with an emphasis on having a personal relationship with Jesus and expressing the gifts of the Holy Spirit.\n\nParishes that practice charismatic worship usually hold prayer meetings outside of Mass and feature such gifts as prophecy, faith healing, and glossolalia. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, a Catholic church describes charismatic worship as \"uplifted hands during songs and audible praying in tongues.\" It further distinguishes a charismatic congregation as one that emphasises complete surrender to Jesus in all parts of life, obedience to both the Gospel and Catholic teaching, as well as Christ-centred friendships.\n\nPerceptions of the Charismatic movement vary within the Catholic Church. Proponents hold the belief that certain \"charismata\" (a Greek word for \"gifts\") are still bestowed by the Holy Spirit today as they were in Early Christianity as described in the Bible. Critics accuse Charismatic Catholics of misinterpreting, or in some cases violating, Church teachings on worship and liturgy. Traditional Catholics, in particular, argue that charismatic practices shift the focus of worship away from reverent communion with Christ in the Eucharist and towards individual emotions and non-liturgical experiences as a substitute.\n\nRenewal advocates believe that the charisms identified in Saint Paul's writings, especially in , , and , continue to exist and to build up the Church (see Catechism of the Catholic Church, §2003). The nine charismatic gifts considered extraordinary in character include: faith, expression of knowledge and wisdom, miracles, the gift of tongues and their interpretation, prophecy, discernment of spirits and healing.() These gifts are related to the traditional seven gifts of the Holy Spirit described in (wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord, as listed in Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1831). The nine charismatic gifts in are also related to the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Other references to charisms in the Catechism of the Catholic Church include §§688, 768, 799-801, 890, 951, 1508 (charism of healing) and 2035. The belief that spiritual gifts exist in the present age is called Continuationism.\n\nIn search of a Spiritual experience, professors from Duquesne University, a Catholic university in Pittsburgh, attended the Congress of the Cursillo movement in August 1966. While visiting, they were introduced to the book entitled \"The Cross and the Switchblade\", which emphasized the Holy Spirit and the Spirit’s charisms. This book became the focus of their studies and further led them to pursue the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn January 1967, professors Ralph Keifer and Patrick Bourgeois attended a prayer meeting where they ultimately received the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The following week, Keifer laid hands on other Duquesne professors, and they also had an experience with the Spirit. Then, in February, during a gathering of Duquesne University students at The Ark and The Dove Retreat Center north of Pittsburgh, more people asked Keifer to pray over them. This led to the event at the chapel where they too received the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues, as well as many other students who were present in the chapel. Keifer sent the news of this event to the University of Notre Dame, where a similar event later occurred, and the Renewal began to spread.\n\nAdherents of the movement formed prayer groups called covenant communities. In these communities, members practiced a stronger commitment to spiritual ideals and created documents, or covenants, that set up rules of life. One of the first structured covenant communities was the Word of God Community. It affiliated with the International Communications Office in the 1980s, and its continued growth resulted in a larger overall community called The Sword of the Spirit. The original Word of God Community eventually split from The Sword of the Spirit, however. Of the two original founders of the communities, one stayed with the Word of God and founded an international ministry that reached Eastern Europe and Africa, while the other remained president of the Sword of the Spirit, which as of 2007, had 47 member communities and 16 affiliated communities around the world.\n\nIn addition to the covenant institutions, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal also experienced international development due to missionary priests who experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit while visiting the United States and implemented their own such services when they returned home. The International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services had a significant role in the guidance of this form of expansion.\n\nAs of 2013, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal exists in over 230 countries in the world and 120 primary local government units of the Philippines, with over 160 million members. Participants in the Renewal also cooperate with non-Catholic ecclesiastical communities and other Catholics for ecumenism, as encouraged by the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Charismatic element of the Church is seen as being evident today as it was in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic communities conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn response to the invitation of Pope Francis, ICCRS and Catholic Fraternity are organizing together the Catholic Charismatic Renewal Golden Jubilee event in 2017. The event began on May 31 and celebrations continued until Pentecost Mass on June 4.\n\nThe initial reaction to the movement by the Church hierarchy was cautiously supportive. Some initially supported it as being a harbinger of ecumenism (greater unity of Gospel witness among the different Christian traditions). It was thought that these practices would draw the Catholic Church and Protestant communities closer together in a truly spiritual ecumenism. Today, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal enjoys support from most of the Church's hierarchy, from the Pope to bishops of dioceses around the world, as a recognized ecclesial movement.\n\nFour popes have acknowledged the movement: Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Pope Francis. Pope Paul VI acknowledged the movement in 1971 and reaffirmed it in 1975. He went on to say that the movement brought vitality and joy to the Church but also mentioned for people to be discerning of the spirits. Pope John Paul II was also supportive of the Renewal and was in favor of its conservative politics. He (as well as then-Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI) acknowledged good aspects of the movement while urging caution, pointing out that members must maintain their Catholic identity and communion with the Catholic Church.\n\nPope John Paul II, in particular, made a number of statements on the movement. On November 30, 1990, The Pontifical Council for the Laity promulgated the decree which inaugurated the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships. Brian Smith of Brisbane, elected President of the Executive of the Fraternity, called the declaration the most significant event in the history of the charismatic renewal since the 1975 Holy Year international conference and the acknowledgment it received from Pope Paul VI at that time, saying: \"It is the first time that the Renewal has had formal, canonical recognition by the Vatican.\"\n\nIn March 1992, Pope John Paul II stated At this moment in the Church's history, the Charismatic Renewal can play a significant role in promoting the much-needed defense of Christian life in societies where secularism and materialism have weakened many people's ability to respond to the Spirit and to discern God's loving call. Your contribution to the re-evangelization of society will be made in the first place by personal witness to the indwelling Spirit and by showing forth His presence through works of holiness and solidarity.\nMoreover, during Pentecost 1998, the Pope recognized the essential nature of the charismatic dimension:\n\n\"The institutional and charismatic aspects are co-essential as it were to the Church’s constitution. They contribute, although differently, to the life, renewal and sanctification of God’s People. It is from this providential rediscovery of the Church’s charismatic dimension that, before and after the Council, a remarkable pattern of growth has been established for ecclesial movements and new communities.\"\n\nThe Papal Preacher, Rev. Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, has written on the topic numerous times since 1986.\n\nCharismatic Catholics and their practices have been criticized for distracting Catholics from authentic Church teachings and traditions, especially by making the worship experience more akin to Pentecostal Protestantism. According to Samuel Rodriguez, Charismatic services in America simply help in increasing the number of Catholics converting to Pentecostal and evangelical denominations: “If you are involved in a Charismatic service today, in ten years’ time—inevitably—you are going to end up in one of my churches.”\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that Christ is actually present on the altar in the sacrifice of the Mass, when a priest consecrates bread and wine to become the body and blood of Jesus. Critics of the charismatic movement argue that practices such as faith healing draw attention away from the Mass and the communion with Christ that takes place therein.\n\nOthers criticize the movement for removing or obscuring traditional Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix and Sacred Heart) in favor of more contemporary expressions of faith.\n\nThe belief that extraordinary spiritual gifts no longer operate in ordinary circumstances is called Cessationism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25693972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25693972", "title": "Charles De Koninck", "text": "Charles De Koninck\n\nCharles De Koninck (29 July 1906 – 13 February 1965) was a Belgian-Canadian Thomist philosopher and theologian. As director of the Department of Philosophy at the Université Laval in Quebec, he influenced Catholic philosophy in French Canada and also influenced Catholic philosophers in English Canada and the United States. The author of many books and articles in French and English, he contributed to a variety of philosophical fields including natural philosophy, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, and political philosophy, but he also wrote on theology, especially Mariology.\n\nDe Koninck was the founder of the so-called Laval School of philosophy, and mentored a number of philosophers, including Ralph McInerny, who published an English translation of De Koninck's collected works.\n\nDe Koninck was born in Torhout, Belgium, the son of Louis De Koninck and Marie Verplancke, both natives of Torhout. In 1914, the De Koninck family emigrated to the United States, where Louis De Koninck worked as a builder and contractor in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn 1921 Charles returned to Belgium to complete his education. He first went to school in Ostende, where he studied mainly mathematics, chemistry, and physics, but where he also read widely in Latin, Greek, Dutch, and English Literature. He then studied philosophy at the Catholic University of Louvain, where he became a Thomist. After attending the University of Detroit, he returned to Louvain and earned a doctorate summa cum laude with a dissertation on Sir Arthur Eddington's philosophy of science.\n\nIn 1934, De Koninck began work at the Université Laval in Quebec, where he became a full professor the following year, a position which he held for the rest of his life. Between 1939 and 1956 he was dean of the faculty of philosophy at Laval.\n\nAs member of the Royal Society of Canada, De Koninck and his family hosted and entertained many well-known people in their Quebec City residence, among them Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his writer-artist wife, Consuelo Suncín during their five-week stay in the province in the spring of 1942. The De Konincks' eight-year-old son, Thomas De Koninck, whom Saint-Exupéry met, may have served as an inspiration for the extraterrestrial visitor of his well-known novella, \"The Little Prince\".\n\nDe Koninck devoted a good portion of his philosophical work to the philosophy of nature. De Koninck's graduate career at Louvain led him to write a dissertation under Fernand Renoirte, himself a philosopher of science, on the philosophy of Sir Arthur Eddington. His dissertation attempted to parlay between classical Thomistic philosophy and Eddington's philosophy of science, shaped by recent developments in relativity theory and quantum theory.\n\nWhile De Koninck's initial view of the relationship between philosophy and the experimental sciences followed a separatist line akin to that of Jacques Maritain, a later development in his thinking portrayed the modern sciences as \"dialectical extensions\" of metaphysics and, more proximately, the philosophy of nature. Over the course of his career, De Koninck published articles addressing overlapping issues in classical Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy and quantum indeterminism, the biological sciences, the foundation of mathematical physics, and the philosophy of mathematics. The most accessible introduction to his thought in the philosophy of nature and science are his Whidden Lectures of 1959, published as a collection titled \"The Hollow Universe\". In the three lectures, De Koninck addresses the philosophical foundations, content, and implications of three modern scientific inquiries: modern mathematics (\"The World of Symbolic Construction, or Two is One Twice Over\"), physics (\"Mental Construction and the Test of Experience\"), and biology (\"The Lifeless World of Biology\"). The epilogue to the book, \"Reckoning with the Computers,\" extends the theme of the hollow universe from the realm of mathematics, physics, and biology to the account of man himself. Scholar Leslie Armour maintains that \"our place as knowing beings suggests to De Koninck that nature and knowing beings are so designed as to go together, and so designed as to be unintelligible without one another.\"\n\nAlong with Henri Grenier and Louis Lachance, De Koninck was a prominent Thomist critic of personalism. De Koninck's book \"On the Primacy of the Common Good: Against the Personalists\" criticized personalist thinkers for claiming that the common good ought to be subordinate to the private good of persons. De Koninck did not name the personalists whom he had in mind, but Yves Simon and I. Th. Eschmann assumed that he was thinking of Jacques Maritain. Yves Simon agreed with De Koninck's rejection of the subordination of the common good to the person, but denied that it applied to Maritain. Eschmann, on the other hand, defended the subordination of the common good to the person and claimed that this was in fact taught by Maritain.\n\n\n\n"}

His sister, Lydia Maria, later became an important reformer.\n\nFrancis studied to become a minister at Harvard Divinity School. He was minister of the Watertown, Massachusetts, Unitarian Church from 1819 to 1842. Francis taught Theodore Parker beginning in 1832 and preached at his ordination ceremony in 1840. Francis encouraged Parker when his translations and books were not selling well. He wrote of his \"astonishment at your labors and learning\", but criticized the recent lack of interest in reading, writing \"the cry is all for action—for doing something, not moping over books as they say\". Both Francis and Parker joined the Transcendental Club in the 1830s, an organization which included members such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Margaret Fuller. Being one of the elders of the group, in fact the eldest member who was also a moderator of the Club, he influenced other members. Preaching at a time when Unitarians were breaking into sometimes-hostile factions in New England, he wrote that \"the condition of things with us in the religious world is anything but pleasant... The cauldron is kept boiling, & all sorts of materials are thrown into it\".\n\nAfter 1842, Francis was Parkman Professor of Pulpit Eloquence at Harvard. His books and writings include \"Christianity as a Purely Internal Principle,\" \"Life of John Eliot, Apostle to the Indians\" and \"A Historical Sketch of Watertown\" (1830). He died in 1863, one year after Transcendental Club co-member Henry David Thoreau died.\n\n"}

It was originally coined by the Polish-American philosopher and sociologist Florian Znaniecki in his book \"Cultural Reality\" (1919) in English and later translated into Polish as \"kulturalizm\". Znaniecki had introduced a similar concept in earlier Polish language publications which he described as \"humanism\" (\"humanizm\").\n\nZnaniecki's culturalism was based on philosophies and theories of Matthew Arnold (Culture and Anarchy), Friedrich Nietzsche (voluntarism), Henri Bergson (creative evolutionism), Wilhelm Dilthey (philosophy of life), William James, John Dewey (pragmatism) and Ferdinand C. Schiller (humanism).\n\nZnaniecki was critical of a number of then-prevalent philosophical viewpoints: intellectualism, idealism realism naturalism and rationalism. He was also critical of irrationalism and intuitionism.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, Znaniecki proposed a new theoretical framework. His \"culturalism\" was an ontological and epistemological approach aiming to eliminate dualisms such as the belief that nature and culture are opposite realities.\n\nThis approach allowed him to \"define social phenomena in cultural terms\". Znaniecki was arguing for the importance of culture, noting that our culture shapes our view of the world and our thinking. Znaniecki notes that while the world is composed of physical artifacts, we are not really capable of studying the physical world other than through the lenses of culture.\n\nAmong the fundamental aspects of the philosophy of culturalism are two categories: value and action. Elżbieta Hałas, who calls it an \"antithesis to the intellectual dogmas of naturalism\", identifies the following assumptions:\n\nZnaniecki's philosophy of culturalism laid the foundation for his larger theoretical system, based around another concept of his, \"humanistic coefficient.\" Through originally a philosophical concept, culturalism was further developed by Znaniecki to inform his sociological theories.\n\nZnaniecki's culturalism influenced modern sociological views of antipositivism and antinaturalism.\n\n"}

The disjunction is between appearance and the reality behind the appearance \"making itself perceptually manifest to someone.\"\n\nVeridical perceptions and hallucinations are not members of a common class of mental states or events. According to this theory, the only thing common to veridical perceptions and hallucinations is that in both cases, the subject cannot tell, via introspection, whether he is having a veridical perception or not. Disjunctivists claim this because they hold that in veridical perception, a subject's experience actually presents the external, mind-independent object of that perception. Further, they claim that in a hallucination there is no external object to be related to, nor are there sense-data to be a part of the perception. Thus, disjunctivism is a form of naive realism or direct realism.\n\nDisjunctivism was first introduced to the contemporary literature by Michael Hinton, and has subsequently been associated with John McDowell. Disjunctivists often hold that an important virtue of their view is that it captures the common sense idea that perception involves a relation to objects in the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "41813997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41813997", "title": "El Mercado de Los Angeles", "text": "El Mercado de Los Angeles\n\nBuilt in 1968, El Mercado de Los Angeles is located in the Boyle Heights district of the city of Los Angeles east of the LA River and adjacent to East Los Angeles (an unincorporated portion of the County of Los Angeles often cited as the heart of the Mexican/American community) on the corner of 1st Street and Lorena Street and is accessible by the Metro Gold Line's Indiana Station located two blocks east. El Mercado is a three-floor indoor shopping center that offers dining and restaurant services, entertainment with live mariachi bands and shopping from various vendors. Although El Mercado is themed and represents a space that honors Mexico and Mexican culture, other Latinos from different ethnicities visit and shop there.\n\nAs an indoor shopping and meeting place, El Mercado also provides economic agency for Latinos as vendors selling music and films, exotic boots, belts, hats, a jewelry store, Mexican handcrafts, toys, cosmetics and services such as travel and sending money to their natal communities. Through selling and bartering Latino vendors engage in market exchanges that give agency to both the buyer and seller. El Mercado de Los Angeles is a place where Latinos can gather together for social purposes and to enjoy cultural experiences through food, music, and other forms of semiotics such as the paintings on the buildings and a mural of the Virgen de Guadalupe that link them to their native lands.\n\nIn East Los Angeles, Latinos constitute approximately 97.1% of the population. The heavy population of Latinos in East Los Angeles demonstrates the appropriation of space due to the process of de-territorialization. De-territorialization of culture refers to the weakening relationships between culture and place. Traditionally, many thought of culture restricted in localized terms, that is cultural was rooted to a particular geographical area, nation, or state but as East Los Angeles proves different, Latinos as cultural subjects, continue to traverse national borders bringing along with them their cultural practices and traditions in different territories. Territorialization on the other hand can be more understood as the process of turning a space into a place, as explained by Clara Irazabal and Ramzi Farhart in their article “Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City”.\n\nEl Mercado is place that allows Latinos to assert their identity to foster a sense of belonging and build an intimate community space. Lourdes Gutierrez Nájera explains in her article “Hayandoese: Zapotec Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging” how Yalaltecos communities in Los Angeles affirm their identity and create a sense of ethnic belonging and community through participation in life cycle events and every day practices.\n\nIn his article “Swap meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: a community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods”, Jeffrey Edwin Juarez describes swap meets as regular meeting spaces that people treat as recreation places, much like a park, to spend time together. El Mercado is a community pace for Latino’s for both local’s and visitors to interact, spend time together and share experiences. One way El Mercado fosters its community space is through its large restaurant located on the third floor popularly known as El Mercadito, which is actually themed in to three different restaurants representing different cities of Mexico that make up the one large restaurant. El Mercadito restaurant is widely used by families and friends as a community space to make reservations for birthday celebrations, wedding receptions, quincenera receptions, and other banquet purposes.\n\nEl Mercado de Los Angeles serves a significant economic purpose for Latinos in the Los Angeles region. For the customers at El Mercado, the mercado provides affordable items that make shopping accessible for people across income levels. Also importantly, mercados foster relationships between vendors. Competition between vendors exists, but mercados in general often function as sites of both economic competition and collaboration between vendors within the mercado. The sense of competition is increased between the relationship between vendor and customer.\n\nAt swap meets, or mercados like El Mercado, complex relationships exist between buyers and sellers. Mercados are less bureaucratic spaces that corporate stores or even independent businesses. Vendors must apply for a permit at El Mercado, yet the vendors frequently make informal exchanges such as bartering/trading, or bargaining for prices. These informal market exchanges give agency to both the buyer and seller because each have a role in setting the terms of the business transaction. El Mercado de Los Ángeles not only provides cultural significance to the consumers who come to it, but it also provides a space for affordable items and economic negotiation.\n\nEl Mercado de Los Angeles offers a variety of services that help send off monetary remittances to Latin America. The Mercado also provides travel and calling services that help customers participate in the formation of cultural remittances to Latin America.\n\nEl Mercado also serves as an important site of cultural and monetary remittances between the United States and México, specifically. This mercado is a site of cultural that is the product of cultural hybridities. It is also a site that actively constructs cultural hybridities in the United States and México. El Mercado offers services to send money back to México securely as well as offering a currency exchange between pesos and United States dollars. Customers are able to send monetary remittance home to México by using the services at the Mercado. These services also assist vendors at the Mercado send some of the profits that they make at the Mercado to family members or communities abroad. These remittances are often directed at families or hometown associations.\n\nThe Mercado de Los Angeles also facilitates opportunities to create cultural remittances for Latino migrants. The mercado offers international calling services and a travel agency that sells international plane tickets. These services aid the fluid migratory process that physically transports migrants from their countries of origin to the countries of current residence. Along with the physical transportation, the Mercado specializes in transculturated goods and items. Many of the stores specialize in traditional Mexican clothing, books, or films. Yet, these traditional items are presented in a transculturated context, outside of México or Latin America. The mercado becomes a transculturated site that participates in cultural remittance when it facilitates the physical circular migration of migrants returning to their home country. Migrants returning home bring cultural remittances to the land that they left, and El Mercado de Los Angeles is an important site of this cultural remittance process in Los Angeles.\n\nEl Mercado de Los Angeles actively produces and shapes culture through a variety of ways. Semiotics describes a series of processes in which meaning is given to the world around humans. As humans interpret visual sensory clues about the world, meaning and culture are produced. At the mercado, mariachi music and visual murals are two principal ways that semiotic processes produce culture.\n\nThe cultural significance of El Mercado is complemented by presence of semiotic cultural elements such as music and the murals present at El Mercado. Semiotics is a process through which visuals, sounds, and other sensory experiences are given meaning and made socially significant. The process of semiotic meaning-making is present at the mercado, especially through the mariachi restaurants. The third floor of the mercado is composed of three restaurants that are well known for not only the food but the mariachi music that they all play. Dolores Inés Casillas, a theorist who writes about cultural semiotics, considers listening to sound a political practice. She views nostalgic sounds from home countries as a means of remembering the home country while constructing space in the land of migration. This sense of political listening supports the idea that El Mercado de Los Angeles is an active sight of cultural production through the visuals and music present at the mercado.\n\nThe Mercado de Los Angeles website also portrays some of the several murals that are present at this marketplace. The themed mariachi restaurants on the third floor provide a visual representation that constructs a cultural space in the heart of Los Angeles. From the Yucatán inspired dining room to an Aztec themed dining room, the mercado provides many visions of a traditional \"México lindo\". These visual forms are not representations of transnational scenes, but of pastoral memories of historical scenes. These pastoral visuals represent an idealized and fond memory of areas throughout Latin America. This space provides meaningful space for the customers of El Mercado de Los Angeles and contributes to the semiotic construction of cultural hybrities at the mercado. The semiotic components of meaning-making affect the Mercado of Los Angeles as a site of economic and cultural significance.\n\n"}

It argues that the mind is in part genetically determined and that its structure and function reflect adaptation, a nonteleological process of interaction between the organism and its environment. A cognitive trait tending to increase inclusive fitness in a given population should therefore grow more common over time, and a trait tending to prevent its carriers from passing on their genes should show up less and less frequently.\n\n\"Evolutionary epistemology\" can also refer to a theory that applies the concepts of biological evolution to the growth of human knowledge, and argues that units of knowledge themselves, particularly scientific theories, evolve according to selection. In this case, a theory—like the germ theory of disease—becomes more or less credible according to changes in the body of knowledge surrounding it.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of evolutionary epistemology is the notion that empirical testing alone does not justify the pragmatic value of scientific theories, but rather that social and methodological processes select those theories with the closest \"fit\" to a given problem. The mere fact that a theory has survived the most rigorous empirical tests available does not, in the calculus of probability, predict its ability to survive future testing. Karl Popper used Newtonian physics as an example of a body of theories so thoroughly confirmed by testing as to be considered unassailable, but which were nevertheless overturned by Einstein's insights into the nature of space-time. For the evolutionary epistemologist, all theories are true only provisionally, regardless of the degree of empirical testing they have survived.\n\n\"Evolutionary epistemology\" can also refer to the opposite of (onto)genetic epistemology, namely phylogenetic epistemology as the historical discovery and reification of abstractions that necessarily precedes the learning of such abstractions by individuals. Piaget dismissed this possibility, stating\n\nPiaget was mistaken in so quickly dismissing the study of phylogenetic epistemology, as there is much historical data available about the origins and evolution of the various notational systems that reify different kinds of abstract entity.\n\nPopper is considered by many to have given evolutionary epistemology its first comprehensive treatment, though Donald T. Campbell coined the phrase in 1974 and Piaget alluded to it in 1974 and described the concept as one of five possible theories in \"The Origins of Intelligence in Children\" (1936).\n\n\n\n"}

For example, individuals might be selected to switch from eating mature plants to seedlings, and thereby deplete their food plant's population. Selection on individuals can theoretically produce adaptations that threaten the survival of the population.\n\nMuch of the research on evolutionary suicide has used the mathematical modeling technique adaptive dynamics, in which genetic changes are studied together with population dynamics. This allows the model to predict how population density will change as a given trait invades the population.\n\nEvolutionary suicide has also been referred to as \"Darwinian extinction\", \"runaway selection to self-extinction\", and \"evolutionary collapse\". The idea is similar in concept to the tragedy of the commons and the Tendency of the rate of profit to fall, namely that they are all examples of an accumulation of individual changes leading to a collective disaster such that it negates those individual changes.\n\nMany adaptations have apparently negative effects on population dynamics, for example infanticide by male lions, or the production of toxins by bacteria. However, empirically establishing that an extinction event was unambiguously caused by the process of adaptation is not a trivial task.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11064", "title": "Faith", "text": "Faith\n\nIn the context of religion, one can define faith as confidence or trust in a particular system of religious belief,\nwithin which faith may equate to confidence based on some perceived degree of warrant,\nin contrast to a definition of faith as being belief without evidence.\n\nThe English word \"faith\" is thought to date from 1200–1250, from the Middle English \"feith\", via Anglo-French \"fed\", Old French \"feid\", \"feit\" from Latin \"fidem\", accusative of \"fidēs\" (trust), akin to \"fīdere\" (to trust).\n\nJames W. Fowler (1940–2015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or spiritual development) across the human life-span. His stages relate closely to the work of Piaget, Erikson, and Kohlberg regarding aspects of psychological development in children and adults. Fowler defines faith as an activity of trusting, committing, and relating to the world based on a set of assumptions of how one is related to others and the world.\n\n\nNo hard-and-fast rule requires individuals pursuing faith to go through all six stages. There is a high probability for individuals to be content and fixed in a particular stage for a lifetime; stages from 2-5 are such stages. Stage 6 is the summit of faith development. This state is often considered as \"not fully\" attainable.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds, ultimately the acceptance of the divine authority of the Manifestations of God. In the religion's view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth. Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.\n\nFaith in Buddhism (', ') refers to a serene commitment in the practice of the Buddha's teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as Buddhas or \"bodhisattvas\" (those aiming to become a Buddha). Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.\n\nIn early Buddhism, faith was focused on the Triple Gem, that is, Gautama Buddha, his teaching (the Dhamma), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the Sangha). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to deities. A faithful devotee was called \"upāsaka\" or \"upāsika\", for which no formal declaration was required. In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority. As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to wisdom and enlightenment, and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.\n\nWhile faith in Buddhism does not imply \"blind faith\", Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of Gautama Buddha. Faith in Buddhism centers on the understanding that the Buddha is an Awakened being, on his superior role as teacher, in the truth of his Dharma (spiritual teachings), and in his Sangha (community of spiritually developed followers). Faith in Buddhism can be summarised as faith in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or bodhi, and Nirvana. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.\n\nIn the later stratum of Buddhist history, especially Mahāyāna Buddhism, faith was given a much more important role. The concept of the Buddha Nature was developed, as devotion to Buddhas and \"bodhisattvas\" residing in Pure Lands became commonplace. With the arising of the cult of the Lotus Sūtra, faith gained a central role in Buddhist practice, which was further amplified with the development of devotion to the Amitabha Buddha in Pure Land Buddhism. In the Japanese form of Pure Land Buddhism, under the teachers Hōnen and Shinran, only entrusting faith toward the Amitabha Buddha was believed to be a fruitful form of practice, as the practice of celibacy, morality and other Buddhist disciplines were dismissed as no longer effective in this day and age, or contradicting the virtue of faith. Faith was defined as a state similar to enlightenment, with a sense of self-negation and humility.\n\nThus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, Buddhist modernism in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism. Faith in Buddhism still has a role in modern Asia or the West, but is understood and defined differently from traditional interpretations. Within the Dalit Buddhist Movement communities, taking refuge is defined not only as a religious, but also a political choice.\n\nThe word translated as \"faith\" in the New Testament is the Greek word \"πίστις\" (\"pístis\") which can also be translated \"belief\", \"faithfulness\", and \"trust\". There are various views in Christianity regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true. In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. Theologian Thomas Aquinas did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it is a mean (understood in the Platonic sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.\n\nThen there are numerous views regarding the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in Jesus brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.\n\nRegardless of which approach to faith a Christian takes, all agree that the Christian faith is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian sees the mystery of God and his grace and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, faith is not static but causes one to learn more of God and to grow; Christian faith has its origin in God.\n\nThe definition of faith given by the apostle Paul at Hebrews 11:1 carries particular weight with Christians that respect the Bible as the source of divine truth. There the apostle writes:\n\n\"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" — King James Version\n\n\"Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exists.\" — International Standard Version\n\n“The naive or inexperienced person[is easily misled and believes every word he hears, but the prudent man is discreet and astute.” (Proverbs 14:15, Amplified Bible) The Christian apostle Paul wrote: “Test everything that is said to be sure it is true, and if it is, then accept it.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21, Living Bible)\n\nIn Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not only fideism or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements. Before Christians have faith, they must understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions and on the personal experiences of the believer. In English translations of the New Testament, the word \"faith\" generally corresponds to the Greek noun πίστις (\"pistis\") or to the Greek verb πιστεύω (\"pisteuo\"), meaning \"to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure\".\n\nIn contrast to noted atheist Richard Dawkins' view of faith as \"blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence\", Alister McGrath quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861–1924), who states that faith is \"not blind, but intelligent\" and that it \"commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...\", which McGrath sees as \"a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith\".\n\nAmerican biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson stated that the Greek word \"pistis\" used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered \"assurance\" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is \"an old verb meaning \"to furnish\", used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.\" Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means \"to be persuaded\".\n\nBritish Christian apologist John Lennox argues that \"faith conceived as belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as belief that has warrant\". He states that \"the use of the adjective 'blind' to describe 'faith' indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind\". \"The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based.\" \"We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up.\" \"Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives.\"\n\nPeter S Williams holds that \"the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality, and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence.\" Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as \"a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true.\"\n\nRegarding doubting Thomas in John 20:24-31, Williams points out that \"Thomas wasn't asked to believe without evidence\". He was asked to believe on the basis of the other disciples' testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples...But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. John 20:30,31.\n\nConcerning doubting Thomas, Michael R. Allen wrote, \"Thomas's definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person \"qua\" person\".\n\nKenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to as \"evidentialism\", and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called \"classical foundationalism\", which is accompanied by \"deontologism\", which holds that humans have an obligation to regulate their beliefs in accordance with evidentialist structures.\n\nThey show how this can go too far, and Alvin Plantinga deals with it. While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. \"Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.\"\n\nThe four-part \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" (CCC) gives Part One to \"The Profession of Faith\". This section describes the content of faith. It elaborates and expands particularly upon the Apostles' Creed. CCC 144 initiates a section on the \"Obedience of Faith\".\n\nIn the theology of Pope John Paul II, faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of Jesus Christ.\n\nSome alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented in a collection of sermons now presented as \n\n\nAhimsa, also referred to as nonviolence, is the fundamental tenet of Hinduism which advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.\n\nIn Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one's higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.\n\nIn Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of Islam is called \"Iman\" (), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestionable or blind belief. A man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty. According to the Quran, Iman must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into Paradise. In the Hadith of Gabriel, \"Iman\" in addition to \"Islam\" and \"Ihsan\" form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.\n\nMuhammad referred to the six articles of faith in the Hadith of Gabriel: \"Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God].\" The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God. The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.\n\nFaith itself is not a religious concept in Judaism. The \"faith in God\" is mentioned in the Book of Genesis Chapter 15 verse 6 and in the Book of Exodus Chapter 4 verse 31 and in the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 43 verse 10, in the 24 books of the Jewish Bible. The word translated as \"faith\" here is the Hebrew word אָמַן which can also be translated \"believe\", \"reliable\", and \"trustworthy\". In the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 43 verse 10, the commandment to know God is followed by the commandments to believe and to understand, thus denoting descending importance.\n\nHowever, Judaism does recognize the positive value of \"Emunah\" (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the \"Apikorus\" (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially compared with Christianity and Islam. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true knowledge, true prophecy and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed. Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of Christian faith, which is called Avodah Zarah in Judaism, a minor form of idol worship, a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honour a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of Jewish principles of faith which are mandatory for all (observant) Jews.\n\nIn the Jewish scriptures trust in God – \"Emunah\" – refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the Torah, notably Deuteronomy 7:9:\n\nThe specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, Orthodox Jews have accepted Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Belief.\n\nA traditional example of \"Emunah\" as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of Abraham. On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see Genesis 12-15).\n\"The Talmud describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, 'G‑d help me!' The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d’s will by stealing from others. For \"emunah\" to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation.\"\n\nFaith itself is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or Five Ks (in Punjabi known as pañj kakkē or pañj kakār), are sometimes referred to as the \"Five articles of Faith\". The articles include \"kēs\" (uncut hair), \"kaṅghā\" (small wooden comb), \"kaṛā\" (circular steel or iron bracelet), \"kirpān\" (sword/dagger), and \"kacchera\" (special undergarment). Baptised Sikhs are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.\n\nThere is a wide spectrum of opinion with respect to the epistemological validity of faith - that is, whether it is a reliable way to acquire true beliefs.\n\nFideism is an epistemological theory which maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of Catholic thought, in a movement called Traditionalism. The Roman Catholic Magisterium has, however, repeatedly condemned fideism.\n\nReligious epistemologists have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument. Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American psychologist and philosopher William James offers a similar argument in his lecture \"The Will to Believe.\" Foundationalism is a view about the structure of justification or knowledge. Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and justified belief are ultimately based upon what are called properly basic beliefs. This position is intended to resolve the infinite regress problem in epistemology. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of reformed epistemology.\n\nReformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. Analytic philosophers Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff develop this view. Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant. Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in \"Warranted Christian Belief\" as a form of externalism that holds that the justification conferring factors for a belief may include external factors. Some theistic philosophers have defended theism by granting evidentialism but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by British philosopher Basil Mitchell and analytic philosopher Richard Swinburne, whose arguments are based on Bayesian probability. In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.\n\nProfessor of Mathematics and philosopher of science at University of Oxford John Lennox has stated, \"Faith is not a leap in the dark; it’s the exact opposite. It’s a commitment based on evidence… It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.” He criticises Richard Dawkins as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.\n\nBertrand Russell wrote:\n\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence. He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.\n\nPhilosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which \"claims about the world are likely true\". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that Muhammad (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that Joseph Smith (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no \"built-in corrective mechanism\". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as \"belief without evidence\" or \"pretending to know things you don't know\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the founder of the tradition in philosophy known as the School of Salamanca, noted especially for his contributions to the theory of just war and international law. He has in the past been described by some scholars as one of the \"fathers of international law\", along with Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius, though contemporary academics have suggested that such a description is anachronistic, since the concept of international law did not truly develop until much later. American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted that Vitoria was \"the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas.\"\n\nVitoria was born in Burgos or Vitoria-Gasteiz and was raised in Burgos, the son of Pedro de Vitoria, of Alava, and Catalina de Compludo, both of noble families. As per modern scholarship, he had Jewish ancestry on his maternal side (the Compludos), being related to famous converts like Paul of Burgos and Alfonso de Cartagena. He became a Dominican in 1504, and was educated at the College Saint-Jacques in Paris, where he was influenced by the work of Desiderius Erasmus. He went on to teach theology from 1516 (under the influences of Pierre Crockaert and Thomas Cajetan). In 1522 he returned to Spain to teach theology at the college of Saint Gregory at Valladolid, where many young Dominicans were being trained for missionary work in the New World. In 1524, he was elected to the Chair of theology at the University of Salamanca, where he was instrumental in promoting Thomism (the philosophy and theology of St. Thomas Aquinas). Francisco de Vitoria died on 12 August 1546 in Salamanca.\n\nA noted scholar, he was publicly consulted by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. He worked to limit the type of power the Spanish Empire imposed on the Native Peoples. He said, \"The upshot of all the preceding is this, then, that the aborigines undoubtedly had true dominion in both public and private matters, just like Christians, and that neither their princes nor private persons could be despoiled of their property on the ground of their not being true owners.\" Vitoria denied that the native peoples could be understood as slaves by nature in Aristotelian terms. He adopted from Aquinas the Roman law concept of \"ius gentium\" (\"the law of nations\"). His defense of American Indians was based on a Scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.\n\nIn three lectures (relectiones) held between 1537 and 1539 Vitoria concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes. This had already been the position of Palacios Rubios. Neither the pope nor Charles V had a rightful claim over Indian lives or property. No violent action could be taken against them, nor could their lands or property be seized, unless the Indians had caused harm or injury to the Spanish by violating the latter’s lawful rights.\n\nA supporter of the just war theory, in \"De iure belli\" Francisco pointed out that the underlying predicate conditions for a \"just war\" were \"wholly lacking in the Indies\". The only area where he saw justification for Spanish \nintervention in native affairs was to protect victims seized for human sacrifice, and because of the inherent human dignity of the victims themselves—whose rights were being violated and thus in need of defense.\n\nThomas E. Woods goes on to describe how some wished to argue that the natives lacked reason, but the evidence was against this because the natives had obvious customs, laws, and a form of government.\n\nThe Spaniards were in the practice of invoking in their American conquests the so-called \"Requerimiento\", a document read to the Indians before the commencement of any hostilities. The \"Requerimiento\", declared the universal authority of the Pope, and the\nauthority the Spanish monarchs had received from the Pope over this part of the New World for the purpose of colonizing and evangelizing it. The Indians had to accept the sovereignty of the Spanish monarchs or be compelled to submit by force. Vitoria denied the legitimacy of this document.\n\nHis works are known only from his lecture notes, as he has published nothing in his lifetime. Nevertheless, his influence such as that on the Dutch legal philosopher Hugo Grotius was significant. \"Relectiones XII Theologicae in duo libros distinctae\" was published posthumously (Antwerp, 1604).\n\nFrancisco de Vitoria's writings have been interpreted by various scholars to support contrary policies. Antony Anghie and others argue that Vitoria’s humanitarianism legitimized conquest.\n\nNotes of his lectures from 1527 to 1540 were copied by students and published under the following titles:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "865767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=865767", "title": "In loco parentis", "text": "In loco parentis\n\nThe term in loco parentis, Latin for \"in the place of a parent\" refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent. Originally derived from English common law, it is applied in two separate areas of the law.\n\nFirst, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties.\n\nSecond, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.\n\nThe \"in loco parentis\" doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of \"parens patriae\", the psychological parent doctrine, and adoption.\n\nCheadle Hulme School, founded in Manchester, England, in 1855, adopted \"in loco parentis\" as its motto, well before the world's first public education act, the Elementary Education Act 1870. The school was established to educate and care for orphans and children of distressed parents.\n\nThe first major limitation to this came in the U.S. Supreme Court case \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\" (1943), in which the court ruled that students cannot be forced to salute the American flag. More prominent change came in the 1960s and 1970s in such cases as \"Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\" (1969), when the Supreme Court decided that \"conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason - whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior - materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.\" Adult speech is also limited by \"time, place and manner\" restrictions and therefore such limits do not rely on schools acting in loco parentis.\n\nIn \"Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\" (1969), the Supreme Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they \"must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint,\" allowing schools to forbid conduct that would \"materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.\" The Court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech.\n\nIn \"New Jersey v. T.L.O.\" (1985) Justice White wrote: \"In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they cannot claim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment.\" The case upheld the search of a purse while on public school property based upon reasonable suspicion, indicating there is a balancing between the student's legitimate expectation of privacy and the public school's interest in maintaining order and discipline. However, in \"Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier\" (1987) the Supreme Court ruled that \"First Amendment rights of students in the public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\" and schools may censor school-sponsored publications (such as a school newspaper) if content is \"...inconsistent with its basic educational mission.\" Other student issues such as school dress codes along with locker, cell phone, and personal laptop computer searches by public school officials have not yet been tested in the Supreme Court.\n\nPrivate institutions are given significantly more authority over their students than public ones, and are generally allowed to arbitrarily dictate rules. In the Kentucky State Supreme Court case \"Gott v. Berea College\" (1913), it was upheld that a \"college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student implicitly agrees to conform to such rules of government\", while publicly funded institutions could not claim the same ability.\n\nIn \"Morse v. Frederick\" (2007) Justice Clarence Thomas, concurring with the majority, argued that \"Tinker's\" ruling contradicted \"the traditional understanding of the judiciary's role in relation to public schooling,\" and ignored the history of public education (127 S.Ct. 2634). He believed the judiciary's role to determine whether students have freedom of expression was limited by \"in loco parentis\". He cited \"Lander v. Seaver\" (1859), which held that \"in loco parentis\" allowed schools to punish student expression that the school or teacher believed contradicted the school's interests and educational goals. This ruling declared that the only restriction the doctrine imposed were acts of legal malice or acts that caused permanent injury. Neither of these were the case with Tinker.\n\nThough \"in loco parentis\" continues to apply to primary and secondary education in the U.S., application of the concept has largely disappeared in higher education. This was not always the case.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, undergraduates were subject to many restrictions on their private lives. Women were generally subject to curfews as early as 10:00, and dormitories were sex-segregated. Some universities expelled students—especially female students—who were somehow \"morally\" undesirable. More importantly, universities saw fit to restrict freedom of speech, on campus, often forbidding organizations out of favor or with different views from speaking, organizing, demonstrating, or otherwise acting on campus. These restrictions were severely criticized by the student movements of the 1960s, and the Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley formed partly on account of them, inspiring students elsewhere to step up their opposition.\n\nThe landmark 1961 case \"Dixon v. Alabama\" was the beginning of the end for \"in loco parentis\" in U.S. higher education. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Alabama State College could not summarily expel students without due process. However, that still does not prevent students who exercise their rights from being subject to more legal action for violation of institutional rules.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1575660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1575660", "title": "Infamous Decree", "text": "Infamous Decree\n\nOn March 17, 1808, Napoleon I created three decrees in a failed attempt to bring equality and to integrate the Jews into French society after the Jewish Emancipation of 1790-1791. The Infamous Decree, the third of the three, had adverse effects. Although the decrees´ aim was to further emancipate the Jews into equal citizenship, it restricted Jewish money lending (Catholics were not permitted to commit acts of usury, or the charging of interest as profit on loans), it annulled all debts owed to Jews by non Jewish debtors and limited the residency of new Jewish peoples in France by restricting all business activities while allowing work in agriculture and regular craftsmanship. The combination of these decrees severely weakened the financial position of once dominant rural French money lending Jews.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte initially won allegiance of Jews when in 1797 he emancipated Jews in Ancona, Italy. He officially chose two High Priests of the Jewish Nation and seven councillors to the High Priests. He allegedly encouraged Jews to reclaim Jerusalem in 1799 with the help of his army in a letter to a rabbi in Jerusalem, but the letter is suspected by many to be a forgery. He in no way acted against the Jews until the early 19th century, when he passed a series of three decrees, one of which became known as the Infamous Decree. Some, such as author Franz Kobler, attribute Napoleon’s change in attitude to Napoleon’s new attachment to France and his newfound desire to protect the interests of the French people. When he was the hero of the Jews, he still was an \"ardent patriot\" of his home island of Corsica.\n\nIn France, quite early in the Nineteenth Century, Jewish moneylenders were accused of usury, in Alsace, as well as of abusing other rights, which were given to them in their emancipation in 1791 under Louis XVI. Napoleon sided with popular French opinion. Though he desired equality for the Jews, he called them \"the most despicable of men\" and proclaimed he did not want their number to increase in an 1808 letter to his brother Jerome.\n\nNapoleon issued an imperial decree in 1806 that suspended payment of debts owed to Jewish moneylenders for one year to warn against usury to the supposedly degenerate Jewish population and called a conference with Jewish leaders. The group he conferred with was dubbed the Great Sanhedrin. and met in 1807.\n\nThough the first meeting of the Great Sanhedrin on February 4, 1807 was ceremonial and solemn, the group was largely ineffective as nothing was done during the month they met to ameliorate the conditions on the Jews that would be imposed by the coming decrees. During the eight sessions, the Great Sanhedrin was forced to condone intermarriage between Frenchmen and Jews in order that the Jewish people might be absorbed into France, since Jews were considered substandard citizens and needed to be either absorbed or expelled. The group also had to support other actions to assimilate the Jews by removing their Jewish ties, such as approving military service to attach young Jewish men to France rather than to their religion and ethnic background. Such measures were a prelude to the passing of the three decrees on March 17, 1808.\n\nAfter Napoleon’s emancipation of the Jews he \"wanted to mandate what some proponents of emancipation had hoped would happen, namely the total assimilation, or biological fusion of Jews with the rest of the French people.\" To mandate the assimilation of Jews into French society, three decrees were issued on March 17, 1808.\n\nThe \"first two decrees restored order to the informal Jewish communities that had survived the revolution by establishing a hierarchical, centralized organization, under the aegis of the ministry of religions.\" The first two decrees set up the consistories which were designed to enforce the decrees. Some of the members also were a part of the Great Sanhedrin which met in 1807. The consistories consisted of a grand rabbi, possibly another rabbi and three lay members who were residents of the town. The consistories acted to enforce Sanhedrin rules through the use of education; they also worked as informants to the government which was monitoring Jewish activity. There was one consistory for every town that contained 2,000 or more Jews.\n\nThe Infamous Decree, also known as the \"third decree,\" presumed all Jews guilty of chicanery (the use of trickery to achieve a political, financial or legal purpose) unless proven innocent, and restricted Jewish commerce and money lending for a period of 10 years.\" This decree was put into place to end Jewish money lending. It annulled all debts owed to Jews by married women, minors, and soldiers and voided any loan that had interest rates exceeding 10 percent. This was an attempt by Napoleon to get rid of alleged usury by Jewish businessmen and to turn these former businessmen into craftsman and farmers to promote supposed equality between the Jews and non-Jews in France. To encourage Jews to move into this niche, the Jews were restricted in changing residency to certain parts of France unless they \"acquired rural property and devoted themselves to agriculture without entering into any commercial or business transactions.\" To keep tabs on businesses that had survived the new restrictions, the decree mandated that all business require a patent or license that had to be renewed yearly. Not only did the decree hurt the Jews economically but it changed their military rights.\n\nThe final restriction of the Jews was an attempt to strengthen their bond with the government and the country. The decree made it so that the Jewish conscripts (required enlistees of military) couldn’t find replacements for themselves when drafted like other Frenchmen were allowed to do.\n\nAs a consequence of the first three decrees, another and final decree was implemented on July 20, 1808. This final decree declared that all Jews acquire a fixed family name to help the government and consistories supervise the Jews movements. They were restricted in their choice of names and weren’t allowed to pick names from the Hebrew Bible or any town names.\n\nThe three decrees were set up to expire after 10 years and would only be continued if renewed after that period. In 1818 Louis XVIII opted to not renew the decree and thus it ended. Louis XVIII was thereafter known as the \"liberator of Jews.\"\n\nAfter the decrees were not renewed after 10 years, Jews migrated into three main areas: Paris, Alsace and Lorraine. Indications of cultural and economical change can be seen in these areas. Although these changes were devastating to the economy of the Jews, they greatly increased the population and the distribution of the Jews.\n\nMany Jews continued to live as lower class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult. They could not have gone into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills because without the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. But as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry. In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses in the city and 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of Paris and Nancy increased also. These different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.\n\nThere were many concerns with Jewish youth and the public school system. There was discrimination and talk of conversions. Only 10 percent of Jewish children attended public school in Alsace. One government Jewish official said, \"Our schools are Catholic schools rather than public schools. Prayers according to the Roman religion are recited upon entering and leaving, the catechism of the same religion is taught there and the textbook used are of that same religion.\" \n\nBy 1810, a few Jews went to local schools and moved to Lycée, but many Jewish parents neglected their children’s education to prepare them into business. Jews gradually moved into public schools, and some even hired private tutors. Some parents home schooled their daughters to teach them music, dance and embroidery.\n\nThe emancipation led to the redistribution of the Jewish population in France. Jews migrated to the cities and to communes where there had not previously been a Jewish population. French Jews went to Paris, by 1809 there were more than 2900 Jews there. The total Jewish population grew to more than 46,000 in Alsace.\n"}

{"id": "683907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=683907", "title": "Jouissance", "text": "Jouissance\n\nIn French, jouissance means enjoyment, in terms both of rights and property, and of sexual orgasm—the latter has a meaning partially lacking in the English word \"enjoyment\".\n\nPoststructuralism has developed the latter sense of \"jouissance\" in complex ways, so as to denote a transgressive, excessive kind of pleasure linked to the division and splitting of the subject involved.\n\nEnglish editions of the works of Jacques Lacan have generally left \"jouissance\" untranslated in order to help convey its specialised usage. Lacan first developed his concept of an opposition between \"jouissance\" and the pleasure principle in his Seminar \"The Ethics of Psychoanalysis\" (1959–1960). Lacan considered that \"there is a \"jouissance\" beyond the pleasure principle\" linked to the partial drive; a \"jouissance\" which compels the subject to constantly attempt to transgress the prohibitions imposed on his enjoyment, to go beyond the pleasure principle.\n\nYet the result of transgressing the pleasure principle, according to Lacan, is not more pleasure but pain, since there is only a certain amount of pleasure that the subject can bear. Beyond this limit, pleasure becomes pain, and this \"painful principle\" is what Lacan calls \"jouissance\". Thus \"jouissance\" is suffering (\"ethics\")—something which may be linked to the influence of the erotic philosophy of Bataille, epitomised in Lacan's remark about \"the recoil imposed on everyone, in so far as it involves terrible promises, by the approach of \"jouissance\" as such\". Lacan also linked \"jouissance\" to the castration complex, and to the aggression of the death drive.\n\nIn his seminar \"The Other Side of Psychoanalysis\" (1969–1970) Lacan introduced the concept of \"surplus-\"jouissance\"\" (French \"plus-de-jouir\") inspired by Marx's concept of surplus-value: he considered \"objet petit a\" is the excess of \"jouissance\" which has no use value, and which persists for the mere sake of \"jouissance\".\n\nLacan considered that \"jouissance\" is essentially phallic, meaning that it does not relate to the \"Other\" as such. In his seminar \"Encore\" (1972–1973), however, Lacan introduced the idea of specifically feminine \"jouissance\", saying that women have \"in relation to what the phallic function designates of \"jouissance\", a supplementary \"jouissance\"...a \"jouissance\" of the body which is...\"beyond the phallus\"\". This feminine \"jouissance\" is ineffable, for both women and men may experience it but know nothing about it.\n\nThe Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek, a known Lacanian theorist, has adopted the term in his philosophy; it may also be seen in the works, both joint and individual, of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and it plays an important role in the writing of Julia Kristeva and Roland Barthes.\n\nIn his 1973 literary theory book \"The Pleasure of the Text\", Barthes divides the effects of texts into two: \"plaisir\" (translated as \"pleasure\") and \"jouissance\". The distinction corresponds to a further distinction Barthes makes between \"readerly\" and \"writerly\" texts. The pleasure of the text corresponds to the readerly text, which does not challenge the reader's position as a subject. The writerly text provides bliss, which explodes literary codes and allows the reader to break out of his or her subject position.\n\nFor Barthes \"plaisir\" is, \"a pleasure... linked to cultural enjoyment and identity, to the cultural enjoyment of identity, to a homogenising movement of the ego.\" As Richard Middleton puts it, \"\"Plaisir\" results, then, from the operation of the structures of signification through which the subject knows himself or herself; \"jouissance\" fractures these structures.\"\n\nThe French feminist writer Hélène Cixous uses the term \"jouissance\" to describe a form of women's pleasure or sexual rapture that combines mental, physical and spiritual aspects of female experience, bordering on mystical communion: \"explosion, diffusion, effervescence, abundance...takes pleasure (jouit) in being limitless\". Cixous maintains that \"jouissance\" is the source of a woman's creative power and that the suppression of \"jouissance\" prevents women from finding their own fully empowered voice. The concept of \"jouissance\" is explored by Cixous and other authors in their writings on \"Écriture féminine\", a strain of feminist literary theory that originated in France in the early 1970s.\n\nOther feminists have argued that Freudian \"hysteria\" is \"jouissance\" distorted by patriarchal culture and say that \"jouissance\" is a transcendent state that represents freedom from oppressive linearities. In her introduction to Cixous' \"The Newly Born Woman\", literary critic Sandra Gilbert writes: \"to escape hierarchical bonds and thereby come closer to what Cixous calls \"jouissance\", which can be defined as a virtually metaphysical fulfillment of desire that goes far beyond [mere] satisfaction... [It is a] fusion of the erotic, the mystical, and the political.\"\n\n\n"}

It was compiled in 1835 by his student Heinrich Gustav Hotho, using Hegel's own hand-written notes and notes his students took during the lectures, but Hotho's work may render some of Hegel's thought more systematic than Hegel's initial presentation.\n\nHegel's Aesthetics is regarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been produced since Aristotle. Hegel's thesis about the historical dissolution of art has been the subject of much scholarly debate and influenced such thinkers like Theodor W. Adorno, Martin Heidegger, György Lukács, Jacques Derrida and Arthur Danto. Hegel was himself influenced by Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. Heidegger calls Hegel's \"Lectures on Aesthetics\" \"the most comprehensive reflection on the essence of art that the West possesses\".\n\nHegel develops his account of art as a mode of absolute spirit that he calls \"the beautiful ideal,\" which he defines most generally as Now when truth in this its external existence [\"Dasein\"] is present to consciousness immediately, and with the concept remains immediately in unity with its external appearance, the Idea is not only true but \"beautiful\". \"Beauty\" is determined as the sensible \"shining\" of the Idea. This ideal is developed throughout the \"Lectures\" accordance Hegel's \"Logic\":\n\nIn these second two parts of the \"Lectures\", Hegel documents the development of art from the paradigmatically symbolic architecture to the paradigmatically classical sculpture to the romantic arts of painting, music, and poetry. At the time it was noted for the wealth of pictures included with it.\n\nContrary to once-common belief, Hegel nowhere declares art to be \"dead.\" What he says, in a representative statement is, \"For us art counts no longer as the highest mode in which truth procures existence for itself.\" He speaks frequently of its \"dissolution\" [\"Auflösung\"], not its end [\"Ende\"], despite Hotho's use of the latter for the heading of the final moment of the Romantic art form.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This system of philosophy is based on a special reduction that is called Ontetic Reduction.\n\nThe word “ontetic” is not an English word; Khatami has coined this word to express his thought most exactly; he did not take it in a sense of “ontologic” nor of “ontic” (and by that, he wishes to differ his discussion from Heidegger’s).[1] For Khatami, ontetic means something more. Ontetic has three constituents which must be considered althgeter as the meaning that this word indicates. Relying on the ancient Persian philosophy, Khatami takes “light” (rushanayi) interpreted as “consciousness” (agahi) which embraces “being”;[2]From other hand, light is \"Tashkiki\", that is, of “a continuous hierarchic structure which can spread both vertically and horizentally”, and this is the idea that is revived by Persian philosopher, Suhravardi the Master of Illumination and theoretically accomplished by Mulla Sadra the founder of Persian Transcendent philosophy. Khatami uses the word “ontetic” to indicate these three elements when are taken together. Ontetic philosophy\nis then a philosophy which is based on this idea.\nMoreover, ontetic philosophy goes systematic. This philosophy requires its special method and logic, and Khatami has reconstructed the “transcendent method” and developed an “ontetic logic”.[3] To set up the transcendent method, first, Khatami starts from every day experience and reconstructs a method to transcend from this experience by reducing it to its original source step- by- step. This method leads to three continuous levels of human consciousness each of which follow its relevant level of logic. (see Ontetic Reduction)\nBeing contemplated by philosophy is expressed by man himself, and therefore man's relations with the world, as also with Him, become central for the sphere of philosophy. Man is an acting subject, a free agent, capable of choosing between various ends compatible with the circumstances of his life, and insofar he is responsible for those relations; and, on the other hand, he has an end appointed him by nature which is obligatory upon him as his moral end. A philosophical knowledge of the world, then, must entail a philosophical knowledge or thorough explanation of the reasons of man's duties flowing from his relation to things and to Him.[4]\n\n[1] For Khatami's discussion on Hedegger’s “ontological-ontic distinction” see: Heidegger's Notion of the World, Moasseseh Andisheh Islami, Tehran 2001.

{"id": "36189390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36189390", "title": "Paraphrasing of copyrighted material", "text": "Paraphrasing of copyrighted material\n\nParaphrasing of copyrighted material may reduce the probability that a court will find that copyright has been infringed; however, there have been many cases where a paraphrase that uses quite different words and sentence structure has been found to infringe on a prior work's copyright.\n\nThe acceptable degree of difference between a prior work and a paraphrase depends on a variety of factors and ultimately depends on the judgement of the court in each individual case.\n\nAn early example of the concept of paraphrasing as a copyright issue arose with Johann Heinrich Zedler's application in 1730 for copyright protection in Saxony for his \"Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon\", one of the first encyclopedias. \nThe publisher of a rival \"General Historical Lexicon\" said that Zedler's \"Universal Lexicon\" would not differ in content from this and other existing lexicons apart from paraphrasing.\nOn 16 October 1730, the Upper Consistory court in Dresden rejected Zedler's request, and warned that he would be subject to confiscation and a fine if he reproduced any material from the \"General Historical Lexicon\" in his \"Universal Lexicon\".\n\nLaws on the degree of copying or paraphrasing that is considered permissible have become steadily more restrictive over the years.\nIn his 2008 book \"Copyright's Paradox\", discussing the conflict between protecting copyright and protecting free speech, Neil Netanel says, \"Yeats [borrowed] from Shelley; Kafka from Kleist and Dickens; Joyce from Homer; and T.S. Eliot from Shakespeare, Whitman and Baudelaire, all in ways that would infringe today's bloated copyright.\"\nParaphrase may apply to music as well as to writing. It was commonplace for Baroque, Classical and Romantic composers to create variations on each other's work without permission. This would not be allowed today.\n\nCopyright protection in Britain dates back to the 1556 Charter of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers.\nThe Licensing of the Press Act 1662 gave publishers exclusive printing rights, but did not give any rights to authors.\nParliament failed to renew the act in 1694, primarily to remove monopoly and encourage a free press.\nThe Statute of Anne in 1710 prescribed a copyright term of fourteen years, and let the author renew for another fourteen years, after which the work went into the public domain.\nOver the years, additional acts and case law steadily refined the definitions of what could be protected, including derivative works, and the degree of protection given.\n\nThe Soviet Union's Copyright Act of 1925 in essence said that a work created by a minimal paraphrase of an existing text could be considered a new work eligible for copyright.\nBy 1991, the Copyright law of the Soviet Union had evolved to give much more protection to the author.\nFree use, similar to the English common law concept of fair use, was only allowed if it did not infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author.\n\nMoral rights are rights of creators of copyrighted works that are generally recognized in civil law jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some common law jurisdictions. \nThey include the right of attribution and the right to the integrity of the work, which bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation without the author's permission. Paraphrasing without permission may be seen as violating moral rights. \nMoral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. \nEven if the author has assigned their copyright to a third party, they still maintain the moral rights to the work.\nMoral rights were first recognized in France and Germany.\nThey were included in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1928.\nWhile the United States became a signatory to the Berne convention in 1989, it does not completely recognize moral rights as part of copyright law, which is seen as protecting commercial rights in intellectual property, but as part of other bodies of law such as defamation or unfair competition which protect the reputation of the author.\n\nEdward Gibbon published the last three volumes of his masterpiece \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" in 1788, at a time when both copyright and moral rights were poorly enforced.\nWith a small private income, he was not dependent on sales but was more concerned about the damage to his reputation from poor translations, a form of paraphrasing.\nHe wrote, \"The French, Italian and German translations have been executed with various success; but instead of patronizing, I should willingly suppress such imperfect copes which injure the character while they propagate the name of the author. The Irish pirates are at once my friends and my enemies...\"\n\nBy the start of the twentieth century, U.S. decisions on unfair competition found that representing as the author's work a version of the work that substantially departed from the original was a cause of action.\nSection §43(a) of the Lanham Act, which protects brands and trademarks, also provides similar protection to laws based on moral rights.\nFor any goods or services, it bans false designation of origin or a false description or representation.\nIn \"Gilliam v. American Broadcasting\" the British comedy group called \"Monty Python\" took action against the ABC network for broadcasting versions of their programs which had been correctly attributed to them but had been extensively edited, in part to remove content that their audience might consider offensive or obscene. \nThe judgement of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was in favor of \"Monty Python\", finding the cuts might be an \"actionable mutilation\" that violated the Lanham Act.\n\nIn the United States, copyright was covered by common law until it was formalized in the Copyright Act of 1976.\nSection §107 of this act set out four \"fair use\" principles to be used in evaluating whether copyright had been infringed:\n\nThese principles apply both to literal copies and to paraphrases.\nJudges are required to consider these factors, but may also take others into consideration, and may choose what weight they apply to each factor.\nAccording to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in \"Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp\" (1977), \"The fair use doctrine offers a means of balancing the exclusive rights of a copyright holder with the public's interest in dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as art, science and industry.\"\nClaims of fair use in copying or paraphrasing are more likely to succeed when the work being copied is factual. \nIn \"Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises\" the Supreme Court of the United States said, \"the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.\"\nHowever, the court went on to quote Gorman, \"Fact or Fancy? The Implications for Copyright\" (1982) which said, \"[E]ven within the field of fact works, there are gradations as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy. One may move from sparsely embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography. The extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied, in order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts, will thus vary from case to case.\"\nUse of a work for critical commentary is generally considered fair, as long as the commentary is indeed about the substance or style of the original work.\nParody may be seen as a form of commentary, and to be effective must copy or paraphrase many of the elements of creative expression in the work being parodied.\nAlthough courts have differed in the past about how closely a parody can copy an original work, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\" (1994) ruled strongly: \"[P]arody has an obvious claim to transformative value... Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and in the process, creating a new one. We thus line up with the courts that have held the parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under §107.\"\n\nUnpublished works have special status under both moral rights and copyright, since the author or copyright owner has the right to control first publication.\nPublication of an excerpt or paraphrase of an unpublished work may infringe that right.\nAn author wishing to quote or even loosely paraphrase an unpublished work in France can only do so with permission from the author.\nIn \"Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises\" (1985) the United States Supreme Court held that \"under ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use.\"\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in \"Salinger v. Random House\", which concerned a biography in which a number of unpublished letters by the subject had been paraphrased, similarly concluded that the copyright owner's right to control publication took precedence over \"fair use\", so even limited paraphrasing was unacceptable.\nThis drew support from those concerned with the rights of an individual to privacy and criticism from those more interested in the public \"right to know.\"\nIn 1992 the Copyright Act was amended as a result of the \"Salinger\" case to include a sentence at the end of §107 saying that the fact that a work is unpublished \"shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration\" of all four fair-use factors.\n\nA paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. Equivalent concepts apply to images or music.\nIn most countries, copyright applies to the original expression in a work rather than to the meanings or ideas being expressed.\nA loose paraphrase of a portion of a work may therefore be published without violating copyright.\nIf the paraphrase is so different that the expression in the derivative work has no similarity to that of the prior work, there is no infringement. \nIn \"See v. Durang\" (1983) the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found \"Copying deleted or so disguised as to be unrecognizable is not copying.\"\nBut courts have struggled to find a clear method of comparing a paraphrase or derivative to a prior work to determine whether the copyright in the original expression has been infringed.\nPhilosophically, there is disagreement about the distinction between thought and language.\nIn the past it was often thought that the two could not be separated, and so a paraphrase could never exactly reproduce a thought expressed in different words. \nAt the opposite extreme is the view that concepts and language are completely independent, so there is always a range of ways in which a concept can be expressed.\nCopyright law in common law countries tries to avoid theoretical discussion of the nature of ideas and expression such as this, taking a more pragmatic view of what is called the idea/expression dichotomy.\nIn \"Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation\" (1930), Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit gave an explanation of the dichotomy that has often been cited by courts hearing copyright cases, and that illustrates the inherent subjectivity of any decision.\nHe said:\nThe plaintiff in a copyright case must show that there is \"substantial similarity\" between the alleged copy and the prior work. \nIn \"Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co\" (1970) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit introduced the concept of \"total concept and feel\", holding that a work could be made up of elements that could not be copyrighted, but that the total concept and feel could be subject to copyright, and would be considered to be infringed if a normal reasonable person would consider that a disputed work was a copy of a prior work.\nThis concept has been used in later cases such as \"Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop\" (1976), where two works derived from the same folk tale had similar plots.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that there had not been copying, since the different versions were very different in style and in detail, saying \"the essence of infringement lies in taking not a general theme but its particular expression through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterization.\"\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in \"Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.\" (1977) refined the concept by establishing a two-stage comparison.\nAn extrinsic test would determine similarity of general ideas, while an intrinsic test would compare the particular expressions used.\nExtrinsic similarity means that two works are substantially similar in their general ideas, which can be determined objectively by an expert.\nIntrinsic similarity means they are substantially similar in their forms of expression, and this is the more subjective test.\nThe second test should be made by an \"ordinary reasonable person\" rather than an expert.\nBoth must be true for an infringement to exist.\n\nThe ideas or facts in a work are not subject to copyright protection, but the \"protected expression\" is.\nA paraphrase of a work may infringe on copyright if the \"protected expression\" in the paraphrase is similar to that in the prior work.\nMany court cases have hinged on how \"protected expression\" is defined and how similarity is determined.\n\nOne of the earliest cases was \"Baker v. Selden\" (1879). Charles Selden had developed a new system of bookkeeping and in 1865 published a short book that described his system, with sample forms. W.C.M. Baker, who had seen Selden's book, published a similar book in 1867 describing an improved version of the system. A suit claiming copyright infringement went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879. \nThe Supreme court found that Selden's idea could not be protected since there was no patent, but his description or explanation of the system was protected by copyright law, and found that Baker's book was \"in large and material part identical with and infringements of the books of Selden system.\"\nThe arguments and ruling differ from modern law in that there was no discussion of the expression, only of the close similarities in the ideas given in the two books.\n\nIn \"Nutt v. National Institute Inc.\" (1929), Nutt was prohibited from delivering in public and for profit lectures that were similar to lectures whose copyright was held by the National Institute for the Improvement of Memory.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case found that the protected expression is more than the literal words but also includes the \"association, presentation, and combination of the ideas and thought which go to make up the [author's] literary composition.\"\nThe court said \"The infringement need not be a complete or exact copy. Paraphrasing or copying with evasion is an infringement, even though there may be little or no conceivable identity between the two.\"\n\nWainwright Securities was engaged in preparing in-depth analyses of public companies, and selling them to major investors. The Wall Street Transcript Corporation, publisher of the \"Transcript\" magazine, began to publish abstracts of the Wainwright reports.\nIn \"Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp\" (1977) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that \"news events\" cannot be copyrighted, but found that \"the Transcript appropriated almost verbatim the most creative and original aspects of the reports, the financial analyses and predictions.\"\nThe court said, \"What is protected is the manner of expression, the author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way he structures his material and marshals facts, his choice of words and the emphasis he gives to particular developments.\"\nAn example of very close paraphrasing in this case was:\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in \"Salinger v. Random House\" (1987) found that an unauthorized biography by Ian Hamilton had infringed copyright with paraphrases of passages from unpublished letters written by the subject, the well-known novelist J. D. Salinger. As an example, the court cited:\nDespite differences in wording and sentence structure, the court found this to be a close paraphrase of a highly original expression.\nIn this case, the close paraphrasing was considered to contribute to the \"amount and substantiality\" of the material that had been copied - that is, paraphrasing is a form of copying.\nThe court also found that Hamilton's practice of including phrases like \"Salinger says,\" or \"he said\" within his paraphrase could give readers of the biography the false impression that they had read Salinger's own words. They might therefore decide not to buy a collection of the original letters. The court found that this meant there would be a financial impact.\nThe court barred publication.\n\nThe case of \"Wright v. Warner Books\" (1991) was superficially similar to \"Salinger\".\nMargaret Walker wrote an unauthorized biography of Richard Wright, best known for his books \"Native Son\" and \"Black Boy\", \nin which she made \"sparing use\" of excerpts from the subject's unpublished letters and journals.\nEllen Wright, Richard Wright's widow, sued the author and Warner Books, the publisher.\nIn one example, the book paraphrased as follows from an unpublished letter that Wright had written:\nDespite the apparent similarity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that copyright had not been infringed.\nThe paraphrasing was just \"straightforward and factual reportage\" of the \"most basic and banal factual matter.\"\n\nThere are cases where there is very little choice about how to express some fact or idea, so a copy or close paraphrase may be unavoidable.\nIn this case, the \"merger doctrine\" comes into play.\nThe fact or idea and the expression are seen as merged, and the expression cannot be protected.\nThe merger doctrine is typically applied only to factual information or scientific theories, not to imaginative works such as plays or novels where the author has a much broader choice of expression.\nThe merger doctrine has been applied to the user interface design of computer software, where similarity between icons used by two different programs is acceptable if only a very limited number of icons would be recognizable by users, such as an image looking like a page to represent a document.\nHowever, in 1994 a U.K. judge in \"Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile Finance\" cast doubt on the merger doctrine, saying he was not comfortable with the idea that \"if there is only one way of expressing an idea that way is not the subject of copyright.\"\n\nThe term \"Scenes a faire\" means \"obligatory scene\", a scene in a play that the audience \"has been permitted to foresee and to desire from the progress of the action; and such a scene can never be omitted without a consequent dissatisfaction.\" The term was applied to copyright law in \"Cain v. Universal Pictures\" (1942), where the United States District Court for the Southern District of California ruled that \"... similarities and incidental details necessary to the environment or setting of an action are not the material of which copyrightable originality consists.\"\nThe concept has been used by U.S. and U.K. courts.\nThe term is used both in the sense of a scene that follows inevitably from a situation,\nor a standard scene that is always included in a particular genre of work.\nAnother court said \"Under the ... doctrine of \"scènes à faire\", courts will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the expression embodied in the work necessarily flows from a commonplace idea.\"\nThe concept has been extended to computer software, where some aspects may be dictated by the problem to be solved, or may be standard programming techniques.\n\nPublishers may formally allow limited quotation but prohibit paraphrasing, since they do not want readers to mistake the paraphrase for the original work.\nIn this case they would prohibit alteration of the work in their permission agreement. \nAlthough paraphrasing may be considered fair use under copyright law it may be considered breach of contract when the author of the paraphrase has implicitly or explicitly accepted a permission agreement.\n\nJudge Richard Posner has argued in his blog in favor of laws that require online sites to obtain permission from the copyright holder before linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials from newspapers. His concern is that existing laws based on fair use may not provide sufficient protection to the newspapers, who are paying for expensive news collection while the websites essentially get a free ride. Without greater protection, Judge Posner considers that the result of widespread paraphrasing of newspapers on internet sites could be a drastic reduction in the number of news-gathering sources.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2371889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2371889", "title": "Romantic friendship", "text": "Romantic friendship\n\nA romantic friendship, passionate friendship, or affectionate friendship is a very close but typically non-sexual relationship between friends, often involving a degree of physical closeness beyond that which is common in the contemporary Western societies. It may include for example holding hands, cuddling, hugging, kissing, giving massages, and sharing a bed, or co-sleeping, without sexual intercourse or other physical sexual expression.\n\nIn historical scholarship, the term may be used to describe a very close relationship between people of the same sex during a period of history when homosexuality did not exist as a social category. In this regard, the term was coined in the later 20th century in order to retrospectively describe a type of relationship which until the mid 19th century had been considered unremarkable but since the second half of the 19th century had become more rare as physical intimacy between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety. Romantic friendship between women in Europe and North America became especially prevalent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of female education and a new rhetoric of sexual difference.\nThe study of historical romantic friendship is difficult because the primary source material consists of writing about love relationships, which typically took the form of love letters, poems, or philosophical essays rather than objective studies. Most of these do not explicitly state the sexual or nonsexual nature of relationships; the fact that homosexuality was taboo in Western European cultures at the time means that some sexual relationships may be hidden, but at the same time the rareness of romantic friendship in modern times means that references to nonsexual relationships may be misinterpreted, as alleged by Faderman, Coontz, Anthony Rotundo, Douglas Bush, and others.\n\nThe content of Shakespeare's works has raised the question of whether he may have been bisexual.\nAlthough twenty-six of Shakespeare's sonnets are love poems addressed to a married woman (the \"Dark Lady\"), one hundred and twenty-six are addressed to an adolescent boy (known as the \"Fair Youth\"). The amorous tone of the latter group, which focus on the boy's beauty, has been interpreted as evidence for Shakespeare's bisexuality, although others interpret them as referring to intense friendship or fatherly affection, not sexual love.\n\nAmong those of the latter interpretation, in the preface to his 1961 Pelican edition, Douglas Bush writes:\nBush cites Montaigne, who distinguished male friendships from \"that other, licentious Greek love\", as evidence of a platonic interpretation.\n\nThe French philosopher Montaigne described the concept of romantic friendship (without using this English term) in his essay \"On Friendship.\" In addition to distinguishing this type of love from homosexuality (\"this other Greek licence\"), another way in which Montaigne differed from the modern view was that he felt that friendship and platonic emotion were a primarily masculine capacity (apparently unaware of the custom of female romantic friendship which also existed):\n\nLesbian-feminist historian Lillian Faderman cites Montaigne, using \"On Friendship\" as evidence that romantic friendship was distinct from homosexuality, since the former could be extolled by famous and respected writers, who simultaneously disparaged homosexuality. (The quotation also furthers Faderman's beliefs that gender and sexuality are socially constructed, since they indicate that each sex has been thought of as \"better\" at intense friendship in one or another period of history.)\n\nSome historians have used the relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed as another example of a relationship that modern people see as ambiguous or possibly gay, but which was most likely to have been a romantic friendship. Lincoln and Speed lived together, shared a bed in their youth and maintained a lifelong friendship. David Herbert Donald pointed out that men at that time often shared beds for financial reasons; men were accustomed to same-sex nonsexual intimacy, since most parents could not afford separate beds or rooms for male siblings. Anthony Rotundo notes that the custom of romantic friendship for men in America in the early 19th century was different from that of Renaissance France, and it was expected that men would distance themselves emotionally and physically somewhat after marriage; he claims that letters between Lincoln and Speed show this distancing after Lincoln married Mary Todd. Such distancing is still practiced today.\n\nProponents of the romantic friendship hypothesis also make reference to the Bible. Historians like Faderman and Robert Brain believe that the descriptions of relationships such as David and Jonathan or Ruth and Naomi in this religious text establish that the customs of romantic friendship existed and were thought of as virtuous in the ancient Near East, despite the simultaneous taboo on homosexuality.\n\nThe relationship between King David and Jonathan, son of King Saul, is often cited as an example of male romantic friendship; for example, Faderman uses 2 Samuel 1:26 on the title page of her book: \"Your love was wonderful to me, passing the love of women.\"\n\nRuth and her mother-in-law Naomi are the female Biblical pair most often cited as a possible romantic friendship, as in the following verse commonly used in same-sex wedding ceremonies:\n\nFaderman writes that women in Renaissance and Victorian times made reference to both Ruth and Naomi and \"Davidean\" friendship as the basis for their romantic friendships.\n\nWhile some authors, notably John Boswell, have claimed that ecclesiastical practice in earlier ages blessed \"same sex unions\", the accurate interpretation of these relationships rests on a proper understanding of the mores and values of the participants, including both the parties receiving the rite in question and the clergy officiating at it. Boswell himself concedes that past relationships are ambiguous; when describing Greek and Roman attitudes, Boswell states that \"[A] consensual physical aspect would have been utterly irrelevant to placing the relationship in a meaningful taxonomy.\" Boswell's own interpretation has been thoroughly critiqued, notably by Brent D. Shaw, himself a homosexual, in a review written for the New Republic:\n\nHistorian Robert Brain has also traced these ceremonies from Pagan \"blood brotherhood\" ceremonies through medieval Catholic ceremonies called \"gossipry\" or \"siblings before God,\" on to modern ceremonies in some Latin American countries referred to as \"compadrazgo\"; Brain considers the ceremonies to refer to romantic friendship.\n\nAs the American suffrage movement succeeded in gaining rights for white middle- and upper-class women, heterosexual marriage became less of a necessity, and many more women went to college and continued to live in female-centric communities after graduation. The all-women peer culture formed at women's colleges allowed students to create their own social rules and hierarchies, to become each other's leaders and heroes, and to idolize each other. These idolizations often took the forms of romantic friendships, which contemporaries called \"smashes\", \"crushes\" and \"spoons.\"\n\nThe practice of \"smashing\" involved one student showering another with gifts: notes, chocolates, sometimes even locks of hair. When the object of the student's affections was wooed and the two of them began spending all their time together, the \"aggressor\" was perceived by her friends as \"smashed\". In the early twentieth century, \"crush\" gradually replaced the term \"smash\", and generally signified a younger girl's infatuation with an older peer. Historian Susan Van Dyne has documented an \"intimate friendship\" between Mary Mathers and Frona Brooks, two members of the Smith College class of 1883. Mathers and Brooks exchanged tokens of affection, relished time spent alone together, and celebrated an anniversary.\n\nRomantic friendships kindled in women's colleges sometimes continued after graduation, with women living together in \"Boston marriages\" or cooperative houses. Women who openly committed themselves to other women often found acceptance of their commitment and lifestyle in academic fields, and felt comfortable expressing their feelings for their same-sex companions.\n\nAt the turn of the century, smashes and crushes were considered an essential part of the women's college experience, and students who wrote home spoke openly about their involvement in romantic friendships. By the 1920s, however, public opinion had turned against crushes as the American public began to realize that female sexuality might not be dependent on men.\n\nSeveral small groups of advocates and researchers have advocated for the renewed use of the term, or the related term Boston marriage, today. Several lesbian, gay, and feminist authors (such as Lillian Faderman, Stephanie Coontz, Jaclyn Geller and Esther Rothblum) have done academic research on the topic; these authors typically favor the social constructionist view that sexual orientation is a modern, culturally constructed concept.\n\n"}
{"id": "5865712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5865712", "title": "Sakya Pandita", "text": "Sakya Pandita\n\nSakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen (Tibetan: ས་སྐྱ་པནདིཏ་ཀུན་དགའ་རྒྱལ་མཚན, )1182-28 November 1251) was a Tibetan spiritual leader and Buddhist scholar and the fourth of the Five Sakya Forefathers (). Künga Gyeltsen is generally known simply as Sakya Pandita, a title given to him in recognition of his scholarly achievements and knowledge of Sanskrit. He is held in the tradition to have been an emanation of Manjusri, the embodiment of the wisdom of all the Buddhas.\n\nAfter that he also known as a great scholar in Tibet, Mongolia, China and India and was proficient in the five great sciences of Buddhist philosophy, medicine, grammar, dialectics and sacred Sanskrit literature as well as the minor sciences of rhetoric, synonymies, poetry, dancing and astrology. He is considered to be the fourth Sakya Forefather and sixth Sakya Trizin and one of the most important figures in the Sakya lineage.\n\nHe was born as Palden Dondup at Sakya in the noble family of Jamyanggön (Khön). This lineage had held the abbotship of Sakya on a hereditary basis since 1073. His father was Palchen Öpoche (1150-1203) and his mother Machig Nyitri Cham. Sakya Pandita was the nephew of Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen (1147–1216), and became the principal disciple of this prominent scholar. He was instructed in the sutras and tantras by Dragpa Gyaltsen and mastered Sanskrit and three Inner Asian languages. Eventually he was initiated as a śrāmaṇera by his master and given the religious name Künga Gyeltsen.\n\nAs a young monk, he visited the prominent Kashmiri scholar Śakya Śri, who ordained him as a bhikśu in 1208, and taught him sutras and mantras. Legend has it that he visited Kyirong in Nepal on his way back, and there defeated a brahman Shastri in a debate on logic. He then overcome his opponent in a contest of supernatural powers. As he wanted to show his fellow Tibetans the peculiar dress of Indian Brahmin priests, he brought the Shastri to Tibet where the unlucky loser was killed by the protective deities of the land. The Shastri's head was then tied to a pillar of the great temple in Sakya which remained until modern times. The experience of Sakya Pandita with Indian learning provided a notably South Asian influence to his scholarship later on. His ordination as bhikśu marked the inception of Sakya as a proper monastic order. He acceded as \"dansa chenpo\" or abbot-ruler of Sakya upon the death of his uncle Dragpa Gyaltsen in 1216.\n\nAccording to later Tibetan historiography, Genghis Khan subjugated a king of Tibet in 1206 and then sent a letter to the Sakya abbot. After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, the Tibetans stopped sending tribute. This is, however, a legend without historical foundation. It is known, however, that the grandson of Genghis Khan and second son of Ögedei Khan, Godan Khan was granted an appanage at Liangzhou (present-day Wuwei, Gansu) in 1239. In 1240 he sent an invasion force under Dorta into Tibet. The Mongols reached the Phanyul Valley north of Lhasa, killing some 500 monks and destroying and looting monasteries, villages and towns. The Gyal Lhakhang Monastery went up in flames and many monks of the Reting Monastery were slaughtered by the horsemen. The Drigung Monastery was saved, ostensibly since the Mongols believed that a sudden avalanche of stones could be attributed to the supernatural powers of the lamas. According to L. Petech, the Reting Monastery itself escaped destruction when Dorta reached Dam, and its abbot suggested the Mongols to contact Sakya Paṇḍita, who was a famous author and religious figure and could represent the Tibetans vis-à-vis the Mongols. According to J.Y. Chang, it was rather the Drigung abbot who made the proposal. Later chronicles assert that Dorta sent message to Prince Godan and enumerated the four foremost sects and lamas of Tibet: Kadam, Taklung, Drigung, and Sakya. Godan drew the conclusion that Sakya Pandita was an important and wise lama who could show the road to salvation, and ordered to send a letter of \"invitation\" and presents to him. The actual reason for selecting the Sakya might have been that the sect was specialized in magic rituals that resonated with Mongol beliefs, and was prominent in spreading Buddhist morality. It was also important that Sakya Paṇḍita was a religious hierarch by birth, and thus represented a dynastic continuity useful for the Mongol aim to rule via respected intermediaries.\n\nIn fact, recent research has shown that the letter of summons sent by Godan is a later fabrication. Nevertheless, Sakya Pandita was indeed summoned to come to Godan's royal camp at Liangzhou in 1244. The cleric left Sakya in the company of his two young nephews, the ten-year-old Phagpa and six-year-old Chakna Dorje. As he continually preached sermons along his way he did not arrive at Prince Godan's camp until 1246. There he had to wait for Godan who at the time participated in the Kurultai where Güyük Khan was enthroned. Sakya Paṇḍita and Godan first met in early 1247. He gave religious instruction to the prince and greatly impressed the court with his personality and powerful teachings. He is also said to have cured Prince Godan of a serious illness, probably leprosy. In return, he was allegedly given \"temporal authority over the 13 myriarchies [\"Trikor Chuksum\"] of Central Tibet.\" Since the myriarchies were not yet constituted by this time the story is not entirely correct. It should be understood in the sense that Sakya Paṇḍita was used as the main agent of the Mongols in Tibetan affairs. Tibetan historians quote a long letter by his hand to the various clerical and temporal lords in Tibet in 1249. In order to spare Tibet from devastating invasions, he wrote, it was necessary that the local regimes unconditionally accepted Mongol overlordship. A census was to be taken, and the lords must henceforth carry out the administration in consultation with envoys dispatched by Sakya and in accordance with Mongol law. However, the sources keep silent about the actual imposition of Mongol rule in these years. The death of Güyük Khan in 1248 led to internal rivalries in the dynasty of Genghis Khan until the enthronement of Möngke Khan in 1251. This left Tibetan affairs in a state of limbo for the time being.\n\nSakya Pandita died on 28 November 1251, at the age of seventy, in the Trulpaide temple in Liangzhou. As he did not marry, he chose his brother's son Chogyal Phagpa as his heir, and nominated him before his death as the successor to his religious authority by giving him his conch shell and begging bowl. After his death Phagpa continued his mission. The conch is one of the Ashtamangala and the begging bowl was a particular symbol of Gautama Buddha and the śramaṇas.\n\nAfter Sakya Pandita's death, the new Mongol ruler Möngke Khan chose to patronize the Drikung Kagyu while the other main schools were put under the protection of various Mongol princes. Nevertheless, a decree from 1252 stated that the Sakya precepts should be followed in the main. Meanwhile, Phagpa won a position in the court of Möngke's brother Kublai Khan and became the tantric guru of the prince in 1258. When Kubilai came to power in 1260 he appointed Phagpa \"guoshi\" \"preceptor of the kingdom\". Thus began a strong Sakya-Mongol alliance, and the see or \"densa\" () of Sakya became the administrative capital of Tibet in 1264. This lasted until about the middle of the 14th century. During the reign of the 14th Sakya Trizin, Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen, the myriarch Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty began to subordinate the Central Tibetan province Ü, marking the \"beginning of the end of the period of Sakya power in Central Tibet.\"\n\nIn the lineage of the Tibetan Panchen Lamas there were considered to be four Indian and three Tibetan tulkus of Amitābha before Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama. The lineage starts with Subhuti, one of the original disciples of Gautama Buddha. Sakya Paṇḍita is considered to be the second Tibetan emanation of Amitābha in this line.\n\nHe is best known for his works such as the \"Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition (Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter)\" and the \"Discrimination of the Three Vows (sDom-gsum rab-dbye)\". He produced five major works in all, the other three being \"The Entrance Gate for the Wise (Mkhas pa rnams 'jug pa'i sgo)\", \"Clarifying the Sage's Intention (Thub pa'i dgongs gsal)\", and the \"Elegant Sayings of Sakya Pandita (sa skya legs bshad).\" The latter is a collection of moral precepts in verse which was imitated by others and translated into Mongolian. He focused on doctrine and logic \"basing himself upon the \"Pramanavarttika\" of Dharmakirti\" and was very interested in rhetoric. With his profound knowledge of Indian Buddhism, Sakya Paṇḍita was observant of what was seen as aberrations in Tibetan Buddhism. He was suspicious of lamas who promised enlightenment without going through the consecutive stages of Buddhist practices and took a more conservative view. The scholastic tradition of Tibetan Buddhism owes much to him, and his works are still included in the monastic curricula today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bhāviveka criticised Buddhapalitas abstinence from syllogistic reasoning in his commentary on Nagarjuna. Following the example of the influential logician Dignāga, Bhāviveka used autonomous syllogistic reasoning (\"svātantra\") syllogisms in the explanation of Madhyamaka. To have a common ground with essentialist opponents, and make it possible to use syllogistic reasoning in discussion with those essentialists, Bhāviveka argued that things can be said to exist conventionally 'according to characteristics'. This makes it possible to take the mere object as the point of departure for the discussion on inherent existence. From there, it is possible to explain how these things are ultimately empty of inherent existence.\n\n\"Prasaṅgika\" views are based on Candrakīrti's critique of Bhāviveka, arguing for a sole reliance on \"prasaṅga\", \"logic consequence,\" a method of reductio ad absurdum which is used by all Madhyamikas, using syllogisms to point out the absurd and impossible logical consequences of holding essentialist views. According to Candrakīrti, the mere object can only be discussed if both parties perceive it in the same way. As a consequence (according to Candrakirti) svatantrika reasoning is impossible in a debate, since the opponents argue from two irreconcilable points of view, namely a mistaken essentialist perception, and a correct non-essentialist perception. This leaves no ground for a discussion starting from a similarly perceived object of discussion, and also makes impossible the use of syllogistic reasoning to convince the opponent.\n\nCandrakīrti's works had no influence on Indian and early Tibetan Madhayamaka, but started to rise to prominence in Tibet in the 12th century. Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), the founder of the Gelugpa school and the most outspoken proponent of the distinction, followed Candrakīrti in his rejection of Bhavaviveka's arguments. According to Tsongkhapa, the Svātantrikas do negate intrinsic nature ultimately, but \"accept that things conventionally have intrinsic character or intrinsic nature.\" Tsongkhapa, commenting on Candrakirti, says that he \"refute[s] essential or intrinsic nature even conventionally.\" For Tsongkhapa, as well as for the Karma Kagyu school, the differences with Bhavaviveka are of major importance.\n\nEstablished by Lama Tsongkhapa, Candrakīrti's view replaced the \"Yogācāra-Mādhyamika\" approach of Śāntarakṣita (725–788), who synthesized Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Buddhist logic in a powerful and influential synthesis called \"Yogācāra-Mādhyamika\". Śāntarakṣita established Buddhism in Tibet, and his \"Yogācāra-Mādhyamika\" was the primary philosophic viewpoint until the 12th century, when the works of Candrakīrti were first translated into Tibetan. In this synthesis, conventional truth or reality is explained and analysed in terms of the Yogacara system, while the ultimate truth is presented in terms of the Madhyamaka system. While Śāntarakṣita's synthesis reflects the final development of Indian Madhyamaka and post-dates Candrakīrti, Tibetan doxographers ignored the nuances of Śāntarakṣita's synthesis, grouping his approach together with Bhāviveka's, due to their usage of syllogistic reasonings to explain and defend Madhyamaka.\n\nAfter the 17th century civil war in Tibet and the Mongol intervention which put the Gelugpa school in the center of power, Tsongkhapa's views dominated Tibetan Buddhism until the 20th century. The Rimé movement revived alternate teachings, providing alternatives to Tsongkhapa's interpretation, and reintroducing Śāntarakṣita's nuances. For the Sakya and Nyingma schools, which participated in the Rimé movement, the Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction is generally viewed to be of lesser importance. For these schools, the key distinction between these viewpoints is whether one works with assertions about the ultimate nature of reality, or if one refrains completely from doing so. If one works with assertions, then that is a Svātantrika approach. Refraining from doing so is a Prāsangika approach.\n\nMadhyamaka originated with the works of \n\nThe name \"Prasangika\" is derived from , a method of logical inquiry which deconstructs the opponents' argument in debate through the use of unwanted logical consequences. It arises from Bhāvaviveka's criticism that Buddhapālita ought not to have relied solely on \"reductio ad absurdum\" argumentation —hence the name \"Prāsangika\", from \"prāsanga\" (\"consequence\")—but ought to have set forth \"autonomous\" (\"svātantra\") syllogisms of his own.\n\nBhāviveka (c. 500 – c. 578 CE) argued that autonomous syllogistic reasoning was required when explaining or commenting on Nagarjuna's teachings on voidness or essencelessness. To be able to use syllogistic reasoning, both parties need to share a common object of discussion at the conventional level. While the various opponents have different opinions on the specifics of their teachings, the \"mere\" objects or \"mere\" forms are commonly appearing to both parties, \"enjoy[ing] a certain existence 'according to their characteristics.\"\n\nBhāviveka criticised Buddhapalita for merely repeating Nagarjuna's ad absurdum approach in his commentary, instead of clarifying Nagarjuna's teachings. According to Bhāviveka, syllogistic reasoning could be used for the sake of clarification. Bhāviveka further argued that Buddhapalita only showed the logical consequences, and incoherence, of the Samkhya's views on causation and inherent existence, but failed to address their arguments against Buddhist critiques. Furthermore, simply negating the opponent's view, without positing one's own position, \"leaves room for doubt in the opponent's mind,\" and is unwarranted.\n\nTo facilitate the possibility of discussing Madhyamaka with opponents, Bhāviveka made a provisional division of the two truths, accepting that phenomena exist \"according to their characteristics.\" Bhāviveka made a further distinction in his treatment of ultimate truth or reality. Ultimate truth or reality transcends discursive thought, and cannot be expressed in words. To be able to talk about it anyway, and distinguish it from relative truth or reality, Bhāviveka makes a distinction between the \"world-transcending\" or \"ultimate truth in itself,\" which is ineffable and beyond words; and the \"pure worldly wisdom\" or \"approximate truth,\" which can be talked about and points to the \"ultimate truth in itself,\" which has to be personally experienced.\n\nDreyfus and McClintock observe that Bhāvaviveka was more influential in Indian Madhyamaka than was Candrakirti: \"In this regard, Bhāvaviveka should probably be seen as quite successful: apart from Candrakirti and Jayananda, nearly all other Indian Madhyamikas were to follow in his footsteps and embrace autonomous arguments as important tools in their endeavors to establish the supremacy of the Madhyamaka view.\"\n\nCandrakirti (c. 600 – c. 650 CE) had little impact during his lifetime. The first commentary on his \"Madhyamakavatara\" was written in India in the 11th century, more than 300 years after his death. In the 12th century his works were translated in Tibetan, and became highly influential.\n\nCandrakirti rejected Bhāviveka's criticism of Buddhapālita, and his use of independent logic. According to Candrakīrti, the mere object can only be discussed if both parties perceive it in the same way. According to Candrakirti, this is impossible, since the opponents argue from two irreconcilable points of view, namely a mistaken essentialist perception, and a correct non-essentialist perception. This leaves no ground for a discussion starting from a similarly perceived object of discussion, and also makes impossible the use of syllogistic reasoning to convince the opponent. According to Chandrakirti, without a conventionally appearing set of characteristics to designate upon, the Svātantrika would not be able to establish a syllogism.\n\nCandrakirti also rejected Bhāviveka's argument that autonomous arguments should be used in commentaries to clarify the original text, noting that Nagarjuna himself, in his auto-commentary on the \"Vigrahavyavartani\", also didn't use autonomous arguments.\n\nCandrakirti rejected \"the use of autonomous arguments, for the very reason that they imply the acceptance (however provisional) of entities. According to Chandrakirti, this mode of thinking is a subtle form of grasping at inherent existence: one's mind is still searching for some way to hold on to an essence, self, or identity for conventionally perceived objects. For Candrakirti, there is no use in explaining the relative truth in any philosophical system; \"the relative truth consists simply of phenomena as we observe them, the unanalyzed constituents of the common consensus.\" The only aim of consequential arguments \"is to introduce the mind to the direct knowledge of emptiness, not an intellectual understanding of it,\" making \"no concessions to the spiritually unprepared.\"\n\nCandrakirti's criticism was \"part of a wider rejection of the logico-epistemological tradition of Dignāga, which he regarded as a misguided attempt to find \"philosophical completeness\" and a sense of intellectual security that is antithetical to the fundamental insight of Madhyamaka.\" Candrakirti did not reject the use of logic, but it served to demarcate the limits of discursive thought. In the absence of any agreement between Madhyamikas and substantialists, \"prasanga\" is the best approach \"to indicate the ultimate without making statements that [...] compromise or [...] obscure their own position.\" Since the use of autonomous arguments implies the acceptance of real entities, even if only provisional, they should not be used.\n\nBorn and educated in India, Śāntarakṣita (725–788) came to the Tibetan Empire at the instigation of King Trisong Detsen after Nyang Tingdzin Zangpo had encouraged the King to make the invitation. Śāntarakṣita came to Tibet sometime before 767 CE. He oversaw the construction of the first Buddhist monastery at Samye in 787 CE, ordained the first monastics there, had Indian Buddhist texts brought to Tibet, and started the first translation project. He also advised the king to invite Padmasambhava to come to Tibet. He was also instrumental in the coming of Kamalaśīla to Tibet, who participated in the so-called \"council of Lhasa,\" which, according to Tibetan tradition, led to the defeat of the Chinese chan monk Moheyan, and the establishment of Indian Buddhism as the norm for Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nŚāntarakṣita synthesised Madhyamaka, Yogacara, and the logico-epistemological tradition of Dignaga and Dharmakirti. In this synthesis, conventional truth or reality is explained and analysed in terms of the Yogacara system, while the ultimate truth is presented in terms of the Madhyamaka system.\n\nWhen Buddhism was established in Tibet, the primary philosophic viewpoint established there was that of Śāntarakṣita (725–788), a synthesis of Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Buddhist logic called \"Yogācāra-Mādhyamika\". A common distinction of Madhyamaka teachings was given by Jnanasutra (, 8th–9th centuries), a student of Śāntarakṣita: \n\nThe difference lies in their \"acceptance or rejection of extramental phenomena on the conventional level.\" While Bhavaviveka considered material phenomena at the conventional level as to be existent outside the mind, he applied Sautrantika terminology to describe and explain them. Śāntarakṣita rejected this approach, denying \"the extramental status of phenomena appearing within the sphere of conventional truth.\" Instead, he saw conventional phenomena as manifestations of the mind, in line with the Yogacara approach.\n\nCandrakirti's works were known in Tibet as early as the 8th century, but \"specifically in connection with the logical tradition,\" when Candrakirti's \"Yuktishashtika\" was translated by Yeshe De (Jnanasutra) and some others. The Prāsangika-Svātantrika distinction was possibly invented by the Tibetan translator Pa tshab nyi ma grags (1055-1145), using the terms \"Rang rgyud pa\" and \"Thal 'gyur ba\", which were Sanskritized by modern scholars as \"Svātantrika\" and \"Prāsaṅgika\". According to Dreyfus and McClintock, Tibetan scholars themselves state that the distinction \"is a Tibetan creation that was retroactively applied in an attempt to bring clarity and order to the study of contemporary Indian Madhyamaka interpretations.\" Later Gelugpa scholars as well as Nyingmapas, after Candrakīrti's works were translated in Tibetan in the 12th century, considered both of the above to constitute subdivisions of Svatantrika, however, under the names of \n\nThose various teachers, and their approaches were grouped together due to their usage of syllogistic reasonings to explain and defend Madhyamaka, in disregard of the philosophical nuances of Śāntarakṣita's approach.\n\nA related doctrinal topic of profound disagreement is between Rangtong-Shentong, which concerns the \"nature\" of ultimate truth as empty of a self or essence, or as constituting an absolute reality which is \"truly existing\" and empty of any other, transitional phenomena.\n\nInitially, this new distinction based on Candrakirti's \"Prasannapada\" met with fierce resistance in Tibet, but gained in popularity and was strongly supported by Je Tsongkhapa (1357 – 1419 CE). He became the most outspoken defender of the Svātantrika-Prāsaṅgika distinction, arguing that \"the two subschools are separated by crucial philosophical differences, including a different understanding of emptiness and of conventional reality.\" Tsongkhapa was a powerful personality with a large following, but he too met with a strong resistance, especially within the Sakya school to which he originally belonged. His critics rejected his interpretation as \"inadequate, newfangled, and unsupported by tradition.\" According to those critics, Tsongkhapa had \"greatly exaggerated the divergence of view.\"\n\nTsongkhapa's view became the dominant view in the beginning of the 17th century, when Gusri Khan (1582-1655) ended the civil war in central Tibet, putting the 5th Dalai Lamai in command of the temples in Tibet. This gave the Gelugpa school a strong political power, and the means to effectively ban the writings of Tsongkhapa's critics.\n\nFor Tsongkhapa, the Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction centers around the usage of autonomous syllogistic reasoning to convince opponents of the Madhyamaka point of view, and the implications of the establishment of conventional existence 'according to characteristics'.\n\nTsongkhapa objected against Bhaviveka's use of autonomous syllogistic reasoning in explaining voidness or essencelessness. To be able to use syllogistic reasoning, both parties need to have a common ground onto which those syllogistic reasonings can be applied. This common ground is the shared perception of the object whose's emptiness of inherent existence is to be established. According to Bhaviveka, this shared perception is possible because the perceived objects are mentally imputed (labeled) based on characteristic marks which distinguishes them from other objects.\n\nThe Prāsaṅgika reject this idea, arguing that \"[w]hat establishes that things exist is only that they are imputable, not that they are imputable with a findable characteristic.\" According to Tsongkhapa, there is no such common ground or shared perception, while the reliance on characteristic marks implies an inherent existence at the conventional level, which is not in accord with the Madhyamaka point of view.\n\nTsongkhapa holds reductio ad absurdum of essentialist viewpoints to be the most valid method of demonstrating emptiness of inherent existence, and of demonstrating that conventional things do not have a naturally occurring conventional identity. According to Tsongkhapa, if both people in a debate or discussion have a valid understanding of emptiness already, then autonomous syllogistic arguments could be quite effective. However, in a circumstance where one or both parties in a debate or discussion do not hold a valid understanding, \"the debate [should be] founded on what the parties accept as valid. Hence, it is proper to refute opponents in terms of what they accept.\" In other words, it is more appropriate to establish a position of emptiness through showing the logical consequences of the incorrect position that the opponent already accepts, than it is to establish emptiness through syllogistic reasoning using premises that the opponent (and perhaps even the proponent) do not fully or deeply understand.\n\nWhile Tsongkhapa's view met with strong resistance after their introduction, his views came to dominate Tibet in the 17th century, with the Ganden Phodrang government, after the military intervention of the Mongol lord Gusri Khan. He supported the Gelugpa's against the Tsangpa family, and put the 5th Dalai Lama in charge of Tibet. Seminal texts which were critical of Tsongkhapa's views, such as Gorampas critic, \"ceased to be available and were almost lost.\"\n\nAccording to Dreyfus & McClintock, \"many other Tibetan commentators have tended to downplay the significance of any differences.\"\n\nIn the 19th century the concurring Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya schools joined forces in the Rimé movement, in an attempt to preserve their religious legacy against the dominant Gelugpa school. Ju Mipham's commentary on Santarakshita's \"Madhyamakalankara\" (\"The Adornment of the Middle Way\") is an example of this new impetus to older strands of Tibetan Buddhism. Mipham presents an alternative interpretation of the Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction, in which the emphasis is not on \"dialectical preferences,\" (consequential reasoning versus syllogistic reasoning), but on the distinction between the \"approximate ultimate truth\" and the \"actual ultimate truth,\" just like Bhavaviveka did. According to Mipham, \"the authentic Svatantrika is the approach that emphasizes the approximate ultimate, while the Prasangika approach emphasizes the ultimate in itself, beyond all assertions.\" His is a gradual approach, starting with sensory experience and the 'realness' of the \"things\" perceived through them, which are \"provisionally accorded a certain existence.\" From there the approximate ultimate truth is posited, demonstrating that \"phenomena cannot possibly exist in the way that they appear,\" invalidating the conventional reality of appearances. From there, \"the ultimate truth in itself, which is completely free from all ssertion, is reached.\" While the Svatantrikas do make assertions about conventional truth or reality, they stay silent on the ultimate in itself, just like the Prasangikas.\n\nAccording to Ju Mipham, Tsongkhapa's approach was seriously flawed. Tsongkhapa's approach leads students in the right direction but will not lead to the true ultimate until they go further. Mipham further argues that Tsongkhapa's approach is an excellent Svatantrika approach, because of the way he refutes true establishment instead of objects themselves. According to the Padmakara Translation Group, \"its presentation of \"conventional,\" as distinct from \"true,\" existence seems very close to the \"existence according to characteristics\" that Bhavya had ascribed to phenomena on the relative level.\n\nThe Sakya teacher Gorampa was critical of Tsongkhapa and his views. One of Gorampa's most important and popular works is \"Distinguishing the Views\" (), in which he argues for his view of Madhyamaka. He and other Sakya teachers classify themselves as presenting the \"Freedom from Proliferation\" () Madhyamaka. Gorampa does not agree with Tsonghkapa that the Prasangika and Svatantrika methods produce different results, nor that the Prasangika is a \"higher\" view. He does also critique the Svatantrika approach as having too much reliance on logic, because in his view the component parts of syllogistic logic are not applicable in the realm of the ultimate. But this critique is constrained to the methodology, and he believed both approaches reach the same ultimate realization.\n\nMainstream Sakyas (following Rongtön and Gorampa) also hold the position that the distinction between these two schools is merely of a pedagogical nature. With regard to the view of the ultimate truth there is no difference between them.\n\nKagyu and Sakya scholars have argued against the claim that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach. According to those critics, there is no difference in the realization of those using the Svatantrika and Prasangika approaches. They also argue that the Svatantrika approach is better for students who are not able to understand the more direct approach of Prasangika, but it nonetheless results in the same ultimate realization.\n\nThe debate is also not strictly along lineage lines, since there are some non-Gelugpa's who prefer Je Tsongkhapa's points, while a notable Gelugpa, Gendün Chöphel, preferred and wrote about Ju Mipham's interpretation.\n\nWhile Lama Tsongkhapa's approach to Madhyamaka is still viewed as authoritative in the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, the 14th Dalai integrates Gelugpa Madhyamaka with Dzogchen views, as did the 5th Dalai Lama. The 14th Dalai Lama has published works like \"The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra\" which seem to be influenced by the views of Śāntarakṣita and Padmasambhava, and contain a blend of Tantric theory, Chittamātra, and Madyamaka-Prasangika.\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama also disagrees, echoing sentiments from classical authorities like Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen (4th Panchen Lama) stating that the credible teachers of the various systems of Buddhist philosophy all \"arrive at the same intended point\" of realization. However, they also state that this non-denominational position is very difficult to establish through reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who ruled France from 1848-1870. It was translated into English in 2002. Small portions were translated in 1967 as an appendix to Norman Cohn's \"Warrant for Genocide\", which identifies it as the main source of the later \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".\n\nThe piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer Lucian and introduced into the French belles-lettres by Bernard de Fontenelle in the 18th century. Shadows of the historical characters of Niccolo Machiavelli and Charles Montesquieu meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way Joly tried to cover up a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon's rule.\n\nJoly relates in his 1870 autobiography\n\nthat one evening thinking of economist Abbé Galiani's treatise \"Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds\" (\"Dialogues on the commerce in wheat\")\nand walking by Pont Royal, he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu would make the case for liberalism; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for despotism.\n\nMachiavelli claims that he \"... wouldn't even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia\". Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly's plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: \"... Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need\" of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails. In the curtain-line Montesquieu exclaims \"Eternal God, what have you permitted!...\".\nThe book was published anonymously (par un contemporain, \"by a contemporary\") in Brussels in 1864\n\nCampaigning against Napoleon III at the French constitutional referendum, 1870, Joly wrote an epilogue to his \"Dialogue\". It was published at Le Gaulois \n\nand La Cloche\n\nmagazines.\n\nIn the beginning of 20th century Joly's book was used as a basis for \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\",\nan infamous Russian-made antisemitic literary forgery. There is an abundance of evidence that \"The Protocols\" were lavishly plagiarized from Joly's book.\n\nItalian writer Umberto Eco claims\nthat in the \"Dialogue\" Joly plagiarized seven pages or more from a popular novel \"Les Mystères du peuple\" by Eugene Sue.\n"}

Harford argues that rational behavior is more widespread than expected in the larger population. He uses economic principles to draw forth the rational elements of supposedly illogical behaviors to illustrate his point.\n\nThe overwhelming gain paradox is a paradox of reasoning that is referred to in the book.\n\nHarford illustrates the paradox by the comparison of three potential job offers:\n\nMost people will state that they will choose to work hard in jobs 1 and 3, but not job 2. In Job 1, working hard is obvious because there is a clear reward for doing so. In Job 2, it seems a bad choice because the likelihood of a reward is so low. But in Job 3, working hard becomes the preferable choice, because the potential gain is so overwhelming that any chance - no matter how small - of obtaining it is seen as worthwhile. This appears irrational and paradoxical, because jobs 2 and 3 are identical 99% of the time.\n\nHarford uses the Overwhelming Gain Paradox to explain the high salaries of certain professionals, such as bankers, executives and entertainers. He argues that the process of preparing for and getting many of these jobs requires extremely hard work with little or no guarantee of reward - usually due to low market demand, or uncertainty. Thus, the rewards for these jobs are set high as the result of a rational choice to exploit the overwhelming gain paradox; were it not for this, most jobs in this category would be seen as resembling job 2, making it unlikely anyone would aspire to them at all, or work hard enough to potentially qualify for them. The exploitation of the paradox also has negative consequences: the resulting high number of aspirants raises levels of competition, and the presence of the paradox amplifies irrational behavior in job hunting; but these are seen as preferable to these jobs attracting no interest at all.\n\n\n"}

Obote was still party leader when he died in October 2005, although he had previously announced his intention to step down.\n\nThe party won nine out of 289 elected seats in the 2006 general election. In the presidential election of the same date, UPC candidate Miria Obote won 0.8 percent of the vote.\n\nOn 14 May 2010, the party elected Olara Otunnu, a former United Nations undersecretary-general for children and armed conflict, to lead the party. He replaced Obote's widow Miria.\n\nThe UPC dominated Ugandan politics from independence until 1971, when Milton Obote was overthrown by Idi Amin. The party returned to power under Obote in 1980 until he was overthrown again in 1985 by Tito Okello. The history of the UPC is intertwined with the ethnic divide that has plagued Uganda since it was a British protectorate.\n\nAs independence approached in the 1940s-1950s, it was clear that the Baganda (the largest ethnic group) wanted extensive autonomy in Uganda, and the Buganda King's party Kabaka Yekka (\"The King Only\") emphasised this desire. However, this was not favoured by most Ugandans of other tribes and amongst some Buganda educated elite who formed an alternative party, the Democratic Party, to aspire for national unity. Although unpopular in Buganda, the Democratic Party had widespread support in the rest of the Bantu-speaking South.\n\nInto this void, there emerged an alternative - the Uganda National Congress (UNC). Although led by a northerner (Milton Obote), the UNC appeared more modernist and accommodating and attracted many southerners particularly in the east. The UNC formed a number of alliances with other parties and emerged as the UPC. The three parties (Kabaka Yekka, UPC, and the Democratic Party) contested the first pre-independence election.\n\nAs expected, Kabaka Yekka won most of the seats in Buganda and the UPC won most seats in the north and east. However the Democratic Party (DP) led by Benedicto Kiwanuka emerged as the largest single party. Kiwanuka was on the verge of becoming the first prime minister of independent Uganda when he was thwarted by a surprising alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka.\n\nThe Kabaka was afraid that DP would remove the monarchy in favour of a more modern-looking Uganda. As for the UPC, Milton Obote, realising he had lost the election, saw the alliance as the way to power. In return, Obote offered the Kabaka a ceremonial role in the new administration and the retention of all royal powers. The UPC/KY alliance thus formed Uganda's first government with Milton Obote as prime minister.\n\nThe alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka did not last long. After four years in power, Milton Obote ordered a military attack on the Kabaka's palace in 1966. The attack was led by an army officer called Idi Amin. The Kabaka escaped to London and Obote declared himself President of Uganda. This action more than anything else began the decline of the UPC as a popular party in Uganda. As his unpopularity grew Obote increasingly turned to his Northern home support rather than trying to strengthen the party in the South. The 1969 elections were cancelled and Obote became dictatorial. His government was overthrown in 1971 by Idi Amin.\n\nThe UPC returned in 1979 after Idi Amin was overthrown. Obote as leader of the UPC was closely aligned to the Military Junta that had replaced Idi Amin and rather than strengthen the support of the party in the South of Uganda took up a more military approach. The army (traditionally dominated by Northerners) was a brutal machine that carried out numerous atrocities particularly in the South. This polarised the North/South divide with the UPC being perceived more as a Northern party than ever before. Southerners turned to the Democratic Party and a smaller party called the Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM) led by a former UPC member, Yoweri Museveni.\n\nIn the elections of 1980, there was overwhelming suspicion that the UPC had rigged the result with the help of the Military Junta. This perception was further enhanced when Obote appointed the head of the Military Junta, Paulo Muwanga as his Vice President when the UPC was declared the winner of the elections. A civil war broke out in Uganda when Yoweri Museveni rejected the result and went to the bush to fight the government.\n\nYoweri Museveni's eventual success was due to the North/South divide that the UPC had helped foster in Uganda. Southerners more than ever before realised that they had to take up arms to protect their rights. In the past most Southerners had despised military careers. When Museveni came to power in 1986, his army was dominated by Southerners particularly from the west.\n\nOn November 28, 2005, Obote's widow Miria was elected party president. Miria Obote was UPC's presidential candidate in the 2006 general election.\n\nThe UPC returned to contest the election in 2006, when Museveni restored multi-party elections; however Obote died in exile a few months before. The UPC's traditional heartland in the North appeared uninterested in the UPC without Obote, but still opposed Museveni. This time they turned to Museveni's main opponent Kizza Besyigye (from the South) who led the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC).\n\nThe UPC had failed even to capitalise on its self-created dilemma (appearing to be a Northern party) by not appointing a popular Northern politician to lead the party - instead they opted for Obote's widow (Miria), a Southerner. After the elections, the party suffered many high level defections to Museveni's ruling National Resistance Movement and to the FDC. Miria's election is a source of resentment, and many Ugandans still associate the party with the military excesses of the past. In the 23 February 2006 parliamentary election, the party won nine out of 319 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThe UPC's poor performance in the 2006 elections forced the party to review its place in Ugandan politics. Uganda's political landscape is changing from regional based parties to personality driven politics. The party needed to find a leader with a recognised calibre in politics. The party chose Dr. Olara Otunnu, a former UN under secretary general for children and armed conflict. The election however revealed internal conflicts in the party that are likely to affect its performance at the 2011 elections. Otunnu served under Tito Okello as Foreign Minister and is seen by some as part of the putsch that overthrew the last UPC government in 1985.\n\nOtunnu's main rival at the party elections was Milton Obote's son Jimmy Akena, the Member of Parliament for Lira Municipality showing the Obote family still cherishes the party that Obote created.\n\n"}

In certain theologies, universalism is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe, whose being is independent of and unconstrained by the events and conditions that compose the universe, such as entropy and physical locality. \n\nThis article also discusses Kantian and Platonist notions of \"universal\", which are considered by most philosophers to be separate notions.\n\nWhen used in the context of ethics, the meaning of \"universal\" refers to that which is true for \"all similarly situated individuals.\" Rights, for example in natural rights, or in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, for those heavily influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment and its conception of a human nature, could be considered universal. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights is inspired by such principles.\n\nIn logic, or the consideration of valid arguments, a proposition is said to have universality if it can be conceived as being true in all possible contexts without creating a contradiction. Some philosophers have referred to such propositions as universalizable. A truth is considered to be universal if it is logically valid (logical) in and also beyond all times and places. Hence a universal truth is considered logically to transcend the state of the physical universe, whose order is derived from such truths. In this case, such a truth is seen as eternal or as absolute. The patterns and relations expressed by mathematics in ways that are consistent with the fields of logic and mathematics are typically considered truths of universal scope. This is not to say that universality is limited to mathematics, since it is also used in philosophy, theology, and other pursuits.\n\nThe relativist conception denies the existence of some or all universal truths, particularly ethical ones (as moral relativism). Though usage of the word \"truth\" has various domains of application, relativism does not necessarily apply to all of them.\n\nIn metaphysics, a universal is a type, a property, or a relation. The noun \"universal\" contrasts with \"individual\", while the adjective \"universal\" contrasts with \"particular\" or sometimes with \"concrete\". The latter meaning, however, may be confusing since Hegelian and neo-Hegelian (e.g. British idealist) philosophies speak of \"concrete universals\".\n\nA universal may have instances, known as its \"particulars\". For example, the type \"dog\" (or \"doghood\") is a universal, as are the property \"red\" (or \"redness\") and the relation \"betweenness\" (or \"being between\"). Any particular dog, red thing, or object that is between other things is not a universal, however, but is an \"instance\" of a universal. That is, a universal type (\"doghood\"), property (\"redness\"), or relation (\"betweenness\") \"inheres\" a particular object (a specific dog, red thing, or object between other things).\n\nPlatonic realism holds universals to be the referents of general terms, i.e. the \"abstract\", nonphysical entities to which words like \"doghood\", \"redness\", and \"betweenness\" refer. By contrast, particulars are the referents of proper names, like \"Fido\", or of definite descriptions that identify single objects, like the phrase, \"that apple on the table\". By contrast, other metaphysical theories merely use the terminology of universals to describe physical entities.\n\n\"The problem of universals\" is an ancient problem in metaphysics concerning the nature of universals, or whether they exist. Part of the problem involves the implications of language use and the complexity of relating language to ontological theory.\n\nUniversal truth is regarded as ontic, i.e. expressing the order of being itself. A universal truth is epistemic only to the extent that its ontic expression is apprehended or discerned in a veridical way, which cannot affect its being in any case. Most ontological frameworks do not consider classes to be universals, although some prominent philosophers, such as John Bigelow, do. \n\n"}
