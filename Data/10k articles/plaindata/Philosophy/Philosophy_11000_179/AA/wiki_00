Opponents of accidentalism maintain that what seems to be a chance occurrence is actually the result of one or more causes that remain unknown due only to a lack of investigation. Charles Sanders Peirce used the term tychism (from τύχη, chance) for theories that make chance an objective factor in the process of the Universe.\n\nIn ethics the term is used, like indeterminism, to denote the theory that mental change cannot always be ascribed to previously ascertained psychological states, and that volition is not causally related to the motives involved. An example of this theory is the doctrine of the \"liberum arbitrium indifferentiae\" (\"liberty of indifference\"), according to which the choice of two or more alternative possibilities is affected neither by contemporaneous data of an ethical or prudential kind nor by crystallized habit (character).\n\n"}

He was an early commentator on a number of Aristotle's works, in particular those dealing with natural philosophy.\n\nAdam and the theologian Richard Fishacre were two Oxford masters of the mid-13th century. Adam introduced the \"New Aristotle\" at the English university at a time when it was prohibited from being taught in Paris, France because of ecclesiastical restrictions. It is probable that Adam received a degree in theology and penned his Aristotelian commentaries during his regency in arts which began by 1243. His explanation of Aristotle's meaning drew heavily on the writing of Averroes.\n\nHis particular interest was in whether the agent intellect was within the soul or a power of the soul. Averroes' believed in the latter interpretation while many theologians were inclined to affirm the former. Adam doubted that the agent and possible intellect are of the same substance. He wondered if the substance of the possible intellect is within the soul while that of the agent intellect is outside of it. Like his Oxford colleagues he was curious about the unity of the soul. He felt that Aristotle merely refuted the idea of Plato. The latter believed the various functions of the soul (understanding, opinion, desire, etc.) reflected diverse parts of the soul, which were located in different organs. To answer the question left unanswered by Aristotle, Adam commented that each of the properties reside in the soul as a whole. \n\nHe elaborated by saying that each individual being can have only one perfection. So it follows that man's perfection must be in one substance. He thought that according to Aristotelian principles, the vegetative and sensitive souls were of different substance than the 'intellective' soul. His attempt to clarify this was inspired by Philip the Chancellor. However Adam's is a more believable argument concerning this matter than is Philip's \"Summa\". Philip the Chancellor insisted that the body and soul were united by a particular medium.\n\n"}

He earned a Ph.D. degree in 1966 and Dr.Sc. in 1976 from the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1990, he became Professor of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; and at the moment he is the Ernest Gellner Professor of Anthropology (Emeritus). He is a Fellow of the British Academy, Corresponding Member of the UNESCO International Institute for the Study of Nomadic Civilizations, and Honorary Member of the Central Asian Studies Society; as well as the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships.\n\nAnatoly M. Khazanov started his professional career as an archaeologist specializing in the nomadic cultures of the Early Iron Age. In the second half of the 1960s he shifted to socio-cultural anthropology. From 1966-1985, his main fields of research were pastoral nomads and the origins of complex societies. His main argument that the nomads were never autarkic and therefore in economic, cultural, and political respects were dependent on their relations with the sedentary world, is shared now by the majority of experts in the field. On the other hand, Khazanov was trying as much as was possible under Soviet censorship, to demonstrate the fallacy of the Soviet Marxist concept of historical process.\n\nAfter his emigration in 1985 from the Soviet Union, Khazanov continued to study mobile pastoralists, paying particular attention to the role of nomads in world history and to the deficiences and shortcomings of their modernization process. He argued that various modernization projects have failed because they did not provide room for the sustained self-development of the pastoralists and denied their participation in decision-making.\n\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, Khazanov has also become known for his contribution to the study of ethnicity and nationalism, and transitions from communist rule. He was one of the first to argue that in many countries this transition does not guarantee an emergence of liberal democratic order. He also argued that, contrary to widespread opinion, globalization per se is unable to reduce nationalism and ethnic strife, which will remain a salient phenomenon in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the 2000s, Khazanov has also turned to the study of collective memory, collective representation, and other related issues; being particularly interested in their role in defining and redefining national and ethnic identities.\n\nKhazanov has written 6 monographs and around 200 articles. These include \"Nomads and the Outside World\" (Cambridge University Press, 1984; 2nd Edition University of Wisconsin Press, 1994), which has been translated into several languages; \"Soviet Nationality Policy During Perestroika\" (Delphic, 1991), and \"After the U.S.S.R.: Ethnicity, Nationalism, and Politics in the Commonwealth of Independent States\" (University of Wisconsin Press, 1995). He has also edited or co-edited 10 volumes of papers, including \"Pastoralism in the Levant: Archaeological Materials in the Anthropological Perspective\" (Prehistory Press, 1992) with Ofer Bar-Yosef, \"Changing Nomads in a Changing World\" (Sussex Academic Press, 1998) with Joseph Ginat, \"Nomads in the Sedentary World\" (Curzon Press, 2001) with André Wink, \"Perpetrators, Accomplices, and Victims in Twentieth Century Politics: Reckoning with the Past\" (Routledge, 2009) with Stanley Payne, and \"Who Owns the Stock?

Meares coined his term from the English atavism, which is derived from the Latin \"atavus\", meaning a great-grandfather's grandfather and, thus, more generally, an ancestor.\n\nAs used by Meares, for example, his 1960 work \"A System of Medical Hypnosis\", the term \"atavistic regression\" is used to denote the tendency to revert to ancestral type:\n\nMeares held the view that when in hypnosis, the higher (more evolved) functions of the subject's brain were switched off, and the subject reverted to a far more archaic and far less advanced (in evolutionary terms) mental state; something which significantly altered the subjects' cognitive processing so that they readily accepted internally consistent, literal logic without any of the normal filters and verifications against the objective facts of the real world.\n\nLater, Meares came to believe that it was the atavistic regression rather than the treatments that went with hypnosis that helped the patient. He concluded that the regression enabled the mind to rest and restored its equilibrium in a way that was analogous to sleep. On one hand people who did not spontaneously undergo this process became tense and unable to let their guard down. On the other hand, helping people to learn how to experience this state a couple of times a day seemed to facilitate mental coping which Meares believed was due to sufficient mental rest.\n\nBy this time he had completed a transition from hypnosis in which he took a large role to the smaller role of facilitator showing patients how to induce this state themeselves. He referred to this regressed state by different names at different times e.g.: relaxing meditative experience, relaxing mental exercise, deep relaxation, atavistic regression, mental ataraxis. Contemporary teachers of his method may refer to this as Stillness Meditation, Stillness Meditation Therapy although some use other terms. Some other traditions use the term stillness meditation and these unrelated systems have little in common with Meares' method.\n\n"}
{"id": "17436096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17436096", "title": "Bible concordance", "text": "Bible concordance\n\nA Bible concordance is a concordance, or verbal index, to the Bible. A simple form lists Biblical words alphabetically, with indications to enable the inquirer to find the passages of the Bible where the words occur.\n\nConcordances may be for the original languages of the Biblical books, or (more commonly) they are compiled for translations.\n\nFriars of the Dominican order invented the verbal concordance of the Bible. As the basis of their work they used the text of the \"Latin Vulgate\", the standard Bible of the Middle Ages in Western Europe. The first concordance, completed in 1230, was undertaken under the guidance of Cardinal Hugo de Saint-Cher (Hugo de Sancto Charo), assisted by fellow Dominicans.\n\nIt contained short quotations (see the Ms. Saint-Omer, Bibliothèque municipale, 0028 ) of the passages where a word was found. These were indicated by book and chapter (the division into chapters had recently been made by Stephen Langton) but not by verses, which Robert Estienne would first introduce in 1545. In lieu of verses, Hugo divided each chapter into seven almost equal parts, indicated by the letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, etc.\n\nThree English Dominicans (1250–1252) added the complete quotations of the passages indicated. Due to lack of space, present-day concordances do not aim for this completeness of quotation; it is likely, therefore, that the passages indicated were far fewer than those found in a complete concordance of today. The work was somewhat abridged, by retaining only the essential words of a quotation, in the 1310 concordance of Conrad of Halberstadt, another Dominican - his work obtained great success on account of its more convenient form.\n\nThe first concordance to be printed appeared in 1470 at Strasburg, and reached a second edition in 1475. The larger work from which it was abridged was printed at Nuremberg in 1485. Another Dominican, John Stoicowic, or John of Ragusa, finding it necessary in his controversies to show the Biblical usage of \"nisi\", \"ex\", and \"per\", which were omitted from the previous concordances, began (c. 1435) the compilation of nearly all the indeclinable words of Latin Scripture; the task was completed and perfected by others and finally added as an appendix to the concordance of Conrad of Halberstadt in the work of Sebastian Brant published at Basle in 1496. Brant's work was frequently republished and in various cities. It served as the basis of the concordance published in 1555 by Robert Estienne. Estienne added proper names, supplied omissions, mingled the indeclinable words with the others in alphabetical order, and gave the indications to all passages by verse as well as by chapter, bringing his work much closer to the present model of concordances. Since then many different Latin concordances have been published:\n\n\nPeter Mintert's \"Lexicon Græco-Latinum\" of the New Testament is a concordance as well as a lexicon, giving the Latin equivalent of the Greek and, in the case of \"Septuagint\" words, the Hebrew equivalent also (Frankfort, 1728).\n\nThe first Hebrew concordance (\"Meïr Netib\") was the work of Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus, begun in 1438 and finished in 1448. It was inspired by the Latin concordances to aid in defence of Judaism, and was printed in Venice in 1523. An improved edition of it by a Franciscan monk, Marius de Calasio, was published in 1621 and 1622 in four volumes. Both these works were several times reprinted, while another Hebrew concordance of the sixteenth century, by Elias Levita, said to surpass Nathan's in many respects, remained in manuscript.\n\nNathan and Calasio arranged the words according to the Hebrew roots, the derivatives following simply according to the order in which they occur in the Hebrew books; the Buxtorfs, father and son, introduced order into the derivatives by a grammatical classification of the verbs and nouns. Their work (Basle, 1632) also contained many new words and passages previously omitted, and an appendix of all the Chaldaic words in the O. T.; Baer's edition of Buxtorf (1847) added certain particles.\n\nFürst's concordance (Leipzig, 1840) was for a long time the standard. It corrected Buxtorf and brought it nearer to completeness, printed all Hebrew words with the vowel-points, and perfected the order of the derivatives. Every word is explained in Hebrew and Latin. Fürst excludes, however, the proper nouns, the pronouns, and most of the indeclinable particles, and makes many involuntary omissions and errors; his classification of roots is sometimes fanciful. \"The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldaic Concordance\" (London, 1843; third edition, 1866) is still considered very useful.\n\nA comprehensive Hebrew concordance is that of Mandelkern (Leipzig, 1896), who rectified the errors of his predecessors and supplied omitted references. Though his own work has been shown to be frequently imperfect, still it is almost complete. An abridged edition of it was published in 1900.\n\nA New Concordance of the Bible (full title A New Concordance of the Bible: Thesaurus of the Language of the Bible, Hebrew and Aramaic, Roots, Words, Proper Names Phrases and Synonyms) by Avraham Even-Shoshan is a concordance of the Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, first published in 1977. The source text used is that of the Koren edition of 1958.\n\nThe first was that of Conrad Kircher (Frankfort, 1607); Tromm's, published at Amsterdam, 1718, had reference not only to the \"Septuagint\", but also to the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. It remained the standard until it gave way to Edwin Hatch and Henry Adeney Redpath's \"Concordance to the Septuagint and other Greek Versions of the Old Testament\" (Oxford, 1892–97). This includes a concordance to the deutero-canonical books and the Old Testament Apocrypha, and to the remains of the versions which form part of Origen of Alexandria's \"Hexapla\". The Hebrew equivalents of the Greek, when known, are also given. References to proper names are added in a supplement published in 1900. Bagster's \"Handy Concordance to the Septuagint\" (London, 1887) gives simply the references, without quotations.\n\nThe earliest concordances to the \"Greek New Testament\" are those of Birken or Betulius (Basle, 1546), Henry Estienne (Paris, 1594), and Erasmus Schmid (Wittenberg, 1638), whose work was twice revised and republished. During the latter half of the nineteenth century the standard New Testament concordance was that of Bruder (Leipzig, 1842; 4th ed., 1888). Its main defect is that it was practically based on the \"textus receptus\", though it aims, in its latest editions to give also the chief variants.\n\nMoulton and Geden's \"Concordance to the Greek Testament\", according to the text of Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, and the English Revisers (Edinburgh and New York, 1897) includes all the marginal readings. In the case of a reading being in dispute among these authorities, the fact is pointed out. The Hebrew equivalents of all quotations in the N. T. are given; the relation of the Greek N. T. words to the Septuagint and other O. T. Greek versions, as well as to classical usage, is indicated. Two other concordances are \"The Englishman's Greek Concordance to the New Testament\" by G. V. Wigram (London, 1839, 2d ed. 1844), and Hudson's \"Critical Greek and English Concordance of the N. T.\" (Boston, 1875), which contains references to the chief variant readings.\n\nCharles Schaaf's \"Lexicon Syriacum\" (Leyden, 1709) practically serves the purpose of a concordance to the \"Peshito\" version.\n\nThe earliest concordances in English were published in the middle of the sixteenth century, the first by Thomas Gybson in 1535 (for the New Testament only), and the second in 1550 by John Marbeck. The most famous one, \"Cruden's Concordance\" was the work of Alexander Cruden. First published in 1738, it reached several editions in his own lifetime and has been re-edited, abridged and reprinted repeatedly. Cruden's work is not a complete concordance, and omits especially many references to proper names, but his last edition had a concordance to the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament, which, however, is usually not reprinted.\n\nIt was surpassed by three major concordances of the King James Version of the Bible, those of Robert Young, James Strong, and Walker.\n\n\nThese were followed by a concordance based on the Douay–Rheims translation of the Bible preferred by Roman Catholics, \"A Textual Concordance of the Holy Scriptures\" by Father Thomas David Williams, 1942.\n\nSince software has made the Bible available in electronic form and with thorough electronic indexes, hard-copy printed concordances have less application. Most scholars and Bible students rely instead on software.\n\nDue to Strong's numbers (see \"Strong's Concordance\") it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible (\"Новая учебная Библия Томпсона\", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society \"The Bible for everyone\", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from Thompson Chain-Reference Bible (\"The New Thompson Study Bible.\" La Buona Novella Inc. & B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then it's Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37847646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37847646", "title": "Crime opportunity theory", "text": "Crime opportunity theory\n\nCrime Opportunity theory suggests that offenders make rational choices and thus choose targets that offer a high reward with little effort and risk. The occurrence of a crime depends on two things: the presence of at least one motivated offender who is ready or willing to engage in a crime, and the conditions of the environment in which that offender is situated, to wit, opportunities for crime. All crimes require opportunity but not every opportunity is followed by crime. Similarly, a motivated offender is necessary for the commission of a crime but not sufficient. A large part of this theory focuses on how variations in lifestyle or routine activities affect the opportunities for crime.\n\nOpportunity thus becomes the limiting factor that determines the outcome in environments prone to crime because the offender generally has little or no control over the conditions of the environment and the conditions that permit particular crimes are often rare, unlikely or preventable.\n\nDaily activities create the convergence in time and space of the three elements necessary for a crime to occur: motivated offenders, suitable targets, and the absence of capable guardians. The theory argues that available opportunities are an important component in the crime calculus. Choices in lifestyle on the part of potential victims may create or curtail crime opportunities for the motivated offender \n\nThe rational choice perspective tries to understand crime from the perspective of the offender. It is directly concerned with the thinking processes of offenders, how they evaluate criminal opportunities, why they decide to do one thing rather than another, and why they choose to obtain their ends by criminal and not legal means. This perspective has helped to explain why displacement does not always occur and has helped develop different ways to reduce opportunities for crime.\n\nAccording to criminologist C. Ray Jeffery, crime results partly from the opportunities presented by a physical environment, therefore, it is possible to alter the physical environment so that crime is less likely to occur. He argues that sociologists overstated the social causes of crime and neglected both biological and environmental determinants.\n\nSituational Crime Prevention introduces discrete managerial and environmental changes to reduce the opportunity for crimes to occur. It is focused on the settings for crime and seeks to predict the occurrence of crime. It suggests that much offending can appropriately be viewed not simply as the product of deep social, economic, and psycho-logical causes but also as the result of deliberate choices by individuals. Therefore, by making criminal action less attractive to offenders, criminal behavior can be curved.\n\nSince its conception, the opportunity theory has received much analysis, criticism, and reform. Through research and experimentation, the theory has evolved from the contributions and improvements made by different scholars each emphasizing his/her own ideas. Some of these are:\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted inside and outside of the United States illustrating opportunity as a significant factor in the commission of crime. One such study is entitled \"The Role of Opportunity in Crime Prevention and Possible Threats of Crime Control Benefits\".\n\nIn Germany during the 1980s, a study of motorcycle theft identified opportunity as a crucial element. The thefts of motorbikes had drastically declined from about 150,000 in 1980 to about 50,000 in 1986. This tremendous decline was the result of a new law passed in 1980 making it illegal to ride a motorbike in Germany without a helmet. The law's strict enforcement led to the huge decline in motorcycle thefts.\n\nThere is some limited evidence of displacement because between 1980 and 1983 thefts of cars went up from about 64,000 to 70,000 and the theft of bicycles also saw a noticeable increase. Altogether, it was clear that, at best, only a small proportion of the 100,000 motorbike thefts saved by the helmet laws were displaced to thefts of other vehicles.\n\nIn the United States, a study was completed to investigate the dramatic increase in residential burglary during the 1960s and 1970s. A careful analysis by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson (1979) showed that this increase was due to a combination of \"temptation\" and \"opportunity\". Temptation is increased by the rise in the purchase of light-weight electronic goods such as TVs and VCRs in people’s homes that could readily be sold. On the other hand, opportunity is increased as a result of more women going out of their homes to work.\n\nThe criminologist Van Dijk noticed a typical pattern in the theft of bicycles that also emphasizes the role of opportunity. He observed that the victim of a bike theft would steal a bike from someone else to replace it. That victim would in turn steal a bike from another owner, and so on. Thus, a single bicycle theft would have a multiplier effect, leading to several bicycle thefts. The chain could apply to the theft of any item with these four attributes: widely owned, necessary for daily use, easily taken, and sufficiently expensive.\n\nAlthough the crime opportunity theory is a useful tool for evaluating criminal environments, there are numerous criticisms:\n\nThe opportunity theory has direct application to crime prevention. Concepts like problem-oriented policing, defensible space architecture, crime prevention through environmental design, and situational crime prevention seek to reduce opportunities for crime for particular kinds of targets, places, and classes of victims. Each is concerned with preventing very specific kinds of crime and none of the four attempts to improve human character. Most important, all four seek to block crime in practical, natural, and simple ways, at low social and economic costs.\n\n\n\n"}

The six rhythmic modes set out by the treatise are all in triple time and are made from combinations of the note values \"longa\" (long) and \"brevis\" (short) and are given the names \"trochee, iamb, dactyl, anapest, spondaic\" and \"tribrach\", although \"trochee, dactyl\" and \"spondaic\" were much more common. It is evident how influential Garlandia's treatise has been by the number of theorists that have used its ideas. Much of the surviving music of the Notre Dame School from the 13th century is based on the rhythmic modes set out in \"De Mensurabili Musica\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1020046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1020046", "title": "Detachment (philosophy)", "text": "Detachment (philosophy)\n\nDetachment, also expressed as non-attachment, is a state in which a person overcomes his or her attachment to desire for things, people or concepts of the world and thus attains a heightened perspective. It is considered a wise virtue and is promoted in various Eastern religions, such as Taoism and Buddhism.\n\nDetachment as release from desire and consequently from suffering is an important principle, or even ideal, in the Bahá'í Faith, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Stoicism, and Taoism.\n\nIn Buddhist and Hindu religious texts the opposite concept is expressed as \"upādāna\", translated as \"attachment\". Attachment, that is the inability to practice or embrace detachment, is viewed as the main obstacle towards a serene and fulfilled life. Many other spiritual traditions identify the lack of detachment with the continuous worries and restlessness produced by desire and personal ambitions.\n\n\"Thou hast inquired about detachment. It is well known to thee that by detachment is intended the detachment of the soul from all else but God. That is, it consisteth in soaring up to an eternal station, wherein nothing that can be seen between heaven and earth deterreth the seeker from the Absolute Truth. In other words, he is not veiled from divine love or from busying himself with the mention of God by the love of any other thing or by his immersion therein.\"\n\nThe second definition is in the Words of Wisdom: \"The essence of detachment is for man to turn his face towards the courts of the Lord, to enter His Presence, behold His Countenance, and stand as witness before Him.\" (Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 155)\n\nRegarding the concept of detachment, or non-attachment, Buddhist texts in Pali mention \"nekkhamma\", a word generally translated as \"renunciation\". This word also conveys more specifically the meaning of \"giving up the world and leading a holy life\" or \"freedom from lust, craving and desires.\"\n\nThe writings of Milarepa, are canonical Mahayana Buddhist texts that emphasize the temporary nature of the physical body and the need for non-attachment.\n\nDetachment is a central concept in Zen Buddhist philosophy. One of the most important technical Chinese terms for detachment is \"wú niàn\" (無念), which literally means \"no thought.\" This does not signify the literal absence of thought, but rather the state of being \"unstained\" (\"bù rán\" 不染) by thought. Therefore, \"detachment\" is being detached from one's thoughts. It is to separate oneself from one's own thoughts and opinions in detail as to not be harmed mentally and emotionally by them.\n\nEastern Christian monasticism cultivated practices of detached watchfulness which were designed to calm the passions and lead to an ongoing state of calm detachment known as apatheia.\n\nIn Western Christianity, Ignatian spirituality encourages detachment, sometimes referred to as \"indifference\", in order to maximize a person's \"availability\" to God and to their neighbors.\n\nThe Hindu view of detachment comes from the understanding of the nature of existence and the true ultimate state sought is that of being in the moment. In other words, while one is responsible and active, one does not worry about the past or future. The detachment is towards the result of one's actions rather than towards everything in life. This concept is cited extensively within Puranic and Vedic literature, for example:\nVairagya is a Hindu term which is often translated as detachment.\n\nDetachment is one of the supreme ideals of Jainism, together with non-violence. Non-possession/Non-attachment is one of the Mahavratas, the five great vows Jain monks observe.\n\nThe Tao Te Ching expressed the concept (in chapter 44) as:\n\nFame or Self: Which matters more?\nSelf or Wealth: Which is more precious?\nGain or Loss: Which is more painful?\nHe who is attached to things will suffer much.\nHe who saves will suffer heavy loss.\nA contented man is rarely disappointed.\nHe who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble.\nHe will stay forever safe.\n"}

{"id": "568962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568962", "title": "Forward chaining", "text": "Forward chaining\n\nForward chaining (or forward reasoning) is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an inference engine and can be described logically as repeated application of \"modus ponens\". Forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for expert systems, business and production rule systems. The opposite of forward chaining is backward chaining.\n\nForward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user, for example) until a goal is reached. An inference engine using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the antecedent (If clause) is known to be true. When such a rule is found, the engine can conclude, or infer, the consequent (Then clause), resulting in the addition of new information to its data. \nInference engines will iterate through this process until a goal is reached.\n\nSuppose that the goal is to conclude the color of a pet named Fritz, given that he croaks and eats flies, and that the rule base contains the following four rules:\n\n\nLet us illustrate forward chaining by following the pattern of a computer as it evaluates the rules.\nAssume the following facts:\n\nWith forward reasoning, the inference engine can derive that Fritz is green in a series of steps:\n\n1. Since the base facts indicate that \"Fritz croaks\" and \"Fritz eats flies\", the antecedent of rule #1 is satisfied by substituting Fritz for X, and the inference engine concludes:\n\n2. The antecedent of rule #3 is then satisfied by substituting Fritz for X, and the inference engine concludes:\n\nThe name \"forward chaining\" comes from the fact that the inference engine starts with the data and reasons its way to the answer,\nas opposed to backward chaining, which works the other way around.\nIn the derivation, the rules are used in the opposite order as compared to backward chaining.\nIn this example, rules #2 and #4 were not used in determining that Fritz is green.\n\nBecause the data determines which rules are selected and used, this method is called data-driven, in contrast to goal-driven backward chaining inference. The forward chaining approach is often employed by expert systems, such as CLIPS.\n\nOne of the advantages of forward-chaining over backward-chaining is that the reception of new data can trigger new inferences, which makes the engine better suited to dynamic situations in which conditions are likely to change.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33543260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33543260", "title": "Historical criticism", "text": "Historical criticism\n\nHistorical criticism, also known as the historical-critical method or higher criticism, is a branch of criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand \"the world behind the text\". While often discussed in terms of Jewish and Christian writings from ancient times, historical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from various parts of the world and periods of history.\nThe primary goal of historical criticism is to discover the text's primitive or original meaning in its original historical context and its literal sense or \"sensus literalis historicus\". The secondary goal seeks to establish a reconstruction of the historical situation of the author and recipients of the text. That may be accomplished by reconstructing the true nature of the events that the text describes. An ancient text may also serve as a document, record or source for reconstructing the ancient past, which may also serve as a chief interest to the historical critic. In regard to Semitic biblical interpretation, the historical critic would be able to interpret the literature of Israel as well as the history of Israel.\nIn 18th century Biblical criticism, the term \"higher criticism\" was commonly used in mainstream scholarship in contrast with \"lower criticism\". In the 21st century, historical criticism is the more commonly used term for higher criticism, and textual criticism is more common than the loose expression \"lower criticism\".\n\nHistorical criticism began in the 17th century and gained popular recognition in the 19th and 20th centuries. The perspective of the early historical critic was rooted in Protestant Reformation ideology since its approach to biblical studies was free from the influence of traditional interpretation. Where historical investigation was unavailable, historical criticism rested on philosophical and theological interpretation. With each passing century, historical criticism became refined into various methodologies used today: source criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, tradition criticism, canonical criticism, and related methodologies.\n\nHistorical-critical methods are the specific procedures used to examine the text's historical origins, such as/the time, the place in which the text was written; its sources; and the events, dates, persons, places, things, and customs that are mentioned or implied in the text.\n\nApplication of the historical critical method, in biblical studies, investigates the books of the Hebrew Bible as well as the New Testament. Historical critics compare texts to other texts written around the same time. An example is that modern biblical scholarship has attempted to understand the Book of Revelation in its 1st century historical context by identifying its literary genre with Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature.\n\nIn regard to the Gospels, higher criticism deals with the synoptic problem, the relations among Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In some cases, such as with several Pauline epistles, higher criticism can confirm the traditional understanding of authorship. Higher criticism understands the New Testament texts within a historical context: that is, that they are not adamantine but writings that express the \"traditio\" (what is handed down). The truth lies in the historical context.\n\nIn classical studies, the 19th century approach to higher criticism set aside \"efforts to fill ancient religion with direct meaning and relevance and devoted itself instead to the critical collection and chronological ordering of the source material.\" Thus, higher criticism, whether biblical, classical, Byzantine or medieval, focuses on the source documents to determine who wrote it and where and when it was written.\n\nHistorical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Islam.\n\nHistorical criticism comprises several disciplines, including source criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, tradition criticism, and radical criticism.\n\nSource criticism is the search for the original sources which lie behind a given biblical text. It can be traced back to the 17th century French priest Richard Simon, and its most influential product is undoubtably Julius Wellhausen's \"Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels\" (1878), whose \"insight and clarity of expression have left their mark indelibly on modern biblical studies.\"\nForm criticism breaks the Bible down into sections (\"pericopes\", stories), which are analyzed and categorized by genres (prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament etc.). The form critic then theorizes on the pericope's \"Sitz im Leben\" (\"setting in life\"), the setting in which it was composed and, especially, used. Tradition history is a specific aspect of form criticism, which aims at tracing the way in which the pericopes entered the larger units of the biblical canon, especially the way in which they made the transition from oral to written form. The belief in the priority, stability and even detectability, of oral traditions is now recognised to be so deeply questionable as to render tradition history largely useless, but form criticism itself continues to develop as a viable methodology in biblical studies.\n\nRedaction criticism studies \"the collection, arrangement, editing and modification of sources\" and is frequently used to reconstruct the community and purposes of the authors of the text.\n\nPioneers of historical criticism as applied to the Bible include the Dutch scholars Desiderius Erasmus (1466? – 1536) and Benedict Spinoza (1632–1677).\nWhen it is applied to the Bible, the historical-critical method is distinct from the traditional, devotional approach. In particular, while devotional readers concern themselves with the overall message of the Bible, historians examine the distinct messages of each book in the Bible. Guided by the devotional approach, for example, Christians often combine accounts from different gospels into single accounts, but historians attempt to discern what is unique about each gospel, including how they differ.\n\nThe phrase \"higher criticism\" became popular in Europe from the mid-18th century to the early 20th century to describe the work of such scholars as Jean Astruc (1684-1766), Johann Salomo Semler (1725–91), Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (1752–1827), Ferdinand Christian Baur (1792–1860), and Wellhausen (1844–1918). In academic circles, it now is the body of work properly considered \"higher criticism\", but the phrase is sometimes applied to earlier or later work using similar methods.\n\n\"Higher criticism\" originally referred to the work of German biblical scholars of the Tübingen School. After the groundbreaking work on the New Testament by Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), the next generation, which included scholars such as David Friedrich Strauss (1808–74) and Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–72), analyzed in the mid-19th century the historical records of the Middle East from biblical times, in search of independent confirmation of events in the Bible. The latter scholars built on the tradition of Enlightenment and Rationalist thinkers such as John Locke (1632–1704), David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Gotthold Lessing, Gottlieb Fichte, G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831) and the French rationalists.\n\nSuch ideas influenced thought in England through the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and, in particular, through George Eliot's translations of Strauss's \"The Life of Jesus\" (1846) and Feuerbach's \"The Essence of Christianity\" (1854). In 1860, seven liberal Anglican theologians began the process of incorporating this historical criticism into Christian doctrine in \"Essays and Reviews\", causing a five-year storm of controversy, which completely overshadowed the arguments over Charles Darwin's newly-published \"On the Origin of Species\". Two of the authors were indicted for heresy and lost their jobs by 1862, but in 1864, they had the judgement overturned on appeal. \"La Vie de Jésus\" (1863), the seminal work by a Frenchman, Ernest Renan (1823–1892), continued in the same tradition as Strauss and Feuerbach. In Catholicism, \"L'Evangile et l'Eglise\" (1902), the magnum opus by Alfred Loisy against the \"Essence of Christianity\" of Adolf von Harnack (1851–1930) and \"La Vie de Jesus\" of Renan, gave birth to the modernist crisis (1902–61). Some scholars, such as Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976) have used higher criticism of the Bible to \"demythologize\" it.\n\nJohn Barton argues that the term \"historical-critical method\" conflates two nonidentical distinctions, and prefers the term \"Biblical criticism\":\n\nNot a few observers, especially among religious circles, have criticized the historical-critical method as biased by \"a priori\" reasons:\n\nFrom these two principles the Modernists deduce two laws, which, when united with a third which they have already got from agnosticism, constitute the foundation of historical criticism. We will take an illustration from the Person of Christ. In the person of Christ, they say, science and history encounter nothing that is not human. Therefore, in virtue of the first canon deduced from agnosticism, whatever there is in His history suggestive of the divine, must be rejected. Then, according to the second canon, the historical Person of Christ was transfigured by faith; therefore everything that raises it above historical conditions must be removed. Lately, the third canon, which lays down that the person of Christ has been disfigured by faith, requires that everything should be excluded, deeds and words and all else that is not in keeping with His character, circumstances and education, and with the place and time in which He lived. A strange style of reasoning, truly; but it is Modernist criticism.\nNow we ask here: Who is the author of this history? The historian? The critic? Assuredly, neither of these but the philosopher. From beginning to end everything in it is a priori.\n\n"}
{"id": "41807996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41807996", "title": "Idam", "text": "Idam\n\nIdam(Tamil) (Sanskrit: इदम् or अयम् or इयम्) is a Tamil/Sanskrit word which denotes location or position or place. In grammar it is used at the beginning or middle of a sentence as a nominative or attributive pronoun, combined with or without \"ya\", adds emphasis to other nouns, propositions etc.; and means - this, here or yonder, present or seen nearby, fit for, or without reference to noun refers to एतद् ('that') or to what precedes.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita (Sloka XVI.13), in the phrase – इदम् अस्तीदम् अपि मे the word, \"idam\", has been used to mean 'this', \"this it is, this also mine\", and in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (Stanza I.i.10) in the phrase – पर्याप्तं त्विदम् एतेषां, meaning \"sufficient though that of these\", \"idam\" used as एतद् refers to 'that', whereas (in Stanza. II.5.9) in the phrase – अयम् स्तनयित्नुः, meaning \"Thunder is Vayu\", \"ayam\" refers to 'is'. In the phrase – ब्रह्म इदम् सर्वं, which means - \"Brahman possessing all the qualities is all-pervading\", the word \"idam\" is used in the sense of 'it is', the Atman is identified with \"idam sarvam\" and the same phrase also expresses the whole world because the world springs from the Atman as is indicated in Stanza V.iii.1. In the Vedas, \"idam\" as \"ayam\" has been used as a subject in nominal sentences as an equivalent of a proposition.\n\nIn Pada 32 of Book II Ch.IV of his Ashtadhyayi Pāṇini, who states that words apply per object, explains that: \nइदमोऽन्वादेशेऽशनुदात्त तृत्यादौ ||\nin the room of \"idam\" 'this', in case of its re-employment in a subsequent member of the same sentence and referring to the same thing (\"anvadesha\" i.e. \"adesha\" after re-employment) there is the substitution of as’ which is a \"anudatta\" i.e. gravely accented, when the third case-affix and the rest follow. That means – अ replaces इदम् in all cases except the nominative and the accusative. In this context Katayayana stipulates that one should specify a pronominal used in subsequently referring to something should be co-referential with a previously used term because replacement by an anaphoric pronoun should not possibly be allowed where there is not co-reference. And, with regard to \"taddhita\" affixation abstract patterns like \"tasya idam\" ('prescribing a genitive relationship'), \"tad asmin\" ('prescribing a locative relationship') and \"tat karoti\" ('prescribing an action meaning involving an accusative relationship') have been identified. The genitive form of \"idams\" is explained as a \"sthaneyoga sasthi\" (Pada I.i.49) and the locative form is explained as \"parasaptami\" when a case ending beginning with the instrumental case endings follows. A substitute which has s’ as an it-letter replaces the whole of the original form which step requires an \"anubandha\".\n\nKaiyata tells us that words with \"Krta\" and \"Tadditha\" affixes denoting \"bhava\" ('being') extended for \"bhava\" to mean \"dravya\" ('object') would result in \"dravya\", a pronoun, referring to anything not specified i.e. to an individual object or locus. According to Patanjali the verb as’ means - \"bhava\" or \"kriya\". The term, \"Kriyadharma\" ('the properties of an action'), is also used in contrast with the terms \"dravyadharma\" and \"sattvadharma\"; and Helaraja states that which has the latter two is something that can be referred to by demonstratives such as \"idam\" ('this') and \"tad\" ('that').\n\nIn Pali language, \"Ida\" and \"Idam\" are accusative singular neuters as is the original \"etad\" or \"eghad\". In Tamil literature \"idam\" refers to land, landscape or place, which word is one of the six forming the three sets of oppositions; \"idam\" pairs in opposition with \"kalam\" ('time') i.e. \"idavakupeyar\" that gives name to a place or to something in or from that place, and \"kalavakupeyar\" which applies the name of a time or season to something that occurs in time and season.\n\nMinard (according to whose criteria repetition would imply an adverb and a declined form indicates a pronoun) considers \"idam\" in the phrase \"idam sarvam\" as an adverb but \"idam\" of the Shatapatha Brahmana ( Stanza 7.4.1.25) firstly implies the article and thereafter 'the All', the Absolute totality which removes the anti-thesis of \"ayam\" ('this') and \"asau\" ('yonder world').\n\nMadhvacharya consistent with Samkhya philosophy and Sayana with Advaita Vedanta, take \"idam\" occurring in the first line – न वि जानामि यदिवेदमस्मि निण्यः संनध्दो मनसा चरामि in Mantra I.164.37 of the Rig Veda to mean 'the Universe' instead of its adverbial meaning \"here\", where the word \"samnaddho\" means ignorance rather than scepticism.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita’s and the post-Vedic use of \"idam\" and \"tad\" refers to the Absolute or Brahman or \"the All\" i.e. to that which the Vedic sages sought to clarify. The \"idam\" occurring in the beginning of Rig Veda mantra X.135.7 refers to the seat of Yama where is heard the sound of Yama’s flute which no mortal can resist. \"Idam\" is the nominative singular neuter demonstrative pronouns, Being and Non-being the singular subject which is one without a second, in which condition it applies to anything falling within the range of human experience.\n\nAccording to Sankara, \"aham\" (I-sense secured in introspection, \"visayi\") and \"idam\" (thou-sense sense secured in extrospection, \"visaya\") are polarly related, they are as opposed as light and darkness. \"Idam Brahman\" refers to \"etadakshara\" - Brahman as the objective unity and the \"tadakshara\" – Brahman refers to the subject, the Atman i.e. Brahman as Itself, which cannot be an object matter of \"pramana-jnana\" since the Atman is non-dual and does not have the knowing and the known in it. Reality is to be cognized objectively as an \"idam\" as the goal by looking inwards otherwise the \"vidhi-vakyas\" would serve no purpose. Beyond \"I\" is not any person knower or doer but the transcendental ground of \"I\", the unspeakable; the indeterminate cannot be spoken about directly. Sankara condemns avidya or Adhyasa, the wrong apprehension of a content where it is not nor can ever be, which the true knowledge of \"idam\" or Brahman alone can eradicate. The \"idam\" aspect of \"ahamkara\" reflected by the light of the pure self becomes the object of the \"I-sense\". Brahman cannot be known in the objective attitude as an object somewhere in the beyond as an \"idam\". Advaita Vedanta holds Brahman as the Atman and Brahman as \"idam sarvam\" (\"all this\").\n\nThe Yoga school of Hindu philosophy considers the Individual Self inseparable from and identical with the Universal Self. Shiva represents the supreme consciousness Brahman; the subject (consciousness) which is the positive \"Shiva-tattva\" is called \"aham\" and the object ('power of consciousness') which is the negative \"Shakti-tattva\" is called \"idam\"('this'), the former which pervades the thirty-five \"tattvas\" being passive is dependent on Shakti (\"idam\") for creation to occur. The three principal modes of Shakti are \"iccha-shakti\" ('will power'), \"jnana-shakti\" ('power of knowledge') and \"kriya-shakti\" ('power of action'). \"Sadashiva-tattva\", which is the first thing with a cause, identified with \"iccha-shakti\" consists of both \"aham\", and \"idam\", \"Ishvara-tattva\" identified with \"jnana-shakti\" accounts for \"aham\" recognizing \"idam\", and \"Sadvidya-tattva\" identified with \"kriya-shakti\" is the complete \"subject-object unity\". In \"Cit-shakti\", \"Ananda-shakti\", \"Iccha-shakti\", \"Jnana-shakti\" and \"Kriya-shakti\" the \"svatantraya\" of Shiva is reflected. \"Shakti-tattva\" too is a reflection of \"Shiva-shakti\". The four \"tattvas\" are not created by the energies of Shiva but are an expression or \"ushma\" (\"heat\") of His true nature. \"Suddhavidya\" is the real state of Shiva or the state of \"aham aham-idam ida\", Ishvara which is the state of \"idam-aham\", \"Sadashiva\" is the state of \"aham-idam\" and \"Shakti\" is the state of \"aham\". In the first section of \"aham aham-idam idam\", \"aham aham\" signifies the stable state associated with one’s cognition of the real nature of Self, the truth of this universe, and the second section \"idam idam\" signifies the unstable state when one experiences the universe is false and unreal. The fourth energy called the \"pralayakala pramatri shakti\" makes one reside in the state of \"Suddhavidya\".\n\nShaivism defines \"sristi\" (\"Creation\") as the act of the Supreme Lord making \"idam\" ('object') appear through self-manifestation in the back-ground of \"akasha\" (void or space) created by self-limitation or self-negation. Here \"Idam\" signifies the Anatman which \"Idamta\" though not different from \"Ahamta\" is not eternal; the self-experience of \"Ahamta\" prevails over the self-experience of indistinct \"Idamta\" which disappears on attaining the \"stithi\" state – \"aham eva idam\" (\"I am all this\"). \"Idamta\", a self-extension, aids in the realization of \"Paramshiva\".\n"}

He was born and died in Berlin.\n\nFormey was born in Berlin, Brandenburg, as the son of immigrant Huguenots. His mother died when he was three years old, and Samuel was brought up by two of his aunts. He was educated for the ministry, and at the age of twenty became pastor of the French Protestant church at Brandenburg. Having in 1736 accepted the invitation of a congregation in Berlin, he was in the following year chosen professor of rhetoric in the Collège Français there, and in 1739 professor of philosophy. His pupils included Louis de Beausobre, who was to become a philosopher and political economist of some standing in his own right.\n\nOn the reorganisation of the Academy of Berlin in 1744, during Frederick the Great's reign, Formey was named a member, and in 1748 its perpetual secretary.\nThe language between the scientists of the Academy, Latin, was changed into French. In 1750 he was appointed as a member of the Royal Society.\n\nBetween 1741 and 1753, successive publishers in The Hague brought out the six volumes of Formey's \"La bell Wolfienne\", which was his effort to explain the philosophy of Christian Wolff to women. This series began as a popularisation of Wolff's philosophy in the form of a philosophical romance, but by the end of the 4th volume, Formey abandoned fiction for a paraphrase and abridgement of Wolff's metaphysical works. These books made Wolff more known in France.\n\nFormey wrote during his life more than 17.000 letters, and corresponded several years with Francesco Algarotti, who in 1737 had published a book on Newtonianism for ladies. \n\"L'Anti-Sans-Souci, où la folie des Nouveaux philosophes\" (1760), which denied Frederick's authorship of the \"Oeuvres\" and stressed the king's piety is attributed to Formey, who did write the preface.\n\nFormey's principal works are \"La belle Wolfienne\" (1741–1753); \"Le Philosophe chrétien\" (1740); \"L'Emile chrétien\" (1764), intended as an answer to the \"Emile\" of Rousseau; and \"Souvenirs d'un citoyen\" (Berlin, 1789). He also published an immense number of contemporary memoirs in the transactions of the Berlin Academy. His correspondence with Prosper Marchand was published in 2012.\n\nAn extensive and detailed list of Formey's works can be found in .\n\n"}

It is the first family with speech disorder to be investigated using genetic analyses, by which the speech impediment is discovered to be due to genetic mutation, and from which the gene \"FOXP2\", often dubbed the \"language gene\", was discovered. Their condition is also the first human speech and language disorder known to exhibit strict Mendelian inheritance.\n\nBrought to medical attention from their school children in the late 1980s, the case of KE family was taken up at the UCL Institute of Child Health in London in 1990. Initial report suggested that the family was affected by a genetic disorder. Canadian linguist Myrna Gopnik suggested that the disorder was characterized primarily by grammatical deficiency, supporting the controversial notion of a \"grammar gene\". Geneticists at the University of Oxford determined that the condition was indeed genetic, but with complex physical and physiological effects, and in 1998, they identified the actual gene, eventually named \"FOXP2\". This discovery directly led to a broader knowledge on human evolution as the gene is directly implicated with the origin of language.\n\nTwo family members, a boy and a girl, were featured in the National Geographic documentary film \"Human Ape\".\n\nKE family children attended Elizabeth Augur's special educational needs unit at Brentford primary school in west London. Towards the end of 1980s seven children of the family attended there. Augur began to learn that the family had a speech disorder for three generations. Of the 30 members, about half suffer from severe deficiency, some are affected mildly, and few are unaffected. Their faces show rigidity at the lower half, and most cannot complete pronouncing a word. Many of them have severe stuttering and with limited vocabulary. In particular, they have difficulty with consonants, and omit them, such as \"boon\" for \"spoon\", \"able\" for \"table\", and \"bu\" for \"blue\". Linguistic deficiency is also noted in written language both in reading and writing. They are characterized by lower nonverbal IQ.\n\nAugur convinced the family to undergo medical studies and approached geneticist Michael Baraitser, of the Institute of Child Health. With colleagues Marcus Prembey and Jane Hurst, they started taking blood samples for analyses in 1987. Their first report in 1990 shows that 16 family members were affected by severe abnormality, though their intelligence and hearing are normal, and that the condition was genetically inherited (autosomal dominant). Upon the news, BBC was preparing a documentary of the case in the scientific serial \"Antenna\". By this time, a Canadian linguist from McGill University, Myrna Gopnik, was visiting her son in Oxford, and delivered an invited lecture at the university, where she noticed the flyer for the BBC programme. She contacted the medical geneticists, interviewed KE family members, and returned to Montreal, Quebec. She was convinced that the genetic defect was largely centred on grammatical ability, and wrote letters to \"Nature\" in 1990. Her reports promulgated a notion of \"grammar gene\" and a controversial concept of grammar-specific disorder.\n\nNeuroscientist and language expert at the Institute of Child Health, Faraneh Vargha-Khadem, began to investigate teaming up with University of Oxford and University of Reading linguists. In 1995 they found, contrary to Gopnik's hypothesis, from comparison of 13 affected and 8 normal individuals that the genetic disorder was a complex impairment of not only linguistic ability, but also intellectual and anatomical features, thereby disproving the \"grammar gene\" notion. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they found that some brain regions were underactive (compared to baseline levels) in the KE family members and that some were overactive, when compared to normal people. The underactive regions included motor neurons that control face and mouth regions. The areas that were overactive includes Broca's area, the speech centre. With Oxford geneticists Simon Fisher and Anthony Monaco, they identified the exact location of the gene on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31) in 1998. The chromosomal region (locus) was named \"SPCH1\" (for speech-and-language-disorder-1), and it contains 70 genes. Using the known gene location of speech disorder from a boy, designated CS, of unrelated family, they discovered in 2001 that the main gene responsible for speech impediment in both KE family and CS was \"FOXP2\", and that this gene plays a major role in the origin and development of language. Mutations in the genes result in speech and language problems.\n\n"}

However, in September 2003, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, criticised the society, saying:\n\nAs a result, in February 2004 the Lord Chancellor exercised his powers under the Access to Justice Act 1999 to appoint a Legal Services Complaints Commissioner to regulate the society. In response to the commissioner's criticisms, in 2005, the Law Society divided its functions among the society, the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Legal Complaints Service but by May 2006, the society's efforts to remedy its own deficiencies were still giving concern to the commissioner. As a result, a penalty of £220,000 was levied. The commissioner subsequently recognised that progress was being made and on 22 February 2007, the service came into being. In April 2007, the commissioner advised the society that their Complaints Handling Plan adequately addressed the concerns. However, in April 2008, the commissioner reported that \"Results show that despite some improvements in all target areas set, there are still failures ... to consistently apply their policies, processes and customer standards.\" On 3 June 2008, the commissioner fined the Law Society £275,000 over the inadequacy of its complaints handling plan for the forthcoming year.\n\nThe Service was a complaints-handling body, quasi-independent of the Society. It was part of the Law Society, but operated independently. The services offered to consumers were confidential and free at the point of use, the profession having rejected the idea of charging a flat fee as do some other professional complaints services, for example that of architects. Where a complaint was upheld the firm complained of may have been required to make a contribution to the costs incurred by the Service in dealing with the complaint. Each case was said to have been looked at impartially, the Service working to find a solution acceptable to everyone concerned, including the lawyer.\n\nThe Service's Chief Executive, Deborah Evans, said:\n\nThe Service and Chief Executive are both steered by the Board for the Legal Complaints Service, chaired by Shamit Saggar.\n\nChief Executive Evans was criticised as actively-seeking complaints about solicitors and as showing an excess of zeal in making work for her organisation in a bid to attract more funding.\n\nComplaints handling was further criticised in Sir David Clementi's 2004 report into regulation of legal services.\n\nWhen the Legal Services Act 2007 fully came into force, the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner was abolished and replaced with an Office for Legal Complaints which supervises the complaints-handling of solicitors, barristers and other legal professionals.\n\n\n"}

MacLaren was inspired by Henry George, Socrates, Dr Francis Roles, Pyotr Ouspensky, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and finally the philosophy of Advaita Vedānta through the Shankaracharyas of Jyoti Math.\n\nMacLaren was born in Glasgow on 24 September 1910. He was the son of Andrew MacLaren, a Labour Member of Parliament who was a staunch advocate of Henry George.\n\nSchooled at Rutlish School in Wimbledon, MacLaren later became attracted to the law and trained as a barrister.\n\nMacLaren's influences include his father Andrew MacLaren, Henry George, Georges Ivanovich Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, Francis Roles and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. According to the Henry George Foundation, MacLaren joined the Henry George movement in London in 1931, serving on the executive committee from 1933 until 1937. At the 1936 International Conference of Georgist Organisations held in London, a contingent from the US presented a question-based method of teaching Henry George's ideas. MacLaren created a similar method and taught the course in London. In 1937 MacLaren left the Henry George movement and founded the School of Economic Science (SES) with the support of his father. In 1938 he was called to the bar and practised in Chambers at 2 Paper Buildings in the Inner Temple. Some sources say MacLaren's father founded the school, while others state it was Leon. According to the SES web site, MacLaren introduced and developed philosophy courses to complement his economics courses. Over time the philosophy courses became SES's principal area of teaching. According to the group's literature, from the mid-1960s onwards, MacLaren presented, in addition to some of the ideas of P. D. Ouspensky, the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, a philosophical theology of absolute non-duality as taught by the eighth-century Indian philosopher-theologian Śaṅkara.\n\nMacLaren was the prospective parliamentary Labour candidate for Epping in 1939 where Winston Churchill was the sitting member but the election did not take place due to the outbreak of war. He later stood as the Liberal candidate for Yeovil at the 1950 election and then at Hendon South in 1951 without any success. According to the SES web site, MacLaren studied Advaita Vedanta philosophy in 1965 with Shantananda Saraswati the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math. MacLaren attended a lecture by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the Albert Hall in London in 1959 and became a student of the Maharishi.\n\nAccording to Practical Philosophy's (founded by MacLaren) web site MacLaren spent three months in the early 1970s traveling around the world visiting the SES affiliated schools. MacLaren's illness came during his final world tour. He was brought back to England from South Africa and died in a London hospital on 24 June 1994. According to his foundation web site, MacLaren wrote a book called \"The Nature of Society\". In 2009 MacLaren's former personal assistant, Dorine Tolley, published a biography of MacLaren's life called \"The Power Within: Leon MacLaren, A Memoir of His Life and Work\".\n\nAccording to MacLaren's foundation web site he married twice, had two daughters and lived in Hammersmith and later Hampstead and Oxfordshire.\n\n"}

{"id": "42635329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42635329", "title": "Mauna (silence)", "text": "Mauna (silence)\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, Mauna (Silence), which has a voice of its own, refers to peace of mind, inner quietude, Samadhi and the Absolute Reality. The Hindu texts insist upon proper understanding of silence by experiencing it through control of speech and practice.\n\nMauna (Sanskrit: मौनम्) or Maunitva (मौनित्व) means – silence, taciturnity, silence of the mind – as in मौनमुद्रा (the attitude of silence) and मौनव्रतम् (a vow of silence) or मौनिन् (observing vow of silence). A Sanskrit Dictionary gives many words such as – अनिर्वचनम् (silence, not uttering anything), अभाषणम् (silence, not speaking), अवचन (absence of assertion, silence, taciturnity), अव्याहृतम् (silence), निःशब्दम् (silence, a calm), - as referring to silence. Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary gives the meaning of the word, Silence, as absence of sound; abstention from sounding, speech, mention, or communication; a time of such absence or abstention, taciturnity. \n\nKumarila lists sound as one of the eleven substances and as one of the twenty-four qualities, he does not include silence in any one of these two lists nor does he describe silence as he does sound.\n\n\"Asat\", the word meaning non-existent or indescribable, appears seven times in the Rig Veda); it differs from the word, \"Mithya\", which means false or untrue, . \"Asat\" is the opposite of \"Rta\". It is the ground of transcendence, the origin of all organized perception, the original ground any and all sounds count in order to sound, and is also called the language of non-Existence. In the sense of \"non-Existence\" or \"inaction\", \"Asat\" is simply silence; in the sense of \"obscuring\" or \"covering\" or \"chaos, \" it is pure noise downwards moving from which tone is a distillation (Rig Veda VII.104.1,10,11). \"Rta\" is the end of an effective synthesis of sensorium, through a whole range of clear and distinct acts of particular senses and their subsequent insights. \"Asat\" stands as the initial space-ground of indeterminate perception or of sets of organized perceptions, the sounding silence from which the worlds, gods and man emerge. Ramana Maharshi in the 6th paragraph of \"Nān Yār\" reminds us that only after firmly establishing our mind in our heart will our primal thought \"I\" which is the root of all thoughts disappear for the ever-existing real self to shine; the place (innermost core of our being) devoid of even a little trace of our primal thought \"I\" is \"svarupa\" (our own essential self) which alone is called \"mauna\" (silence), it is the state of egolessness. \n\nKena Upanishad tells us - यद्वाचाऽनभ्युदितं येन वागभ्युद्यते – \"That which is not uttered by speech that by which speech is revealed\" (I.5), - यच्छ्रोत्रेण न शृणोति येन श्रोत्रमिदं श्रुतम् - \"That which man does not hear with the ear, that by which man knows the ear\", - तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते - \"know that to be Brahman and not this that people worship as an object\" (I.9). It is only when the knower is utterly negative and yet aware that the known conveys Its secret to him, that the process of knowing as emanating from the knower ceases, and that the interval between knowing and not knowing is not covered by any projection of the knower. The sensitive mind ready to receive the subtlest intimation of Brahman responds to the voice of silence. The mind liberated from even the attribute of \"sattva\" must stand in front of utter silence. Yajnavalkya insists that the spiritual man in order to experience Brahman must transcend both silence (\"mauna\") and non-silence (\"amauna\").\n\nHuman knowledge suffers from the limitation of incompleteness but the Vedantic view of knowledge is rooted in self-revelation or self-luminosity. The truth of knowledge consists in its non-contradictedness and novelty, and not in mere correspondence or coherence. Metaphysical knowledge essentially implies permanent and changeless certitude. Nididhyasana with the aid of \"sravana\" (with a basis of the Mahavakyas) must precede knowledge. Sruti is the starting point of enquiry. Sraddha (Provisional belief), induced by Sabda or Agama (authoritative statements) and supported by Anubhava (experiences or realizations), is required to start an enquiry. Knowledge is truth and truth is the foundation of the Upanishads. Truthfulness in speech leads to truthfulness in spirit because in truth is initiation based. Truth is based on the heart, and reason is the true abode of truth. Satya or truth is a quality of speech and Dharma is the actualization of truth.\nControl of speech is not forced silence. Meditation is the practice of silence. The state of Samadhi is the boundless ocean of silence. Absorptive concentration is Samadhi. Superconscious trance is nirbija (seedless) because it is objectless and devoid of ignorance which is the seed of bondage. The dispositions of super-conscious trances, brought about by supreme detachment due to faith (which is purity of mind), overpower and counteract the dispositions of conscious trances, when these are destroyed along with the mind to merge in Prakrti, the pure self, liberated, abides in its essential nature and shines forth with its light of transcendental consciousness.\n\nThe attribute-less Brahman is explained sometimes by silence. In his commentary on Brahma Sutras III.ii.17, Sankara tells us that Bhadhva, questioned about Brahman by Bashkalin asked him to learn Brahman and became silent; on second and third questioning by Bashkalin he replied – \" I am teaching you indeed, but you do not understand. Silence is that Self.\" The soundless \"Ardhamatra\", that lingers after the three differentiated sounds of Pranava (\"Om\") die away, is Turiya or Pure Consciousness, the attributeless Brahman (Mandukya Upanishad 12). The causal and the resultant conditions, the non-apprehension and misapprehension of Reality, do not exist in Turiya. Silence is Awareness, it is the Atman, the Self (Mundaka Upanishad II.ii.6) . The absolutistic interpretation is that silence is the genuine teaching about the ultimate Reality, because the Absolute is beyond the scope of speech and thought.\n\nSamkhya and Yoga are dualistic systems; they treat Purusa and Prakrti as equally real entities even though absolutely opposed to each other. The concept of Kaivalya signifies that the aim of these systems is to secure an \"aloneness\" by severing all connections. The discriminating knowledge does cause the separation of Purusa from Prakrti but Prakrti remains intact to cause further bondage. Kaivalya is false transcendence achieved by cutting oneself of altogether from all manifestation and through the ushering in of a blissful silence. The true transcendence, too, is a state above all manifestation, but not aloof or away from transcendence. True transcendence is also silence, but not the silence that is opposed to movement or change because its inherent nature is not disturbed. True transcendence is not the silence of death benumbing the creative flow of life but the silence of which both death and immortality are equal shadows – यस्य च्छायामृतं यस्य मृत्युः (Rig Veda X.121.2). The true advaita never needs the excision of a second in order to achieve its non-duality. The Mimamsakas took the view that nothing but exhaustion of all actions can lead to liberation.\n\nYama tells Naciketa (Katha Upanishad I.iii.13) that the discriminating mind should merge the organ of speech into the mind; he who has extracted and tasted the real essence enjoys true happiness in total silence and all alone united with the source and protecting it (Rig Veda I.79.3). Sankara explains this unity by citing Badhva’s response to Bashkalin. The silence referred to by Badhva as the indescribable nature of Brahman is meant to be felt somewhere deep within. It is of far greater magnitude than mere looking into one’s own mind, far more acute than even the sharpest intellect that can ever read into and decipher its codes. This silence compels the framing of questions, and by itself is the answer not merely in the sound of speech that covers it and reaches the ears. The letters of the alphabet and the words they constitute do not emit the sound or sounds they represent; the sounds they depict are of no value if there is no meaning attached. The silence spoken of by Badhva by itself speaks out most eloquently because it has a meaning attached to it; we are that meaning as also the interpretation of its subtleness. Rishi Ayasya (Rig Veda IX.46.2) prays –\n\nHe states that having acquired the knowledge of the Highest the learned people easily unravel the deeply hidden meaning of the most subtle kind. The letters of the alphabet are the limiting adjuncts of the sounds they denote. The space that exists between two lines is the same that exists between sentences, between words and between letters making up those words. But this space denotes no sound; it is devoid of limiting adjuncts or barriers, the same as the Supreme Being who is a mass of Pure Consciousness devoid of limiting adjuncts. Thus, Space which is silent, unchangeable, eternal and infinite is Brahman. Silence is the Avyakta, the only reality whereas sound is the other Avyakta which is Maya or Prakrti that projects itself on account of its three qualities (gunas). Turiya is beyond utterance and is therefore called the Amatra. Sankara tells us that ignorance is the cause of all conditioned experiences, from the darkness of ignorance arises the sense of separateness, and an ignorant person is hardly aware of the continuous perception of Brahman.\n"}

{"id": "826411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=826411", "title": "Nature (essay)", "text": "Nature (essay)\n\n\"Nature\" is an essay written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, and published by James Munroe and Company in 1836. In the essay Emerson put forth the foundation of transcendentalism, a belief system that espouses a non-traditional appreciation of nature. Transcendentalism suggests that the divine, or God, suffuses nature, and suggests that reality can be understood by studying nature. Emerson's visit to the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris inspired a set of lectures he later delivered in Boston which were then published.\n\nWithin the essay, Emerson divides nature into four usages: Commodity, Beauty, Language and Discipline. These distinctions define the ways by which humans use nature for their basic needs, their desire for delight, their communication with one another and their understanding of the world. Emerson followed the success of \"Nature\" with a speech, \"The American Scholar\", which together with his previous lectures laid the foundation for transcendentalism and his literary career.\n\nIn \"Nature\", Emerson lays out and attempts to solve an abstract problem: that humans do not fully accept nature's beauty. He writes that people are distracted by the demands of the world, whereas nature gives but humans fail to reciprocate. The essay consists of eight sections: Nature, Commodity, Beauty, Language, Discipline, Idealism, Spirit and Prospects. Each section takes a different perspective on the relationship between humans and nature.\n\nIn the essay Emerson explains that to experience the \"wholeness\" with nature for which we are naturally suited, we must be separate from the flaws and distractions imposed on us by society. Emerson believed that solitude is the single mechanism through which we can be fully engaged in the world of nature, writing \"To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars.\" \n\nWhen a person experiences true solitude, in nature, it \"take[s] him away\". Society, he says, destroys wholeness, whereas \"Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the process and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each other's hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.\"\n\nEmerson defines a spiritual relationship. In nature a person finds its spirit and accepts it as the Universal Being. He writes: \"Nature is not fixed but fluid; to a pure spirit, nature is everything.\"\n\nEmerson uses spirituality as a major theme in the essay. Emerson believed in reimagining the divine as something large and visible, which he referred to as nature; such an idea is known as transcendentalism, in which one perceives a new God and their body, and becomes one with their surroundings. Emerson confidently exemplifies transcendentalism, stating, \"From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid transformations: the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind\", postulating that humans and wind are one. Emerson referred to nature as the \"Universal Being\"; he believed that there was a spiritual sense of the natural world around him. Depicting this sense of \"Universal Being\", Emerson states, \"The aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship\".\n\nAccording to Emerson, there were three spiritual problems addressed about nature for humans to solve: \"What is matter? Whence is it? And Whereto?\" What is matter? Matter is a phenomenon, not a substance; rather, nature is something that is experienced by humans, and grows with humans' emotions. Whence is it and Whereto? Such questions can be answered with a single answer, nature's spirit is expressed through humans, \"Therefore, that spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does not build up nature around us, but puts it forth through us\", states Emerson. Emerson clearly depicts that everything must be spiritual and moral, in which there should be goodness between nature and humans.\n\n\"Nature\" was controversial to some. One review published in January 1837 criticized the philosophies in \"Nature\" and disparagingly referred to beliefs as \"Transcendentalist\", coining the term by which the group would become known.\n\nHenry David Thoreau had read \"Nature\" as a senior at Harvard College and took it to heart. It eventually became an essential influence for Thoreau's later writings, including his seminal \"Walden\". In fact, Thoreau wrote \"Walden\" after living in a cabin on land that Emerson owned. Their longstanding acquaintance offered Thoreau great encouragement in pursuing his desire to be a published author.\n\n"}

He also served in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. He is best known for his role in the Bank War.\n\nA member of the prominent Biddle family of Philadelphia, Nicholas Biddle worked for prominent officials such as John Armstrong Jr. and James Monroe in his youth. After returning to Philadelphia, he won election to the state legislature. While serving in the legislature, he successfully lobbied Congress and President Monroe for the creation of a new central bank, which became known as the Second Bank of the United States. In 1822, Monroe appointed Biddle as the third president of the bank. Biddle would continue to serve as the bank's president for several years, during which time he exercised power over the nation's money supply and interest rates, seeking to prevent economic crises. \n\nAt the request of Henry Clay and other Whigs, Biddle asked Democratic President Andrew Jackson to renew the bank's federal charter in 1832. Jackson, who held a deep hostility to many banks, declined to renew the charter, beginning a political debate known as the Bank War. When Jackson transferred the federal government's deposits to several state banks, Biddle raised interest rates, causing a mild economic recession. The federal charter expired in 1836, but the bank was re-chartered by Pennsylvania. Biddle continued to serve as president of the bank until 1839.\n\nNicholas Biddle was born in Philadelphia, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Ancestors of the Biddle family immigrated to Pennsylvania when the proprietor, William Penn (of the Religious Society of Friends, or \"Quakers\") visited, and fought in the pre-Revolutionary colonial struggles. His father, Charles, was prominent in his devotion to the cause of American independence and served as Vice-President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, alongside Council President, the famous Benjamin Franklin (1705/06–1790).\n\nAn uncle with the same name, Nicholas Biddle (1750–1778), whose residence was also in Philadelphia, was an early colonial and American Revolutionary War naval hero, who died during the rebellion. Another uncle, Edward Biddle, was also a member of the First Continental Congress of 1774. Young Nicholas's preparatory education was received at an academy in Philadelphia, where his progress was so rapid that he entered the class of 1799 in the University of Pennsylvania (formerly the \"Academy\", then the \"College of Philadelphia\" until 1791), and would have taken his degree at the age of thirteen had it not been deemed wise to keep him longer at his books. He was accordingly sent to Princeton (formerly the College of New Jersey), entered the sophomore class, and was graduated in 1801 as valedictorian, dividing the first honor of the class with his only rival. His younger brother Thomas Biddle, a War of 1812 hero who died in a duel, should not be confused with his cousin by the same name, who became a leading exchange broker in Philadelphia.\n\nBiddle was offered an official position before he had even finished his law studies. As secretary to John Armstrong Jr. (a Revolutionary War officer, delegate to the Continental Congress, later a U.S. Senator, United States minister to France, and Secretary of War under fourth President James Madison during the War of 1812), he went abroad in 1804 and was in Paris in the new French Empire at the time of Napoleon Bonaparte's coronation. Afterward he participated in an audit related to the \"Louisiana Purchase\" by the United States of the territory west of the Mississippi River, acquiring his first experience in financial affairs. Biddle traveled extensively through Europe, returning to England to serve as secretary for James Monroe, then United States minister to the Court of St. James's (Kingdom of Great Britain). At Cambridge University, Biddle took part in a conversation with Cambridge professors involving comparison between modern Greek dialect and that of Homer; the incident captured Monroe's attention.\n\nIn 1807, Biddle returned home to Philadelphia. He practiced law and wrote, contributing papers to different publications on various subjects, but chiefly in the fine arts. He became associate editor of a magazine called \"Port-Folio\", which was published from 1806–23. When editor Joseph Dennie died in 1812, Biddle took over the magazine and lived on 7th Street, near Spruce Street.\n\nBiddle also prepared western explorers Lewis and Clark's report for publication of their exploratory expedition up the Missouri River through the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase from France (previously recently owned for generations by Spain), across the Rocky Mountains and the Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest to the mouth of the Columbia River on the far Pacific coast, and he encouraged third President Thomas Jefferson to write an introductory memoir of his former aide and private secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, (1774–1809). However, Biddle's name does not appear in the work, as he was elected to serve on the Pennsylvania state legislature (1810–1811) and was compelled to turn over the project to Paul Allen, (1775–1826), who then further supervised its publication. With the consent of all parties, Allen was then recognized as the editor.\n\nBiddle served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1810, and then in the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1814. He originated a bill favoring popular education almost a quarter of a century in advance of the times. Though the bill was initially defeated, it resurfaced repeatedly in different forms until, in 1836, the Pennsylvania \"common-school\" system was inaugurated as an indirect result of his efforts.\n\nAfter Biddle moved to the Pennsylvania State Senate, he lobbied for the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States. It was on this subject that he made his first speech, which attracted general attention at the time, and was warmly commended by Chief-Justice Marshall and other leaders of public opinion. \n\nThe Bank had been revived and reorganized from the earlier First Bank of the United States, established in 1791 under the administration of first President George Washington, and after a chartered term of 20 years, expired in 1811 on the eve of the monetary pressures of the coming War of 1812 era. After economic hardships and problems financing the Government and its war measures during the War of 1812 to 1815, and a period of dormancy, a newly revived and reorganized Second Bank of the United States was rechartered in 1816 under fifth President James Monroe, who appointed Biddle as a Federal Government director and representative. When the Bank's president, Langdon Cheves, resigned in 1822, Biddle became its president. During his association with the Bank, President Monroe, under authority from Congress, directed him to prepare a \"Commercial Digest\" of the laws and trade regulations of the world and the various nations. For many years after, this Digest was regarded as an authority on the subject. \n\nIn late 1818, $4 million of interest payments on the bonds previously sold in 1803 to pay for the \"Louisiana Purchase\" was due, in either gold or silver, to European investors. The U.S. Government had to get its hands on additional amounts of \"specie\", i.e., silver or gold. As the Government's fiscal agent, the Bank was required to make this payment on behalf of the Government. The Bank was forced to demand that the private commercial banks that had been lent money in the form of \"fiat\" paper must now repay in specie, which was then sent to Europe to pay the government's creditors. This rather sudden contraction of the country's monetary base after three currency and rampant speculation based on debt led to the financial Panic of 1819.\n\nMeanwhile, in Tennessee, General and future Presidential candidate, Andrew Jackson was hard-pressed to pay his debts during this period. He developed a lifelong hostility to all banks that were not completely backed by gold or silver deposits. This meant, above all, hostility to the new Second Bank of the United States..\n\nAs Bank president, Biddle occasionally engaged in the newly-developing national techniques of \"central banking\" – controlling the nation's money supply, regulating interest rates, lending to state banks, and acting as the U.S. Government's fiscal agent. When state banks became excessive in their lending practices, Biddle's Bank acted as a restraint. In a few instances, he even rescued state banks to prevent the risk of \"contagion\" spreading. He was also important in the 1833 establishment of Girard College, an early free private school for poor orphaned boys in Philadelphia, under the provisions of the will of his friend and former legal client, Stephen Girard (1750–1831), one of the wealthiest men in America. Girard had been the original promoter of the revival and reorganization of the Second Bank and its largest investor.\n\nOn August 26, 1831, Biddle's brother, Thomas, a War of 1812 veteran, was killed in a duel on \"Bloody Island\" on the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri with U.S. Representative (Congressman) Spencer Pettis. Thomas had taken offense to Pettis' criticizing Nicholas at the bank. After an exchange of letters to the editor of a newspaper, Biddle accosted an ill Pettis in his hotel room. After Pettis recovered, he then challenged Thomas to a duel, and both were killed when they exchanged shots from five feet apart.\n\nThe Bank War began when seventh President Andrew Jackson began criticizing the Bank early in his first term. Biddle, at the urging of Henry Clay and other Bank supporters, upped the ante when he applied for the Bank's re-charter in January 1832. This was four years before the charter was scheduled to expire at the end of two decades, and the hope was to force Jackson into making an unpopular decision that might cost him during an election year. But, once challenged, President Jackson decided to veto the bill anyway. Jackson, well known for his stubborn personality and steadfast leadership, still harbored ill-will toward Henry Clay of Kentucky from the earlier \"Corrupt Bargain\" accusation following the Presidential Election of 1824 which made him Secretary of State when appointed by the administration of the winner, sixth President John Quincy Adams. \n\nAt Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson in the 1832 election. Biddle was told that this would only give credence to Jackson's theory that the Bank interfered in the American political process, but chose to dismiss the warning. Ultimately, Clay's strategy failed, and in November he lost to Jackson, who was reelected to a second term.\n\nIn early 1833, Jackson, despite opposition from some members of his cabinet, decided to withdraw the Government's funds from the Bank. The incumbent Secretary of the Treasury, Louis McLane, a member of Jackson's Cabinet, professed moderate support for the Bank. He therefore refused to withdraw the Federal funds directed by the President and would not resign, so Jackson then transferred him to the State Department. McLane's successor, William J. Duane, was also opposed to the Bank, but would not carry out Jackson's orders either. After waiting four months, President Jackson summarily dismissed Duane, replacing him with Attorney General Roger B. Taney as a recess appointment when Congress was out of session. In September 1833, Taney helped transfer the public deposits from the Bank to seven state-chartered banks. Faced with the loss of the Federal deposits, Biddle decided to raise interest rates and deliberately induce a recession. A mild financial panic ensued from late 1833 to mid-1834. Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment. Meanwhile, Biddle and other Bank supporters attempted to renew the Bank's charter through the Congress on numerous occasions. All their attempts failed under the threat of a Jackson presidential veto.\n\nFinally, after the requisite twenty-year term, the Bank's charter expired in April 1836, but the financial institution continued as a state-chartered bank under the laws of Pennsylvania for several more years. As the Bank wound up its operations in the next five years, state-chartered banks in the West and South relaxed their lending standards, maintaining unsafe reserve ratios and contributing to the Panic of 1837. In 1839 Biddle resigned from his post as bank president, and in 1841, amidst the post-Panic recession, the Bank finally failed. Biddle was arrested and charged with fraud, but was acquitted. He died soon after, on February 27, 1844, while still involved in the ensuing civil suits.\n\nIn 1811 Biddle married Jane Margaret Craig (born 1792); the couple had six children including Charles John Biddle, who served in the United States Army and in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Nicholas Biddle Estate in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania, also known as \"Andalusia\", is a National Historic Landmark, registered with the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n\n"}

His thought is influenced by Max Stirner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georges Palante, Oscar Wilde, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Schopenhauer and Charles Baudelaire.\n\nAbele Ricieri Ferrari was born in Arcola, Liguria, Italy on May 12, 1890 in a poor peasant family. He did not adjust to school discipline and quit in the first year never coming back after that. While he worked in his father's farm, he self-educated himself with an emphasis in poetry and philosophy. Around his town, he was surrounded by a vibrant anarchist scene which he started to come close to.\n\nHe discovered Max Stirner, Errico Malatesta, Peter Kropotkin, Henrik Ibsen, and Friedrich Nietzsche, whom Novatore often quoted. From 1908 on he embraced individualist anarchism. In 1910, he was charged with the burning of a local church and spent three months in prison, but his participation in the fire was never proven. A year later, he went on the lam for several months because the police wanted him for theft and robbery. On September 30, 1911, the police arrested him for vandalism. He justified refusal of work and he thought, in his personal philosophy of life, that he has the right to expropriate from the rich people what he needed for his daily survival, and using force wasn't a problem for him.\n\nIn 1914, he began to write for anarchist papers. He was drafted in 1912 but quickly discharged for unknown causes. As the Great War approached he deserted his regiment on April 26, 1918 and was sentenced to death by a military tribunal for desertion and high treason on October 31. He left his village and fled, propagating the desertion from the Army and the armed uprising against the state. Novatore was married with two children at the time and when his younger son died in the last months of 1918, Novatore came back to his home, risking the arrest only to give him a last goodbye.\n\nHe was involved in an anarcho-futurist collective in La Spezia which he led (along with Auro d'Arcola) to be active in the militant anti-fascist \"Arditi del Popolo\". He was close friends with Enzo Martucci and Bruno Filippi. Renzo Novatore wrote for many anarchist papers (\"Cronaca Libertaria, Il Libertario, Iconoclastal, Gli Scamiciati, Nichilismo, Pagine Libere\") where he debated with other anarchists (among them Camillo Berneri). He published a magazine, \"Vertice\", which has unfortunately been lost apart from few articles. Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal \"Iconoclasta!\" alongside the young stirnerist illegalist Bruno Filippi\n\nIn May 1919, the city of La Spezia fell under control of a self-proclaimed Revolutionary Committee and he fought alongside it. On June 30, 1919, Novatore was hidden in a hut in the countries near the city of Sarzana. A farmer told the police about him and he was sentenced to ten years in prison, but was released in a general amnesty a few months later. By the early 1920s Italy was about to be taken over by Fascism. He decided to go underground and in 1922 he joined the gang of the famous robber of anarchist inspiration: Sante Pollastro.\n\nHe was killed in an ambush by \"carabinieri\" in Teglia, near Genoa, on November 29, 1922 while being with Pollastro but Pollastro managed to escape. On Novatore's body the detectives found some false documents, a Browning gun with two full magazines, one hand grenade and a ring with a secret container filled with a lethal dose of cyanide.\n\nNovatore talked of the \"heroic beauty of the anti-collectivist and creative I\" which is beyond both bourgoise and proletarian manners and morality. He spoke of his individual situation as living \"In the Reign of the Phantoms\" recalling Stirner. He summarizes his view of his situation as existing among social conformism saying \"The world is one pestulant church covetous and slimy where all have an idol to fetishistically adore and an altar on which to sacrifice themself.\"\n\nIn this way he speaks of religion saying \"if you will patiently await the desolate calvary to then nail yourself on the cross, becoming the image of ME that is the ManGod, you will be the perfect human creature worthy of sitting at the right of my father who is in the kingdom of heaven.\". As far as democracy and the legacy of the Enlightenment he says \"the French Revolution says to you: I have proclaimed the rights of man. If you will enter devoutly in the symbolic cloister of human social justice to sublimate and humanize through the moral canon of social life, you will be a citizen and I will give you the rights I proclaimed to man.\" \"Progress (?) and Civilization (?), Religion (?) and the Ideal (?), have closed life in a mortal circle where the phantoms most grim have erected their viscid reign. Time to end it! We must break the circle violently and exit\".\n\nAs an exit of this situation he proclaims \"revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth. Because we-violent celebralists and passional sentimentalists at the same time-understand and know that revolution is a necessity of the silent sorrow that suffers at the bottom and a need of the free spirits who suffer in the heights.\" He summarizes the three options in life as \"The stream of slavery, the stream of tyranny, the stream of freedom! With revolution, the last of these streams needs to burst upon the other two and overwhelm them. It needs to create spiritual beauty, teach the poor the shame of their poverty, and the rich the shame of their wealth.\"\n\nNevertheless, he has an individualist permanent conception of revolution which he thinks could at some point come into conflict with the masses. He says \"You are waiting for the revolution! Very well! My own began along time ago! When you are ready – God, what an endless wait! – it won’t nauseate me to go along the road awhile with you! But when you stop, I will continue on my mad and triumphant march toward the great and sublime conquest of Nothing!\". Alongside this, he manifests an insurrectionary point of view such as when he manifests that \"Every society you build will have its fringes, and on the fringes of every society, heroic and restless vagabonds will wander, with their wild and virgin thoughts, only able to live by preparing ever new and terrible outbreaks of rebellion!\".\n\nHe says he views \"Only ethical and spiritual wealth\" as \"invulnerable.\nThis is the true property of individuals. The rest no!\nThe rest is vulnerable! And all that is vulnerable will be violated!\" Novatore sees thoses similar to him as \"anarchists. And individualists, and nihilists, and aristocrats.\" and as \"the lovers of every miracle, the promoters of every prodigy, the creators of every wonder!\"; \"the enemies of all material domination and all spiritual leveling.\"\n\nHe adheres to nihilism but denies \"christian nihilism\" as he sees it denies life. He says instead \"Since the only serious people are those who know how to be actively engaged laughing.\" and so the individualists must go \"Forward, for the destruction of the lie and of the phantoms! Forward, for the complete conquest of individuality and of Life!\". Novatore described himself as an anarchist and defined that term as follows;\n\nNovatore is critical of the individualism of Herbert Spencer which he thinks \"it is true that he fights against the state, but he fights against it only because the state as it is doesn’t function as he would like\". He also sees that Spencer \"does not penetrate or understand the mysterious, aristocratic, vagabond, rebel individual!\".\n\nAnd so he is critical of thinkers such as \"Darwin, Comte, Spencer and Marx\" which he sees as sociologists who will tend to not being \"able to understand the varied, the particular... sacrifices the one or the other on the altar of the universal.\" Instead he takes sides with authors who are for him \"the giants of Art and Thought like Nietzsche, Stirner, Ibsen, Wilde, Zola, Huysmans, Verlaine, Mallarmé...\".\n\nThe notorious Italo-Argentinian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni dedicated a poem to Novatore shortly after knowing about his death. Later he will establish the \"Anarcho-individualist Group Renzo Novatore\" which enters the “Italian Anti-fascist Alliance” in Argentina.\n\nRenzo Novatore has received attention recently in post-left anarchy and insurrectionary anarchism as can be seen in the writings of Wolfi Landstreicher. In his introduction to \"Towards the Creative nothing\" by Renzo Novatore, Landstreicher writes \"It is difficult to find anarchist works in English that are at the same time \"individualist\" and explicitly revolutionary, that emphasize the centrality of the aim of individual self-determination to a revolution that will \"communalize material wealth\" as it will \"individualize spiritual wealth\". For this and other reasons I chose to translate Toward the Creative Nothing by Renzo Novatore and publish several of his shorter pieces.\" In an article called \"Whither now? Some thoughts on creating anarchy\" Wolfi Landstreicher writing as Feral Faun says \"Then we can cease to be merely on the margins of society and will each, as unique wild beings, become the center of an insurrectionary project that may destroy civilization and create a world in which we freely live, relate and create as our unique desires move us. We will become – to quote Renzo Novatore again – \"a shadow eclipsing any form of society which can exist under the sun.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

His paper suggested that electricity was not a single force, as was believed by, for example Benjamin Franklin and Giambatista Beccaria, but was instead two opposing forces arising from two separate liquids.\n\nHe reported his observations on the static electricity resulting from repeatedly removing his woollen and silk stockings, a habit which led to him being nicknamed \"The Barefoot Philosopher\".\n\nAlthough his theory was paid little attention in Britain, his views received more notice abroad. Scholars such as Jean-Antoine Nollet, Franz Aepinus, Johan Wilcke, Brugmans Anton or Torbern Bergman were supporters of his 'two-fluid' theory, considering him its originator. However, this idea was a revival of that of Charles du Fay, who in 1733 considered that electricity consisted of 'glass electricity' (\"électricité vitreuse\") and 'resin electricity' (\"électricité résineuse\").\n\nModern historians of science are not a little kinder to his views as the country people of his time. The reasons are obvious, since most reports of electricity in the 18th Century by Joseph Priestley's The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) were derived, although the treated fairly dualistic position, on the other hand, no opportunity to mock Symmers omitted.

{"id": "23401166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23401166", "title": "Satisfiability", "text": "Satisfiability\n\nIn mathematical logic, satisfiability and validity are elementary concepts of semantics. A formula is \"satisfiable\" if it is possible to find an interpretation (model) that makes the formula true. A formula is \"valid\" if all interpretations make the formula true. The opposites of these concepts are unsatisfiability and invalidity, that is, a formula is \"unsatisfiable\" if none of the interpretations make the formula true, and \"invalid\" if some such interpretation makes the formula false. These four concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to Aristotle's square of opposition.\n\nThe four concepts can be raised to apply to whole theories: a theory is satisfiable (valid) if one (all) of the interpretations make(s) each of the axioms of the theory true, and a theory is unsatisfiable (invalid) if all (one) of the interpretations make(s) each of the axioms of the theory false.\n\nIt is also possible to consider only interpretations that make all of the axioms of a second theory true. This generalization is commonly called satisfiability modulo theories.\n\nThe question whether a sentence in propositional logic is satisfiable is a decidable problem. In general, the question whether sentences in first-order logic are satisfiable is not decidable. In universal algebra and equational theory, the methods of term rewriting, congruence closure and unification are used to attempt to decide satisfiability. Whether a particular theory is decidable or not depends whether the theory is variable-free or on other conditions.\n\nFor classical logics, it is generally possible to reexpress the question of the validity of a formula to one involving satisfiability, because of the relationships between the concepts expressed in the above square of opposition. In particular φ is valid if and only if ¬φ is unsatisfiable, which is to say it is not true that ¬φ is satisfiable. Put another way, φ is satisfiable if and only if ¬φ is invalid.\n\nFor logics without negation, such as the positive propositional calculus, the questions of validity and satisfiability may be unrelated. In the case of the positive propositional calculus, the satisfiability problem is trivial, as every formula is satisfiable, while the validity problem is co-NP complete.\n\nIn the case of classical propositional logic, satisfiability is decidable for propositional formulae. In particular, satisfiability is an NP-complete problem, and is one of the most intensively studied problems in computational complexity theory.\n\nSatisfiability is undecidable and indeed it isn't even a semidecidable property of formulae in first-order logic (FOL). This fact has to do with the undecidability of the validity problem for FOL. The question of the status of the validity problem was posed firstly by David Hilbert, as the so-called Entscheidungsproblem. The universal validity of a formula is a semi-decidable problem. If satisfiability were also a semi-decidable problem, then the problem of the existence of counter-models would be too (a formula has counter-models iff its negation is satisfiable). So the problem of logical validity would be decidable, which contradicts the Church-Turing theorem, a result stating the negative answer for the Entscheidungsproblem.\n\nIn model theory, an atomic formula is satisfiable if there is a collection of elements of a structure that render the formula true. If \"A\" is a structure, φ is a formula, and \"a\" is a collection of elements, taken from the structure, that satisfy φ, then it is commonly written that\n\nIf φ has no variables, that is, if φ is an atomic sentence, and it is satisfied by \"A\", then one writes\n\nIn this case, one may also say that \"A\" is a model for φ, or that φ is \"true\" in \"A\". If \"T\" is a collection of atomic sentences (a theory) satisfied by \"A\", one writes\n\nA problem related to satisfiability is that of finite satisfiability, which is the question of determining whether a formula admits a \"finite\" model that makes it true. For a logic that has the finite model property, the problems of satisfiability and finite satisfiability coincide, as a formula of that logic has a model if and only if it has a finite model. This question is important in the mathematical field of finite model theory.\n\nNevertheless, finite satisfiability and satisfiability need not coincide in general. For instance, consider the first-order logic formula obtained as the conjunction of the following sentences, where formula_1 and formula_2 are constants:\n\n\nThe resulting formula has the infinite model formula_7, but it can be shown that it has no finite model (starting at the fact formula_8 and following the chain of formula_9 atoms that must exist by the third axiom, the finiteness of a model would require the existence of a loop, which would violate the fourth axiom, whether it loops back on formula_10 or on a different element).\n\nThe computational complexity of deciding satisfiability for an input formula in a given logic may differ from that of deciding finite satisfiability; in fact, for some logics, only one of them is decidable.\n\nNumerical constraints often appear in the field of mathematical optimization, where one usually wants to maximize (or minimize) an objective function subject to some constraints. However, leaving aside the objective function, the basic issue of simply deciding whether the constraints are satisfiable can be challenging or undecidable in some settings. The following table summarizes the main cases.\n\n\"Table source: Bockmayr and Weispfenning\".\n\nFor linear constraints, a fuller picture is provided by the following table.\n\n\"Table source: Bockmayr and Weispfenning\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "321652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321652", "title": "Term logic", "text": "Term logic\n\nIn philosophy, term logic, also known as traditional logic, syllogistic logic or Aristotelian logic, is a loose name for an approach to logic that began with Aristotle and that was dominant until the advent of modern predicate logic in the late nineteenth century. This entry is an introduction to the term logic needed to understand philosophy texts written before it was replaced as a formal logic system by predicate logic. Readers lacking a grasp of the basic terminology and ideas of term logic can have difficulty understanding such texts, because their authors typically assumed an acquaintance with term logic.\n\nAristotle's logical work is collected in the six texts that are collectively known as the \"Organon\". Two of these texts in particular, namely the \"Prior Analytics\" and \"De Interpretatione\", contain the heart of Aristotle's treatment of judgements and formal inference, and it is principally this part of Aristotle's works that is about term logic. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Lukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Jan Lukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley – which informs modern translations of \"Prior Analytics\" by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.\n\nThe fundamental assumption behind the theory is that propositions are composed of two terms – hence the name \"two-term theory\" or \"term logic\" – and that the reasoning process is in turn built from propositions:\n\nA proposition may be universal or particular, and it may be affirmative or negative. Traditionally, the four kinds of propositions are:\nThis was called the \"fourfold scheme\" of propositions (see types of syllogism for an explanation of the letters A, I, E, and O in the traditional square). Aristotle's \"original\" square of opposition, however, does not lack existential import.\n\nIn the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article, \"The Traditional Square of Opposition\", Terence Parsons explains:\n\nA term (Greek \"horos\") is the basic component of the proposition. The original meaning of the \"horos\" (and also of the Latin \"terminus\") is \"extreme\" or \"boundary\". The two terms lie on the outside of the proposition, joined by the act of affirmation or denial.\nFor early modern logicians like Arnauld (whose \"Port-Royal Logic\" was the best-known text of his day), it is a psychological entity like an \"idea\" or \"concept\". Mill considers it a word. To assert \"all Greeks are men\" is not to say that the concept of Greeks is the concept of men, or that word \"Greeks\" is the word \"men\". A proposition cannot be built from real things or ideas, but it is not just meaningless words either.\n\nIn term logic, a \"proposition\" is simply a \"form of language\": a particular kind of sentence, in which the subject and predicate are combined, so as to assert something true or false. It is not a thought, or an abstract entity. The word \"propositio\" is from the Latin, meaning the first premise of a syllogism. Aristotle uses the word premise (\"protasis\") as a sentence affirming or denying one thing or another (\"Posterior Analytics\" 1. 1 24a 16), so a premise is also a form of words.\nHowever, as in modern philosophical logic, it means that which is asserted by the sentence. Writers before Frege and Russell, such as Bradley, sometimes spoke of the \"judgment\" as something distinct from a sentence, but this is not quite the same. As a further confusion the word \"sentence\" derives from the Latin, meaning an opinion or judgment, and so is equivalent to \"proposition\".\n\nThe \"logical quality\" of a proposition is whether it is affirmative (the predicate is affirmed of the subject) or negative (the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus \"every philosopher is mortal\" is affirmative, since the mortality of philosophers is affirmed universally, whereas \"no philosopher is mortal\" is negative by denying such mortality in particular.\n\nThe \"quantity\" of a proposition is whether it is universal (the predicate is affirmed or denied of all subjects or of \"the whole\") or particular (the predicate is affirmed or denied of some subject or a \"part\" thereof). In case where existential import is assumed, quantification implies the existence of at least one subject, unless disclaimed.\n\nFor Aristotle, the distinction between singular and universal is a fundamental metaphysical one, and not merely grammatical. A singular term for Aristotle is primary substance, which can only be predicated of itself: (this) \"Callias\" or (this) \"Socrates\" are not predicable of any other thing, thus one does not say \"every Socrates\" one says \"every human\" (\"De Int.\" 7; \"Meta.\" D9, 1018a4). It may feature as a grammatical predicate, as in the sentence \"the person coming this way is Callias\". But it is still a \"logical\" subject.\n\nHe contrasts universal (\"katholou\") secondary substance, genera, with primary substance, particular (\"kath' hekaston\") specimens. The formal nature of universals, in so far as they can be generalized \"always, or for the most part\", is the subject matter of both scientific study and formal logic.\n\nThe essential feature of the syllogism is that, of the four terms in the two premises, one must occur twice. Thus\n\nThe subject of one premise, must be the predicate of the other, and so it is necessary to eliminate from the logic any terms which cannot function both as subject and predicate, namely singular terms.\n\nHowever, in a popular 17th century version of the syllogism, Port-Royal Logic, singular terms were treated as universals:\n\nThis is clearly awkward, a weakness exploited by Frege in his devastating attack on the system.\n\nThe famous syllogism \"Socrates is a man ...\", is frequently quoted as though from Aristotle, but fact, it is nowhere in the \"Organon\". Sextus Empiricus in his \"Hyp. Pyrrh\" (Outlines of Pyrronism) ii. 164 first mentions the related syllogism \"Socrates is a human being, Every human being is an animal, Therefore, Socrates is an animal.\"\n\nThe Aristotelian logical system had a formidable influence on the late-philosophy of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. In the early 1970s, Lacan reworked Aristotle's term logic by way of Frege and Jacques Brunschwig to produce his four formulae of sexuation. While these formulae retain the formal arrangement of the square of opposition, they seek to undermine the universals of both qualities by the 'existence without essence' of Lacan's particular negative proposition.\n\nTerm logic began to decline in Europe during the Renaissance, when logicians like Rodolphus Agricola Phrisius (1444–1485) and Ramus (1515–1572) began to promote place logics. The logical tradition called Port-Royal Logic, or sometimes \"traditional logic\", saw propositions as combinations of ideas rather than of terms, but otherwise followed many of the conventions of term logic. It remained influential, especially in England, until the 19th century. Leibniz created a distinctive logical calculus, but nearly all of his work on logic remained unpublished and unremarked until Louis Couturat went through the Leibniz \"Nachlass\" around 1900, publishing his pioneering studies in logic.\n\n19th-century attempts to algebraize logic, such as the work of Boole (1815–1864) and Venn (1834–1923), typically yielded systems highly influenced by the term-logic tradition. The first predicate logic was that of Frege's landmark \"Begriffsschrift\" (1879), little read before 1950, in part because of its eccentric notation. Modern predicate logic as we know it began in the 1880s with the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, who influenced Peano (1858–1932) and even more, Ernst Schröder (1841–1902). It reached fruition in the hands of Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead, whose \"Principia Mathematica\" (1910–13) made use of a variant of Peano's predicate logic.\n\nTerm logic also survived to some extent in traditional Roman Catholic education, especially in seminaries. Medieval Catholic theology, especially the writings of Thomas Aquinas, had a powerfully Aristotelean cast, and thus term logic became a part of Catholic theological reasoning. For example, Joyce's \"Principles of Logic\" (1908; 3rd edition 1949), written for use in Catholic seminaries, made no mention of Frege or of Bertrand Russell.\n\nSome philosophers have complained that predicate logic:\n\nEven academic philosophers entirely in the mainstream, such as Gareth Evans, have written as follows:\n\n\n"}

During a potlatch, members of the society with a surplus of food and supplies provide these for all members of a clan, and in situations with other clans this sharing of resources is either a competitive showing or one of creating loyalties, and sometimes both simultaneously.\n\nTraditionally the village was centered on the chiefs' house, and this is where potlatches were held. This was because the chief had the biggest cache where the food was stored.\n\nThere were many different reasons to hold a potlatch in Athabaskan culture, including the birth of a child, a surplus of food, or a death in the clan. The most elaborate of Athabaskan potlatches was the mortuary or funeral potlatch. This marked \"the separation of the deceased from society and is the last public expression of grief.\" \n\nThere were slight variations in the funeral and mortuary potlatches depending on the status or role of the member of the clan who had died. Different songs and dances were performed for a warrior than for an elder. Because of the tight-knit manner of a group or clan, usually due to extended family ties, the death of an elder, in particular, had a very large effect on the tribe. The corpse would first be dressed by the women of the clan and be prepared, while the mobilizing and putting together of the funeral would be taken care of by the closest male relative of the deceased. The preparations would differ but the proceedings of the funerals themselves were generally similar.\n\nThe potlatch generally consisted of \"the feast, dancing & singing, oratory, and the distribution of gifts\". The feast was provided by a wealthier member of the group to communicate \"sentiment, affection, familiarity and goodwill.\" Dancing and singing were a reciprocation of the guests to the hosts for their generosity. Stories were told in the same manner, and for entertainment. The act of giving out gifts was possibly the most dynamic aspect of the traditional Athabaskan potlatch. This was a generous act of sharing one's wealth with the rest of the tribe, and simultaneously a show of the abundance and superiority of the host.\n\nModern potlatches still contain many of the traditional aspects of sharing food, giving gifts, singing, dancing and telling stories, but now the purpose has changed. Most modern potlatches can be held for similar reasons, such as a birth or a death, but now they are no longer so much a show of wealth, but a celebration to keep the tradition alive.\n\nAs with other aspects of the potlatch, food plays a significant role in the social structure; providing large amounts of food for the guests is symbolic of the host's love and care for his guests, and also for the nourishment he symbolically provides to future generations. Due to the overabundance of food, leftovers are distributed first to elders, then the remainder of the guests. According to Simeone, doing so is \"a reminder of the host's generosity long after the event.\"\n\nAs the potlatch is attended by dozens to hundreds of people from neighboring villages, and is often hosted by one or two people, food and money are given as a gift to the host by family members, to help offset the cost of feeding so many. Several men of the village are tasked with hunting moose specifically for a potlatch; it is not uncommon for three or more moose to be killed to feed the guests over the two or three days feasting. One account of a potlatch in the village of Tetlin claimed 22 moose were killed and butchered in preparation of a particularly large feast. In addition to moose meat, many other types of wild food are harvested or donated, such as beaver, duck, salmon, and berries. Traditional subsistence foods provide a reminder of the relationship between the Athabaskan and the land which has historically sustained them.\n\nBreakfast and lunch are served each day for potlatch attendees and are less formal than the evening meal. Breakfast is offered each morning; eggs, bacon, coffee, and potatoes are common fare. Lunch consists of soup, sandwiches, and tea. The evening meal is scheduled for a specific time and all potlatch attendees are expected to attend. It is the most significant spiritual and social event of the potlatch and is treated as such by the attendees. Large rolls of white butcher paper are rolled out on the floor to serve as place settings and many participants sit next to each other on the floor. Benches and chairs are provided for elders.\n\nMoose is normally cooked by the men of the potlatch. It is served roasted, fried, and as moose head stew, which consists of the meaty portions of the moose's head mixed with vegetables and rice in large stew pots. Grilled and smoked salmon is served, as is soup made from round whitefish. Wild cranberries and blueberries are incorporated into desserts.\n\nThe traditional wild food is supplemented by store-bought items, most notably black loose leaf tea, which was introduced to the Athabaskan by traders in the 1800s and remains a staple among present day potlatches. Bannock, also known as fry bread, rolls, and salads are also served.\n\nThe celebration of dance for the Athabaskan people plays a vital role in the success of a potlatch. Unlike many cultures that have changed their mourning over the course of many generations, the Athabaskan people have stayed strong and true to the old ways of song and dance.\n\nDancing is a very important part of Athabaskan culture, and it is often the focal point of the potlatch, particularly after the evening meal. During potlatches a variety of songs are sung; the first songs sung of the weeklong event are called the mourning songs. Traditionally new songs are song first to give thanks to the hosts that are sponsoring the potlatch, followed by the singing of old songs.\n\nPoldine Carlo, an Athabaskan from Interior Alaska, noted that \"The potlatch usually lasted for a week. The first night we would have a big potlatch at the community hall and then the mourning songs were sung, the new songs first for the ones the potlatch was being given for and then the old, old songs that we have been singing for a long time. The women would stand in line all across the hall and dance.\"\n\nAn excerpt from the book \"Rifles, Blankets, & Beads\" tells of \"sorry songs\" that were sung at a potlatch that took place in Tanacross: \"At one potlatch in Tonacross, for example, a sequence of sorry songs began with one made especially for the person that had just died. It followed by songs for a young man who died in a house fire 10 years before; a boy who drowned in the river while attempting to draw water and for Elisha's father, who died in the 1960s.\"\n\nThe grieving process within the Alaskan Native community is rather unusual, it is shared not just by the family but by both local and neighboring communities. If one member of the family of the deceased does not show up or is late, this is considered to be such a great insult that tribal chiefs have been known to interrupt potlatches in order to publicly shame those who have arrived late or have not communicated with the rest of the community concerning their loss. Grieving is expected to be shared, and thus the burden of grief is lifted from the individual to the group.\n\nDance is the outlet that allows potlatch attendees to vent their grief; \"sorry songs\" give way to \"happy songs\" and dances, such as the calico dance, where colorful bolts of cloth are passed among female participants, who dance in a large circle. Such dances serve to restore harmony among the relationships within the tribe.\n\nA traditional Athabaskan potlatch is concluded with the giving of gifts. Valuable trade items, traditionally dentalium shells, now largely replaced by rifles, blankets, cash, and beaded items, are collected by the host from members of their mother's moiety and are redistributed by the host to members of his father's moiety in exchange for their contributions of celebration and participation in the potlatch. For instance, an exceptional dancer might be rewarded for her abilities, and likewise a grave digger or pallbearer would be compensated at a funeral potlatch.\n\nAt the conclusion of a potlatch, gifts are piled high in the center of the meeting hall and distributed to guests. By distributing guns and blankets to the assembled guests, the host demonstrates his relationship to and his feelings for his paternal relatives and potential marriage partners. Through these distributions the host gains prestige as he symbolically ensures his guests' existence by giving them guns to hunt with and blankets to keep them warm.\n\nBeaded items are also commonly given as gifts at potlatches, including necklaces, moccasins, gloves, vests, and gun cases. Beads, like the dentalium they have come to replace, are symbolic of social relations that, when expressed in the form of necklaces or sashes, literally surround or embrace the individual. Today Tanacross people see dentalium shells not only as symbols of prestige but also as expressions of affection.\n\nWhile rifles, blankets and beaded items are traditional potlatch gifts, they are not the only ones. Other gifts might include furs, afghans, quilts, moose hide jackets, calico, snowshoes, gloves, hats, coffeepots, enameled plates, snow shovels, suitcases, frying pans and many others both practical and symbolic.\n\nDentalium shells and moose hide jackets are often worn by the host while distributing gifts. In some communities, gifts are given out while wearing gloves. If the gloves are kept, it is believed that the wealth will be stored in them, and eventually return to the giver.\n\nOften a potlatch host will fully deplete their savings and give away their entire material wealth. The potlatch is an honorable ceremony, and in giving everything away, the host gains prestige. A rich man who does not share his possessions is, to an Athabaskan, a stingy man who is to be pitied.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "239140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239140", "title": "Validity (statistics)", "text": "Validity (statistics)\n\nValidity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world based on probability. The word \"valid\" is derived from the Latin validus, meaning strong. This should not be confused with notions of certainty nor necessity. The validity of a measurement tool (for example, a test in education) is considered to be the degree of probability to which the tool measures what it claims to measure; in this case, the validity is an equivalent to a percent of how accurately the claim corresponds to reality. \n\nIn psychometrics, validity has a particular application known as test validity: \"the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores\" (\"as entailed by proposed uses of tests\").\n\nIt is generally accepted that the concept of scientific validity addresses the nature of reality in terms of statistical probability and as such is an epistemological and philosophical issue as well as a question of measurement of the possibility that a scientific claim is true. The use of the term in logic is narrower, relating to the truth of inferences made from premises. In logic, and therefore as the term is applied to any epistemological claim, validity refers to the consistency of an argument flowing from the premises to the conclusion; as such, the truth of the claim in logic is not only reliant on validity. Rather, an argumentative claim is true if and only if it is both valid and sound. This means the argument flows without contradiction from the premises or the conclusion, and all of the premises and the conclusion correspond to known facts. As such, \"scientific or statistical validity\" is not a deductive claim that is necessarily truth preserving, but is an inductive claim that remains true or false in an undecided manner. This is why \"scientific or statistical validity\" is a claim that is qualified as being either strong or weak in its nature, it is never necessary nor certainly true. This has the effect of making claims of \"scientific or statistical validity\" open to interpretation as to what, in fact, the facts of the matter mean. \n\nValidity is important because it can help determine what types of tests to use, and help to make sure researchers are using methods that are not only ethical, and cost-effective, but also a method that truly measures the idea or constructs in question.\n\nValidity of an assessment is the degree to which it measures what it is supposed to measure. This is not the same as reliability, which is the extent to which a measurement gives results that are very consistent. Within validity, the measurement does not always have to be similar, as it does in reliability. However, just because a measure is reliable, it is not necessarily valid. E.g. a scale that is 5 pounds off is reliable but not valid. A test cannot be valid unless it is reliable. Validity is also dependent on the measurement measuring what it was designed to measure, and not something else instead. Validity (similar to reliability) is a relative concept; validity is not an all-or-nothing idea. There are many different types of validity.\n\nConstruct validity refers to the extent to which operationalizations of a construct (e.g., practical tests developed from a theory) measure a construct as defined by a theory. It subsumes all other types of validity. For example, the extent to which a test measures intelligence is a question of construct validity. A measure of intelligence presumes, among other things, that the measure is associated with things it should be associated with (convergent validity), not associated with things it should not be associated with (discriminant validity).\n\nConstruct validity evidence involves the empirical and theoretical support for the interpretation of the construct. Such lines of evidence include statistical analyses of the internal structure of the test including the relationships between responses to different test items. They also include relationships between the test and measures of other constructs. As currently understood, construct validity is not distinct from the support for the substantive theory of the construct that the test is designed to measure. As such, experiments designed to reveal aspects of the causal role of the construct also contribute to constructing validity evidence.\n\nContent validity is a non-statistical type of validity that involves \"the systematic examination of the test content to determine whether it covers a representative sample of the behavior domain to be measured\" (Anastasi & Urbina, 1997 p. 114). For example, does an IQ questionnaire have items covering all areas of intelligence discussed in the scientific literature?\n\nContent validity evidence involves the degree to which the content of the test matches a content domain associated with the construct. For example, a test of the ability to add two numbers should include a range of combinations of digits. A test with only one-digit numbers, or only even numbers, would not have good coverage of the content domain. Content related evidence typically involves a subject matter expert (SME) evaluating test items against the test specifications. Before going to the final administration of questionnaires, the researcher should consult the validity of items against each of the constructs or variables and accordingly modify measurement instruments on the basis of SME's opinion. \n\nA test has content validity built into it by careful selection of which items to include (Anastasi & Urbina, 1997). Items are chosen so that they comply with the test specification which is drawn up through a thorough examination of the subject domain. Foxcroft, Paterson, le Roux & Herbst (2004, p. 49) note that by using a panel of experts to review the test specifications and the selection of items the content validity of a test can be improved. The experts will be able to review the items and comment on whether the items cover a representative sample of the behavior domain.\n\nFace validity is an estimate of whether a test appears to measure a certain criterion; it does not guarantee that the test actually measures phenomena in that domain. Measures may have high validity, but when the test does not appear to be measuring what it is, it has low face validity. Indeed, when a test is subject to faking (malingering), low face validity might make the test more valid. Considering one may get more honest answers with lower face validity, it is sometimes important to make it appear as though there is low face validity whilst administering the measures.\n\nFace validity is very closely related to content validity. While content validity depends on a theoretical basis for assuming if a test is assessing all domains of a certain criterion (e.g. does assessing addition skills yield in a good measure for mathematical skills? To answer this you have to know, what different kinds of arithmetic skills mathematical skills include) face validity relates to whether a test appears to be a good measure or not. This judgment is made on the \"face\" of the test, thus it can also be judged by the amateur.\n\nFace validity is a starting point, but should never be assumed to be probably valid for any given purpose, as the \"experts\" have been wrong before—the Malleus Malificarum (Hammer of Witches) had no support for its conclusions other than the self-imagined competence of two \"experts\" in \"witchcraft detection,\" yet it was used as a \"test\" to condemn and burn at the stake tens of thousands men and women as \"witches.\"\n\nCriterion validity evidence involves the correlation between the test and a criterion variable (or variables) taken as representative of the construct. In other words, it compares the test with other measures or outcomes (the criteria) already held to be valid. For example, employee selection tests are often validated against measures of job performance (the criterion), and IQ tests are often validated against measures of academic performance (the criterion).\n\nIf the test data and criterion data are collected at the same time, this is referred to as concurrent validity evidence. If the test data are collected first in order to predict criterion data collected at a later point in time, then this is referred to as predictive validity evidence.\n\nConcurrent validity refers to the degree to which the operationalization correlates with other measures of the same construct that are measured at the same time. When the measure is compared to another measure of the same type, they will be related (or correlated). Returning to the selection test example, this would mean that the tests are administered to current employees and then correlated with their scores on performance reviews.\n\nPredictive validity refers to the degree to which the operationalization can predict (or correlate with) other measures of the same construct that are measured at some time in the future. Again, with the selection test example, this would mean that the tests are administered to applicants, all applicants are hired, their performance is reviewed at a later time, and then their scores on the two measures are correlated.\n\nThis is also when measurement predicts a relationship between what is measured and something else; predicting whether or not the other thing will happen in the future. High correlation between ex-ante predicted and ex-post actual outcomes is the strongest proof of validity.\n\nThe validity of the design of experimental research studies is a fundamental part of the scientific method, and a concern of research ethics. Without a valid design, valid scientific conclusions cannot be drawn.\n\nStatistical conclusion validity is the degree to which conclusions about the relationship among variables based on the data are correct or ‘reasonable’. This began as being solely about whether the statistical conclusion about the relationship of the variables was correct, but now there is a movement towards moving to ‘reasonable’ conclusions that use: quantitative, statistical, and qualitative data.\n\nStatistical conclusion validity involves ensuring the use of adequate sampling procedures, appropriate statistical tests, and reliable measurement procedures. As this type of validity is concerned solely with the relationship that is found among variables, the relationship may be solely a correlation.\n\nInternal validity is an inductive estimate of the degree to which conclusions about \"causal\" relationships can be made (e.g. cause and effect), based on the measures used, the research setting, and the whole research design. Good experimental techniques, in which the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable is studied under highly controlled conditions, usually allow for higher degrees of internal validity than, for example, single-case designs.\n\nEight kinds of confounding variable can interfere with internal validity (i.e. with the attempt to isolate causal relationships):\n\n\nExternal validity concerns the extent to which the (internally valid) results of a study can be held to be true for other cases, for example to different people, places or times. In other words, it is about whether findings can be validly generalized. If the same research study was conducted in those other cases, would it get the same results?\n\nA major factor in this is whether the study sample (e.g. the research participants) are representative of the general population along relevant dimensions. Other factors jeopardizing external validity are:\n\n\nEcological validity is the extent to which research results can be applied to real-life situations outside of research settings. This issue is closely related to external validity but covers the question of to what degree experimental findings mirror what can be observed in the real world (ecology = the science of interaction between organism and its environment). To be ecologically valid, the methods, materials and setting of a study must approximate the real-life situation that is under investigation.\n\nEcological validity is partly related to the issue of experiment versus observation. Typically in science, there are two domains of research: observational (passive) and experimental (active). The purpose of experimental designs is to test causality, so that you can infer A causes B or B causes A. But sometimes, ethical and/or methological restrictions prevent you from conducting an experiment (e.g. how does isolation influence a child's cognitive functioning?). Then you can still do research, but it is not causal, it is correlational. You can only conclude that A occurs together with B. Both techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOn first glance, internal and external validity seem to contradict each other – to get an experimental design you have to control for all interfering variables. That is why you often conduct your experiment in a laboratory setting. While gaining internal validity (excluding interfering variables by keeping them constant) you lose ecological or external validity because you establish an artificial laboratory setting. On the other hand, with observational research you can not control for interfering variables (low internal validity) but you can measure in the natural (ecological) environment, at the place where behavior normally occurs. However, in doing so, you sacrifice internal validity.\n\nThe apparent contradiction of internal validity and external validity is, however, only superficial. The question of whether results from a particular study generalize to other people, places or times arises only when one follows an inductivist research strategy. If the goal of a study is to deductively test a theory, one is only concerned with factors which might undermine the rigor of the study, i.e. threats to internal validity.\n\nIn psychiatry there is a particular issue with assessing the validity of the diagnostic categories themselves. In this context:\n\nRobins and Guze proposed in 1970 what were to become influential formal criteria for establishing the validity of psychiatric diagnoses. They listed five criteria:\n\nThese were incorporated into the Feighner Criteria and Research Diagnostic Criteria that have since formed the basis of the DSM and ICD classification systems.\n\nKendler in 1980 distinguished between:\n\n\nNancy Andreasen (1995) listed several additional validators – molecular genetics and molecular biology, neurochemistry, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and cognitive neuroscience – that are all potentially capable of linking symptoms and diagnoses to their neural substrates.\n\nKendell and Jablinsky (2003) emphasized the importance of distinguishing between validity and utility, and argued that diagnostic categories defined by their syndromes should be regarded as valid only if they have been shown to be discrete entities with natural boundaries that separate them from other disorders.\n\nKendler (2006) emphasized that to be useful, a validating criterion must be sensitive enough to validate most syndromes that are true disorders, while also being specific enough to invalidate most syndromes that are not true disorders. On this basis, he argues that a Robins and Guze criterion of \"runs in the family\" is inadequately specific because most human psychological and physical traits would qualify - for example, an arbitrary syndrome comprising a mixture of \"height over 6 ft, red hair, and a large nose\" will be found to \"run in families\" and be \"hereditary\", but this should not be considered evidence that it is a disorder. Kendler has further suggested that \"essentialist\" gene models of psychiatric disorders, and the hope that we will be able to validate categorical psychiatric diagnoses by \"carving nature at its joints\" solely as a result of gene discovery, are implausible.\n\nIn the United States Federal Court System validity and reliability of evidence is evaluated using the Daubert Standard: see Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. Perri and Lichtenwald (2010) provide a starting point for a discussion about a wide range of reliability and validity topics in their analysis of a wrongful murder conviction.\n\n"}
