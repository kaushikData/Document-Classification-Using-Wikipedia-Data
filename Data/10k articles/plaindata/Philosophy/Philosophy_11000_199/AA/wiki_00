Gordon\n\nAaron David Gordon (; 9 June 1856 – 22 February 1922), more commonly known as A. D. Gordon, was a Zionist ideologue and the spiritual force behind practical Zionism and Labor Zionism. He founded Hapoel Hatzair, a movement that set the tone for the Zionist movement for many years to come. Influenced by Leo Tolstoy and others, it is said that in effect he made a religion of labor. However, he himself wrote in 1920, \"Surely in our day it is possible to live without religion.\"\n\nGordon was the only child of a well-to-do family of Orthodox Jews. He was self-educated in both religious and general studies, and spoke several languages. For thirty years, he managed an estate, where he proved to be a charismatic educator and community activist. Gordon married his cousin, Faige Tartakov, at a young age and had seven children with her, though only two of them survived.\n\nGordon was an early member of the Hibbat Zion movement and made \"aliyah\" to Ottoman Palestine in 1904, when he was 48, after being persuaded by his wife not to emigrate to America. His daughter Yael followed him in 1908 and his wife about a year later, but his son stayed behind to continue his religious studieshe seems to have refused to accompany his father because of differences in their religious outlooks. Four months after she arrived in the country, his wife became ill and died. Gordon lived in Petah Tikva and Rishon LeZion, before finally settling in the Galilee in 1919. He lived simply and supported himself as a hired agricultural hand, while writing his emerging philosophy at night. Although he participated in the Zionist Congress of 1911, Gordon refused to become involved in any of the Zionist political parties, out of principle.\n\nGordon believed that all of Jewish suffering could be traced to the parasitic state of Jews in the Diaspora, who were unable to participate in creative labor. To remedy this, he sought to promote physical labor and agriculture as a means of uplifting Jews spiritually. It was the experience of labor, he believed, that linked the individual to the hidden aspects of nature and being, which, in turn were the source of vision, poetry, and the spiritual life. Furthermore, he also believed that working the land was a sacred task, not only for the individual but for the entire Jewish people. Agriculture would unite the people with the land and justify its continued existence there. In his own words: \"The Land of Israel is acquired through labor, not through fire and not through blood.\" Return to the soil would transform the Jewish people and allow its rejuvenation, according to his philosophy. A.D. Gordon elaborated on these themes, writing: \n\nThe Jewish people has been completely cut off from nature and imprisoned within city walls for two thousand years. We have been accustomed to every form of life, except a life of labor- of labor done at our behalf and for its own sake. It will require the greatest effort of will for such a people to become normal again. We lack the principal ingredient for national life. We lack the habit of labor… for it is labor which binds a people to its soil and to its national culture, which in its turn is an outgrowth of the people's toil and the people's labor. ... We, the Jews, were the first in history to say: \"For all the nations shall go each in the name of its God\" and \"Nations shall not lift up sword against nation\" - and then we proceed to cease being a nation ourselves. \n\nAs we now come to re-establish our path among the ways of living nations of the earth, we must make sure that we find the right path. We must create a new people, a human people whose attitude toward other peoples is informed with the sense of human brotherhood and whose attitude toward nature and all within it is inspired by noble urges of life-loving creativity. All the forces of our history, all the pain that has accumulated in our national soul, seem to impel us in that direction... we are engaged in a creative endeavor the like of which is itself not to be found in the whole history of mankind: the rebirth and rehabilitation of a people that has been uprooted and scattered to the winds...\" (A.D. Gordon, \"Our Tasks Ahead\" 1920)\n\nGordon perceived nature as an organic unity. He preferred organic bonds in society, like those of family, community and nation, over \"mechanical\" bonds, like those of state, party and class. Jewish individuals were cut off from their nation, living in Diaspora, they were cut off from direct contact with nature; they were cut off from the experience of sanctity, and the existential bond with the infinite. Gordon wrote:\n\n[W]e are a parasitic people. We have no roots in the soil, there is no ground beneath our feet. And we are parasites not only in an economic sense, but in spirit, in thought, in poetry, in literature, and in our virtues, our ideals, our higher human aspirations. Every alien movement sweeps us along, every wind in the world carries us. We in ourselves are almost non-existent, so of course we are nothing in the eyes of other people either\"\n\nMore than just a theoretician, he insisted on putting this philosophy into practice, and refused to take any clerical position that was offered to him. He was an elderly intellectual of no great physical strength and with no experience doing manual labor, but he took up the hoe and worked in the fields, always focusing on the aesthetics of his work. He served as a model of the pioneering spirit, descending to the people and remaining with them no matter what the consequences were. He experienced the problems faced by the working class, suffering from malaria, poverty, and unemployment. But he did have admirers and followers who turned to him for advice and help. \n\nGordon had always been a principled individual—even as a young man he refused to allow his parents to pay the customary bribe so that he would be exempted from military service, arguing that if he did not serve, someone else would have to serve instead of him. In the end, he spent six months in the army, but was released when it was discovered that he was not in good enough physical shape. He later refused to accept payment for his articles or the classes he taught, citing the Mishnah that states \"Do not turn the Torah into a source of income.\" At the same time, he did not lapse into dogmatism either. When Rachel the Poet asked his opinion about whether she should go overseas to study, an idea that was anathema to most of the Zionist leadership, he encouraged her to do so.\n\nAlthough formerly an Orthodox Jew, Gordon rejected religion later in his life. Students of his writings have found that Gordon was greatly influenced by Russian author Leo Tolstoy, as well as by the Hassidic movement and Kabbalah. Many have also found parallels between his ideas and those of his contemporary, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the spiritual father of Religious Zionism.\n\nCentral to Gordon's philosophy is the idea that the cosmos is a unity. This notion in which man and nature are one and all men are organic parts of the cosmos is reflected throughout his thought, including political issues, the role of women in the modern world, and Jewish attitude to the Arabs. He believed the central test for the reborn Jewish nation would be the attitude of the Jews to the Arabs. The Biblical principle regarding \"the stranger that sojourns in thy midst\" guided his thought on this matter. In his statutes for labor settlements, which he drew up in 1922, Gordon included a clause that said that land should be assigned to Arabs wherever new settlements were founded, to ensure their welfare. He believed that this principle of good neighborliness should be undertaken for moral reasons rather than tactical advantage, and that it would eventually lead to a spirit of universal human solidarity. A summary of his thinking on Jewish-Arab relations can be found in his work \"Mibachutz\", where he wrote: \n\"Our relations to the Arabs must rest on cosmic foundations. Our attitude toward them must be one of humanity, of moral courage which remains on the highest plane, even if the behavior of the other side is not all that is desired. Indeed their hostility is all the more a reason for our humanity.\"\n\nGordon's moods alternated between enormous frustration and great hope for the future. He believed that an idealistic new generation of creative Jews would emerge in the Land of Israel, with a high sense of morals, a deep spiritual commitment, and a commitment to their fellow human beings. Toward the end of his life, however, he preferred to isolate himself in Nature. From a letter he wrote to Rachel the Poet, it seems that he grew more and more frustrated with people's petty squabbles and selfish interests.\n\nHe founded and led Hapoel Hatzair (\"The Young Worker\"), a non-Marxist, Zionist movement, as opposed to the Poale Zion movement which was more Marxist in orientation and associated with Ber Borochov and Nahum Syrkin.\n\nGordonia, a Zionist youth movement, was created to put Gordon's teachings into practice, established several kibbutzim in Israel. Gordon died of throat cancer on Kibbutz Degania Alef at the age of 66.\n\n\n"}

He is an expert in international public law and philosophy of law.\n\nIn 1989, Ellian came to the Netherlands as a political refugee.\nHaving experienced first-hand the Islamic theocratic government of Iran, he writes often about how such issues are affecting the world in general and the Netherlands in particular. Due to threats on his life tied to such criticism, he is currently heavily guarded.\n\nEllian grew up in Iran. As a youngster, he learned the profession of journalism with one of the most prominent journalists of Iran. He was a freelance journalist for Iranian political magazines aimed at youth. During the Iranian Revolution 1978-1979 he became, like many youngsters of his age, a supporter of the Fedayan-e Khalq-e Iran. After the revolution, however, there came a split in this party. Many followers become adherents of either the majority branch of this party or supporters of the Tudeh Party of Iran. Ellian became both a member of the Tudeh Party of Iran and active with the Youth Organization of Tudeh Party of Iran. It is worth noting that the Islamic regime prohibited and suppressed all political parties and activities which were not aligned with it after the Revolution. This meant that also Ellian was in danger of being arrested which, hence, led him to go underground and finally to escape the country. He decided to escape to Pakistan.\nHowever, there he still faced extradition back to Iran thus shortly afterwards he fled to Afghanistan where already a community of intellectuals and activists from Iran had gathered. There he met Siavash Kasraie who was also a member of the Tudeh Party of Iran and from whom he learned poetry. Besides he studied medicine for few years in the capital, Kabul. \nSlowly on an ideological struggle occurred between him and the leaders of the Tudeh Party in Kabul who were, in Ellian’s point of view, Stalinist figures which was reason enough for him and few of his friends to break up with the Tudeh Party of Iran. In the fall of 1987, he decided to seek asylum with the Permanent Representative of the United Nations in Kabul whereupon, in 1989, he was invited to come to the Netherlands and was flown out of the country by the United Nations together with other dissidents who were also in danger.\n\nIan Buruma, among others, accuses Ellian of misrepresentation. On the other hand, Ibn Warraq asserts “Buruma gets these basic facts upside down. Ellian never misrepresented his identity or his past, nor did he arrive in the Netherlands under false pretenses”. Spuriousness of such allegations is, for instance, also asserted by others like J. Hoeksma who, as part of the legal staff of the Dutch representation of the UNHCR at the time, also confirms the opposite of the aforementioned allegations. The same grievances have been brought to the fore by, among others, Ellian himself and Frits Bolkestein due to which Buruma was, together with his publisher “Publishing House Penguin”, forced to make many changes and removals in later editions of his book. Other prominent persons defending the truthfulness of Ellian’s case include the Nobel Prize winner of Literature Mario Vargas Llosa.\n\nIn the Netherlands Ellian started his studies of law at the Catholic University of Brabant (now the University of Tilburg). In 1996, he graduated with a degree in international public law, criminal law, and philosophy. He remained in Brabant as a researcher until he found a position with the \"Amsterdam Center for International Law\", of the University of Amsterdam. He obtained a PhD from the University of Tilburg in 2003, The title of his doctoral dissertation is: \"A Investigation into the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa\". In this research he focused on the political transition sparked by the South-African Truth and Reconciliation Commission; questions pertaining to both international criminal law and legal philosophy. Central in his research stood the question: “why did the South Africans opt for a tribunal and the possibility of amnesty instead of a criminal tribunal that could try and punish the crimes of the past?”. It is worth to bring to attention for those who are interested in this topic that a further reading on this can be found in a later academic book wherein he has contributed by means of his article titled “Political Transition to a Democratic Regime: The South African Echoes of Forgiveness, Truth Commission and Negotiating Justice”. In his aforementioned research, he concluded that the commission was an acceptable tribunal worthy of international respect. In 2003 he became an associated professor of jurisprudence, and since 2005 he is a full professor at the law faculty of the University of Leiden. Since 2012 he is the academic director of the Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of the Law at the law faculty of Leiden.\nEllian was a regular columnist for \"NRC Handelsblad\", and makes appearances on political discussion programs on Dutch television. Ellian writes articles for the magazine Elsevier but also for international magazines and newspapers such as Wall Street Journal, Le Monde, and Le Figaro.\n\nFollowing the 2009 Iranian presidential election, Ellian wrote an open letter to Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran. The letter was published by German magazine Der Spiegel, Le Monde, the Wall Street Journal, and Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad. Der Spiegel subtitled the letter \"Your Regime Is Finished\" (not a direct quote from Ellian), while NRC Handelsblad subtitled it \"The children of the revolution will accept the ayatollah's rule no more\".\nIt is inevitable to bear in mind that Afshin Ellian is also a prominent defender of the Freedom of Speech. For the most recent publication reference can be made to the book “The State of Exception and Militant Democracy in a Time of Terror”.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13018310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13018310", "title": "Argument", "text": "Argument\n\nIn logic and philosophy, an argument is a series of statements (in a natural language), called the premises or premisses (both spellings are acceptable) intended to determine the degree of truth of another statement, the conclusion. The logical form of an argument in a natural language can be represented in a symbolic formal language, and independently of natural language formally defined \"arguments\" can be made in math and computer science.\n\nLogic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments. Deductive arguments can be valid or sound: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if one or more of the premisses is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premisses necessitate a true conclusion. Inductive arguments, by contrast, can have different degrees of logical strength: the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability. The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth—for example, the persuasiveness of so-called \"indispensability claims\" in transcendental arguments, the quality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.\n\nThe Latin root \"arguere\" (to make bright, enlighten, make known, prove, etc.) is from Proto-Indo-European \"argu-yo-\", suffixed form of \"arg-\" (to shine; white).\n\nInformal arguments as studied in \"informal logic\", are presented in ordinary language and are intended for everyday discourse. Conversely, formal arguments are studied in \"formal logic\" (historically called \"symbolic logic\", more commonly referred to as \"mathematical logic\" today) and are expressed in a formal language. Informal logic may be said to emphasize the study of argumentation, whereas formal logic emphasizes implication and inference. Informal arguments are sometimes implicit. That is, the rational structure – the relationship of claims, premises, warrants, relations of implication, and conclusion – is not always spelled out and immediately visible and must sometimes be made explicit by analysis.\n\nThere are several kinds of arguments in logic, the best-known of which are \"deductive\" and \"inductive.\" An argument has one or more premises but only one conclusion. Each premise and the conclusion are truth bearers or \"truth-candidates\", each capable of being either true or false (but not both). These truth values bear on the terminology used with arguments.\n\n\n\nA \"deductive argument\" is one that, if valid, has a conclusion that is entailed by its premises. In other words, the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises—if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny the conclusion, because the negation of the conclusion is contradictory to the truth of the premises.\n\nDeductive arguments may be either valid or invalid. If an argument is valid, it is a valid deduction, and if its premises are true, the conclusion must be true: a valid argument cannot have true premises and a false conclusion.\n\nAn argument is formally valid if and only if the denial of the conclusion is incompatible with accepting all the premises.\n\nThe validity of an argument depends, however, not on the actual truth or falsity of its premises and conclusion, but solely on whether or not the argument has a valid logical form. The validity of an argument is not a guarantee of the truth of its conclusion. Under a given interpretation, a valid argument may have false premises that render it inconclusive: the conclusion of a valid argument with one or more false premises may be either true or false.\n\nLogic seeks to discover the valid forms, the forms that make arguments valid. A form of argument is valid if and only if the conclusion is true under all interpretations of that argument in which the premises are true. Since the validity of an argument depends solely on its form, an argument can be shown to be invalid by showing that its form is invalid. This can be done by giving a counter example of the same form of argument with premises that are true under a given interpretation, but a conclusion that is false under that interpretation. In informal logic this is called a counter argument.\n\nThe form of argument can be shown by the use of symbols. For each argument form, there is a corresponding statement form, called a corresponding conditional, and an argument form is valid if and only if its corresponding conditional is a logical truth. A statement form which is logically true is also said to be a valid statement form. A statement form is a logical truth if it is true under all interpretations. A statement form can be shown to be a logical truth by either (a) showing that it is a tautology or (b) by means of a proof procedure.\n\nThe corresponding conditional of a valid argument is a necessary truth (true \"in all possible worlds\") and so the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, or follows of logical necessity. The conclusion of a valid argument is not necessarily true, it depends on whether the premises are true. If the conclusion, itself, just so happens to be a necessary truth, it is so without regard to the premises.\n\nSome examples:\n\nIn the above second to last case (Some men are hawkers...), the counter-example follows the same logical form as the previous argument, (Premise 1: \"Some \"X\" are \"Y\".\" Premise 2: \"Some \"Y\" are \"Z\".\" Conclusion: \"Some \"X\" are \"Z\".\") in order to demonstrate that whatever hawkers may be, they may or may not be rich, in consideration of the premises as such. \"(See also, existential import).\"\n\nThe forms of argument that render deductions valid are well-established, however some invalid arguments can also be persuasive depending on their construction (inductive arguments, for example). \"(See also, formal fallacy and informal fallacy).\"\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose conclusion follows from its premise(s), and the premise(s) of which is/are true.\n\nNon-deductive logic is reasoning using arguments in which the premises support the conclusion but do not entail it. Forms of non-deductive logic include the statistical syllogism, which argues from generalizations true for the most part, and induction, a form of reasoning that makes generalizations based on individual instances. An inductive argument is said to be \"cogent\" if and only if the truth of the argument's premises would render the truth of the conclusion probable (i.e., the argument is \"strong\"), and the argument's premises are, in fact, true. Cogency can be considered inductive logic's analogue to deductive logic's \"soundness.\" Despite its name, mathematical induction is not a form of inductive reasoning. The lack of deductive validity is known as the problem of induction.\n\nIn modern argumentation theories, arguments are regarded as defeasible passages from premises to a conclusion. Defeasibility means that when additional information (new evidence or contrary arguments) is provided, the premises may be no longer lead to the conclusion (non-monotonic reasoning). This type of reasoning is referred to as defeasible reasoning. For instance we consider the famous Tweedy example: \nThis argument is reasonable and the premises support the conclusion unless additional information indicating that the case is an exception comes in. If Tweedy is a penguin, the inference is no longer justified by the premise. Defeasible arguments are based on generalizations that hold only in the majority of cases, but are subject to exceptions and defaults.\nIn order to represent and assess defeasible reasoning, it is necessary to combine the logical rules (governing the acceptance of a conclusion based on the acceptance of its premises) with rules of material inference, governing how a premise can support a given conclusion (whether it is reasonable or not to draw a specific conclusion from a specific description of a state of affairs). Argumentation schemes have been developed to describe and assess the acceptability or the fallaciousness of defeasible arguments. \nArgumentation schemes are stereotypical patterns of inference, combining semantic-ontological relations with types of reasoning and logical axioms and representing the abstract structure of the most common types of natural arguments. The argumentation schemes provided in (Walton, Reed & Macagno, 2008) describe tentatively the patterns of the most typical arguments. However, the two levels of abstraction are not distinguished. For this reason, under the label of “argumentation schemes” fall indistinctly patterns of reasoning such as the abductive, analogical, or inductive ones, and types of argument such as the ones from classification or cause to effect.\nA typical example is the argument from expert opinion, which has two premises and a conclusion.\n\nEach scheme is associated to a set of critical questions, namely criteria for assessing dialectically the reasonableness and acceptability of an argument. The matching critical questions are the standard ways of casting the argument into doubt.\n\nIf an expert says that a proposition is true, this provides a reason for tentatively accepting it, in the absence of stronger reasons to doubt it. But suppose that evidence of financial gain suggests that the expert is biased, for example by evidence showing that he will gain financially from his claim.\n\nArgument by analogy may be thought of as argument from the particular to particular. An argument by analogy may use a particular truth in a premise to argue towards a similar particular truth in the conclusion. For example, if A. Plato was mortal, and B. Socrates was like Plato in other respects, then asserting that C. Socrates was mortal is an example of argument by analogy because the reasoning employed in it proceeds from a particular truth in a premise (Plato was mortal) to a similar particular truth in the conclusion, namely that Socrates was mortal.\n\nOther kinds of arguments may have different or additional standards of validity or justification. For example, Charles Taylor writes that so-called transcendental arguments are made up of a \"chain of indispensability claims\" that attempt to show why something is necessarily true based on its connection to our experience, while Nikolas Kompridis has suggested that there are two types of \"fallible\" arguments: one based on truth claims, and the other based on the time-responsive disclosure of possibility (see world disclosure). The late French philosopher Michel Foucault is said to have been a prominent advocate of this latter form of philosophical argument.\n\nArgument is an informal calculus, relating an effort to be performed or sum to be spent, to possible future gain, either economic or moral. In informal logic, an argument is a connection between\n\nEx :\n</ol>\n\nThe argument is neither a) \"advice\" nor b) \"moral or economical judgement\", but the connection between the two. \nAn argument always uses the connective because. \nAn argument is not an explanation. It does not connect two events, cause and effect, which already took place, but a possible individual action and its beneficial outcome. \nAn argument is not a proof. A proof is a logical and cognitive concept; an argument is a praxeologic concept. A proof changes our knowledge; an argument compels us to act.\n\nArgument does not belong to logic, because it is connected to a real person, a real event, and a real effort to be made.\n\nThe value of the argument is connected to the immediate circumstances of the person spoken to. \nIf, in the first case,(1) John has no money, or knows he has only one year to live, he will not be interested in buying the stock. If, in the second case (2) she is too heavy, or too old, she will not be interested in studying and becoming a dancer. The argument is not logical, but profitable.\n\nWorld-disclosing arguments are a group of philosophical arguments that are said to employ a disclosive approach, to reveal features of a wider ontological or cultural-linguistic understanding – a \"world,\" in a specifically ontological sense – in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and \"logical space\" on which an argument implicitly depends.\n\nWhile arguments attempt to show that something was, is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try to show \"why\" or \"how\" something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of \"whether\" or not Fred's cat has fleas, Joe may state: \"Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe, the cat is scratching right now.\" Joe has made an \"argument that\" the cat has fleas. However, if Joe asks Fred, \"Why is your cat scratching itself?\" the explanation, \"...because it has fleas.\" provides understanding.\n\nBoth the above argument and explanation require knowing the generalities that a) fleas often cause itching, and b) that one often scratches to relieve itching. The difference is in the intent: an argument attempts to settle whether or not some claim is true, and an explanation attempts to provide understanding of the event. Note, that by subsuming the specific event (of Fred's cat scratching) as an instance of the general rule that \"animals scratch themselves when they have fleas\", Joe will no longer wonder \"why\" Fred's cat is scratching itself. Arguments address problems of belief, explanations address problems of understanding. Also note that in the argument above, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is up for debate (i.e. is a claim), but in the explanation, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is assumed to be true (unquestioned at this time) and just needs \"explaining\".\n\nArguments and explanations largely resemble each other in rhetorical use. This is the cause of much difficulty in thinking critically about claims. There are several reasons for this difficulty.\n\n\nExplanations and arguments are often studied in the field of Information Systems to help explain user acceptance of knowledge-based systems. Certain argument types may fit better with personality traits to enhance acceptance by individuals.\n\nFallacies are types of argument or expressions which are held to be of an invalid form or contain errors in reasoning. There is not as yet any general theory of fallacy or strong agreement among researchers of their definition or potential for application but the term is broadly applicable as a label to certain examples of error, and also variously applied to ambiguous candidates.\n\nIn Logic types of fallacy are firmly described thus:\nFirst the premises and the conclusion must be statements, capable of being true or false. Secondly it must be asserted that the conclusion follows from the premises. In English the words \"therefore\", \"so\", \"because\" and \"hence\" typically separate the premises from the conclusion of an argument, but this is not necessarily so. Thus: \"Socrates is a man, all men are mortal therefore Socrates is mortal\" is clearly an argument (a valid one at that), because it is clear it is asserted that \"Socrates is mortal\" follows from the preceding statements. However \"I was thirsty and therefore I drank\" is NOT an argument, despite its appearance. It is not being claimed that \"I drank\" is logically entailed by \"I was thirsty\". The \"therefore\" in this sentence indicates \"for that reason\" not \"it follows that\".\n\n\nOften an argument is invalid because there is a missing premise—the supply of which would render it valid. Speakers and writers will often leave out a strictly necessary premise in their reasonings if it is widely accepted and the writer does not wish to state the blindingly obvious. Example: \"All metals expand when heated, therefore iron will expand when heated.\" (Missing premise: iron is a metal). On the other hand, a seemingly valid argument may be found to lack a premise – a 'hidden assumption' – which if highlighted can show a fault in reasoning. Example: A witness reasoned: \"Nobody came out the front door except the milkman; therefore the murderer must have left by the back door.\" (Hidden assumptions- the milkman was not the murderer, and the murderer has left by the front or back door).\n\n\n\n"}

You probably don't want to hear that the people doing them had to find something to occupy themselves after they dissolved the backbone cabal.\n\nBIFF served as a satire of an exceptional behaviour in a fairly homogeneous environment.\n\nThe explosive growth of the web led to the rapid decline of BIFF, as Biffisms became no longer exceptional and the Internet rapidly became a much larger and much more heterogeneous environment, leading both to newcomers not being aware of BIFF's existence and to BIFF becoming less contrasting as an exception in the increasingly \"noisy\" Internet.\n\nThis was posted on the Usenet Oracle mailing list digest 775-06:\n\nB1ff also became the name of a type of internet slang that was created in the early days of the Internet by groups who felt they were being watched by government officials or corporations. This was a major step towards full 1337 (Leet); however, they originally had different purposes. B1ff only changes words only enough so a program looking for certain words doesn't find them, whereas 1337 was created to prevent non-1337 humans from reading text.\n\nDuring the early days of internet gaming, a new side of b1ff took a significant rise, when scripts edited the content of instant chat conversations. Today, however, most censoring scripts can compensate for the letter-number replacement. Thus, b1ff has mainly evolved into 1337, a more involved language which, although it does include letter-number replacement, also includes letter mixing (e.g. \"pr0n\"), similar-sound substitution (e.g. \"h4xx\" for \"hack\"), 'building' a letter from multiple characters (e.g. x from ><), and the invention of new words as a substitute for common words.\n\nIn the sense of caricaturing the prototypical pre-adolescent or over-self-confident noob on the Internet, b1ff's legacy lives on, in practice if not in name.\n\nBeyond apparently inspiring the naming and style of the precursor to leet, b1ffisms continue to be seen today in many Internet forums and comment threads, both in direct posts and in deliberate ironic imitation. Every Internet user who has used leetspeek ironically (\"the ph34r!\") or mocked pre-teen gamers or IRCers (\"OMG WTF!!!1eleven11 kthxbye\") is essentially using a modernised b1ff. b1ff, like Eliza Doolittle, appears to be a specifically created yet immediately classic shibboleth of some fundamental human behaviour, on the part of both the parodied and the parodying.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "175838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175838", "title": "Divine simplicity", "text": "Divine simplicity\n\nIn theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts. The general idea can be stated in this way: the being of God is identical to the \"attributes\" of God. Characteristics such as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a substance; in other words we can say that in God both essence and existence are one and the same.\n\nVarieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism, although the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' \"Enneads\" as the Simplex.\n\nIn Jewish philosophy and in Jewish mysticism divine simplicity is addressed via discussion of the attributes () of God, particularly by Jewish philosophers within the Muslim sphere of influence such as Saadia Gaon, Bahya ibn Paquda, Yehuda Halevi, and Maimonides, as well by Raabad III in Provence. A classic expression of this position is found in Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed,\nAccording to Maimonides, then, there can be no plurality of faculties, moral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. Even to say that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce plurality, if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes. Maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that God's power is greater than ours, that God's life is more permanent than ours, or that God's knowledge is broader than ours. Maimonedes believed that statements such as \"God lives\" or \"God is powerful\" are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion, but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations. Still, Maimonedes also believed that negation is objectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity: God is neither this nor that, and ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us. Citing Psalm 65, Maimonides concludes that the highest form of praise we can give God is silence.\n\nSome identify divine simplicity as a corollary of Divine Creation: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\" (Genesis 1:1). God, as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property (and hence an absolute unity); see Negative theology.\n\nFor others, conversely, the axiom of Divine Unity (see \"Shema Yisrael\") informs the understanding of divine simplicity. Bahya ibn Paquda (\"Duties of the Heart\" 1:8) points out that God's Oneness is \"true oneness\" (האחד האמת) as opposed to merely \"circumstantial oneness\" (האחד המקרי). He develops this idea to show that an entity which is truly one must be free of properties and thus indescribable – and unlike anything else. (Additionally such an entity would be absolutely unsubject to change, as well as utterly independent and the root of everything.) \n\nThe implication – of either approach – is so strong that the two concepts are often presented as synonymous: \"God is not two or more entities, but a single entity of a oneness even more single and unique than any single thing in creation… He cannot be sub-divided into different parts — therefore, it is impossible for Him to be anything other than one. It is a positive commandment to know this, for it is written (Deuteronomy 6:4) '…the Lord is our God, the Lord is one'.\" (Maimonides, \"Mishneh Torah\", \"Mada\" 1:7.)\n\nDespite its apparent simplicity, this concept is recognised as raising many difficulties. In particular, insofar as God's simplicity does not allow for any structure — even conceptually — divine simplicity appears to entail the following dichotomy.\n\n\nThe resultant paradox is famously articulated by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (\"Derekh Hashem\" I:1:5), describing the dichotomy as arising out of our inability to comprehend the idea of absolute unity:\nThe Kabbalists address this paradox by explaining that “God created a spiritual dimension… [through which God] interacts with the Universe... It is this dimension which makes it possible for us to speak of God’s multifaceted relationship to the universe without violating the basic principle of His unity and simplicity” (Aryeh Kaplan, \"Innerspace\"). The Kabbalistic approach is explained in various Chassidic writings; see for example, \"Shaar Hayichud\", below, for a detailed discussion.\n\nIn Western Christian classical theism, God is \"simple\", not \"composite\", not \"made up of thing upon thing\". Thomas Morris notes that divine simplicity can mean any or all of three different claims:\n\n\nIn other words, property simplicity (or metaphysical simplicity) states that the characteristics of God are not parts of God that together make up God. God is simple; God is those characteristics. For example, God does not \"have\" goodness but simply \"is\" goodness. \n\n\"Spatial simplicity\" is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional Christian theists (who do not consider God to be a physical object). \"Temporal simplicity\" is endorsed by many theists but is highly controversial among Christian theologians. Morris describes \"Property simplicity\" as the property of having no properties, and this area is more controversial still.\n\nIn the medieval era, theologians and philosophers held to a view called \"constituent ontology\" whereby natures were actual constituents of things. Following Aquinas, an individual nature was more like a concrete object than an abstract object. Thus, one person's humanity was not, in this sense, the same as another person's humanity; each had his own individual human nature which was individuated by the matter (\"materia signata\") out of which each man was composed. For entities which are immaterial such as angels, there is no matter to individuate their natures, so each one just is its nature. Each angel is therefore literally one of a kind, although, this claim proved controversial.\n\nTheologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of God by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it. Thus, in quantitative or spatial terms, God is simple as opposed to being made up of pieces, present in entirety everywhere, if in fact present anywhere. In terms of essences, God is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter, or body and soul, or mind and act, and so on. If distinctions are made when speaking of God's attributes, they are distinctions of the \"modes\" of God's being, rather than \"real\" or \"essential\" divisions. And so, in terms of subjects and accidents, as in the phrase \"goodness of God\", divine simplicity allows that there is a conceptual distinction between the person of God and the personal attribute of goodness, but the doctrine disallows that God's identity or \"character\" is dependent upon goodness, and at the same time the doctrine dictates that it is impossible to consider the goodness in which God participates separately from the goodness which God is.\n\nFurthermore, according to some , as creatures our concepts are all drawn from the creation (the assumption of empiricism); it follows from this and divine simplicity that God's attributes can only be spoken of by analogy, since it is not true of any created thing that its properties are identical to its being. Consequently, when Christian Scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity, when it says that God is good for example, it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech. God's essence is inexpressible; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to God who simply \"is\" goodness, because humanity is a complex being composed by God \"in the image and likeness of God.\"\n\nThe doctrine has been criticized by many Christian theologians, including John S. Feinberg, Thomas Morris, William Lane Craig, and Alvin Plantinga, who in his essay \"Does God Have a Nature?\" calls it \"a dark saying indeed.\" Plantinga gives three arguments against divine simplicity. First, he argues our concepts can apply univocally to God, even if our language to describe God is limited, fragmentary, halting, and inchoate. He argues that when we have a concept of something like being a horse, we know what it is for something to be a horse. The concept applies to an object if that object is, in fact, a horse. If none of our concepts apply to God, then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as God, and yet God does not have properties such as wisdom, being the creator, and being almighty. In fact, God would not have any properties for which we have concepts. God would not even have properties such as existing, being self-identical, or even being the referent of the term 'God.' If God transcends human experience, then we cannot say something univocal about God, since such a claim presupposes that we know what it means to transcend human experience, and that it applies to God.\n\nThe claim that God can only be described analogically is, as Plantinga describes, a double-edged sword. If we cannot use univocal language to describe God and argue against simplicity, we are equally handicapped when it comes to the arguments for divine simplicity. If we cannot rely on our usual modes of inference in reasoning about God, we cannot argue for the conclusion that God is not distinct from his properties. Plantinga concludes \"This way of thinking begins in a pious and commendable concern for God's greatness and majesty and augustness, but it ends in agnosticism and in incoherence.\"\n\nPlantinga also gives three criticisms of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity directly, stating that it is exceedingly hard to grasp or construe the doctrine, and it is difficult to see why anyone would be inclined to accept it. First, the Thomist doctrine of simplicity states that all abstract objects are identical with God's essence and hence God himself. Plantinga states that this seems to clash with the obvious fact that the property of being a horse is distinct from the property of being a turkey and both are distinct from God and his essence.\n\nSecondly, Plantinga argues, if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with God to only the properties that God exemplifies, the doctrine is still problematic. Metaphysical simplicity states that God has no accidental (i.e. contingent) properties. Yet, it clearly does seem that God has accidental properties such as having created Adam, and knowing that Adam sinned. Some of God's characteristics characterize him in every possible world and some do not. Plantinga also argues that the conflation of God's actuality with his potentiality inherits all the problems of the essence-accident complexity and is furthermore vexed in its own right. Just as it seems there are characteristics that God has but could have lacked, it also seems the case that there are characteristics that God lacks but could have had. No doubt God has not created all the persons he will create. If so, there is at least one individual essence such that God does not now have, but will have the characteristic of causing that essence to be instantiated. If so, God has potentiality with respect to that characteristic.\n\nPlantinga's third critique challenges the very heart of simplicity. Metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition, meaning that there is no complexity of properties in God and that he is identical with his nature and each of his properties. There are two difficulties with this view. First, if God is identical with each of his properties, then each of his properties is identical with each of his other properties, so God has only one property. This flies in the face of the idea that God has both power and mercifulness, neither of which is identical with the other. Secondly, if God is identical with his properties, then, since each of God's properties is a property, it follows that God is a property as well. In this case, God has just one property: himself. The problem is that properties do not in and of themselves cause anything. No property could have created the world, and no property could know anything at all. If God is a property, then he isn't a person but a mere abstract object, having no power, life, love, or even awareness.\n\nCraig calls property simplicity \"philosophically and theologically unacceptable.\" He also states that divine simplicity is open to powerful objections. On the doctrine of divine simplicity, God is absolutely similar in all possible worlds. Since the statement \"God knows x\" is equivalent to \"x is true,\" it becomes inexplicable why those worlds vary if in every one God knows, loves, and wills the same things. Morris states that it is an idea whose implications are difficult to defend and whose advantages can be had in other ways. It is also an idea whose motivation, under close scrutiny, is not so convincing. John S. Feinberg concludes: \"These philosophical problems plus the biblical considerations raised earlier lead me to conclude that simplicity is not one of the divine attributes. This doesn't mean that God has physical parts, but that the implications of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity are too problematic to maintain the doctrine.\"\n\nRigorous views of divine simplicity were championed by the Mu'tazili, which resulted in a radically apophatic theology. By postulating a distinction between Existence and Essence for all created beings, which was perceived to be uniquely absent in God, Al-Farabi established another model of divine simplicity. Ibn Sinā supported and elaborated this position, Al-Ghazali contested this identification of Divine essence and existence, but still saw all Divine attributes and acts as enveloped in and indistinct from the Divine Essence, this latter view of divine simplicity was shared with some of the most trenchant critics of the Muslim philosophical writers, like Ibn Taymiyyah.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1752698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1752698", "title": "Exclusivism", "text": "Exclusivism\n\nExclusivism is the practice of being exclusive; mentality characterized by the disregard for opinions and ideas other than one's own, or the practice of organizing entities into groups by excluding those entities which possess certain traits. (for an opposite example, see essentialism).\n\nReligious exclusivism, one of the three classic typologies created by Alan Race in order to describe religions relative to one another, states that one religion, to the exclusion of all others, has the correct understanding of God, truth and salvation. Diana Eck states, ‘Exclusivism is more than simply a conviction about the transformative power of the particular vision one has; it is a conviction about its finality and its absolute priority over competing views’. While it was originally used to define Christianity, exclusivism can apply to any religious belief system, as can Race’s other two categories inclusivism and pluralism. In his 1982 \"Christians and Religious Pluralism,\" Race defined pluralism as all religions being equally beneficial, with no single religion dominating. Inclusivism attempts to straddle the poles of pluralism and exclusivism by agreeing with the latter that one religion (Christianity) has the most value, and agreeing with the former by stating that other religions still have significant value. While Race’s three categories have been criticized, amended and refuted, most religious studies and interfaith scholars and students find the typologies useful as a starting point for conversations about the diversity of religions.\n\nPluralism was borne out of a criticism of exclusivism, saying that no single tradition has a monopoly on revelation or salvation, and that we have no way to judge between the salvific claims by adherents of any faith tradition. Paul Hedges suggests that each religion knows ‘transcendent reality (“God”) yet in partial perspective,’ much like the oft-quoted parable of the seven blind men and the elephant. Gavin D’costa says pluralists have two main critiques of exclusivists: people of other religions are god and loving and that they do not know their own Scriptures well enough. Alvin Plantinga says that pluralist’s problem with exclusivism stems from its immorality and arrogance. He quotes William Cantwell Smith: ‘Except at the cost of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible actually to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent, fellow human beings: “…we believe that we know God and we are right; you believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong.”’ Along with Smith, the leading proponent of pluralism is John Hick, who writes:\n\n[Exclusivism], with its baleful historical influence, in validating centuries of anti-semitism, the colonial exploitation by Christian Europe of what today we call the third world, and the subordination of women within a strongly patriarchal religious system, not only causes misgivings among many Christians but also alarms many of our non-Christian neighbors, creating invisible but powerful barriers within the human community.\n\nIt is worth noting that D’costa argued persuasively that logically, pluralism can no longer be considered a category; when it makes a declarative truth claim, it becomes another form of exclusivism.\n\nInclusivists state that while one religion or revelation is true (Christianity), other truths can be found in fragments within other religions. Karl Rahner states it succinctly: ‘Insofar as they in good conscience practice what is good in their religion, people in other religions receive God’s grace and are “anonymous Christians,” people who are being saved through Christ, though they do not realize it.’ Inclusivists point to the biblical parable of the sheep and the goats in which the saved sheep show surprise at being rewarded for their service to Jesus (Matthew 25: 31-40)\n\nAccording to Race, the history of the Abrahamic faiths’ exclusivism – as well as inclusivism – goes back to the words of the Bible and the Qur’an. Christian exclusivists point to John’s gospel (14: 6), which quotes Jesus as saying, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ After Jesus’ death, his disciple Peter said publicly, ‘Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved’ (Acts 4:12). Likewise, the Qur’an (3:85) states, ‘If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).’ While Judaism does not stress salvation, the First Commandment (Exodus 20:3) is ‘You shall have no other gods before me.’ Race says, ‘The tension between Christian experience and the recognition of potential authentic practice outside of the Christian revelation, in fact has always existed in Christian history from the beginning, from the words of Jesus himself in the gospel of Luke: in 9:50 he says, “He who is \"not against\" us is for us”’. Daniel Strange points out what Race neglects to mention: that in the same gospel (11:23), Jesus says, ‘He who is \"not with me\" is against me.’\n\nThe exclusivist idea of ‘no salvation outside of the Christian church’ (\"Extra ecclesiam nulla salus\") has roots as early as Origen in the third century. And while the Bible speaks about many topics of inclusion, diversity and tolerance in both the Old and New Testament – attitudes toward the alien and stranger; the hope of Christians being drawn from all nations and languages; God’s universal care and sustaining of creation; the universal scope of the gospel and the universal mandate to take the gospel to the nations – the overwhelming feeling in the Church throughout most of its history mimics that of the Council of Florence in 1422: ‘The Council firmly believes, professes and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but Jews, heretics and schismatics, cannot participate in eternal life, but will depart into everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his [sic] angels.’ Martin Luther continued the exclusivist theological bent: ‘For where Christ is not preached, there is no Holy Spirit to create, call and gather the Christian Church, and outside it no one can come to the Lord Christ’. The door in the exclusivist castle opened a crack during the 20th century missionary movement, when Dutch missiologist Hendrik Kraemer wrote that Jesus is the one who has the complete authority to judge other religions’ efficacy. Highlighting a unique contemporary take on the salvation problem, Strange introduces George Lindbeck’s contention that those who do not know the Bible cannot be condemned for their lack of knowledge.\n\nMara Brecht states that the problem with classic exclusivism is that it deals mainly with Christianity and salvation (or ‘top down’). She highlights the work of the ‘New Wave of exclusivism,’ led by Griffiths, D’costa and Netland, who employ a ‘bottom up’ approach to religious diversity. New Wave Exclusivists focus more on the religious believers’ ‘ways of knowing and understanding of religious beliefs as expressive truth,’ resulting in a broader possibility for interfaith engagement. For example, Netland sets aside comparing religions’ salvation when he says dialogue should focus on the most important question all religions deal with – the question of truth. Brecht reaches the conclusion that exclusivism is tenable for Christians – and by extension other religious believers – if believers come into contact with believers of other religions who can possibly ‘defeat’ their own, so they can have something to base their truth claims on. Brecht says, ‘Practically, this means that, for example, reflective Christians will consider their beliefs to be as \"probable\" as alternatives from within their own tradition, \"somewhat more probable than\" the relevant alternatives from within Judaism and \"considerably more probable than\" Buddhist alternatives. In other words, believers will weigh their beliefs against other beliefs.’\n\nDouglas Pratt further defines exclusivism, dividing it into three subdivisions – open, closed and extreme. Citing t’Hooft and Kraemer, Pratt says open exclusivism, while never ceding the superior position, ‘may at least be amenably disposed toward the other,’ if only in order to know Them well enough for possible conversion. The relationship is not entered into on equal ground, therefore, nor with the openness to a significant reciprocal change of self-identity. If dialogue is entered into, it is only for mutual edification and an increase in good will. Closed exclusivism offers no chance for a relationship, other than acknowledging the other’s right to exist. An extreme, hard-line exclusivism often leads to a fundamentalist perspective. Pratt writes, ‘Fundamentalism, as a mindset, is a mentality that expresses the modern quest for universality and coherence writ large: only one truth; one authority; one authentic narrative that accounts for all; one right way to be.’ The logical conclusion for this fundamentalist mindset is taking steps to eliminate the other, as one would a business competitor. Pratt writes, ‘The negation of otherness is perhaps critical, for it involves a devaluing and dismissal of the \"other,\" whether in terms of rival community or competing alterities, ideological or otherwise. In the process of negating the other, the self is asserted as inherently superior. My God is greater than your god.’\n\nPaul Moser posits two forms of exclusivism: logical religious exclusivism, which asserts that since the contradictory, foundational truth claims for each religion excludes some or many of them from being true; and the doxastic redemptive exclusivism based on the Athanasian Creed, which states if a person does not believe the Christian concept of the Trinity, that person is condemned. Moser further believes that a God who would exclude people from salvation for neither hearing nor understanding the concept of the Trinity does not have a moral character, and is therefore undeserving of worship.\n\nWhile most attention of exclusivism points toward Christianity, each religion has a branch that falls into the exclusivist category. D’costa points out whether one considers oneself Buddhist or Hindu or Muslim – or indeed a pluralist – each version states that ‘only one single revelation or one single religion is true and all other “revelations” or religions are false.’ While acknowledging that historically, Christianity showed the most extreme forms of exclusivism, Pratt contends that many fundamentalist religions compete for that title, with Islam leading other worthy contenders in ways that are not always obvious. With the purging of the Rohingya in Myanmar, the Buddhist Rakhine have joined the ranks of fundamentalists willing to resort to killing to achieve dominance over competing religions.\n\nThe Decree of Diopithes (430 BCE) forbade the worship of and belief in gods other than those of the Olympian pantheon recognised by the Athenian polis. The introduction of other gods was treated as \"asebeia\", or impiety, and was punishable by death. The philosophers Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Socrates, Stilpo, Theodorus of Cyrene, Aristotle, and Theophrastus were accused of impiety under this decree. Socrates was found guilty of the charge of introducing new gods and condemned to death by drinking hemlock.\n\nAntiochus IV Epiphanes, Selucid ruler of Israel, decided to Hellenize the Jews by ordering the worship of Zeus; when they refused, Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree.\n\nAccording to Herodotus the Caunians, a Greek people who claimed to have originated in Crete and settled in Asia Minor, worshiped the Olympian Gods exclusively. \"They determined that they would no longer make use of the foreign temples which had been established among them, but would worship their own old ancestral Gods alone. Then their whole youth took arms, and striking the air with their spears, marched to the Calyndic frontier, declaring that they were driving out the foreign Gods.\"\n\nPlato, in his Laws, advocates that the state should punish those who deny the existence of the Olympian Gods or believe that the gods exist but think they are indifferent to mankind or can be easily bought by bribes.\n\n\"Interpretatio graeca\", the common tendency of ancient Greek writers to identify foreign divinities with members of their own pantheon, can be seen as a kind of exclusivism. The syncretism of the Hellenistic period whereby aspects of the cults of foreign Gods such as iconography and epithets, can also be seen as a kind of exclusivism.\n\nIn a sociological survey of Americans and their relationship with religions other than Christianity, nearly 90 percent of respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed that “religious diversity has been good for America,” which reinforces the idea that Americans value diversity and religious freedom. However, respondents who identified in the exclusivist category or believed that the United States was a Christian nation displayed much more negative views and a decreased willingness to include other religious people in the lives of their community. Stephen Merino concludes, ‘It may be that when many Americans think of “religious diversity,” they have only Christian diversity in mind.’ Nevertheless, they also provided research to back up their statement, \"‘\"Prior contact with non-Christians will be associated with more positive views of religious diversity and increased willingness to include non-Christians into social life.’ \n\nIn answering the pluralist charge, and hearkening back to Netland, Brad Stetson baldly states, ‘It is possible exclusivism is true.’ It is this statement, he says, that upsets pluralists who charge exclusivists with arrogance and bad form. ‘It is simply not true, as pluralists imply, that disagreeing with someone […] about religious truth is tantamount to treating them badly.[…] [a]n exclusivist claim about religious truth is not defeated strictly because such claims are believed to militate against human harmony and peace.' In addition, Hick, Smith and other pluralists balk at the idea that an all-loving God would condemn some people to hell, nor that anyone actually deserves to be damned; he then quotes CS Lewis: ‘The doors of hell are locked on the \"inside.’\" \n"}

{"id": "4376005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4376005", "title": "Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church", "text": "Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Church historically observes the disciplines of fasting and abstinence at various times each year. For Catholics, fasting is the reduction of one's intake of food, while abstinence refers to refraining from meat (or another type of food). The Catholic Church teaches that all people are obliged by God to perform some penance for their sins, and that these acts of penance are both personal and corporeal. The purpose of fasting is spiritual focus, self-discipline, imitation of Christ, and performing penance.\n\nContemporary Vatican legislation, which is followed by Catholics of the Latin Rite (who comprise most Catholics) is rooted in the 1966 Apostolic Constitution of Pope Paul VI, \"Paenitemini\", and codified in the 1983 \"Code of Canon Law\" (in Canons 1249–1253). According to \"Paenitemini\" and the 1983 Code of Canon Law, on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, both abstinence and fasting are required of Catholics who are not exempted for various reasons. All Fridays of the year are days are bound by the law of abstinence on all Fridays that are not Solemnities, while the law of fasting binds all Catholics who are aged between eighteen and sixty on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. Nevertheless, both \"Paenitemini\" and the 1983 Code of Canon Law permitted the Episcopal Conferences to propose adjustments of the laws on fasting and abstinence for their home territories, and most have done so. For example, in some countries, the Bishops' Conferences have obtained from Rome the substitution of pious or charitable acts for abstinence from meat on all Fridays of the year (including Fridays of Lent) except Good Friday. Others continue to abstain from eating meat on Lenten Fridays, but not on Fridays outside of Lent. Still others voluntarily abstain from meat on however, fasting may be less stringent on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday.\n\nMembers of the Eastern Catholic Churches are obliged to follow the discipline of their own particular church. While some Eastern Catholics try to follow the stricter rules of their Orthodox counterparts, the actual canonical obligations of Eastern Catholics to fast and abstain are usually much more lenient than those of the Orthodox.\n\nThe Personal Ordinariates for former Anglicans reconciled to the Catholic Church follow the discipline of the Latin Rite (of which they are a part) including the norms established by the Council of Catholic Bishops in whose territories they are erected and of which their Ordinaries are members. Thus in England the norm is abstinence on all Fridays of the year. The Bishop in the United States has emphasized the statements in the USCCB norms \"Friday itself remains a special day of penitential observance throughout the year,\" and \"we give first place to abstinence from flesh meat.\" The Rogation Days have been re-establised in the Calendar of the Ordinariates, and as long as a Solemnity does not take precedence, the Fridays in September and Advent are days of obligatory abstinence. Obligatory abstinence on Ember Friday in Lent is included in the universal Lenten discipline, and abstinence on Ember Friday on Whitsuntide is not required, as all days of the Octave of Pentecost are Solemnities.\nThe Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays popularized the Friday fish fry and inspired the creation of the Filet-O-Fish sandwich at McDonald's.\n\nRules relating to fasting pertain to the quantity of food allowed on days of fasting, while those regulating abstinence refer to the quality or type of food. The Christian tradition of fasts and abstinence developed from Old Testament practices, and were an integral part of the early church community. Louis Duchesne observed that Monday and Thursday were days of fasting among pious Jews. Early Christians practiced regular weekly fasts on Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\nThere has always been a close connection between fasting and almsgiving; the money saved on food should be given to the poor.\n\nThe habit of fasting before Easter developed gradually, and with considerable diversity of practice regarding duration. As late as the latter part of the second century there were differing opinions not only regarding the manner of the paschal fast, but also the proper time for keeping Easter. In 331 St. Athanasius enjoined upon his flock a period of forty days of fasting preliminary to, but not inclusive of, the stricter fast of Holy Week, and in 339, after having traveled to Rome and over the greater part of Europe, wrote in the strongest terms to urge this observance upon the people of Alexandria as one that was universally practiced, \"to the end that while all the world is fasting, we who are in Egypt should not become a laughing-stock as the only people who do not fast but take our pleasure in those days\".\n\nIn the time of Gregory the Great (590–604) there were apparently at Rome six weeks of six days each, making thirty-six fast days in all, which St. Gregory, who is followed therein by many medieval writers, describes as the spiritual tithing of the year, thirty-six days being approximately the tenth part of three hundred and sixty-five. At a later date the wish to realize the exact number of forty days led to the practice of beginning Lent on Ash Wednesday.\n\nThe ordinary rule on fasting days was to take but one meal a day and that only in the evening, white meat and, in the early centuries, wine were entirely forbidden.\n\nThese days were at one time observed with a Black Fast of strictly no more than one meal, without meat, dairy, oil, or wine. This Lenten fast was traditionally broken at sunset. In the 10th century the custom of taking the only meal of the day at three o'clock was introduced. In the 14th century the meal was allowed at mid-day, and soon the practice of an evening collation (snack) became common. A morning collation was introduced in the early 19th century.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Church law prescribed fasting throughout Lent, with abstinence only on Friday and Saturday. Some countries received dispensations: Rome in 1918 allowed the bishops of Ireland to transfer the Saturday obligation to Wednesday; in the United States, abstinence was not required on Saturday. The other weekdays were simply days of \"fasting without abstinence.\" A similar practice (common in the United States) was called \"partial abstinence\", which allowed meat only once during the day at the main meal. (There is nothing in current Catholic Canon Law which corresponds to \"partial abstinence\".) The countries of the former Spanish empire also had their own extensive dispensations from the Roman rules of fasting and abstinence, based on the \"Crusader privileges\" of the Spanish dominions as codified in the Bull of the Crusade. In some European colonies, the obligation to fast and abstain differed by race, with natives often having more lenient rules than Europeans or mestizos.\n\nWhile the rules of abstinence generally only allow seafood, there are a few exceptions. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week; in response to a question posed by French settlers in Quebec in the 17th century, beaver was classified as an exception; and the Archbishop of New Orleans said that \"alligator is considered in the fish family\" in 2010. The legal basis for the classification of beaver as fish probably rests with the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas, which bases animal classification as much on habit as anatomy.\n\nBesides Lent, there were other penitential times customarily accompanied by fasting or abstinence. These included Advent, the Ember Days, the Rogation Days, Fridays throughout the year, and vigils of important feast days.\n\nAdvent is considered a time of special self-examination, humility, and spiritual preparation in anticipation of the birth of Christ. Fridays and Saturdays in Advent were days of abstinence, and until early in the 20th century, the Fridays of Advent were also days of fasting.\n\nThe vigils observed included the Saturday before Pentecost, October 31 (the vigil of All Saints), December 24 (Christmas Eve), December 7 (the vigil of the Immaculate Conception) and August 14 (the vigil of the Assumption). These vigils all required fasting; some also required abstinence. If any of these fell on a Sunday, the vigil, but not the obligation of fasting, was moved to the Saturday before. (Some other liturgical days were also known as vigils but neither fasting nor abstinence was required, particularly the vigils of feasts of the Apostles and the Vigil of the Epiphany.) By 1959 in the United States, the fast for the vigil of Christmas was moved to December 23.\n\nEmber days occurred four times a year. The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of the ember week were days of fast and abstinence, though the Wednesday and Saturday were often only days of partial abstinence. In addition, Roman Catholics were required to abstain from meat (but not fast) on all other Fridays, unless the Friday coincided with a holy day of obligation.\n\nThe former regulations on abstinence obliged Roman Catholics starting as young as age seven, but there were many exceptions. Large classes of people were considered exempt from fasting and abstinence, not only the sick and those with physically demanding jobs, but also people traveling and students. The regulations were adapted to each nation, and so in most dioceses in America abstinence from meat was not required on the Friday after Thanksgiving, to accommodate any meat left over from that US national holiday.\n\nOn the eve of Vatican II, fasting and abstinence requirements in numerous Catholic countries were already greatly relaxed compared to the beginning of the 20th century, with fasting often reduced to just 4 days of the year (Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, the vigil of Christmas or the day before, and the vigil either of the Immaculate Conception or of the Assumption).\n\nSome controversy has arisen over whether Catholics should continue to fast and abstain from the things they voluntarily gave up for Lent on the Sundays of Lent. Questions include whether the “forty days” of Lent are limited to weekdays or whether they include Sundays, and if every Sunday is like Easter.\n\nThe Latin word for \"Lent\" is \"Quadragesima\" which literally means \"forty\". The term imitates many biblical images of fasting for forty days (e.g. Exodus 24:18; Matthew 4:2; Luke 4:2). While all of this is true, Lenten and Easter practices varied in the East and the West as both traditions developed over time. The various Lenten fasts which developed did not always last forty days.\n\nIn the fourth century, the council of Nicaea referred to Lent as “the forty” before the Paschal feast. Although it is not entirely clear, the grammar of this phrase could be read to imply that one should prepare for forty days for the coming of Easter. One thing that is clear from the council of Nicaea is the fact that whatever the length of this penance, it did not include Sundays, since this council forbade even kneeling on Sunday. Sundays were treated differently by the early Christians and penitential kneeling on Sundays was strictly forbidden. This early discipline later evolved in the Western Church as our understanding of various gestures in worship shifted. Eventually in the Western tradition kneeling became a sign of reverence not of penance.\n\nIn the history of the development of Lenten traditions in the western Church there were actually two different focuses. One was on the Baptismal liturgy of catechumens who were journeying towards the Easter Vigil to be baptized and received in to the Church. The second tradition involved a rite for reconciling adult penitents. Initially these penitents were those who were excommunicated and were in the process of being reconciled to the Church. In 1091 AD, Pope Urban II changed this and required all the faithful to receive ashes in what became Ash Wednesday. Over time the penitential aspect alone became the focus of Lent.\n\nThe Second Vatican council wished to restore the original double focus on baptism and penance. The fathers note, “The season of Lent has a twofold character: primarily by recalling or preparing for baptism and by penance, it disposes the faithful, who more diligently hear the word of God and devote themselves to prayer, to celebrate the paschal mystery. This twofold character is to be brought into greater prominence both in the liturgy and by liturgical catechesis.” (\"Sacrosanctum concilium\" 109).\n\nWhat are the implications for the Sundays in Lent? Can we solve this with Math? According to the modern \"General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar\" (2011), “The forty days of Lent run from Ash Wednesday up to but excluding the Mass of the Lord's Supper exclusive.” If you get a calendar out you would see that this year there are 20 days of Lent in February but only 24 days (23.5?) of Lent in March for a total of 44 days. There are 6 Sundays in Lent. Using these numbers you would not achieve the ‘biblical number’ forty by subtracting the six Sundays that occur within Lenten session. Does this prove that we should fast and abstain on Sunday’s? Or perhaps two of the Sundays?\n\nSeveral points need to be noted. First the definition of Lent as excluding half of Holy Thursday, the whole of Good Friday and Holy Saturday only came about in 1969. These three days are now called the Triduum and are no longer considered part of the session of Lent. In other words, the numbers did actually work until this recent change. But now is the number ‘forty,’ merely figurative?\n\nNotice that even in the current definition of Lent, Easter waits for us to complete the Triduum, and there are two more days of serious penance in the Triduum which still brings the total to forty days of penance excluding Sundays. The penitential disciple of Lent is still forty days even if the season of Lent is now shorten by the Triduum.\n\nWe must not confuse the season on Lent with the penitential disciple of Lent. The tradition of the Church did not require equal penances on each day of Lent, and no penance was required on Sunday.\n\nSomeone might say that the Sundays of Lent are part of the season of Lent and, therefore, must continue to have a penitential meaning. This is certainly partly true. We do worship in a more reserved and sober manner on the Sundays of Lent. But the fact remains that the penitential discipline of Lent always excluded these Sundays. We might also point out that the lectionary readings of the Sundays of Lent all focus on the catechumenal journey towards the Easter Vigil and not exclusively on penance.\n\nAs was pointed out above, Lenten traditions have developed over time. One consistent feature has been that the penitential discipline of Lent excluded Sundays. This point is especially evident in the writings of St. Augustine.\n\nIn St. Augustine’s \"Letter 36\", he refutes a rigorist who insists that Christians should fast on the Sabbath (Saturday). This might initially sound tangential but it leads Augustine to our question. Augustine, by the way, argues that we are free to fast or not fast on the Sabbath, and as Christians we are not bound by the Jewish Sabbath keeping regulations.\n\nAugustine also tells us that in his time Christians regularly fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year and not just in Lent (36.30) and that some Churches fasted as well on the Sabbath. By comparison, fasting on the Lord’s Day (Sunday) “would be a cause of no small scandal to the Church” (36.2, cf. 36.10, 29). He notes, “For in these questions on which the divine scripture has determined nothing certain, the custom of the people of God or the practices of our ancestors are to be taken as law” (36.2). He makes it clear that not fasting on the Lord’s Day was the standard practice for the Church in Rome, in Africa and in Millan. He also points out that fasting or abstaining on the Lord’s Day was a practice of the followers of the heresy of the Manichees (36.27) and Priscillianist (36.28) which the Church universally rejected.\n\nFasting on the Lord’s Day is a ‘scandal’ and ‘abominable’ (36.27) though Augustine allows one exception, “unless perhaps someone might be able to extend a fast beyond a week without taking any meal in order to approximate a fast of forty days” (36.27). He does not seem to have in mind someone who is merely, for example, not eating meat for forty days, but an epic fast of biblical proportions. (e.g. “without taking any meal”).\n\nAgain the point is that the penitential discipline of Lent always excluded Sundays and further St. Augustine says that fasting on Sundays is a scandal and abominable.\n\nFinally someone might add one more layer to this discussion. The person who is asking about drinking their latte on Sundays in Lent, is really taking about their own self-imposed private devotion. It is interesting to learn about the history of this practice of private devotion.\n\nPrior to Second Vatican Council the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the Roman Pontifical and the approved regulations for the United States (\"Uniform Norms\" 1951, \"Modification\" 1956) required a rigorous scheme of fasting by all the faithful 21- 59-years-old. Abstinence could be complete or partial, and fasting allowed one full meal plus partial meals. All week days of Lent had either a fast or a fast and abstinence attached to them. It is very clear in these documents that we were discussing the weekdays of Lent, excluding Sundays.\n\nDuring World War II special permission was given to local ordinaries to dispense the faithful from these rigorous daily requirements and this permission was extended again in 1949. In light of these dispensations the \"Uniform Norms\" 1951, and \"Modification\" 1956 for the US included a paragraph which exhorted the faithful to be generous in performing additional voluntary works of Christian perfection.\n\nIt seems the wide spread custom of taking on voluntary penance began in the 1950s. Prior to this people were satisfied fulfilling the demanding norms of Lent. Since these new \"voluntary acts\" are not required, it would seem the faithful can do whatever they want, but choosing to do penance on a Sunday is clearly not in the spirit of Catholic Tradition.\n\nContemporary legislation is rooted in the 1966 Apostolic Constitution of Pope Paul VI, \"Paenitemini\". He recommended that fasting be appropriate to the local economic situation, and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain. He also allowed that fasting and abstinence might be substituted with prayer and works of charity, although the norms for doing so were to be set down by the Episcopal Conferences.\n\nCurrent practice of fast and abstinence is regulated by Canons 1250–1253 of the 1983 code. They specify that all Fridays throughout the year, and the time of Lent are penitential times throughout the entire Church. All adults (those who have attained the 'age of majority', which is 18 years in canon law) are bound by law to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday until the beginning of their sixtieth year. All persons who have completed their fourteenth year are bound by the law of abstinence on all Fridays unless they are solemnities, and again on Ash Wednesday; but in practice this requirement has been greatly reduced by the Episcopal Conferences because under Canon 1253, it is these Conferences that have the authority to set down the local norms for fasting and abstinence in their territories. (However, the precept to both fast and abstain on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday is usually not dispensed from.)\n\nAbsent any specification of the nature of \"fasting\" in the current Canon Law, the traditional definition is obviously applicable here which is that on the days of mandatory fasting, Catholics may eat only one full meal during the day. Additionally, they may eat up to two small meals or snacks, known as \"collations\". Church requirements on fasting only relate to solid food, not to drink, so Church law does not restrict the amount of water or other beverages – even alcoholic drinks – which may be consumed.\n\nIn some Western countries, Catholics have been encouraged to adopt non-dietary forms of abstinence during Lent. For example, in 2009 Monsignor Benito Cocchi, Archbishop of Modena, urged young Catholics to give up text messaging for Lent.\n\nIn addition to the fasts mentioned above, Roman Catholics must also observe the Eucharistic Fast, which involves taking nothing but water and medicines into the body for some time before receiving the Eucharist. The earliest recorded regular practice was to eat at home before the Lord's Supper if one was hungry (I Corinthians 11:34). The next known ancient practice was to fast from midnight until Mass that day. As Masses after noon and in the evening became common in the West, this was soon modified to fasting for three hours. The latest Code of Canon Law reduced the Eucharistic Fast to the current one-hour requirement for the Roman Rite. Particular law in some Eastern Catholic Churches also requires a one-hour Eucharistic fast.\n\nThe Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference decreed on Friday 4 October 1985 that Fridays throughout the year, including in Lent (other than Good Friday) are not obligatory days of abstinence from meat, provided an alternative form of penance is practised. Although this remains the case to this day, support for the return of obligatory Friday abstinence has been gradually increasing since England and Wales returned to Friday abstinence in 2011, with some Australian bishops expressing interest.\n\nThe Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops decrees that the days of fast and abstinence in Canada are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, and specifies that Fridays are days of abstinence. This includes all Fridays year round, not just Fridays of Lent. Catholics, however, can substitute special acts of charity or piety on these days.\n\nCurrent norms for England and Wales, issued by the Bishops' Conference in May 2011, re-introduced the expectation that all Catholics able to do so should abstain from meat on all Fridays of the year, effective Friday, September 16, 2011.\n\nOn 25 November 2010 the Irish Bishops’ Conference published the resource leaflet \"Friday Penance\". It followed from the March 2010 Pastoral Letter to the Catholics of Ireland from Pope Benedict XVI suggesting initiatives to support renewal in the Church in Ireland. He asked that Irish Catholics offer their Friday Penances “for an outpouring of God’s mercy and the Holy Spirit’s gifts of holiness and strength,” and that fasting, prayer, reading of Scripture and works of mercy be offered in order to obtain healing and renewal for the Church in Ireland.\n\nThe leaflet states that Penance \"arises from the Lord’s call to conversion and repentance\" and describes that it is an \"essential part of all genuine Christian living\":\n\n\"Friday Penance\" also explains why penance is important: “Declaring some days throughout the year as days of fast and abstinence (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday) is meant to intensify penances of the Christian. Lent is the traditional season for renewal and penance but Catholics also observe each Friday of the year as days of penance. The link between Friday and penance is extremely ancient and is even reflected in the Irish language word for Friday: \"An Aoine\" (\"The Fast\").”\n\nThe leaflet suggests ways of fulfilling Friday penance such as abstaining from meat or alcohol, visiting the Blessed Sacrament or helping the poor, sick and lonely as well as other suggestions.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) produced a statement in 1966 called \"Pastoral Statement on Penance and Abstinence\", which was modified slightly in 1983.\n\nOne writer has summarized the U.S. rules as follows:\n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has declared that \"the age of fasting is from the completion of the eighteenth year to the beginning of the sixtieth.\" The USCCB also allows the substitution of some other form of penance for abstinence on all of the Fridays of the year, except for those Fridays in Lent. Thus, the rules for fasting and abstinence in the United States are:\n\nAccording to the USCCB:\nAbstinence laws consider that meat comes only from animals such as chickens, cows, sheep or pigs --- all of which live on land. Birds are also considered meat. Abstinence does not include meat juices and liquid foods made from meat. Thus, such foods as chicken broth, consomme, soups cooked or flavored with meat, meat gravies or sauces, as well as seasonings or condiments made from animal fat are technically not forbidden. However, moral theologians have traditionally taught that we should abstain from all animal-derived products (except foods such as gelatin, butter, cheese and eggs, which do not have any meat taste). Fish are a different category of animal. Salt and freshwater species of fish, amphibians, reptiles, (cold-blooded animals) and shellfish are permitted.\n\nBecause of this, some Catholic parishes in the United States sponsor a fish fry during Lent. In predominantly Roman Catholic areas, restaurants may adjust their menus during Lent by adding seafood items to the menu in an attempt to appeal to Roman Catholics. However, the same USCCB website says that:While fish, lobster and other shellfish are not considered meat and can be consumed on days of abstinence, indulging in the lavish buffet at your favorite seafood place sort of misses the point. Abstaining from meat and other indulgences during Lent is a penitential practice.\n\nThe USCCB also states that:Those that are excused from fast and abstinence outside the age limits include the physically or mentally ill including individuals suffering from chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Also excluded are pregnant or nursing women. In all cases, common sense should prevail, and ill persons should not further jeopardize their health by fasting.\n\nIn 2010, Archbishop of New Orleans Gregory Michael Aymond clarified that alligator is also considered seafood, saying \"Yes, the alligator's considered in the fish family, and I agree with you — God has created a magnificent creature that is important to the state of Louisiana, and it is considered seafood.\" This was in response to a letter from a local alligator wrangler.\n\nTo fast customarily means to only eat one meal during the day, and to avoid animal products. Eastern Christians view fasting as one part of repentance and supporting a spiritual change of heart. Eastern Christians observe two major times of fasting, the \"Great Fast\" before Easter, and \"Phillip's Fast\" before the Nativity.\n\nDuring the Great Fast, meat, eggs, dairy products, fish and oil are avoided.\n\nThe fast period before Christmas is called \"Philip's Fast\" because it begins after the feast day of St. Philip. Specific practices vary, but on some days during the week meat, dairy products and (in some countries) oil are avoided, while on other days there is no restriction. During approximately the last week before the Nativity, typically meat, dairy, eggs and oil are avoided on all days, meals are moderate in quantity, and no food is taken between meals.\n\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

According to the Estonian Encyclopedia's definition, he \"wrote plenty of irritating publicist articles\".\n\nGustav Naan was born in Russian SFSR in a village near Vladivostok to a family of Estonian settlers. He graduated from the Leningrad State University in 1941. He took part in World War II and joined the CPSU in 1943. Having settled to Estonia after the USSR annexed Estonia, Gustav Naan, a loyal communist and graduate of the Higher Party School of the AUCP(b) (1946) published a number of Stalinist-oriented polemic pieces (treating Estonian history and politics from the pro-Soviet perspective, e.g. \"Eesti kodanlike natsionalistide ideoloogia reaktsiooniline olemus″ ('The Reactionary Essence of the Ideology of Estonian Bourgeois Nationalists'), 1947). In 1948, Naan published an article in \"Voprosy filosofii\" on the philosophical implications of the theory of relativity, criticizing 'physical idealists' of the US and Britain; in 1951, however, he published an article that decried vulgar materialist critics of the relativity theory whilst being ″tolerant on philosophic questions to a striking degree in Stalinist Russia, considering its place and time of publication″. Authors who followed Naan's article into discussion were almost universally critical of Naan's position. In 1952, which was the most intense year of the debate, three different authors published against Naan in the 1952 first issue of \"Voprosy filosofii\" alone.\n\nNaan was the director of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1950–1951), Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1951–1964). From 1964, Naan worked at the Institute of Astrophysics and Atmosphere Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR. Having turned to theorizing on cosmology, cybernetics and demography, he often rejected taboos of both the 'traditional' world-view and orthodox communist opinions on such matters. He often juxtaposed what he saw as a science-based world-view with a trivial thinking (Estonian: \"argimõtlemine\"), which he saw both among common people, the intelligentsia as well as the ruling classes. He later claimed to have been one of the promoters of the theory of relativity at the time this was still considered pseudoscience by the Soviet authorities. The influential 1968 article \"Võim ja vaim\" (roughly \"The Power and the Mind\") was widely read among the liberal intelligentsia, who interpreted it as a critique of the administrative/bureaucratic socialism and command economy. His articles such as this enjoyed popularity in Russia, too. In 1960s and 1970s he often held lectures either in the assembly hall of the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute or (as initiated on his own initiative) in Tõravere as seminars of philosophy, often balancing between the permissible by the authorities and impermissible.\n\nHe also proposed the Symmetric Universe hypothesis, according to which, side by side with the ordinary world, there is an anti-world. His ideas have been characterized as \"viewpoints that have been recognized as valuable from the scientific point of view\".\n\nNaan was editor-in-chief of \"Eesti nõukogude entsüklopeedia\" (literally: \"Estonian Soviet Encyclopedia\"), the first edition of which started in the late 1960s. The encyclopedia was highly successful in Estonia.\n\nIn terms of political affiliations, Naan remained a staunch supporter of the Soviet system (initially an enthusiastic supporter of Perestroika though) and was a devote opponent of Estonia's pro-independence movement; Naan supported the (pro-Moscow) Internationalist Movement. Having gained much public support in the 1970s for his relatively bold opinion pieces on topics like family, the rising divorce rate (that he argued was more or less a normal development), morals and sex (the importance of which, he argued, was being downplayed out of pseudomoralistic argumentation), he soon became a despised figure for his anti-independence stance, which was reflected in his newspaper articles of the time (e.g. his article «С ног на голову» ('From (standing on) Feet to (standing on) Head', Estonian title \"Kõik pea peale″), condemning the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR, was published in \"Pravda\", 23. November 1988.). He also published a number of articles where he either tried to downplay or rationalize Stalinist repressions. His stance almost led to his expulsion from the Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Similar to the Cadet Honor Codes of the United States Military Academy and United States Air Force Academy, the Concept formalizes the requirement for midshipmen to demonstrate integrity while refusing to lie, cheat or steal.\n\nThe Treatise adopts the use of first-person point of view, becoming a personal call to obey the letter and spirit of the Concept amongst midshipmen of the brigade. The United States Coast Guard Academy utilizes a similar Honor Concept to impart the same call to integrity for its corps of cadets.\n\nUnlike the other service academies' honor codes, the Honor Concept allows a midshipman to confront someone committing an honor violation without formally reporting it. At the other academies, failure to formally report an honor violation is construed as tolerating it, which is itself a violation of the code.\n\nPenalties for violating the Honor Concept can be severe, up to and including expulsion from the Academy.\n\nThe principles of the Honor Concept are as old as the Academy itself, revolving around the principle that an officer's word is his bond. However, examination of the past academy honor practices by 1953 USNA class president Ross Perot discovered \"no uniform policy for dealing with midshipmen who had violated their class's conception of honor.\" While admitting to \"irreverence\" as an \"inescapable trait of midshipmen,\" brigade leaders like Perot, William P.

It is held by some philosophical and metaphysical theories of divine presence. Immanence is usually applied in monotheistic, pantheistic, pandeistic, or panentheistic faiths to suggest that the spiritual world permeates the . It is often contrasted with theories of transcendence, in which the divine is seen to be outside the material world.\n\nMajor faiths commonly devote significant philosophical efforts to explaining the relationship between immanence and transcendence but do so in different ways, such as:\n\nAnother meaning of immanence is the quality of being contained within, or remaining within the boundaries of a person, of the world, or of the mind. This meaning is more common within Christian and other monotheist theology, in which the one God is considered to transcend his creation.\n\nPythagoreanism says that the \"nous\" is an intelligent principle of the world acting with a specific intention. This is the divine reason regarded in Neoplatonism as the first emanation of the Divine. From the \"nous\" emerges the world soul, which gives rise to the manifest realm. Pythagoreanism goes on to say the Godhead is the Father, Mother, and Son (Zeus). In the mind of Zeus, the \"ideas\" are distinctly articulated and become the Logos by which he creates the world. These ideas become active in the Mind (\"nous\") of Zeus. With him is the Power and from him is the \"nous\". This theology further explains that Zeus is called Demiurge (\"Dêmiourgos\", Creator), Maker (\"Poiêtês\"), and Craftsman (\"Technitês\"). The nous of the demiurge proceeds outward into manifestation becoming living ideas. They give rise to a lineage of mortal human souls. The components of the soul are 1) the higher soul, seat of the intuitive mind (\"divine nous\"); 2) the rational soul (\"logistiko\"n) (seat of discursive reason / \"dianoia\"); 3) the nonrational soul (\"alogia\"), responsible for the senses, appetites, and motion. Zeus thinks the articulated ideas (Logos). The \"idea of ideas\" (\"Eidos - Eidôn\"), provides a model of the Paradigm of the Universe, which the Demiurge contemplates in his articulation of the \"ideas\" and his creation of the world according to the Logos.\n\nTantric Buddhism and Dzogchen posit a non-dual basis for both experience and reality that could be considered an exposition of a philosophy of immanence that has a history on the subcontinent of India from early CE to the present. A paradoxical non-dual awareness or \"rigpa\" (Tibetan — \"vidya\" in Sanskrit) — is said to be the 'self perfected state' of all beings. Scholarly works differentiate these traditions from monism. The non-dual is said to be not immanent and not transcendent, not neither, nor both. One classical exposition is the Madhyamaka refutation of extremes that the philosopher-adept Nagarjuna propounded.\n\nExponents of this non-dual tradition emphasize the importance of a direct experience of non-duality through both meditative practice and philosophical investigation. In one version, one maintains awareness as thoughts arise and dissolve within the 'field' of mind, one does not accept or reject them, rather one lets the mind wander as it will until a subtle sense of immanence dawns. Vipassana or insight is the integration of one's 'presence of awareness' with that which arises in mind. Non-duality or rigpa is said to be the recognition that both the quiet, calm abiding state as found in samatha and the movement or arising of phenomena as found in vipassana are not separate. In this way it could be stated that Dzogchen is a method for the recognition of a 'pure immanence' analogous to what Deleuze theorized about.\n\nAccording to Christian theology, the transcendent God, who cannot be approached or seen in essence or being, becomes immanent primarily in the God-man Jesus the Christ, who is the incarnate Second Person of the Trinity. In Byzantine Rite theology the immanence of God is expressed as the hypostases or energies of God, who in his essence is incomprehensible and transcendent. In Catholic theology, Christ and the Holy Spirit immanently reveal themselves; God the Father only reveals himself immanently vicariously through the Son and Spirit, and the Divine Nature, the Godhead is wholly transcendent and unable to be comprehended.\n\nThis is expressed in St. Paul's letter to the Philippians, where he writes:\n\nThe Holy Spirit is also expressed as an immanence of God.\n\nThe immanence of the triune God is celebrated in the Catholic Church and Eastern Churches during the liturgical calendar feast as the Theophany of God (see Feast of Theophany).\n\nPope Pius X wrote at length about philosophical-theological controversies over immanence in his encyclical \"Pascendi dominici gregis\".\n\nIn the theology of Karl Rahner, it is said that \"the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity.\" That is to say, God communicates Himself to humanity (\"economic\" Trinity) as He really is in the divine Life (\"immanent\" Trinity).\n\nAccording to Latter Day Saint theology, all of material creation is filled with immanence, known as the light of Christ. It is also responsible for the intuitive conscience born into man. The Light of Christ is the source of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment, and is the means by which God is in and through all things. LDS scriptures identify the divine Light with the mind of God, the source of all truth and conveyor of the characteristics of the divine nature through God’s goodness. The experienced brilliance of God reflects the “fullness” of this spirit within God’s being. Similarly, mankind can incorporate this spiritual light or divine mind and thus become one with God. This immanent spirit of light bridges the scientific and spiritual conceptualizations of the universe.\n\nGiordano Bruno's, Baruch Spinoza's and, it may be argued, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophies were philosophies of immanence versus philosophies of transcendence such as Thomism or Aristotelian tradition. Kant's \"transcendental\" critique can be contrasted to Hegel's \"immanent dialectics.\"\n\nGilles Deleuze qualified Spinoza as the \"prince of philosophers\" for his theory of immanence, which Spinoza resumed by \"Deus sive Natura\" (\"God or Nature\"). Such a theory considers that there is no transcendent principle or external cause to the world, and that the process of life production is contained in life itself. When compounded with Idealism, the immanence theory qualifies itself away from \"the world\" to there being no external cause to one's mind.\n\nGiovanni Gentile's actual idealism, sometimes called \"philosophy of immanence\" and the metaphysics of the \"I\", \"affirms the organic synthesis of dialectical opposites that are immanent within actual or present awareness\". His so-called method of immanence \"attempted to avoid: (1) the postulate of an independently existing world or a Kantian \"Ding-an-sich\" (thing-in-itself), and (2) the tendency of neo-Hegelian philosophy to lose the particular self in an Absolute that amounts to a kind of mystical reality without distinctions.\"\n\nPolitical theorist Carl Schmitt used the term in his book \"Politische Theologie\" (1922), meaning a power within some thought, which makes it obvious for the people to accept it, without needing to claim being justified. The immanence of some political system or a part of it comes from the reigning contemporary definer of \"Weltanschauung\", namely religion (or any similar system of beliefs, such as rationalistic or relativistic world-view). The Nazis took advantage of this theory creating, or resurrecting, basically religious mythology of race, its heroes, and its destiny to motivate people and to make their reign unquestionable, which it became.\n\nThe French 20th-century philosopher Gilles Deleuze used the term immanence to refer to his \"empiricist philosophy\", which was obliged to create action and results rather than establish transcendents. His final text was titled \"Immanence: a life...\" and spoke of a plane of immanence.\n\nFurthermore, the Russian Formalist film theorists perceived immanence as a specific method of discussing the limits of ability for a technological object. Specifically, this is the scope of potential uses of an object outside of the limits prescribed by culture or convention, and is instead simply the empirical spectrum of function for a technological artifact.\n\nTraditional Jewish religious thought can be divided into \"Nigleh\" (\"Revealed\") and \"Nistar\" (\"Hidden\") dimensions. Hebrew Scripture is, in the Kabbalistic tradition, explained using the four level exegesis method of \"Pardes\". In this system, the first three approaches, Simple, Hinted and Homiletical interpretations, characterise the revealed aspects. The fourth approach, the Secret meaning, characterises a hidden aspect. Among the classic texts of Jewish tradition, some Jewish Bible commentators, the \"Midrash\", the \"Talmud\", and mainstream Jewish philosophy use revealed approaches. Other Bible commentators, the Kabbalah, and Hasidic philosophy, use hidden approaches. Both dimensions are seen by adherents as united and complementary. In this way, ideas in Jewish thought are given a variety of ascending meanings. Explanations of a concept in \"Nigleh\", are given inherent, inner, mystical contexts from \"Nistar\".\n\nDescriptions of Divine immanence can be seen in \"Nigleh\", from the Bible to Rabbinic Judaism. In Genesis, God makes a personal covenant with the forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Daily Jewish prayers refer to this inherited closeness and personal relationship with the Divine, for their descendants, as \"the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\". To Moses, God reveals his Tetragrammaton name, that more fully captures Divine descriptions of transcendence. Each of the Biblical names for God, describe different Divine manifestations. The most important prayer in Judaism, that forms part of the Scriptural narrative to Moses, says \"Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.\" This declaration combines different Divine names, and themes of immanence and transcendence. Perhaps the most personal example of a Jewish prayer that combines both themes is the invocation repeatedly voiced during the time in the Jewish calendar devoted to \"Teshuva\" (Return, often inaccurately translated as Repentance), \"Avinu Malkeinu\" (\"Our Father, Our King\"). Much of the later Hebrew Biblical narrative recounts the reciprocal relationship and national drama of the unfolding of themes of immanence and transcendence. Kabbalistic, or Hasidic Jewish thought and philosophy describe and articulate these interconnected aspects of the Divine-human relationship.\n\nJewish Mysticism gives explanations of greater depth and spirituality, to the interconnected aspects of God's immanence and transcendence. The main expression of mysticism, the Kabbalah, began to be taught in 12th Century Europe, and reached a new systemisation in 16th Century Israel. The Kabbalah gives the full, subtle, traditional system of Jewish metaphysics. In the Medieval Kabbalah, new doctrines described the 10 \"Sephirot\" (Divine emanations) through which the Infinite, unknowable Divine essence reveals, emanates, and continuously creates existence. The Kabbalists identified the final, feminine \"Sefirah\" with the earlier, traditional Jewish concept of the \"Shekhinah\" (immanent Divine Presence). This gave great spirituality to earlier ideas in Jewish thought, such as the theological explanations of suffering (theodicy). In this example, the Kabbalists described the \"Shekhinah\" accompanying the children of Israel in their exile, being exiled alongside them, and yearning for Her redemption. Such a concept derives from the Kabbalistic theology that the physical World, and also the Upper spiritual Worlds, are continuously recreated from nothing by the \"Shefa\" (flow) of Divine will, which emanates through the \"Sefirot\". As a result, within all creations are Divine sparks of vitality that sustain them. Medieval \"Kabbalah\" describes two forms of Divine emanation, a \"light that fills all worlds\", representing this immanent Divine creative power, and a \"light that surrounds all worlds\", representing transcendent expressions of Divinity.\n\nThe new doctrines of Isaac Luria in the 16th Century completed the Kabbalistic system of explanation. Lurianic Kabbalah describes the process of \"Tzimtzum\" (צמצום meaning \"Contraction\" or \"Constriction\") in the Kabbalistic theory of creation, where God \"contracted\" his infinite essence in order to allow for a \"conceptual space\" in which a finite, independent world could exist. This has received different later interpretations in Jewish mysticism, from the literal to the metaphorical. In this process, creation unfolds within the Divine reality. Luria offered a daring cosmic theology that explained the reasons for the \"Tzimtzum\", the primordial catastrophe of \"Shevirat Hakelim\" (the \"Breaking of the Vessels\" of the \"Sefirot\" in the first existence), and the messianic \"Tikkun\" (\"Fixing\") of this by every individual through their sanctification of physicality. The concept of \"Tzimtzum\" contains a built-in paradox, as it requires that God be simultaneously transcendent and immanent:\n\n\n\n"}

This is evident in many Qur’anic verses or \"ayat\", one of the most important being:\n\"if anyone slays a human being, unless it be [in punishment] for murder or spreading corruption on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind.\"(Qur’an 5:32)\nIt is this verse which has ultimately fueled the interest in Islamic bioethics and within it exist two basic principles which ensure that the sanctity of human life is preserved:\n\nThough Muslims recognize and maintain that Allah is the ultimate source of life (Qur’an 2:258), the Qur’an illustrates that God has instilled in them reason, free will, the ability to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is unacceptable (Qur’an 91:8) while also supplying the provisions of nature (Qur’an 45:13). With these things, Muslims are held responsible for maintaining health and preventing illness. In the event that illness occurs, Muslims are obliged to seek medical treatment in a manner which is Islamically appropriate and permissible.\n\nThe fundamental basis of Islamic bioethics is that all rulings and actions must fall into accordance with Islamic law (shari’a) and Islamic ethics. By evaluating bioethical issues from and ethical and legal standpoint, jurists can issue decrees or fatwas regarding the permissibility of the pertaining subject. Any rule that has not been explicitly outlined in the religious texts or formulated from them by jurists is referred to as bid‘ah (innovation) and, therefore, is haram (impermissible). For this reason, all medical procedures and treatments, as well as conduct between patient and medical professional must be legitimized by the sources of Islamic law, \n\n\nPrinciples of bioethics in the Western world were first developed and outlined by two American philosophers and bioethicists, Tom Beauchamp and James F. Childress, in their book, \"Principles of Biomedical Ethics\". The concept of bioethical principles has since been regarded as a purely “Western” innovation which is absent in the Islamic health care system. These bioethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice have been legitimized by Muslims jurists as falling into the sphere of Islamic law and have also been supported by Qur’anic verses (Qur'an 3:104, 16:90 and 17:70). They have subsequently become the foundational spirit underlying the \"Oath of the Muslim Doctor\" and, thus, dictate the conduct between a Muslim physician and his or her patient.\n\nFormulations of rulings on bioethical issues in the Islamic context generally arise due to some form of deliberation between medical professionals and religious authority who have been recognized as most qualified individuals of location or time period. After being approached by health care officials, a member of the religious authority (mufti) may then consult the religious texts and determine whether or not a specific issue is obligatory (wajib/fard), recommended (mustahabb), neutral (mubah), discouraged (makruh) or forbidden (haram).\n\nAs health care and science have progressed over time, and the Muslim population has also increased to over one billion adherents over every continent on the globe, there have been increasingly prevalent circumstances for the evaluation of technological applications and bioethical issues to determine how they fit into the Islamic sphere. As a result, larger bodies of Islamic committees have been formed to address issues at hand. National Committees of Medical Ethics/Bioethics have been formed in many Islamic countries which work together with ulema to issue fatwas ensuring that neither the progress of medical science is hindered, nor the Islamic code of bioethics is jeopardized. The importance of Islamic law (sharia’) is so heavily valued that each issue is looked at independently and subsequently deemed permissible or impermissible. Specific issues addressed in the modern scientific era include abortion, fertility treatments, family planning, euthanasia, genetic research, cloning, stem cell research among many other issues.\n\nThe Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics (IMSE) Project is a multinational effort to produce a comprehensive collection of Islamic bioethics resources. Project staff members at two Georgetown University libraries, the Bioethics Research Library (Washington) and the School of Foreign Service-Qatar Library (Doha), have already compiled over 1,000 relevant written works into the IMSE Special Collection and have entered them into the searchable IMSE Database. The IMSE Project is funded by the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development.\n"}

Born Iván Nagy, his family name was changed to Böszörményi-Nagy during his childhood. He emigrated from Hungary to the United States in 1950, and he simplified his name to Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy at the time of his naturalization as a US citizen.\n\nBoszormenyi-Nagy is best known for developing the \"Contextual\" approach to family therapy and individual psychotherapy. It is a comprehensive model which integrates \"individual psychological\", \"interpersonal\", existential, systemic, and \"intergenerational\" dimensions of individual and family life and development.\n\nThe contextual model, in its most well-known formulation, proposes four dimensions of relational reality, both as a guide for conducting therapy and for conceptualizing relational reality in general: \nThese dimensions are taken to be inter-linked, but not equatable or reducible to one another.\n\nThe contextual model proposes \"relational ethics\"—the ethical or \"justice\" dimension of close relationships—as an overarching integrative conceptual and methodological principle. Relational ethics focuses in particular on the nature and roles of \"connectedness\", \"caring\", reciprocity, loyalty, \"legacy\", guilt, fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness - within and between generations. It is taken to represent not just a set of prescriptive norms, nor simply psychological phenomena, perspectives, or constructions. Rather, relational ethics is seen as (1) having some objective ontological and experiential basis by virtue of being derived from basic needs and from real relationships that have concrete consequences (i.e., as distinct from abstract or \"value\" ethics); and (2) as being significant explanatory and motivational dynamics operating - in both beneficial and destructive ways - in individuals, families, social groups, and broader society. The construct validity and significance of relational ethics in clinical and educational contexts have been supported by a number of studies. (See also \"Relational ethics\".)\n\nIn a later formulation of the contextual model, Boszormenyi-Nagy proposed a fifth dimension - the \"ontic dimension\" - which was implicit in the earlier formulations, but which considers more explicitly the nature of the interconnection between people that allows an individual to exist decisively as a \"person\", and not just a \"self\". \"(See also Intersubjectivity and Philosophy of dialogue.)\"\n\n\"Multidirected partiality\" is the main methodological principle of contextual therapy. Its aim is to evoke a dialogue of responsible mutual position-taking among family members. It consists of a sequential, empathic turning towards member after member (even absent members), in which both acknowledgement and expectation are directed at them. It is an alternative to the more common 'neutrality' or unilateral partiality of other approaches. It requires an appreciation of the 'ledger' from each person's point of view, even that of the current victimizer.\n\nFor example, a family comes into therapy desiring to fix their son's outbursts and oppositional defiant behavior. The therapist (and possibly a co-therapist where appropriate) would first seek basic information (including any relevant clinical or medical information), construct a genogram if possible, and have each family member explain their side of the story (either conjointly or in individual sessions as appropriate), in order to begin to understand the problem in terms of background facts, the relational context (i.e., \"intergenerational\", \"interpersonal\", and systemic), and deeper motivational factors (e.g., psychological processes, hidden \"loyalties\" and \"legacies\", \"ledger\" imbalances, \"destructive entitlement\" resulting from real or perceived injustices, \"scapegoating\", \"parentification\" of the child, etc.), and not simply (as is commonly done in some other approaches) in terms of the 'behaviour', 'systemic interactions', 'cognitions', or 'narratives' of the family and the son.\n\nHaving gained this preliminary understanding of the situation, the therapist would firstly address any issues requiring urgent attention (e.g., physical welfare, prevention of violence, etc.), especially in relation to the interests of the most vulnerable member(s), whether or not they are present at the therapy sessions. The therapist would then go further, carefully and sequentially 'taking the side' of each member (while seeking to maintain overall balance, but not 'joining' the family as occurs, for example, in structural therapy), the aim being to begin a genuine dialogue of mutual accountability, to reduce the reliance on dysfunctional acting-out, and to find resources (e.g., hope, will) for rebuilding relationships through mutual acknowledgement of both entitlements and obligations, shifts in attitude and intention (but not 'relabeling' as in strategic or constructivist approaches), fair exoneration, and redemptive or \"rejunctive\" (i.e., 'trust-building') actions, that will in turn build individual and relational maturity and integrity (i.e., \"self-validation\" and \"self-delineation\" - contextual counterparts of Bowen's \"differentiation\"), and \"trustworthiness\", which contextual therapists see as the ultimate relational resource for individual and family well-being.\n\nThe approach would be adapted - although the basic principles would remain the same - according to the particular case; for example: adults having problems with their siblings or elderly parents; couples issues; conflicts associated with blended families, adoption, fostering, gamete donation and surrogacy; migration and cross-cultural issues; different mental disorders; addiction and substance abuse; criminal behavior, domestic violence, and so on.\n\nThe contextual approach allows for the inclusion of many significant aspects of other approaches to psychotherapy and family therapy, provided that they are consistent with the overarching contextual principle of multilateral therapeutic ethical concern and accountability.\n\n\n\n"}

She was ranked for three consecutive years by the United States Squash Racquets Association among the nation’s top twenty women, placing 19th in 1979 (when she lost to Diana Nyad in the first round of the Women’s National Tournament), 15th in 1980, and 10th in 1981 (when she finished eighth in the National Tournament).\n\nWhiting did graduate work in Philosophy at Cornell, earning an M.A. in 1981 and a Ph.D. in 1984 (with a dissertation on \"Individual Forms in Aristotle,\" supervised by T.H. Irwin). She was Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Harvard from 1983 to 1986, then moved to the University of Pittsburgh, where she was granted tenure in 1991. She left for Cornell in 1997, and moved from there to the University of Toronto in 2003. She returned to Pittsburgh in 2015.\n\nWhiting has been a fellow at Stanford’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and Cornell’s Society for Humanities. She has also received fellowships from the ACLS, the Howard Foundation, and the NEH; was co-director (with psychologist Louis Sass of Rutgers) of an NEH Summer Institute on Mind, Self, and Psychopathology; and co-director (with her Pittsburgh colleague Stephen Engstrom) of an NEH conference that led to the publication of their co-edited volume: \"Aristotle, Kant, and the Stoics: Rethinking Happiness and Duty\" (Cambridge UP, 1996).\n\nIn 2007, Whiting received the Konrad Adenauer Research Award, given annually by the Alexander von Humboldt Association, in cooperation with the Royal Society of Canada, to recognize \"the entire academic record to date of an internationally renowned Canadian researcher in the Humanities or Social Sciences\". She spent 2007-08 doing research at the Humboldt University in Berlin, where she also co-taught a summer seminar on Aristotle’s Hylomorphism with faculty from Berlin, Oxford, Paris and Edinburgh. In 2014, she was made an Honorary Doctor of Science at Franklin and Marshall.\n\nWhiting has lectured widely in North America and Europe. Though her teaching interests range widely, and include Philosophy and Literature as well as Feminism, her publications are divided mainly between work in ancient philosophy and work on contemporary issues at the intersection of ethics, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. Though most of her work in ancient philosophy has been on Aristotle, she has recently started to work on Plato, and published a radical re-reading of his allegedly tripartite psychology: \"Psychic Contingency in the \"Republic\"\" (in \"Plato on the Divided Self,\" Barney, Brennan, and Brittain eds., Oxford UP 2013).\n\nWhiting’s work on personal identity takes concern for one’s future selves as a \"component\" of psychological continuity, and has been reprinted (alongside of work on that topic by philosophers ranging from Plato and Locke through Derek Parfit and Thomas Nagel) in a highly acclaimed anthology of readings in Metaphysics. She has worked closely with Sydney Shoemaker, and was co-editor (with Richard Moran and Alan Sidelle) of a double-issue of \"Philosophical Topics\" devoted to his work. She also worked closely with Annette Baier and has published two pieces celebrating Baier’s career. One piece, drawing on the work of Virginia Woolf, appears in a volume Whiting co-edited with two of Baier’s former students on whose committees she also served (Joyce Jenkins and Christopher Williams).\n\nOxford University Press is publishing three volumes of Whiting’s papers. \"First, Second, and Other Selves: Essays on Friendship and Personal Identity\" is in press and scheduled to appear in May 2016. \"Thinking and Acting Together: Essays on Aristotle’s Ethics\" is scheduled to appear in 2017, with \"Body and Soul: Essays on Aristotle’s Hylomorphism\" following in 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "1762870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1762870", "title": "Letter of Peter to Philip", "text": "Letter of Peter to Philip\n\nThe Letter of Peter to Philip is a gnostic Christian epistle found in the Nag Hammadi Library in Egypt. It was dated to be written around late 2nd century to early 3rd century CE and focuses on a post-crucifixion appearance and teachings of Jesus Christ to the apostles on the Mount of Olives, or Mount Olivet.\n\nThe Letter of Peter to Philip, found in the cache of texts at Nag Hammadi and bound into Codex VIII, contains a brief letter purporting to be from Saint Peter to Saint Philip, followed by a narrative and gnostic discourse upon the nature of Christ. It was probably written in the late 2nd century or the beginning of the 3rd, originally in Greek, but translated into Coptic in the Nag Hammadi text. The title of the Letter is originally \"The Letter of Peter Which He Sent to Philip\", but is commonly simplified to \"The Letter of Peter to Philip\". Another copy of the letter has more recently been found in the Codex Tchacos and is titled plainly as \"The Letter of Peter to Philip\".\n\nThe Nag Hammadi Library is a collection of thirteen codices that was found near the Egyptian city of Nag Hammadi in 1945. Many writings found in this library are referred to as “Gnostic Gospels” because most of the documents contain gnostic teachings that conflicted with the beliefs of proto-orthodox Christianity, which at the time was becoming the predominant form of Christianity. Therefore, most were rejected from the canon as Orthodox Christianity was formed in the early centuries C.E.\n\nThe Letter of Peter to Philip begins with a greeting from the apostle Peter, the presumed author of this letter. It continues with Peter speaking directly to Philip, expressing his (Peter’s) wish that Philip rejoin the apostles in their evangelization mission. When Philip and the apostles meet on the Mount Olives, they prayed together twice, each time emphasizing light as a symbol of Jesus. After their prayers, the apostles are visited by a great light from the sky identifying itself as “Jesus Christ who is with you forever”. He began teaching the apostles of the aeons and their pleroma, followed by a series of questions from apostles about their struggles against the archons and how much they must suffer for the sake of their faith. Once the light disappeared from them, the apostles left the Mount Olives to go to Jerusalem, continuing their evangelization.\n\nThe Letter of Peter to Philip is the last concluding tractate of the Nag Hammadi Codex VIII. Its predecessor is the Sethian text, \"Zostrianos\". It is speculated by scholars that the Letter of Peter to Philip was chosen as the last tractate for its convenience of brevity. This is supported by the fact that the Letter and \"Zostrianos\" share little theological or literary relationship. The Letter uses passages that are reminiscent of the Gospel of John and Acts of the Apostles which indicates that the author may have attempted to classify the text as one of the acts of the apostles.\n\nThe Letter is considered to be Petrine in nature because of Peter's position as the leader of the apostles. The addressee of the Letter, Saint Philip, is portrayed as submissive, answering to Saint Peter's authority. In early Christianity, there was a conflict between the traditions associated with Peter and Philip. This letter is supposed by some scholars to be a \"Petrine document designed to promote Peter's primacy in the early church.\" In addition, this document attempts to claim true apostolic authority by connecting the teachings Jesus gives in this post-crucifixion appearance with those he delivered during his earthly ministry. This would have been a bold assertion in the face of the proto-orthodox Christianity that was gaining power over other types of early Christianity.\n\n\n"}

He taught Romance Languages at Johns Hopkins University and Princeton University, and has written extensively on the history, theory and practice of historiography, and more recently, on aspects of German cultural history.\n\nGossman was born in Glasgow, Scotland and educated in public schools in the city, and during World War II, the surrounding countryside. In 1951, he graduated with an M.A. (Hons.) degree in French and German literature from the University of Glasgow. In 1952, he obtained the \"Diplôme d'Études Supérieures\" at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, and wrote his thesis \"The Idea of the Golden Age in \"Le Roman de la Rose.\"\"\n\nFrom 1952-1954, Gossman served in the Royal Navy where he was trained to be a simultaneous English-Russian translator. Upon completion of national service in 1954, he entered the then newly founded St. Antony's College, the first exclusively graduate college of Oxford University. In 1958 he completed a doctoral dissertation on scholarly research and writing on the Middle Ages during the French Enlightenment (\"The World and Work of \"La Curne de Sainte-Palaye\"\").\n\nAfter a brief stint as Assistant Lecturer at the University of Glasgow (1957–1958), Gossman accepted a teaching position in the Department of Romance Languages at The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He rose through the ranks, becoming professor in 1966, head of the French section of the Department in 1968, and chair in 1975. Gossman says he was fortunate to have as colleagues and friends in those years René Girard, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Lucien Goldmann, Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Serres and Louis Marin. Gossman recalls in his autobiography:\n\nIn 1976, Gossman moved to Princeton University, where he spent 23 \"calm, happy, productive and personally and intellectually fulfilling years.\" He served on key university committees, and from 1991-1996 chaired the Romance Languages Department. In 1990 he received Princeton's Howard T. Berhman Award for distinguished service in the humanities.\n\nIn 1991 he was made an Officer in the Ordre des Palmes Académiques; in 1996, he was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society; and in 2005 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities from Princeton University. Gossman has also served on the editorial boards of The Johns Hopkins University Press, the Princeton University Press and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nSince retiring in 1999, Gossman has resumed his undergraduate studies of German culture. He has written a number of articles on aspects of 19th-century German art and cultural politics, including several studies of the Nazarene movement. On the Nazarenes, he has authored the study \"Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Painters of the Nineteenth Century\" and the book \"The Making of a Romantic Icon: The Religious Context of Friedrich Overbeck's 'Italia und Germania.'\"\n\nAlong with articles on a wide range of topics, as of April 2010 Gossman has published 14 books. Here are summaries and reviews of some of his best-known books:\n\n\nThough the great German classical scholar Theodor Mommsen was probably unaware of it, he was the object of the passionate and enduring hatred of J. J. Bachofen, an obscure Swiss philologist in the provincial city of Basle. Bachofen, not well known in the English-speaking world, is mentioned by anthropologists for his contribution to the popular 19th-century theory of \"matriarchy\", and by classicists such as George Derwent Thomson for his contributions to the study of Greek myth and tragedy. Arnaldo Momigliano writes in \"The Journal of Modern History:\n\n\nGossman maintains that underlying the argument that historiography cannot be subsumed under a poetics or a rhetoric is a larger claim, namely that a wide range of activities, from literary criticism, through legal debate, theology, ethics, politics, psychology, and medicine to the natural sciences, all constitute rational practices, even if there is considerable variation in the degree of formalism and rigor and in the type of argument most commonly employed in each of these different fields of inquiry.\n\nHence Gossman emphasizes the practice or process of doing history rather than the product. What appeals to him in the idea of reason as a practice is its open, liberal, and democratic character. Historiography as a rational practice supposes a community of participants rather than the \"anomie\" of a world in which every man is his own historian that appears to be implied by privileging the historical \"text.\" Edward Berenson writes in his book \"The Trial of Madame Caillaux:\"\n\nDrawing on English, German and French scholarship, the essays in this volume illuminate the many facets of the problematic relationship between history and literature, and show how each discipline both challenges and undermines the other's absolutist pretensions. Includes Gossman's seminal study on French historian Augustin Thierry (\"Augustin Thierry and Liberal Historiography\") and two important essays on French historian Jules Michelet. Ceri Crossley writes in the journal \"French History\":\n\n\nAfter co-teaching with Carl Schorske an undergraduate seminar on the civic culture of 19th century Basel, Switzerland, Gossman worked on this book for 20 years. Gossman argues that the peculiar, somewhat anachronistic political and social structure of Basel made it a favorable haven for \"untimely\" ideas that challenged the positivism and optimistic progressivism of the time: the philosophy of Nietzsche, the historiography of Bachofen and Burckhardt, and the theology of Franz Overbeck. Awarded the American Historical Association's 2001 George L. Mosse Prize for an outstanding work on the intellectual and cultural history of Europe since the Renaissance. John R. Hinde writes in the \"American Historical Review\":\n\n\nGossman focuses on Johann Friedrich Overbeck's painting \"Italia and Germania\" to discuss the importance of religious conversion in Romantic thought. This book serves as a thoughtful introduction to the way of thinking of one of the most important of the Nazarene movement painters. It treats the evolution of the Nazarene artists’ preoccupation with religious issues in an engaging manner and offers a social-historical and theological context to Overbeck's painting. Won the American Philosophical Society's 2007 John Frederick Lewis Award for best book or monograph.\n\n\nMarie Adelheid, Prinzessin Reuß-zur Lippe, was a rebellious young woman and aspiring writer from an ancient princely family who became a fervent Nazi. Heinrich Vogeler was a well-regarded \"Jugendstil\" (Art Nouveau) artist who joined the German Communist Party and later emigrated to the Soviet Union. Ludwig Roselius was a successful Bremen businessman who had made a fortune from his invention of decaffeinated coffee.\n\nWhat was it about the revolutionary climate following Germany's defeat in World War I that induced three such different personalities to collaborate in the production of a slim volume of poetry - entitled \"Gott in mir (God in Me)\" - about the indwelling of the divine within the human? Gossman's study provides insight into the sources and character of the \"Nazi Conscience.\" \n\nFirst published in Germany in 1929, this is a new and corrected English translation of a memoir recounting a rebellious young woman's struggle to achieve independence. Born in 1883 into a wealthy aristocratic society of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hermynia Zur Mühlen spent much of her childhood traveling in Europe and North Africa with her diplomat father. After five years on her German husband's estate in Czarist Russia, she broke with both her family and her husband and set out on a precarious career as a professional writer. She also became a convinced and passionate socialist and devoted her considerable literary talent to the propagation of socialism and the struggle against Nazism and anti-Semitism. The author of novels (most of them translated into English), short stories, and highly successful \"proletarian\" children's fairy tales, she also translated from French, Russian, and English (notably most of the works of Upton Sinclair) into German. Because of her outspoken opposition to National Socialism, she had to flee first Germany in 1933, then her native Austria in 1938, and seek refuge in England, where she died, virtually penniless in 1951. This edition of her memoir is accompanied by thumbnail sketches of the many individuals and events mentioned in it and thus evokes an entire vanished age. In addition, Gossman contributes a comprehensive study of Zur Mühlen's life and work in the form of a \"Tribute\" to a talented and unjustly neglected woman writer.\n\n\nIn the past half-century the writing of history has been the object of much critical scrutiny on the part of literary scholars, philosophers, and historians. History painting has traditionally been an important topic in art history. The illustration of history books in contrast, has not attracted much attention. \"Figuring History\" is a preliminary inquiry into the changing ways in which graphics, ranging from representational images to statistical charts, have been used to enhance or illuminate historical texts.\n\n\nBorn into a prominent German Jewish banking family, Baron Max von Oppenheim (1860-1946)was a keen amateur archaeologist and ethnographer. His discovery and excavation of Tell Halaf in Syria was a major contribution to knowledge of the ancient Middle East; his massive study of the Bedouins is still consulted by scholars today. Oppenheim was also an ardent German patriot, eager to secure for his country its \"place in the sun.\" Excluded by his part-Jewish ancestry from the regular German diplomatic service, he earned a reputation among the British and the French as \"the Kaiser's spy\" because of his intriguing with nationalist groups in Egypt and North Africa and his plan, on the outbreak of World War I, to incite Muslims under British, French, and Russian rule to a jihad against their rulers. Despite being \"half-Jewish\" according to the Nuremberg Laws, Oppenheim was not molested by the Nazis. In fact, he placed his knowledge of the Middle East and his contacts with Muslim leaders at the service of the regime. \"The Passion of Max von Oppenheim\" tells the unsettling story of one part-Jewish man's passion for his country in the face of persistent and, in his later years, genocidal anti-Semitism. Its focus is on the political attitudes of highly acculturated and wealthy German Jews in the Kaiserzeit and in the face of National Socialism.\n\n\nRespected by his peers and hugely successful internationally in the first half of the twentieth century—in 1935 the English translation of one of his fifteen major biographies was the first book to be published in Allen Lane's pioneering Penguin paperback series (Penguin #1) -- Maurois is now hardly read. His liberal humanism, his moderate and conciliatory stance in everything from politics to his lucid and elegant writing style, his \"politeness\" as he put it himself, appealed in his own time to a broad educated public. As manners values, and society have changed, and unquestioning respect for a shared European cultural tradition has diminished, have the very characteristics that once ensured Maurois' popularity caused new generations of readers to find his work, when they are aware of it, outdated and of little interest?\n\n'Jules Michelet: On History'(2014)()\n\nThree programmatic essays on history by one of the greatest of Romantic historians, interest in whose work was revived by the celebrated modern \"Annales\" school. The first, translated by Flora Kimmich, and the second, translated by Lionel Gossman, are available here for the first time in English translation; the third, the Preface to the 1869 edition of the Histoire de France, originally published in its first English translation by Edward K. Kaplan in 1977, has been revised by the translator for this volume. Edited and with a foreword by Lionel Gossman.\n\nGossman continues to work on a book-length study of Heinrich Vogeler, a successful turn-of-the-century German artist and illustrator and a friend of the poet Rilke. Gossman is interested in Vogeler's transformation from a dandy and aesthete in the years before World War I into a left-wing anarchist and then Communist in the years following the war, and in his dogged search for an artistic form appropriate to his changed convictions and worldview.\n\n"}

According to him, the case was known at the highest levels of the French state, but he provided no specifics as to the persons involved, citing the risk of being sued for libel. A criminal investigation was then opened and he was asked to cooperate with the prosecutors.\n\nIn June 2011, \"Le Canard Enchaîné\", \"Le Monde\" and other media revealed that Luc Ferry, a professor at Paris Diderot University since 1996 (or 1997, depending on sources) had not ever taught there — when he was minister, he was on leave, and when not on leave his obligation to teach was waived in order for him to undertake other official duties. Some of those came with compensation pay, while he was still paid as a professor. In 2010, however, a change in legislation (introduced by minister Valérie Pécresse) made the University financially autonomous. It did not want to have professors on its payroll that did not teach, which may have made its president liable for misuse of public funds; it then required Luc Ferry to do his allocated teaching share, which he declined to do. In 2011, according to some sources, the university is threatening to get him to refund his salary (€4500 per month).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "313055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313055", "title": "Mere addition paradox", "text": "Mere addition paradox\n\nThe mere addition paradox, also known as the repugnant conclusion, is a problem in ethics, identified by Derek Parfit and discussed in his book \"Reasons and Persons\" (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations.\n\nConsider the four populations depicted in the following diagram: A, A+, B− and B. Each bar represents a distinct group of people, with the group's size represented by the bar's width and the happiness of each of the group's members represented by the bar's height. Unlike A and B, A+ and B− are complex populations, each comprising two distinct groups of people.\n\nHow do these populations compare in value? \n\nParfit observes that i) A+ seems no worse than A. This is because the people in A are no worse-off in A+, while the additional people who exist in A+ are better off in A+ compared to A (if it is stipulated that their lives are good enough that living them is better than not existing).\n\nNext, Parfit suggests that ii) B− seems better than A+. This is because B− has greater total and average happiness than A+.\n\nThen, he notes that iii) B seems equally as good as B−, as the only difference between B− and B is that the two groups in B− are merged to form one group in B.\n\nTogether, these three comparisons entail that B is better than A. However, Parfit observes that when we directly compare A (a population with high average happiness) and B (a population with lower average happiness, but more total happiness because of its larger population), it may seem that B can be worse than A.\n\nThus, there is a paradox. The following intuitively plausible claims are jointly incompatible: (a) that A+ is no worse than A, (b) that B− is better than A+, (c) that B− is equally as good as B, and (d) that B can be worse than A.\n\nSome scholars, such as Larry Temkin and Stuart Rachels, argue that the apparent inconsistency between the four claims just outlined relies on the assumption that the \"better than\" relation is transitive. We may resolve the inconsistency, thus, by rejecting the assumption. On this view, from the fact that A+ is no worse than A and that B− is better than A+ it simply does not follow that B− is better than A.\n\nTorbjörn Tännsjö argues that the intuition that B is worse than A is wrong. While the lives of those in B are worse than those in A, there are more of them and thus the collective value of B is greater than A. Michael Huemer also argues that the repugnant conclusion is not repugnant and that normal intuition is wrong.\n\nHowever, the above discussion fails to appreciate the true source of repugnance. On the face of it, it may not be absurd to think that B is better than A. Suppose, then, that B is in fact better than A, as Huemer argues. It follows that this revised intuition must hold in subsequent iterations of the original steps. For example, the next iteration would add even more people to B+, and then take the average of the total happiness, resulting in C-. If these steps are repeated over and over, the eventual result will be Z, a massive population with the minimum level of average happiness; this would be a population in which every member is leading a life barely worth living. Z is the repugnant conclusion.\n\nAn alternative use of the term \"mere addition paradox\" was presented in a paper by Hassoun in 2010. It identifies paradoxical reasoning that occurs when certain statistical measures are used to calculate results over a population. For example, if a group of 100 people together control $100 worth of resources, the average wealth per capita is $1. If a single rich person then arrives with 1 million dollars, then the total group of 101 people controls $1,000,100, making average wealth per capita $9,901, implying a drastic shift away from poverty even though nothing has changed for the original 100 people. Hassoun defines a \"no mere addition axiom\" to be used for judging such statistical measures: \"merely adding a rich person to a population should not decrease poverty\" (although acknowledging that in actual practice adding rich people to a population may provide some benefit to the whole population).\n\nThis same argument can be generalized to many cases where proportional statistics are used: for example, a game sold on a download service may be considered a failure if less than 20% of those who download the demo then purchase the game.

{"id": "340238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340238", "title": "Occasionalism", "text": "Occasionalism\n\nOccasionalism is a philosophical theory about causation which says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by God. (A related theory, which has been called \"occasional causation\", also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events, but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them.) The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of God's causing of one event after another. However, there is no necessary connection between the two: it is not that the first event \"causes\" God to cause the second event: rather, God first causes one and then causes the other.\n\nThe doctrine first reached prominence in the Islamic theological schools of Iraq, especially in Basra. The ninth century theologian Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari argued that there is no Secondary Causation in the created order. The world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation. As such the world is in a constant state of recreation by God.\n\nThe most famous proponent of the Asharite occasionalist doctrine was Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali, an 11th-century theologian based in Baghdad. In \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\", Al-Ghazali launched a philosophical critique against Neoplatonic-influenced early Islamic philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. In response to the philosophers' claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes (God being, as it were, the Primary and Final Cause in an ontological and logical sense), Ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity. There is no independent necessitation of change and becoming, other than what God has ordained. To posit an independent causality outside of God's knowledge and action is to deprive Him of true agency, and diminish his attribute of power. In his famous example, when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire, but through God's direct intervention, a claim which he defended using logic. In the 12th century, this theory was defended and further strengthened by the Islamic theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, using his expertise in the natural sciences of astronomy, cosmology and physics.\n\nBecause God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the laws of nature. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) — in other words, his rational will. This is not, however, an essential element of an occasionalist account, and occasionalism can include positions where God's behaviour (and thus that of the world) is viewed as ultimately inscrutable, thus maintaining God's essential transcendence. On this understanding, apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such: they are simply God behaving in a way that \"appears\" unusual \"to us\". Given his transcendent freedom, he is not bound even by his own nature. Miracles, as breaks in the rational structure of the universe, can occur, since God's relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles.\n\nIn 1993, Karen Harding's paper \"Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory\" described several \"remarkable\" similarities between Ghazali's concept of occasionalism and the (disputed) Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. She stated: \"In both cases, and contrary to common sense, objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence. In order for an object to exist, it must be brought into being either by God (al Ghazili) or by an observer (the Copenhagen Interpretation).\"\n\nIn a 1978 article in \"Studia Islamica\", Lenn Goodman asks the question, \"Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?\" and demonstrates that Ghazali did not deny the existence of observed, \"worldly\" causation. According to Goodman's analysis, Ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect: rather, Ghazali argues that there is no \"necessary\" link between observed cause and effect.\n\nOne of the motivations for the theory is the dualist belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their essences that one cannot affect the other. Thus, a person's mind cannot be the true cause of his hand's moving, nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish. In other words, the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa. Also, occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either, for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects. The will of God is taken to be necessary.\n\nThe doctrine is, however, more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the Cartesian school. There are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in Descartes's own writings, but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations. However, many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position. In one form or another, the doctrine can be found in the writings of: Johannes Clauberg, Claude Clerselier, Gerauld de Cordemoy, Arnold Geulincx, Louis de La Forge, François Lamy, and (most notably), Nicolas Malebranche.\n\nThese occasionalists' negative argument, that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events, was anticipated by certain arguments of Nicholas of Autrecourt in the fourteenth century, and were later taken up by David Hume in the eighteenth. Hume, however, stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory, where God was called upon to replace such connections, complaining that \"We are got into fairy land [...] Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses.\" Instead, Hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself. George Berkeley was also inspired by the occasionalists, and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies. For Berkeley, bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds, and all such ideas were, as he put it, \"visibly inactive\". However, Berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances, but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all. On the contrary, every simple substance had the power to produce changes in \"itself\". The illusion of transeunt efficient causation, for Leibniz, arose out of the pre-established harmony between the alterations produced immanently within different substances.\n\n\n"}

For his body of work, he was awarded the 1981 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1982 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and the 1990 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nBorn March 31, 1914, Octavio Paz was introduced to literature early in his life through the influence of his grandfather's library, filled with classic Mexican and European literature. During the 1920s, he discovered Gerardo Diego, Juan Ramón Jiménez, and Antonio Machado, Spanish writers who had a great influence on his early writings.\n\nAs a teenager in 1931, Paz published his first poems, including \"Cabellera\". Two years later, at the age of 19, he published \"Luna Silvestre\" (\"Wild Moon\"), a collection of poems. In 1932, with some friends, he founded his first literary review, \"Barandal\". In 1937 at the age of 23, Paz abandoned his law studies and left Mexico City for Yucatán to work at a school in Mérida, set up for the sons of peasants and workers. There, he began working on the first of his long, ambitious poems, \"Entre la piedra y la flor\" (\"Between the Stone and the Flower\") (1941, revised in 1976). Influenced by the work of T. S. Eliot, it explores the situation of the Mexican peasant under the domineering landlords of the day.\n\nIn 1937, Paz was invited to the Second International Writers Congress in Defense of Culture in Spain during the country's civil war; he showed his solidarity with the Republican side and against fascism. Upon his return to Mexico, Paz co-founded a literary journal, \"Taller\" (\"Workshop\") in 1938, and wrote for the magazine until 1941. In 1937 he married Elena Garro, who is considered one of Mexico's finest writers. They had met in 1935. They had one daughter, Helena, and were divorced in 1959.\n\nIn 1943, Paz received a Guggenheim fellowship and used it to study at the University of California at Berkeley in the United States. Two years later he entered the Mexican diplomatic service, and was assigned for a time to New York City. In 1945, he was sent to Paris, where he wrote \"El Laberinto de la Soledad\" (\"The Labyrinth of Solitude\"). \"The New York Times\" later described it as \"an analysis of modern Mexico and the Mexican personality in which he described his fellow countrymen as instinctive nihilists who hide behind masks of solitude and ceremoniousness.\" In 1952, he travelled to India for the first time. That same year, he went to Tokyo, as chargé d'affaires. He next was assigned to Geneva, Switzerland. He returned to Mexico City in 1954, where he wrote his great poem \"Piedra de sol\" (\"Sunstone\") in 1957, and published \"Libertad bajo palabra\" (\"Liberty under Oath\"), a compilation of his poetry up to that time. He was sent again to Paris in 1959. In 1962, he was named Mexico's ambassador to India.\n\nIn India, Paz completed several works, including \"El mono gramático\" (\"The Monkey Grammarian\") and \"Ladera este\" (\"Eastern Slope\"). While in India, he met numerous writers of a group known as the Hungry Generation and had a profound influence on them.\nHe met his first wife Elena Garro a writer in Mexico City and was married to her in 1937, they were together until 1959. They had a daughter Helena Laura Paz Garro.\n\nIn 1965, he married Marie-José Tramini, a French woman who would be his wife for the rest of his life. In October 1968, he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest of the Mexican government's massacre of student demonstrators in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco.\n\nAfter staying in Paris for refuge, he returned to Mexico in 1969. He founded his magazine \"Plural\" (1970–1976) with a group of liberal Mexican and Latin American writers.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970 he was Simón Bolívar Professor at Cambridge University. He was also a visiting lecturer during the late 1960s and the A. D. White Professor-at-Large from 1972 to 1974 at Cornell University. In 1974 he lectured at Harvard University as Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer. His book \"Los hijos del limo\" (\"Children of the Mire\") was the result of those lectures. After the Mexican government closed \"Plural\" in 1975, Paz founded \"Vuelta\", another cultural magazine. He was editor of that until his death in 1998, when the magazine closed.\n\nHe won the 1977 Jerusalem Prize for literature on the theme of individual freedom. In 1980, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Harvard, and in 1982, he won the Neustadt Prize. Once good friends with novelist Carlos Fuentes, Paz became estranged from him in the 1980s in a disagreement over the Sandinistas, whom Paz opposed and Fuentes supported. In 1988, Paz's magazine \"Vuelta\" published criticism of Fuentes by Enrique Krauze, resulting in estrangement between Paz and Fuentes, who had long been friends.\n\nA collection of Paz's poems (written between 1957 and 1987) was published in 1990. In 1990, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nHe died of cancer on April 19, 1998, in Mexico City.\n\nGuillermo Sheridan, who was named by Paz as director of the Octavio Paz Foundation in 1998, published a book, \"Poeta con paisaje\" (2004) with several biographical essays about the poet's life up to 1998, when he died.\n\n\"The poetry of Octavio Paz\", wrote the critic Ramón Xirau, \"does not hesitate between language and silence; it leads into the realm of silence where true language lives.\"\n\nA prolific author and poet, Paz published scores of works during his lifetime, many of which have been translated into other languages. His poetry has been translated into English by Samuel Beckett, Charles Tomlinson, Elizabeth Bishop, Muriel Rukeyser and Mark Strand. His early poetry was influenced by Marxism, surrealism, and existentialism, as well as religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. His poem, \"Piedra de sol\" (\"Sunstone\"), written in 1957, was praised as a \"magnificent\" example of surrealist poetry in the presentation speech of his Nobel Prize.\n\nHis later poetry dealt with love and eroticism, the nature of time, and Buddhism. He also wrote poetry about his other passion, modern painting, dedicating poems to the work of Balthus, Joan Miró, Marcel Duchamp, Antoni Tàpies, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roberto Matta. As an essayist Paz wrote on topics such as Mexican politics and economics, Aztec art, anthropology, and sexuality. His book-length essay, \"The Labyrinth of Solitude\" (Spanish: \"El laberinto de la soledad\"), delves into the minds of his countrymen, describing them as hidden behind masks of solitude. Due to their history, their identity is lost between a pre-Columbian and a Spanish culture, negating either. A key work in understanding Mexican culture, it greatly influenced other Mexican writers, such as Carlos Fuentes. Ilan Stavans wrote that he was \"the quintessential surveyor, a Dante's Virgil, a Renaissance man\".\nPaz wrote the play \"La hija de Rappaccini\" in 1956. The plot centers around a young Italian student who wanders about Professor Rappaccini's beautiful gardens where he spies the professor's daughter Beatrice. He is horrified to discover the poisonous nature of the garden's beauty. Paz adapted the play from an 1844 short story by American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne, which was also entitled \"Rappaccini's Daughter\". He combined Hawthorne's story with sources from the Indian poet Vishakadatta and influences from Japanese Noh theatre, Spanish \"autos sacramentales\", and the poetry of William Butler Yeats. The play's opening performance was designed by the Mexican painter Leonora Carrington. In 1972, Surrealist author André Pieyre de Mandiargues translated the play into French as \"La fille de Rappaccini \" (Editions Mercure de France). First performed in English in 1996 at the Gate Theatre in London, the play was translated and directed by Sebastian Doggart and starred Sarah Alexander as Beatrice.\n\nThe Mexican composer Daniel Catán adapted the play as an opera in 1992.\n\nPaz's other works translated into English include several volumes of essays, some of the more prominent of which are \"Alternating Current\" (tr. 1973), \"Configurations\" (tr. 1971), in the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works, \"The Labyrinth of Solitude\" (tr. 1963), \"The Other Mexico\" (tr. 1972); and \"El Arco y la Lira\" (1956; tr. \"The Bow and the Lyre\", 1973). In the United States, Helen Lane's translation of \"Alternating Current\" won a National Book Award.\nAlong with these are volumes of critical studies and biographies, including of Claude Lévi-Strauss and Marcel Duchamp (both, tr. 1970), and \"The Traps of Faith\", an analytical biography of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, the Mexican 17th-century nun, feminist poet, mathematician, and thinker.\n\nHis works include the poetry collections \"¿Águila o sol?\" (1951), \"La Estación Violenta\", (1956), \"Piedra de Sol\" (1957), and in English translation the most prominent include two volumes that include most of Paz in English: \"Early Poems: 1935–1955\" (tr. 1974), and \"Collected Poems, 1957–1987\" (1987). Many of these volumes have been edited and translated by Eliot Weinberger, who is Paz's principal translator into American English.\n\nOriginally Paz supported the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, but after learning of the murder of one of his friends by the Republicans, he became gradually disillusioned. While in Paris in the early 1950s, influenced by David Rousset, André Breton and Albert Camus, he started publishing his critical views on totalitarianism in general, and particularly against Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn his magazines \"Plural\" and \"Vuelta\", Paz exposed the violations of human rights in communist regimes, including Castro's Cuba. This brought him much animosity from sectors of the Latin American left. In the prologue to Volume IX of his complete works, Paz stated that from the time when he abandoned communist dogma, the mistrust of many in the Mexican intelligentsia started to transform into an intense and open enmity. Paz continued to consider himself a man of the left, the democratic, \"liberal\" left, not the dogmatic and illiberal one. He also criticized the Mexican government and leading party that dominated the nation for most of the 20th century.\n\nPolitically, Paz was basically a social democrat, who became increasingly supportive of liberal ideas without ever renouncing to his initial leftist and romantic views. In fact, Paz was \"very slippery for anyone thinking in rigid ideological categories,\" Yvon Grenier wrote in his book on Paz's political thought. \"Paz was simultaneously a romantic who spurned materialism and reason, a liberal who championed freedom and democracy, a conservative who respected tradition, and a socialist who lamented the withering of fraternity and equality. An advocate of fundamental transformation in the way we see ourselves and modern society, Paz was also a promoter of incremental change, not revolution.\"\n\nIn 1990, during the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall, Paz and his \"Vuelta\" colleagues invited several of the world's writers and intellectuals to Mexico City to discuss the collapse of communism. Writers included Czesław Miłosz, Hugh Thomas, Daniel Bell, Ágnes Heller, Cornelius Castoriadis, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Jean-François Revel, Michael Ignatieff, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jorge Edwards and Carlos Franqui. The encounter was called \"The experience of freedom\" (Spanish: \"La experiencia de la libertad\") and broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September.\n\nPaz criticized the Zapatista uprising in 1994. He spoke broadly in favor of a \"military solution\" to the uprising of January 1994, and hoped that the \"army would soon restore order in the region\". With respect to President Zedillo's offensive in February 1995, he signed an open letter that described the offensive as a \"legitimate government action\" to reestablish the \"sovereignty of the nation\" and to bring \"Chiapas peace and Mexicans tranquility\".\n\nPaz was dazzled by \"The Waste Land\" by T. S. Eliot, in Enrique Munguia's translation as \"El Páramo\" which was published in the magazine \"Contemporaries\" in 1930. As a result of this, although he maintained his primary interest in poetry, he had an unavoidable outlook on prose: \"Literally, this dual practice was for me a game of reflections between poetry and prose\".\n\nWorried about confirming the existence of a link between morals and poetry, in 1931, at the age of 16, he wrote what would be his first published article, \"Ethics of the Artist\", where he planted the question about the duty of an artist among what would be deemed art of thesis, or pure art, which disqualifies the second as a result of the teaching of tradition. Assimilating a language that resembles a religious style and, paradoxically, a Marxist style, finds the true value of art in its purpose and meaning, for which, the followers of pure art, of which he's not one, are found in an isolated position and favor the kantiana idea of the \"man that loses all relation with the world\".\n\nThe magazine \"Barandal\" appeared in August 1931, put together by Rafael López Malo, Salvador Toscano, Arnulfo Martínez Lavalle and Octavio Paz. All of them were not yet in their youth except for Salvador Toscano, who was a renowned writer thanks to his parents. Rafael López participated in the magazine, \"Modern\" and, as well as Miguel D. Martínez Rendón, in the movimiento de los agoristas, although it was more commented on and known by the high school students, over all for his poem, \"The Golden Beast\". Octavio Paz Solórzano became known in his circle as the occasional author of literary narratives that appeared in the Sunday newspaper add-in El Universal, as well as Ireneo Paz which was the name that gave a street in Mixcoac identity.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nietzsche identifies this motivation with pride. On this point the essay prefigures theories concerning a destructive \"will to truth\" that Nietzsche discusses in \"On the Genealogy of Morals\", \"Beyond Good and Evil\", and \"The Gay Science\".\n\nAs an illustration of a motivated seeker of truth, Nietzsche takes Heraclitus, although he also discusses Pythagoras and Empedocles. He recounts Heraclitus as being psychologically distant from other people, due to being aware of truth while others are not: \nNietzsche's focus is on the psychology and social life of the philosopher, identifying misanthropy and seclusion as the result of being motivated toward knowledge itself, regardless of any features of the philosopher's cosmology, physics, or epistemology.\n\nNietzsche concludes the essay by identifying a need to have art along with knowledge. Art is necessary because it adds emotion and purpose to society. Knowledge is limited; for example, a knowledge of matter and motion will not reveal any purpose in the universe. While the motivation for knowledge in itself brings about insights which help society, art allows constant variation which can affirm a sense a purposiveness, which is an emotional need of individuals.\n\n\"On the Pathos of Truth\" was written in 1872, and was intended to be a preface or foreword, but no book was ever written to follow it. Nietzsche, however, did collect it, along with four other such prefaces to unwritten books, and gave the edition to Cosima Wagner as a Christmas present.\n\n"}
{"id": "1884270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1884270", "title": "Peace News", "text": "Peace News\n\nPeace News (PN) is a pacifist magazine first published on 6 June 1936 to serve the peace movement in the United Kingdom. From later in 1936 to April 1961 it was the official paper of the Peace Pledge Union (PPU), and from 1990 to 2004 was co-published with War Resisters' International.\n\n\"Peace News\" was begun by Humphrey Moore who was a Quaker and in 1933 had become editor of the National Peace Council's publications. Working with a peace group in Wood Green, London, Moore and his wife, Kathleen (playing the role of business manager), launched \"Peace News\" with a free trial issue in June 1936. With distribution through Moore’s contacts with the National Peace Council, the new magazine rapidly attracted attention. Within six weeks, Dick Sheppard, founder of the Peace Pledge Union, proposed to Moore that \"Peace News\" should become the PPU’s paper. Early contributors to this new organ of the PPU included Mohandas Gandhi, George Lansbury, and illustrator Arthur Wragg. \"Peace News\" also had a large number of women contributors, including Vera Brittain, Storm Jameson, Rose Macaulay, Ethel Mannin, Ruth Fry, Kathleen Lonsdale and Sybil Morrison.\n\nSome contributors were so sympathetic to the grievances of Nazi Germany that one sceptical member found it difficult to distinguish between letters to \"Peace News\" and those in the newspaper of the British Union of Fascists. The historian Mark Gilbert has argued that \"With the exception of \"Action\", the journal of the British Union of Fascists, it is hard to think of another British newspaper which was so consistent an apologist for Nazi Germany as \"Peace News\".\" However, Juliet Gardiner has noted that \"Peace News\" also urged the British government to give sanctuary to Jewish refugees from Nazism. The fact that some PN contributors were supporting appeasement and excusing Nazi actions caused PN contributor David Spreckley to express fears that \"in their scramble for peace\", they were gaining \"some questionable allies\".\n\nSales of \"Peace News\" peaked at around 40,000 during the so-called Phoney War between September 1939 and May 1940. In that month in the face of demands in parliament for the banning of the paper, the printer and distributors stopped working with \"Peace News\". However, with help from the typographer Eric Gill, Hugh Brock and many others, Moore continued to publish \"Peace News\" and arrange for distribution around the UK.\n\nHumphrey Moore’s emphasis on \"Peace News\" having a single-minded anti-war policy was increasingly being challenged. Others wanted greater emphasis on building a peaceful society once hostilities ended. In 1940 the PPU asked Moore to step aside in the post of assistant editor (which post he held until 1944), and appointed John Middleton Murry as editor. By 1946 Murry had abandoned pacifism and resigned.\n\nHugh Brock took on the role of assistant editor of Peace News in 1946 and became editor in 1955, lasting until 1964. During his period of tenure the magazine separated from the PPU as it had widened its focus into areas not directly related to absolute pacifism. \"Peace News\" in the 1940s published material from American journalist Dwight Macdonald and Maurice Cranston (later to become a noted philosopher).\n\nFrom the 1940s on, \"Peace News\" began to take a strongly critical line towards British rule in Kenya. The magazine also established links with African anti-colonial activists Kwame Nkrumah and Kenneth Kaunda, and \"\"Peace News\"′ close involvement with the anti-apartheid struggle...led to the banning of the paper in South Africa in 1959\". During the 1950s, \"Peace News\" contributors included such noted activists as André Trocmé, Martin Niemöller, Fenner Brockway, A. J. Muste, Richard B. Gregg, Alex Comfort, Donald Soper, Michael Scott, Leslie Hall, M.P., Muriel Lester, Emrys Hughes, M.P., Wilfred Wellock, and Esmé Wynne-Tyson\n\nIn 1959 a gift of £5,700 from Tom Willis enabled \"Peace News\" to buy 5 Caledonian Road, London, N1. This became its office and printing press and was also shared with Housmans Bookshop. It was at the \"Peace News\" office that the Nuclear Disarmament/Peace symbol was adopted. Describing the British pacifist tradition in the 1950s, David Widgery wrote \"at its most likeable it was the sombre decency of \"Peace News\", then a vegetarian tabloid with a Quaker emphasis on active witness\".\n\nThe magazine campaigned against nuclear weapons, often working with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. During this period Brock brought to \"Peace News\" \"a staff of writer-activists committed to developing Gandhian nonviolent action in the anti-militarist cause\", including Pat Arrowsmith, Richard Boston, April Carter, Alan Lovell, Michael Randle, Adam Roberts and the American Gene Sharp. Brock's successor in 1964 was Theodore Roszak. In the same year, a Caribbean Quaker and \"PN\" writer, Marion Glean, \"contributed to a series of statements by post-colonial activists on 'race' in the run-up to the 1964 election, published by Theodore Roszak, editor of \"Peace News\".\" After the election, Glean helped bring together several activists, including David Pitt, C. L. R. James and Ranjana Ash to form the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination. Throughout the 1960s, \"Peace News\" covered issues such as opposition to the Vietnam War and the Biafran issue in the Nigerian Civil War. The magazine's coverage of the Vietnam War was notable for its support for the protests of the Vietnamese Buddhists, who it argued could become a nonviolent \"Third Force\" independent of both the Saigon and Hanoi governments. \"Peace News\" also ran lengthy analysis of left-wing thinkers, including E.P. Thompson's two-part study of C. Wright Mills and Theodore Roszak's assessment of Lewis Mumford.\n\nIn 1971 it added to its masthead the words \"for nonviolent revolution\".\n\nIn 1974, the paper moved its main office to Nottingham, where it remained until 1990.\n\nIn 1978, one worker at Housmans was injured after a bomb was sent to the \"Peace News\" offices, (allegedly by the neo-Nazi organisation Column 88) as part of a series of attacks on left-wing organisations (similar attacks were made on the Socialist Workers Party and Anti-Nazi League offices before this occurred).\n\n\"Peace News\" suspended publication at the end of 1987, intending to relaunch after a period of rethinking and planning. In May 1989 the paper resumed publication, but quickly ran into financial difficulties. In 1990 it became linked to War Resisters' International and was co-published as a monthly until 1999, then as a quarterly with a British-oriented \"Nonviolent Action\" published in the intervening months. \"Peace News\" came out strongly against the Iraq War while at the same time condemning Saddam Hussein. In 2005, \"Peace News\" resumed monthly publication, as an independent British publication and in a tabloid format.\n\nIn June 2014, \"Peace News\" ran an article calling for a \"Yes\" vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum.\n\n\"Peace News\" continues to be published in tabloid size print media and as a website by Peace News Ltd. It describes its editorial objectives as: to support and connect nonviolent and anti-militarist movements; provide a forum for such movements to develop common perspectives; take up issues suitable for campaigning; promote nonviolent, antimilitarist and pacifist analyses and strategies; stimulate thinking about the revolutionary implications of nonviolence.

{"id": "809629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=809629", "title": "Renaissance philosophy", "text": "Renaissance philosophy\n\nThe designation \"Renaissance philosophy\" is used by scholars of intellectual history to refer to the thought of the period running in Europe roughly between 1355 and 1650 (the dates shift forward for central and northern Europe and for areas such as Spanish America, India, Japan, and China under European influence). It therefore overlaps both with late medieval philosophy, which in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was influenced by notable figures such as Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, William of Ockham, and Marsilius of Padua, and early modern philosophy, which conventionally starts with René Descartes and his publication of the \"Discourse on Method\" in 1637. Philosophers usually divide the period less finely, jumping from medieval to early modern philosophy, on the assumption that no radical shifts in perspective took place in the centuries immediately before Descartes. Intellectual historians, however, take into considerations factors such as sources, approaches, audience, language, and literary genres in addition to ideas. This article reviews both the changes in context and content of Renaissance philosophy and its remarkable continuities with the past.\n\nThe structure, sources, method, and topics of philosophy in the Renaissance had much in common with those of previous centuries.\n\nParticularly since the recovery of a great portion of Aristotelian writings in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it became clear that, in addition to Aristotle's writings on logic, which had already been known, there were numerous others roughly having to do with natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. These areas provided the structure for the philosophy curriculum of the emerging universities. The general assumption was that the most 'scientific' branches of philosophy were those that were more theoretical and therefore more widely applicable. During the Renaissance too, many thinkers saw these as the main philosophical areas, with logic providing a training of the mind to approach the other three.\n\nA similar continuity can be seen in the case of sources. Although Aristotle was never an unquestioned authority (he was more often than not a springboard for discussion, and his opinions were often discussed along those of others, or the teaching of Holy Scripture), medieval lectures in physics consisted of reading Aristotle's \"Physics\", lessons in moral philosophy consisted of examinations of his \"Nicomachean Ethics\" (and often his \"Politics\"), and metaphysics was approached through his \"Metaphysics\". The assumption that Aristotle's works were foundational to an understanding of philosophy did not wane during the Renaissance, which saw a flourishing of new translations, commentaries, and other interpretations of his works, both in Latin and in the vernacular.\n\nIn terms of method, philosophy was considered during the late Middle Ages as a subject that required robust enquiry on the part of people trained in the subject's technical vocabulary. Philosophical texts and problems were typically approached through university lectures and 'questions'. The latter, similar in some ways to modern debates, examined the pros and cons of particular philosophical positions or interpretations. They were one of the cornerstones of the 'scholastic method', made students who proposed or responded to questions quick on their feet, and required a deep familiarity with all of the known philosophical tradition, which would often be invoked in support of or against specific arguments. This style of philosophy continued to have a strong following in the Renaissance. Pico della Mirandola's \"Disputations\", for instance, depended directly on this tradition, which was not at all limited to university lecture halls.\n\nGiven the remarkable range of Aristotelian philosophy, it was possible to discuss all kinds of issues in medieval and Renaissance philosophy. Aristotle had treated directly problems such as the trajectory of missiles, the habits of animals, how knowledge is acquired, the freedom of the will, how virtue is connected with happiness, the relationship of the lunar and the sublunar worlds. Indirectly he had stimulated discussion on two points that were particularly of concern to Christians: the immortality of the soul and the eternity of the world. All of these continued to be of considerable interest to Renaissance thinkers, but we shall see that in some cases the solutions offered were significantly different because of changing cultural and religious landscapes.\n\nHaving established that many aspects of philosophy were held in common during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it will now be useful to discuss in what areas changes were afoot. The same outline as above will be used, to show that within trends of continuity one can also find surprising differences.\n\nIt is therefore useful to reconsider what was mentioned above about philosophical sources. The Renaissance saw a significant broadening of source material. Plato, known directly only through two and a half dialogues in the Middle Ages, came to be known through numerous Latin translations in fifteenth century Italy, culminating in the hugely influential translation of his complete works by Marsilio Ficino in Florence in 1484. \nPetrarch was not able to read Plato directly, but he greatly admired him. Petrarch was also a great admirer of Roman poets such as Virgil and Horace and of Cicero for Latin prose writing. Not all humanists followed his example in all things, but Petrarch contributed to a broadening of his time's 'canon' (pagan poetry had previously been considered frivolous and dangerous), something that happened in philosophy as well. In the sixteenth century anyone who considered himself 'au fait' read Plato as well as Aristotle, trying as much as possible (and not always very successfully) to reconcile the two with each other and with Christianity. This is probably the main reason why Donato Acciaiuoli's commentary on Aristotle's Ethics (first published in 1478) was so successful: it blended the three traditions beautifully. Other movements from ancient philosophy also re-entered the mainstream. This was never really the case for Epicureanism, which was almost always caricatured and considered with suspicion, but Scepticism and Pyrrhonism did make a comeback thanks to writers like Michel Montaigne, and the movement of Stoicism made an impressive re-appearance in the writings of Justus Lipsius. In all of these cases it is impossible to separate the pagan philosophical doctrines from the Christian filter through which they were approached and made legitimate.\n\nWhile generally the Aristotelian structure of the branches of philosophy stayed in place, interesting developments and tensions were taking place within them. In moral philosophy, for instance, a position consistently held by Thomas Aquinas and his numerous followers was that its three subfields (ethics, economics, politics) were related to progressively wider spheres (the individual, the family and the community). Politics, Thomas thought, is more important than ethics because it considers the good of the greater number. This position came under increasing strain in the Renaissance, as various thinkers claimed that Thomas's classifications were inaccurate, and that ethics were the most important part of morality. Other important figures, such as Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) (1304-1374), questioned the whole assumption that the theoretical aspects of philosophy were the more important ones. He insisted, for instance, on the value of the practical aspects of ethics. Petrarch's position, expressed both strongly and amusingly in his invective \"On His Own Ignorance and That of Many Others\" (\"De sui ipsius ac multorum ignorantia\") is also important for another reason: it represents the conviction that philosophy should let itself be guided by rhetoric, that the purpose of philosophy is therefore not so much to reveal the truth, but to encourage people to pursue the good. This perspective, so typical of Italian humanism, could easily lead to reducing all philosophy to ethics, in a move reminiscent of Plato's Socrates and of Cicero.\n\nIf, as mentioned above, scholasticism continued to flourish, the Italian humanists (i.e., lovers and practitioners of the humanities) challenged its supremacy. As we have seen, they believed that philosophy could be brought under the wing of rhetoric. They also thought that the scholarly discourse of their time needed to return to the elegance and precision of its classical models. They therefore tried dressing philosophy in a more appealing garb than had their predecessors, whose translations and commentaries were in technical Latin and sometimes simply transliterated the Greek. In 1416/1417 Leonardo Bruni, the pre-eminent humanist of his time and chancellor of Florence, re-translated Aristotle's \"Ethics\" into a more flowing, idiomatic and classical Latin. He hoped to communicate the elegance of Aristotle's Greek while also making the text more accessible to those without a philosophical education. Others, including Nicolò Tignosi in Florence around 1460, and the Frenchman Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples in Paris in the 1490s, tried to please the humanists either by including in their commentaries on Aristotle appealing historical examples or quotations from poetry, or by avoiding the standard scholastic format of questions, or both. The driving conviction was that philosophy should be freed of its technical jargon so that more people would be able to read it. At the same time, all kinds of summaries, paraphrases, and dialogues dealing with philosophical issues were prepared, in order to give their topics a wider dissemination. Humanists also encouraged the study of Aristotle and other writers of antiquity in the original. Desiderius Erasmus, the great Dutch humanist, even prepared a Greek edition of Aristotle, and eventually those teaching philosophy in the universities had to at least pretend that they knew Greek. Humanists were not, however, great fans of the vernacular. There is only a handful of examples of dialogues or translations of Aristotle's works into Italian during the fifteenth century. Once it had been determined, however, that Italian was a language with literary merit and that it could carry the weight of philosophical discussion, numerous efforts in this direction started to appear, particularly from the 1540s onward. Alessandro Piccolomini had a programme to translate or paraphrase the entire Aristotelian corpus into the vernacular. Other important figures were Benedetto Varchi, Bernardo Segni and Giambattista Gelli, all of them active in Florence. Efforts got underway to present Plato's doctrines in the vernacular as well. This rise of vernacular philosophy, which quite predated the Cartesian approach, is a new field of research whose contours are only now beginning to be clarified.\n\nIt is very hard to generalize about the ways in which discussions of philosophical topics shifted in the Renaissance, mainly because to do so requires a detailed map of the period, something we do not yet have. We know that debates about the freedom of the will continued to flare up (for instance, in the famous exchanges between Erasmus and Martin Luther), that Spanish thinkers were increasingly obsessed with the notion of nobility, that duelling was a practice that generated a large literature in the sixteenth century (was it permissible or not?).\n\nEarlier histories gave perhaps undue attention to Pietro Pomponazzi's pronouncements on the immortality of the soul as a question that could not be resolved philosophically in a way consistent with Christianity, or to Pico della Mirandola's \"Oration\" on the dignity of man, as if these were signals of the period's increasing secularism or even atheism. In fact, the most successful compendium of natural philosophy in the period (\"Compendium philosophiae naturalis\", first published in 1530) was authored by Frans Titelmans, a Franciscan friar from the Low Countries whose work has a very strong religious flavour. We must not forget that most philosophers of the time were at least nominal, if not devout, Christians, that the sixteenth century saw both the Protestant and the Catholic reformations, and that Renaissance philosophy culminates with the period of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). In other words, religion had a massive importance in the period, and one can hardly study philosophy without remembering this.\n\nThis is true among others for the philosophy of Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), who reinterpreted Plato in the light of his early Greek commentators and also of Christianity. Ficino hoped that a purified philosophy would bring about a religious renewal in his society and therefore transformed distasteful aspects of Platonic philosophy (for instance, the homosexual love exalted in the Symposium) into spiritual love (i.e., Platonic love), something later transformed by Pietro Bembo and Baldassar Castiglione in the early sixteenth century as something also applicable to relationships between men and women. Ficino and his followers also had an interest in 'hidden knowledge', mainly because of his belief that all of ancient knowledge was interconnected (Moses, for instance, had received his insights from the Greeks, who in turn had received them from others, all according to God's plan and therefore mutually consistent; Hermeticism is relevant here). Although Ficino's interest in and practice of astrology was not uncommon in his time, one should not necessarily associate it with philosophy, as the two were usually considered to be quite separate and often in contradiction with each other.\n\nIn conclusion, like any other moment in the history of thought Renaissance philosophy cannot be considered to have provided something entirely new nor to have continued for centuries to repeat the conclusions of its predecessors. Historians call this period the 'Renaissance' in order to indicate the rebirth that took place of ancient (particularly classical) perspectives, sources, attitudes toward literature and the arts. At the same time, we realize that every reappropriation is constrained and even guided by contemporary concerns and biases. It was no different for the period considered here: the old was mixed with and changed by the new, but while no claims can be made for a revolutionary new starting point in philosophy, in many ways the synthesis of Christianity, Aristotelianism, and Platonism offered by Thomas Aquinas was torn apart in order to make way for a new one, based on more complete and varied sources, often in the original, and certainly attuned to new social and religious realities and a much broader public.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work is unique in that it employs not alphabets, but is composed entirely in Kannada numerals. The \"Saangathya\" metre of Kannada poetry is employed in the work. It uses numerals 1 through 64 and employs various patterns or \"bandhas\" in a frame of 729 (27×27) squares to represent alphabets in nearly 18 scripts and over 700 languages. Some of the patterns used include the \"Chakrabandha\", \"Hamsabandha\", \"Varapadmabandha\", \"Sagarabandha\", \"Sarasabandha\", \"Kruanchabandha\", \"Mayurabandha\", \"Ramapadabandha\", \"Nakhabandha\", etc. As each of these patterns are identified and decoded, the contents can be read.\n\nThe work is said to have around 600,000 verses, nearly 6 times as big as the ancient Indian epic \"Mahabharata\". Totally there are 26 chapters constituting it a big volume of which only three have been decoded.The author expounds that many philosophies which existed in the Jain classics are eloquently and skillfully interpreted in the work. It is also claimed to consist of works in several languages including Sanskrit, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Prakrit, etc., apart from Kannada. Different languages can be realised by assigning different alphabets to different numbers.\n\nIt is also believed to contain valuable information about various sciences including mathematics, chemistry, physics, astronomy, medicine, history, space travel, etc. Karlamangalam Srikantaiah, the editor of the first edition, has claimed that the work contains instructions for travel in water and space travel. It is also said that the work contains information about the production of modern weapons.\n\nThough written in Kannada its numerical enunciation enables the people of other languages to comprehend it.\n\nThe work is attributed to Jain bolis Kumudendu Muni. He claims that he was guru of amoghavarsha of Manyakheta and a disciple of virasena and jinasena of Dhavala. However, not much is known about this monk. Scholars are divided about when he lived. Karlamangalam Srikantaiah, the editor of the first edition, claims that the work may have been composed around 800 AD. Dr Venkatachala Sastry, however, dates him and his work to the 15th century. He also claims that Kumudendu Muni belonged to a village called Yalavalli near Nandidurga in Chikkaballapura Taluk in Kolar district. He further dates the work to around the 1550-1600 period and suggests it might be even more recent.\n\nS. Srikanta Sastri, a respected name in the study of Indian history and culture, has commented on the work thus,\nThere are 16,000 \"chakras\" in all. Out of which only 1,270 chakras are available.

It is usually said that versions of the slingshot argument have been given by Gottlob Frege, Alonzo Church, W. V. Quine, and Donald Davidson. However, it has been disputed by Lorenz Krüger (1995) that there is much unity in this tradition. Moreover, Krüger rejects Davidson's claim that the argument can refute the correspondence theory of truth. Stephen Neale (1995) claims, controversially, that the most compelling version was suggested by Kurt Gödel (1944).\n\nThese arguments are sometimes modified to support the alternative, and evidently stronger, conclusion that there is only one \"fact\", or one true \"proposition\", \"state of affairs\", \"truth condition\", \"truthmaker\", and so on.\n\nOne version of the argument (Perry 1996) proceeds as follows.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nLet \"S\" and \"T\" be arbitrary true sentences, designating \"Des\"(\"S\") and \"Des\"(\"T\"), respectively. (No assumptions are made about what kinds of things \"Des\"(\"S\") and \"Des\"(\"T\") are.) It is now shown by a series of designation-preserving transformations that \"Des\"(\"S\") = \"Des\"(\"T\"). Here, \"formula_1\" can be read as \"the \"x\" such that\".\n\nNote that (1)-(9) is not a derivation of \"T\" from \"S\". Rather, it is a series of (allegedly) designation-preserving transformation steps.\n\nAs Gödel (1944) observed, the slingshot argument does not go through if Bertrand Russell's famous account of definite descriptions is assumed. Russell claimed that the proper logical interpretation of a sentence of the form \"The \"F\" is \"G\"\" is:\n\nOr, in the language of first-order logic:\n\nWhen the sentences above containing formula_3-expressions are expanded out to their proper form, the steps involving substitution are seen to be illegitimate. Consider, for example, the move from (3) to (4). On Russell's account, (3) and (4) are shorthand for:\nClearly the substitution principle and assumption 4 do not license the move from (3') to (4'). Thus, one way to look at the slingshot is as simply another argument in favor of Russell's theory of definite descriptions.\n\nIf one is not willing to accept Russell's theory, then it seems wise to challenge either \"substitution\" or \"redistribution\", which seem to be the other weakest points in the argument. Perry (1996), for example, rejects both of these principles, proposing to replace them with certain weaker, qualified versions that do not allow the slingshot argument to go through.\nGaetano Licata (2011) rejected the slingshot argument showing that the concept of identity (=) employed in the Davidson's and Gödel's demonstration is very problematic, because Gödel (following Russell) uses the Leibniz's principle of indiscernability of identicals, which suffer from the criticism proposed by Wittgenstein: to state that x=y when all properties of x are also properties of y is false because y and x are different signs, while to state that x=x when all properties of x are also properties of x is a nonsense. Licata's thesis is that the sign = (usually employed between numbers) needs a logical foundation before being employed between objects and properties.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7478649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7478649", "title": "Sokei-an", "text": "Sokei-an\n\nSokei-an Shigetsu Sasaki (佐々木 指月 (曹渓庵); March 10, 1882 – May 17, 1945), born Yeita Sasaki (佐々木 栄多), was a Japanese Rinzai monk who founded the Buddhist Society of America (now the First Zen Institute of America) in New York City in 1930. Influential in the growth of Zen Buddhism in the United States, Sokei-an was one of the first Japanese masters to live and teach in America. In 1944 he married American Ruth Fuller Everett. He died in May 1945 without leaving behind a Dharma heir. One of his better known students was Alan Watts, who studied under him briefly. Watts stayed for two weeks as a student of Sokei-an in the late 1930s.\n\nSokei-an was born in Japan in 1882 as Yeita Sasaki. He was raised by his father, a Shinto priest, and his father's wife, though his birth mother was his father's concubine. Beginning at age four, his father taught him Chinese and soon had him reading Confucian texts. Following the death of his father when he was fifteen, he became an apprentice sculptor and came to study under Japan's renowned Koun Takamura at the Imperial Academy of Art in Tokyo. While in school he began his study of Rinzai Zen under Sokatsu Shaku, (a Dharma heir of Soyen Shaku), graduating from the academy in 1905. Following graduation he was drafted by the Japanese Imperial Army and served briefly during the Russo-Japanese War on the border of Manchuria. Sasaki was discharged when the war ended shortly after in 1906, and soon married his first wife, Tomé, a fellow student of Sokatsu. The newlyweds followed Sokatsu to San Francisco, California that year as part of a delegation of fourteen. The couple soon had their first child, Shintaro. In California with the hope of establishing a Zen community, the group farmed strawberries in Hayward, California with little success. Sasaki then studied painting under Richard Partington at the California Institute of Art, where he met Nyogen Senzaki. By 1910 the delegation's Zen community had proven unsuccessful. All members of the original fourteen, with the exception of Sasaki, made return trips back to Japan.\n\nSokei-an then moved to Oregon without Tomé and Shintaro to work for a short while, being rejoined by them in Seattle Washington (where his wife gave birth to their second child, Seiko, a girl). In Seattle, Sasaki worked as a picture frame maker and wrote various articles and essays for Japanese publications such as \"Chuo Koron\" and \"Hokubei Shinpo\". He traveled the Oregon and Washington countrysides selling subscriptions to \"Hokubei Shinpo\". His wife, who had become pregnant again, moved back to Japan in 1913 to raise their children. Over the next few years he made a living doing various jobs, when in 1916 he moved to Greenwich Village in Manhattan, New York, where he encountered the poet and magus Aleister Crowley. Sometime during this period he was interviewed by the US Army but not drafted due to lingering allegiances to Japan. In New York he worked both as a janitor and a translator for Maxwell Bodenheim. He also began to write poetry during his free time. He returned to Japan in 1920 to continue his koan studies, first under Soyen Shaku and then with Sokatsu. In 1922 he returned to the United States and in 1924 or 1925 began giving talks on Buddhism at the Orientalia Bookstore on E. 58th Street in New York City, having received lay teaching credentials from Sokatsu. In 1928 he received inka from Sokatsu in Japan, the \"final seal\" of approval in the Rinzai school. Then, on May 11, 1930, Sokei-an and some American students founded the Buddhist Society of America, subsequently incorporated in 1931, at 63 West 70th Street (originally with just four members). Here he offered sanzen interviews and gave Dharma talks, also working on various translations of important Buddhist texts. He made part of his living by sculpting Buddhist images and repairing art for Tiffany's.\n\nIn 1938 his future wife, Ruth Fuller Everett, began studying under him and received her Buddhist name (Eryu); her daughter, Eleanor, was then the wife of Alan Watts (who also studied under Sokei-an that same year). In 1941 Ruth purchased an apartment at 124 E. 65th Street in New York City, which also served as living quarters for Sokei-an and became the new home for the Buddhist Society of America (opened on December 6). Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sokei-an was arrested by the FBI as an \"enemy alien\" taken to Ellis Island on June 15 and then interned at a camp in Fort Meade, Maryland on October 2, 1942 (where he suffered from high blood pressure and several strokes). He was released from the internment camp on August 17, 1943 following the pleas of his students and returned to the Buddhist Society of America in New York City. In 1944 he divorced his wife in Little Rock, Arkansas, with whom he had been separated for several years. Soon after, on July 10, 1944, Sokei-an married Ruth Fuller Sasaki in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Sokei-an died on May 17, 1945 after years of bad health. His ashes are interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York. The Buddhist Society of America underwent a name change following his death in 1945, becoming the First Zen Institute of America.\n\nSokei-an's primary way of teaching Zen Buddhism was by means of sanzen, \"an interview during which the teacher would set the student a koan\"—and his Dharma talks were often delivered in the form of a teisho. Sokei-an did not provide instruction in zazen or hold sesshins at the Buddhist Society of America. His primary focus was on koans and sanzen, relying on the Hakuin system. According to Mary Farkas, \"Sokei-an had no interest in reproducing the features of Japanese Zen monasticism, the strict and regimented training that aims at making people 'forget self.' In these establishments, individuality is stamped out, novices move together like a school of fish, their cross-legged position corrected with an ever-ready stick.\"\n\nDwight Goddard (author of \"A Buddhist Bible\") has described Sokei-an as, \"being from the autocratic and blunt 'old school' of Zen masters.\" According to writer Robert Lopez, \"Sokei-an lectured on Zen and Buddhism in English. But he communicated the essence of the Buddha’s teaching and in his daily life by his presence alone, in silence, and in a radiance achieved through, as he once said, 'nature’s orders.'\" Alan Watts has said of Sokei-an, \"I felt that he was basically on the same team as I; that he bridged the spiritual and the earthy, and that he was as humorously earthy as he was spiritually awakened.\" In his autobiography, Watts had this to say, \"When he began to teach Zen he was still, as I understand, more the artist than the priest, but in the course of time he shaved his head and 'sobered up.'

The German weekly \"Der Freitag\" called him as \"one of the most exciting voices of his generation\" and he has been described as a \"fiery voice of dissent in the Post-Yugoslav landscape\" His writing has appeared in \"The Guardian\", \"Al Jazeera\", Der Spiegel, Newsweek and \"The New York Times\".\n\nHorvat was born in Osijek, Croatia, but lived for the first eight years of his life in exile in Germany, before returning to Croatia in 1991. After returning to Croatia, he was involved in the hardcore punk scene of the 1990s, graduated philosophy and general linguistics at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb, started writing for Croatian magazines such as Zarez and with 25 years published two books, \"Protiv političke korektnosti\" (Against Political Correctness) and \"Znakovi postmodernog grada\" (Signs of the Postmodern City) in Croatia and Serbia. Since then he has written several books in Croatian, and all his subsequent work in English (\"Poetry from the Future, The Radicality of Love, Subversion!\"), which was translated into dozens of languages, including Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Turkish, German and others. In 2008 he co-founded the Subversive Festival, where he served as program director until 2013. In 2016 he co-founded the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM 2025) along with Yanis Varoufakis.\n\nHorvat is regarded as one of the \"central figures of the new left in post-Yugoslavia\". He has participated in different activist movements across the world, including the 2009 student protests in Croatia, Occupy Wall Street in 2011, and World Social Forum in Senegal and Tunisia. He has visited the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit which he described as a „dystopian nightmare“, claiming that „the real problem is the dogmatic slumber of the leaders of the free world, represented at this G20 summit by Merkel, May and others, which is the origin of our current dystopian nightmare (wars, terrorism, the refugee crisis and climate change“. Since 2016 he has been claiming that „the need for a progressive international movement was never as urgent as today“. Asked about what the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal meant for the future of politics, he claims that „in the near future this will be remembered as the early days of a much more radical transformation of what we understand under politics“ . \n\nHe was one of the founders of the Subversive Festival in 2008, an annual festival which included Oliver Stone, Alexis Tsipras, Aleida Guevara, Slavoj Žižek, Tariq Ali, Zygmunt Bauman, David Harvey, Saskia Sassen, etc. In 2013 together with the programme team he left the Subversive Festival \"due to differences in understanding the goals and direction of the activist platforms within Subversive Forum and, more generally, the general purpose of Subversive Festival\". The influence and significance of the Subversive Festival was often paralleled to the Praxis School, the Marxist humanist philosophical movement that originated in the SFR Yugoslavia, during the 1960s. In 2017 Horvat published the book \"Subversion!\" which the American linguist and social critic Noam Chomsky praised as a book \"based on rich personal experience and participation in constructive subversion, along with wide reading from classics to the latest dreams of artificial intelligence\" According to Chomsky, \"Horvat leads us on a whirlwind tour of the maladies and discontents of modern civilization and the many ways to right what is wrong and achieve a better future\" \n\nIn 2014 Horvat launched a project called Philosophical Theatre (\"Filozofski Teatar\") at Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. The underlying idea was to reestablish the close relationship between philosophy and theatre. It is a monthly series of public debates with thinkers and artists. His guests included M.I.A., Vanessa Redgrave, Margarethe von Trotta, Adam Curtis, Herta Müller, Hito Steyerl, Mladen Dolar, Julia Kristeva, Eva Illouz, Tariq Ali, Bobby Gillespie, Thomas Piketty and others. According to the Croatian National Theater, the complete number of visitors of the program from 2014 since 2018 was around 20,000.\n\nDuring 2013 Horvat was the host and author of an intellectual TV show on Croatian National Television called \"Zdravo Društvo\" (Sane Society) which tried to recreate the Balkan cultural space and hosted many intellectuals such as Renata Salecl, Rade Šerbedžija, Andrej Nikolaidis, Viktor Ivančić, etc. Officially it was called off by the management because of “austerity measures”. However, the Bosnian writer Miljenko Jergović wrote that the TV show likely would not have been removed if not for an opinion piece Horvat wrote in the Guardian that criticized an anti-gay-marriage referendum and, more generally, the movement of Croatian society in a culturally conservative if not fascistic direction. Jergović wrote, \"If he had written it in 1942 he would've ended up in Jasenovac concentration camp. If he had written it in 1972 he would've ended up in Lepoglava prison.

{"id": "221962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221962", "title": "Synoptic Gospels", "text": "Synoptic Gospels\n\nThe gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are referred to as the Synoptic Gospels because they include many of the same stories, often in a similar sequence and in similar or sometimes identical wording. They stand in contrast to John, whose content is comparatively distinct. The term \"synoptic\" (; ) comes via Latin from the Greek , \"synopsis\", i.e. \"(a) seeing all together, synopsis\"; the sense of the word in English, the one specifically applied to these three gospels, of \"giving an account of the events from the same point of view or under the same general aspect\" is a modern one.\n\nThis strong parallelism among the three gospels in content, arrangement, and specific language is widely attributed to literary interdependence. The question of the precise nature of their literary relationship—the synoptic problem—has been a topic of lively debate for centuries and has been described as \"the most fascinating literary enigma of all time\". The longstanding majority view favors Marcan priority, in which both Matthew and Luke have made direct use of the Gospel of Mark as a source, and further holds that Matthew and Luke also drew from an additional hypothetical document, called \"Q\".\n\nBroadly speaking, the synoptic gospels are similar to John: all are composed in Koine Greek, have a similar length, and were completed within a century of Jesus' death. They also differ from non-canonical sources, such as the Gospel of Thomas, in that they belong to the ancient genre of biography, collecting not only Jesus' teachings, but recounting in an orderly way his origins, his ministry and miracles, and his passion and resurrection.\n\nIn content and in wording, though, the synoptics diverge widely from John but have a great deal in common with each other. Though each gospel includes some unique material, the majority of Mark and roughly half of Matthew and Luke coincide in content, in much the same sequence, often nearly verbatim. This common material is termed the \"triple tradition\".\n\nThe triple tradition, the material included by all three synoptic gospels, includes many stories and teachings:\n\nFurthermore, the triple tradition's pericopae (passages) tend to be arranged in much the same order in all three gospels. This stands in contrast to the material found in only two of the gospels, which is much more variable in order.\n\nThe classification of text as belonging to the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather on the degree of similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report the cursing of the fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only the parable of the barren fig tree, in a different point of the narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.\n\nAn illustrative example of the three texts in parallel is the healing of the leper:\n\nMore than half the wording in this passage is identical. Just as interesting, though, is that each gospel includes words absent in the other two and omits something included by the other two.\n\nIt has been observed that the triple tradition itself constitutes a complete gospel quite similar to the shortest gospel, Mark.\n\nMark, unlike Matthew and Luke, adds relatively little to the triple tradition. Pericopae unique to Mark are scarce, notably two healings involving saliva and the naked runaway. Mark's additions within the triple tradition tend to be explanatory elaborations (e.g., \"the stone was rolled back, \"for it was very large\") or Aramaisms (e.g., \"\"Talitha kum\"!\"). The pericopae Mark shares with only Luke are also quite few: the Capernaum exorcism and departure from Capernaum, the strange exorcist, and the widow's mites. A greater number, but still not many, are shared with only Matthew, most notably the so-called \"Great Omission\" from Luke of .\n\nMost scholars take these observations as a strong clue to the literary relationship among the synoptics and Mark's special place in that relationship. The hypothesis favored by most experts is \"Marcan priority\", that Mark was composed first and that Matthew and Luke each used Mark and incorporated most of it, with adaptations, into their own gospels. A leading alternative hypothesis is \"Marcan posteriority\", that Mark was formed primarily by extracting what Matthew and Luke shared in common.\n\n An extensive set of material—some two hundred verses or roughly half the length of the triple tradition—are the pericopae shared between Matthew and Luke but absent in Mark. This is termed the \"double tradition\". Parables and other sayings predominate in the double tradition, but it also includes narrative elements:\nUnlike triple-tradition material, double-tradition material is very differently arranged in the two gospels. Matthew's lengthy Sermon on the Mount, for example, is paralleled by Luke's shorter Sermon on the Plain, with the remainder of its content scattered throughout Luke. This is consistent with the general pattern of Matthew collecting sayings into large blocks, while Luke does the opposite and intersperses them with narrative.\n\nBesides the double-tradition proper, Matthew and Luke often agree against Mark within the triple tradition to varying extents, sometimes including several additional verses, sometimes differing by a single word. These are termed the \"major and minor agreements\" (the distinction is imprecise). One example is in the passion narrative, where Mark has simply, \"Prophesy!\" while Matthew and Luke both add, \"Who is it that struck you?\"\n\nThe double-tradition's origin, with its major and minor agreements, is a key facet of the synoptic problem. The simplest hypothesis is that Luke relied on Matthew's work or vice versa. But many experts, on various grounds, maintain that neither Matthew nor Luke used the other's work. If this is the case, they must have drawn from some common source, distinct from Mark, that provided the double-tradition material and overlapped with Mark's content where major agreements occur. This hypothetical document is termed \"Q\", for the German \"Quelle\", meaning \"source\".\n\nMatthew and Luke contain a large amount of material found in no other gospel. These materials are sometimes called \"Special Matthew\" or \"M\" and \"Special Luke\" or \"L\".\n\nBoth Special Matthew and Special Luke include distinct opening infancy narratives and distinct post-resurrection conclusions (with Luke continuing the story in his second book Acts). In between, Special Matthew includes mostly parables, while Special Luke includes both parables and healings.\n\nSpecial Luke is notable for containing a greater concentration of Semitisms than any other gospel material.\n\nLuke gives some indication of how he composed his gospel in his prologue:\n\nSince many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, I too decided, after investigating everything carefully from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed.\n\nThe \"synoptic problem\" is the question of the specific literary relationship among the three synoptic gospels—that is, the question as to the source or sources upon which each synoptic gospel depended when it was written.\n\nThe texts of the three synoptic gospels often agree very closely in wording and order, both in quotations and in narration. Most scholars ascribe this to \"documentary dependence\", direct or indirect, meaning the close agreements among synoptic gospels are due to one gospel's drawing from the text of another, or from some written source that another gospel also drew from.\n\nThe synoptic problem hinges on several interrelated points of controversy:\n\nFurthermore, some theories try to explain the relation of the synoptic gospels to John; to non-canonical gospels such as Thomas, Peter, and Egerton; to the Didache; and to lost documents such as the Hebrew logia mentioned by Papias, the Jewish–Christian gospels, and the Gospel of Marcion.\n\nAncient sources virtually unanimously ascribe the synoptic gospels to the apostle Matthew, to Peter's interpreter Mark, and to Paul's companion Luke - hence their respective canonical names. A remark by Augustine at the beginning of the fifth century presents the gospels as composed in their canonical order (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), with each evangelist thoughtfully building upon and supplementing the work of his predecessors—the Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew–Mark).\n\nThis view (when any model of dependence was considered at all) seldom came into question until the late eighteenth century, when Johann Jakob Griesbach published in 1776 a \"synopsis\" of the synoptic gospels. Instead of harmonizing them, he displayed their texts side by side, making both similarities and divergences apparent. Griesbach, noticing the special place of Mark in the synopsis, hypothesized Marcan posteriority and advanced (as Henry Owen had a few years earlier) the two-gospel hypothesis (Matthew–Luke).\n\nIn the nineteenth century, researchers applied the tools of literary criticism to the synoptic problem in earnest, especially in German scholarship. Early work revolved around a hypothetical proto-gospel (\"Ur-Gospel\"), possibly in Aramaic, underlying the synoptics. From this line of inquiry, however, a consensus emerged that Mark itself served as the principal source for the other two gospels—Marcan priority.\n\nIn a theory first proposed by Weisse in 1838, the double tradition was explained by Matthew and Luke independently using two sources—thus, the two-source (Mark-Q) theory—which supplemented Mark with another hypothetical source consisting mostly of sayings. This additional source was at first seen as the \"logia\" (sayings) spoken of by Papias and thus called \"Λ\", but later it became more generally known as \"Q\", from the German \"Quelle\", meaning \"source\". This two-source theory eventually won wide acceptance and was seldom questioned until the late twentieth century; most scholars simply took this new orthodoxy for granted and directed their efforts toward Q itself, and this is largely the case.\n\nThe theory is also well known in a more elaborate form set forth by Streeter in 1924, which additionally hypothesized written sources \"M\" and \"L\" (for \"Special Matthew\" and \"Special Luke\" respectively)—hence the influential four-document hypothesis. This exemplifies the prevailing scholarship of the time, which saw the canonical gospels as late products, dating from well into the second century, composed by unsophisticated cut-and-paste redactors out of a progression of written sources, and derived in turn from oral traditions and from folklore that had evolved in various communities. More recently, however, as this view has gradually fallen into disfavor, so too has the centrality of documentary interdependence and hypothetical documentary sources as an explanation for all aspects of the synoptic problem.\n\nIn recent decades, weaknesses of the two-source theory have been more widely recognized, and debate has reignited. Many have independently argued that Luke did make some use of Matthew after all—the Common Sayings Source. British scholars went further and dispensed with Q entirely, ascribing the double tradition to Luke's direct use of Matthew—the Farrer hypothesis of 1955.\nNew attention is also being given to the Wilke hypothesis of 1838 which, like Farrer, dispenses with Q but ascribes the double tradition to Matthew's direct use of Luke. Meanwhile, the Augustinian hypothesis has also made a comeback, especially in American scholarship. The Jerusalem school hypothesis has also attracted fresh advocates, as has the Independence hypothesis, which denies documentary relationships altogether.\n\nOn this collapse of consensus, Wenham observed: \"I found myself in the Synoptic Problem Seminar of the Society for New Testament Studies, whose members were in disagreement over every aspect of the subject. When this international group disbanded in 1982 they had sadly to confess that after twelve years' work they had not reached a common mind on a single issue.\"\n\nNearly every conceivable theory has been advanced as a solution to the synoptic problem. The most notable theories include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "328815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328815", "title": "Theistic evolution", "text": "Theistic evolution\n\nTheistic evolution, theistic evolutionism, evolutionary creationism or God-guided evolution are views that regard religious teachings about God as compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological evolution. Theistic evolution is not in itself a scientific theory, but a range of views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views.\n\nSupporters of theistic evolution generally harmonize evolutionary thought with belief in God, rejecting the conflict thesis regarding the relationship between religion and science they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict each other.\n\nFrancis Collins describes theistic evolution as the position that \"evolution is real, but that it was set in motion by God\", and characterizes it as accepting \"that evolution occurred as biologists describe it, but under the direction of God\". The executive director of the National Center for Science Education in the United States of America, Eugenie Scott, has used the term to refer to the part of the overall spectrum of beliefs about creation and evolution holding the theological view that God creates through evolution. It covers a wide range of beliefs about the extent of any intervention by God, with some approaching deism in rejecting the concept of continued intervention.\n\nJust as different types of evolutionary explanations have evolved, so there are different types of theistic evolution. Creationists Henry M. Morris and John D. Morris, point out that there are different terms which have been used to describe different positions: \"\"Orthogenesis\" (goal-directed evolution), \"nomogenesis\" (evolution according to fixed law), \"emergent evolution\", \"creative evolution\", and others\"\".\n\nOthers argue that one should read the creation story in the book of Genesis only metaphorically.\n\nOthers see \"evolutionary creation\" (EC, also referred to by some observers as \"evolutionary creationism\") as the belief that God, as Creator, uses evolution to bring about his plan. The Jesuit paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was an influential proponent of God-directed evolution or \"orthogenesis\", in which man will eventually evolve to the \"omega point\" of union with the Creator. Eugenie Scott states in \"Evolution Vs. Creationism\" that it is a type of evolution rather than creationism, despite its name, and that it is \"hardly distinguishable from Theistic Evolution\". According to evolutionary creationist Denis Lamoureux, although referring to the same view, the word arrangement in the term \"theistic evolution\" places \"the process of evolution as the primary term, and makes the Creator secondary as merely a qualifying adjective.\" Scott also uses the term \"theistic evolutionism\" interchangeably with \"theistic evolution\". Divine intervention is seen at critical intervals in history in a way consistent with scientific explanations of speciation, with similarities to the ideas of progressive creationism that God created \"kinds\" of animals sequentially.\n\nRegarding the embracing of Darwinian evolution, historian Ronald Numbers describes the position of the late 19th-century geologist George Frederick Wright as \"Christian Darwinism\".\n\nHistorians of science (and authors of pre-evolutionary ideas) have pointed out that scientists had considered the concept of biological change well before Darwin.\n\nIn the 17th century, the English nonconformist/Anglican priest and botanist John Ray, in his book \"The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1692)\", had wondered \"why such different species should not only mingle together, but also generate an animal, and yet that that hybridous production should not again generate, and so a new race be carried on\".\n\n18th-century scientist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) published \"Systema Naturae\" (1735- ), a book in which he considered that new varieties of plants could arise through hybridization, but only under certain limits fixed by God. Linnaeus had initially embraced the Aristotelian idea of immutability of species (the idea that species never change), but later in his life he started to challenge it. Yet, as a Christian, he still defended \"special creation\", the belief that God created \"every living creature\" at the beginning, as read in Genesis, with the peculiarity a set of original species of which all the present species have descended.\n\nLinnaeus wrote:\nLinnaeus attributed the active process of biological change to God himself, as he stated:\n\nJens Christian Clausen (1967), refers to Linnaeus' theory as a \"forgotten evolutionary theory [that] antedates Darwin's by nearly 100 years\", and reports that he was a pioneer in doing experiments about hybridization.\n\nLater observations by Protestant botanists Carl Friedrich von Gärtner (1772-1850) and Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter (1733-1806) denied the immutability of species, which (according to Christian apologists) the Bible never teaches. Kölreuter used the term \"transmutation of species\" to refer to species which have experienced biological changes through hybridization, although they both were inclined to believe that hybrids would revert to the parental forms by a general law of reversion, and therefore, would not be responsible for the introduction of new species. Later, in a number of experiments carried out between 1856 and 1863, the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), aligning himself with the \"new doctrine of special creation\" proposed by Linnaeus, concluded that new species of plants could indeed arise, although limitedly and retaining their own stability.\n\nGeorges Cuvier's analysis of fossils and discovery of extinction disrupted static views of nature in the early 19th century, confirming geology as showing a historical sequence of life. British natural theology, which sought examples of adaptation to show design by a benevolent Creator, adopted catastrophism to show earlier organisms being replaced in a series of creations by new organisms better adapted to a changed environment. Charles Lyell (1797-1875) also saw adaptation to changing environments as a sign of a benevolent Creator, but his uniformitarianism envisaged continuing extinctions and replacements. As seen in correspondence between Lyell and John Herschel, scientists were looking for creation by laws rather than by miraculous interventions. In continental Europe, the idealism of philosophers including Lorenz Oken (1779-1851) developed a \"Naturphilosophie\" in which patterns of development from archetypes were a purposeful divine plan aimed at forming humanity. These scientists rejected transmutation of species as materialist radicalism threatening the established hierarchies of society. The idealist Louis Agassiz (1807-1873), a persistent opponent of transmutation, saw mankind as the goal of a sequence of creations, but his concepts were the first to be adapted into a scheme of theistic evolutionism. In \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" published in 1844, its anonymous author (Robert Chambers) set out goal-centred progressive development as the Creator's divine plan, programmed to unfold without direct intervention or miracles. The book became a best-seller and popularised the idea of transmutation in a designed \"law of progression\". The scientific establishment strongly attacked \"Vestiges\" at the time, but later more sophisticated theistic evolutionists followed the same approach of looking for patterns of development as evidence of design.\n\nThe comparative anatomist Richard Owen (1804-1892), a prominent figure in the Victorian era scientific establishment, opposed transmutation throughout his life. When formulating homology he adapted idealist philosophy to reconcile natural theology with development, unifying nature as divergence from an underlying form in a process demonstrating design. His conclusion to his \"On the Nature of Limbs\" of 1849 suggested that divine laws could have controlled the development of life, but he did not expand this idea after objections from his conservative patrons. Others supported the idea of development by law, including the botanist Hewett Watson (1804-1881) and the Reverend Baden Powell (1796-1860), who wrote in 1855 that such laws better illustrated the powers of the Creator. In 1858 Owen in his speech as President of the British Association said that in \"continuous operation of Creative power\" through geological time, new species of animals appeared in a \"successive and continuous fashion\" through birth from their antecedents by a Creative law rather than through slow transmutation.\n\nWhen Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, many liberal Christians accepted evolution provided it was reconciled with divine design. The clergymen Charles Kingsley and Frederick Temple, both conservative Christians in the Church of England, promoted a theology of creation as an indirect process controlled by divine laws. Some strict Calvinists welcomed the idea of natural selection, as it did not entail inevitable progress and humanity could be seen as a fallen race needing salvation. Aubrey Moore also accepted the theory of natural selection, incorporating it into his Christian beliefs as merely the way God worked. Darwin's friend Asa Gray defended natural selection as compatible with design.\n\nDarwin himself, in his second edition of the \"Origin\" (January 1860), had written in the conclusion:\nWithin a decade most scientists had started espousing evolution, but from the outset some expressed opposition to the concept of natural selection and searched for a more purposeful mechanism. In 1860 Richard Owen attacked Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" in an anonymous review while praising \"Professor Owen\" for \"the establishment of the axiom of \"the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things\"\". Sir John Herschel apparently dismissed Darwin's book as \"the law of higgledy-pigglety\", and in 1861 he wrote of evolution that \"An intelligence, guided by a purpose, must be continually in action to bias the direction of the steps of change–to regulate their amount–to limit their divergence–and to continue them in a definite course\". He added \"On the other hand, we do not mean to deny that such intelligence may act according to law (that is to say, on a preconceived and definite plan)\". Christian scientist Sir David Brewster wrote an article called \"\" in which he rejected many Darwinian ideas, such as those concerning vestigial organs or questioning God's perfection in his work. Brewster concluded that Darwin's book contained both \"much valuable knowledge and much wild speculation\", although accepting that \"every part of the human frame had been fashioned by the Divine hand and exhibited the most marvellous and beneficent adaptions for the use of men\".\n\nIn the 1860s theistic evolutionism became a popular compromise in science, and gained widespread support from the general public. Between 1866 and 1868 Owen published a theory of derivation proposing that species had an innate tendency to change in ways that resulted in variety and beauty showing creative purpose. Both Owen and Mivart insisted that natural selection could not explain patterns and variation, which they saw as resulting from divine purpose. In 1867 the Duke of Argyll published \"The Reign of Law\", which explained beauty in plumage without any adaptive benefit as design generated by the Creator's laws of nature for the delight of humans. Argyll attempted to reconcile evolution with design by suggesting that the laws of variation prepared rudimentary organs for a future need.\n\nCardinal John Henry Newman, wrote in 1868: \"Mr Darwin's theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill ... and I do not [see] that 'the accidental evolution of organic beings' is inconsistent with divine design — It is accidental to us, not to God.\"\n\nIn 1871 Darwin published his own research on human ancestry in \"The Descent of Man\", concluding that humans were \"descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears\", which would be classified amongst the Quadrumana along with monkeys, and in turn descended \"through a long line of diversified forms\" going back to something like the larvae of sea squirts. Critics promptly complained that this \"degrading\" image \"tears the crown from our heads\", but there is little evidence that it led to loss of faith. Among the few who did record the impact of Darwin's writings, the naturalist Joseph LeConte struggled with \"distress and doubt\" following the death of his daughter in 1861, before enthusiastically saying in the late 1870s there was \"not a single philosophical question connected with our highest and dearest religious and spiritual interests that is fundamentally affected, or even put in any new light, by the theory of evolution\", and in the late 1880s embracing the view that \"evolution is entirely consistent with a rational theism.\" Similarly, George Frederick Wright responded to Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" and Charles Lyell's 1963 \"Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man\" by turning to Asa Gray's belief, that God had set the rules at the start and only intervened on rare occasions, as a way to harmonise evolution with theology. Wright's faith was not seriously shaken by evolution, but he later suffered a crisis when confronted with historical criticism of the Bible.\n\nAccording to Eugenie Scott: \"In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant seminaries, and it is the official position of the Catholic church.\" Studies show that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan; among 34 countries sampled, only Turkey had a lower rate of acceptance than the United States.\n\nTheistic evolutionism has been described as arguing for compatibility between science and religion, and as such it is viewed with disdain both by some atheists and many creationists.\n\nHominization, in both science and religion, involves the process or the purpose of becoming human. The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, at least for the Abrahamic religions, which hold as a core belief that animals do not have immortal souls but that humans do. Many versions of theistic evolution insist on a special creation consisting of at least the addition of a soul just for the human species.\n\nScientific accounts of the origin of the universe, the origin of life, and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and to account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem. Theistic evolution typically postulates a point at which a population of hominids who had (or may have) evolved by a process of natural evolution acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms. This group might be restricted to Adam and Eve, or indeed to Mitochondrial Eve, although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which such an event occurred should essentially be the same as in paleoanthropology and archeology, but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical. The term \"special transformism\" is sometimes used to refer to theories that there was a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization.\n\nSeveral 19th-century theologians and evolutionists attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics John Augustine Zahm and St. George Jackson Mivart, but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps. and 20th-century thinking tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.\n\nThe American botanist Asa Gray used the name \"theistic evolution\" in a now-obsolete sense for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book \"Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism\". He argued that the deity supplies beneficial mutations to guide evolution. St George Jackson Mivart argued instead in his 1871 \"On the Genesis of Species\" that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution (orthogenesis) by specifying the laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. The Duke of Argyll set out similar views in his 1867 book \"The Reign of Law\". The historian Edward J. Larson stated that the theory failed as an explanation in the minds of biologists from the late 19th century onwards as it broke the rules of methodological naturalism which they had grown to expect.\n\nThe major criticism of theistic evolution by non-theistic evolutionists focuses on its essential belief in a supernatural creator. These critics argue that by the application of Occam's razor, sufficient explanation of the phenomena of evolution is provided by \"natural\" processes (in particular, natural selection), and the intervention or direction of a \"super\"natural entity is not required. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins considers theistic evolution a superfluous attempt to \"smuggle God in by the back door\". \n\nA number of notable proponents of theistic evolution, including Kenneth R. Miller, John Haught, George Coyne, Simon Conway Morris, Denis Alexander, Ard Louis, Darrel Falk, Alister McGrath, Francisco J. Ayala, and Francis Collins are critics of intelligent design.\n\nYoung Earth creationists including Ken Ham criticise theistic evolution on theological grounds, finding it hard to reconcile the nature of a loving God with the process of evolution, in particular, the existence of death and suffering before the Fall of Man. They consider that it undermines central biblical teachings by regarding the creation account as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, instead of treating it as historical. They also fear that a capitulation to what they call \"atheistic\" naturalism will confine God to the gaps in scientific explanations, undermining biblical doctrines, such as God's incarnation through Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

R. Sorley, was a Scottish philosopher. A Gifford Lecturer, he was one of the British Idealist school of thinkers, with interests in ethics.\n\nWilliam Ritchie Sorley was born in Selkirk, Scotland, the son of Anna Ritchie and William Sorley, a Free Church of Scotland minister. He was educated first at Edinburgh University, where he took a degree in philosophy and mathematics. This was followed by New College, Edinburgh where he studied Theology with the intention of training for the church. He gave this up, and after winning the Shaw Fellowship he spent a year at Trinity College, Cambridge where he took Part II of the Moral Sciences Tripos. He subsequently spent several years at Cambridge where he was lecturer and in 1883 he was elected a Fellow at Trinity.\n\nIn 1886, he was appointed to a post at University College, London. After two years he was appointed to a professorship at University College Cardiff, succeeding Andrew Seth as Professor of Logic and Philosophy.\n\nIn 1894 he was appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, and finally in 1900 he succeeded Henry Sidgwick in the Knightbridge Professorship at the University of Cambridge. He held this post until his retirement in 1933. He received the honorary degree \"Legum Doctor\" (LL.D.) from the University of Edinburgh in March 1900, and was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1905.\n\nSorley's main philosophical interest was the place of moral values in the constitution of the universe. He thought that moral values are objective- a view he explains in his Gifford lectures and in his earlv work on the ethics of naturalism. What is morally good is what we are morally bound to pursue within our ability to do so. If it does not lie within our power to act in a certain way, then we are not bound to pursue it and it cannot be a moral value.\n\nHe is now remembered for his \"A History of British Philosophy to 1900\", published in 1920, with its idiosyncratic slant, as a retrospective view from the point of view of British Idealism. Among his other published works are: \"The Ethics of Naturalism: a Criticism\" (second edition 1904), \"The Moral Life and Moral Worth\" (1911), and his Gifford Lectures which he gave in 1914-15 and were published under the title \"Moral Values and the Idea of God\" (second edition 1921). In his obituary, J.H. Muirhead said of this: \"I can remember the sense of freshness and power that this book gave us all at the time\". The poet Charles Sorley was his son.\n\nDuring the long argument about admitting women as students at Cambridge, there were votes by the Senate in 1897 and again in 1920, following intense public debates among lecturers and undergraduates, and the circulation of many flysheets propounding arguments for and against. Sorley was persistently hostile to any presence of women in Cambridge and argued that they were not after equality but sought power and would damage university life. He authored several flysheets with Prof. Ridgeway - both wanted women totally excluded from Cambridge and instead a separate women's university set up for them.\n\nHe died in Cambridge on 28 July 1935 aged 79, following a bout of pneumonia.\n\n\n"}
