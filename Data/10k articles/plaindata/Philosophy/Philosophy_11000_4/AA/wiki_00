His astronomical tables written under the patronage of Sultan Sanjar (\"\", 1115) is considered to be one of the major works in mathematical astronomy of the medieval period. He provided the positions of fixed stars, and for oblique ascensions and time-equations for the latitude of Marv in which he was based. He also wrote extensively on various calendrical systems and on the various manipulations of the calendars. He was the author of an encyclopedia on scales and water-balances.\n\nAl-Khazini was an emancipated slave in Marv, which was then one of the most important cities of Khorasan. He got his name from his master () who was the treasurer of Marv. The term \"khāzin\" was simply the title of the royal treasurer since the early Islamic period. His master made provisions so that al-Khazini could obtain a first-class education. Some believe that al-Khazini was a pupil of Omar Khayyam. While this is not known, he wrote about Khayyam, in particular, he gave a description of the water-balance invented by him (and improved upon by Al-Isfizari). And according to some sources, he collaborated with him on the reformation of the Persian calendar in 1079.\n\nAl-Khazini was known for being a humble man. He refused thousands of Dinar for his works, saying he did not need much to live on because it was only his cat and himself in his household. Al-Khazini was one of only about twenty astronomers of the Islamic era who performed original observations. His works reached Byzantium in the 14th century, in particular, they were studied by George Chrysococces and later by Theodore Meliteniotes.\n\nAl Khazini seems to have been a high government official under Sanjar ibn Malikshah and the sultan of the Seljuk Empire. He did most of his work in Merv, where they are known for their libraries. His best-known works are \"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\", \"Treatise on Astronomical Wisdom\", and \"The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar\".\n\n\"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\" is an encyclopedia of medieval mechanics and hydrostatics composed of eight books with fifty chapters. It is a study of the hydrostatic balance and the ideas behind statics and hydrostatics, it also covers other unrelated topics. There are four different manuscripts of \"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\" that have survived. The balance al-Khazini built for Sanjar's treasury was modeled after the balance al-Asfizari, who was a generation older than al-Khazini, built. Sanjar's treasurer out of fear destroyed al-Asfizari's balance; he was filled with grief when he heard the news. Al-Khazini called his balance \"combined balance\" to show honor towards Al-Asfizari. The meaning of the balance was a \"balance of true judgment\". The job of this balance was to help the treasury see what metals were precious and which gems were real or fake. In \"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\" al-Khazini states many different examples from the Koran ways that his balance fits into religion. When al-Khazini explains the advantages of his balance he says that it \"performs the functions of skilled craftsmen\", its benefits are theoretical and practical precision.\n\nThe \"Treatise on Astronomical Wisdom\" is a relatively short work. It has seven parts and each part is assigned to a different scientific instrument. The seven instruments include: a triquetrum, a dioptra, a \"triangular instrument,\" a quadrant, devices involving reflection, an astrolabe, and simple tips for viewing things with the naked eye. The treatise describes each instrument and their uses.\n\n\"The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar\" is said to have been composed for Sultan Sanjar, the ruler of Merv and his balance was made for Sanjar's treasury. The tables in \"The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar\" are tables of holidays, fasts, etc. The tables are said to have the latitudes and longitudes of forty-three different stars, along with their magnitudes and (astrological) temperaments. It is said that al-Khazini's observations for this work were probably done in Merv in various observatories with high quality instruments.\n\n"}

The National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) was formed out of the Guild of Undergraduates at the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI). Under the leadership of Geddes Granger (now Makandal Daaga), NJAC and the Black Power movement appeared as a serious challenge to the authority of Prime Minister Eric Williams.\n\nThis was coupled with a growing militancy by the trade union movement, led by George Weekes of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union, Clive Nunez of the Transport and Industrial Workers Union and Basdeo Panday, then a young trade union lawyer and activist. The Black Power Revolution began with a 1970 Carnival band named Pinetoppers whose presentation entitled \"The Truth about Africa\" included portrayals of \"revolutionary heroes\" including Fidel Castro, Stokely Carmichael and Tubal Uriah Butler.\n\nThis was followed by a series of marches and protests. Williams countered with a broadcast entitled \"I am for Black Power\". He introduced a 5% levy to fund unemployment reduction and later established the first locally owned commercial bank. However, this intervention had little impact on the protests\n\nIt was mainly led by NJAC's duo of Makandal Daaga and Khafra Khambon in tandem with other various interests within the trade unions, and other social groups like Afro-Trinidadians and were noted to attract many disaffected members of the then ruling People's National Movement (PNM) under Eric Williams.\nA large turnout of the disaffected poor of the cities and towns, as well as those black youth of the disaffected communities were attracted to the uprising and were present in the movement, as well as youths and others from the St. Augustine campus of UWI.\n\nOn 6 April 1970 a protester, Basil Davis, was killed by the police. This was followed on 13 April by the resignation of A. N. R. Robinson, Member of Parliament for Tobago East. The death of this protester led to the Movement to pick up momentum. On 18 April sugar workers went on strike, and there was talk of a general strike. In response to this, Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency on 21 April and arrested 15 Black Power leaders. Responding in turn, a portion of the Trinidad Defense Force, led by Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, mutinied and took hostages at the army barracks at Teteron. Through the action of the Coast Guard, including Officer Hugh Griffith and negotiations between the Government and the rebels, the mutiny was contained and the mutineers surrendered on 25 April.\n\nWilliams made three additional speeches in which he sought to identify himself with the aims of the Black Power movement. He re-shuffled his Cabinet and removed three Ministers (including two white members) and three senators. He also introduced the \"Public Order Act\", which reduced civil liberties in an effort to control protest marches. After public opposition, led by A. N. R. Robinson and his newly created \"Action Committee of Democratic Citizens\" (which later became the Democratic Action Congress), the bill was withdrawn. Attorney General Karl Hudson-Phillips offered to resign over the failure of the bill, but Williams refused his resignation.\n\n\n\n"}

Major figures in the movement include Walter Rodney and the Abeng group.\n\nThe Black Power movement in Trinidad & Tobago emerged in the late-1960s and came to a head with the Black Power Revolution in February 1970. It had as a precursor the labour uprisings of the 1930s. Key figures in the Black Power movement include Makandal Daaga, Clive Nunez and Basdeo Panday. The movement was responsible for bringing about significant social changes within Trinidad & Tobago, in particular the upward mobility of blacks in corporate Trinidad.\n\nThe Haitian revolution is one of the most exemplifying parts in history pertaining to black power in the Caribbean. This revolution led haiti to become the first black republic of the new world. Haitians developed a fierce vibrant and resistant culture in which they defended themselves from the British, Spanish, and French.\n\nBois Caïman is where a Vodou ceremony took place in which the first major slave revolt of the Haitian Revolution was planned. On August 14, 1791, slaves from nearby plantations gathered to participate in a secret ceremony conducted in the woods in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. A prominent slave leader and Vodou priest, Dutty Boukman, gave the signal to begin the revolt. The ceremony began the era of black power in Haiti. The effect a couple months after the revolt was that slave rebels controlled a third of the island by 1792.\n\n\n\nhttps://blog.uwgb.edu/revolutions/\n\nhttp://afropunk.com/search/haiti/\n\nhttp://crawfurd.dk/africa/haiti200.htm\n"}

It is named after F. H. Bradley who discussed the problem in his 1893 book \"Appearance and Reality\". It bears a close kinship to the issue of the unity of the proposition.\n\nBradley raises the problem while discussing the bundle theory of objects, according to which an object is merely a \"bundle\" of properties. This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object. More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an infinite regress. \n\nSuppose, for example, that \"a\" respects \"b\". This state of affairs seems to involve three things: \"a\", \"b\", and the relation of respecting. For the state of affairs of \"a\" respecting \"b\" to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (\"a\", \"b\", and the relation of respecting) exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might say, is that \"a\" and \"b\" \"stand in\" the relation of respecting. But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of \"a\" and \"b\" standing in the relation of respecting. This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: \"a\", \"b\", the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in. Again, however, for it to be the case that \"a\" and \"b\" stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might now say, is that \"a\", \"b\", and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, ad infinitum.\n\nIn \"Appearance and Reality\", Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are \"independently real\". One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b. It does not, in addition, involve a third item, \"the relation of respecting\", to which a and b must then bear some further relation (\"standing in\").\n\nA different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a vicious regress.\n\n\n"}

It was made up of both clerical and lay persons, and its members were Maltese as well as foreign. Its area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly ethics. It also gave considerable importance to biblical studies.\n\nThe society was basically a joint venture between two priests, one French, Francis (or François) Gesualdo, and the other Maltese, Andrew Axac (or Axiak).\n\nBoth priests had separate schools of their own. Gesualdo already had an up and running school at Birgu, in 1526 when Axac transferred his own school there from Mdina. Though other private schools were also present, theirs became quickly known for their somewhat unorthodox teachings. Gesualdo’s and Axac’s friendship might have begun during this time.\n\nAxac did not stay long at Birgu, just a year or less. In 1527 he returned to Mdina where he continued teaching there for some twenty-five years (up till around 1533). It seems that his school, was quite popular. Gesualdo also moved his school to Mdina very shortly after Axac’s relocation.\n\nAround 1530, Gesualdo and Axac together began the \"Society of True Christians\" at Mdina. That was the year in which the Knights Hospitallers were entrusted with the Maltese islands. The society functioned uninterruptedly for some fifteen years under the guidance of the two priests.\n\nThe society was made up of many of the students or former students, and friends, of both Gesualdo and Axac. They met regularly to read and share the writings of Martin Luther, and also of some others, such as Melanchthon and Erasmus. These authors and all their writings were condemned by the Holy See, and as such were fanatically sought out by the Inquisition.\n\nInspired by the Reformation writers, the members of the society harboured an alternative view to the current model of the Catholic Church, to which they all belonged. Amongst other matters, they seem to have denied the divine foundation of the sacraments and their supernatural efficacy, the law of celibacy, the veneration of saints and of sacred images, indulgences, the existence of purgatory, and the primacy of the Roman pontiff (the pope).\n\nMost members of the society were in possession of a copy of the New Testament in vernacular, which some had brought over from Sicily. Though it is not known which was the precise version they possessed, various editions could be found, notably those of Martin Luther, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples, the William Tyndale, and the Froschau Bible. This helped them to adhere to, and deepen, their own version of the \"philosophia Christi\" (the philosophy of Christ), about which they read in Erasmus’ writings.\n\nThe society thus believed in a religion which was not doctrinal, and had no theology, but was solely inspired from the spirituality and morality of the New Testament.\n\nIn 1545, the Inquisition caught up with Gesualdo and Axac, and accused them and their associates of heresy. They were all held prisoners at the palace of the Inquisition at Birgu while their lengthy proceedings were ongoing. They were probably also tortured.\n\nEventually, the larger part of the society members were let off with an admonition. However, Gesualdo and another member, Petit, who were considered to be the most pernicious (\"perniciosissimus hæreticus\"). They both refused to reject their beliefs, and were thus condemned to be burned at the stake (\"uti pertinax et impœnitens ad ignem vivus damnatus\"). Their condemnation was publicly read at the church of St. Lawrence at Birgu on November 5, 1545. The execution was implemented immediately afterwards on that same day at the main square of Birgu. These were the first and, fortunately, the last execution of the sort ever performed in Malta.\n\nAfter Gesualdo’s and Petit’s killing, the society was disbanded forever.\n\nThe following are certainly not the only member of the society. They are the ones whose names have been recorded in the records of the Inquisition since they were considered the most ‘dangerous’ of all. The students, for instance, of both Gesualdo and Axac were never formally accused of heresy, and thus their names, unfortunately, have been lost.\n\n\nUp till now no work is known to have survived by the society or by any of its members. Since the members were all submitted to the scrutiny of the Inquisition, the likelihood of any of their writings surviving is next to nil. However, neither is it impossible.\n\nThe Society of True Christians must be appreciated against the social, political, religious and historical background of its time. Considering all of this, what Gesualdo and Axac did was certainly outstanding and amazing. The whole group was truly exceptional. It was not only up to date in terms of knowledge (considering the limitations of the time) but also philosophically engaging and interesting. Its members must be also considered to be very courageous people.\n\nThe period of their operation was indeed bleak. Nevertheless, these people dared to entertain a new philosophy and dream a new world-view. Their ruthless destruction only goes on to prove how extraordinary their endeavour was.\n\nThe main source of information about the society is practically only that of the annals of the Inquisition. This not only means that the records are extremely difficult to research (if not by a thorough expert in the field) but also taken with a pinch of salt, since the objective of the archives is not to show its victims favourably or in their true light but, on the contrary, to heap upon them shame and dishonour.\n\nThough the members of the society had the New Testament as their basic text, this is certainly not the only reading they did. They were thoroughly familiar with the Greek and Latin classics, with major Christian philosophers, and with the new readings of people like Melanchthon and Erasmus, amongst others. Their ultimate objective was, it seems, to develop a kind of ethical philosophy which was innovative and refreshing, leaving behind them the thought categories of old and discovering a philosophy which was at once more authentic and sensible.\n\nPhilosophy in Malta\n"}

Her current research focuses on normative questions in political philosophy concerning democracy and citizen participation, global governance, human rights, religion and politics. She works in a framework of deliberative democratic theory, where she defends a participatory construal of the democratic ideal against proposals to insulate political decision making from the influence of the citizenry. This conception requires the citizens to respect the priority of public reason over religious or otherwise comprehensive views in their political deliberations in the public sphere. At the level of global governance, she argues against the current state-centric understanding of human rights obligations because of the protection gaps it leaves open. Instead, she advocates a more ambitious construal of the responsibility to protect (R2P) human rights, which she interprets as a provisional duty of the international community as a whole until appropriate institutions are in place to close these gaps. \nLafont is also widely known for her work in Critical Theory, especially for her critical elaboration of themes in the philosophy of Jürgen Habermas. Cristina Lafont’s earlier philosophical work in the philosophy of language of Heidegger’s hermeneutics issues in her identification of a specific form of “linguistic turn” (centered on the “world-disclosing” function of conceptual structures in language) in post-Kantian German philosophy between Hamann and Habermas. The upshot is that the systematic idealistic and constructivist tendency of this tradition is owed to a specific set of assumptions in its linguistic philosophy. In this work, she applies select tools from the theory of meaning developed in analytic philosophy of language to foundational issues from German Continental philosophy. This approach enables fruitful and precise comparisons between, e.g., Robert Brandom’s inferentialist framework and hermeneutics or Habermas’ theory of communicative action. One central tenet of Lafont’s philosophical work that runs throughout these otherwise very different works is her interest in the necessary conditions for normative rational criticism and reasoned change on this basis. This motivates her insistence on the need for realist correctives of the idealism characteristic of German philosophy of language as much as it is behind her critical examination of principles of public reason in deliberative democracy and as it drives her research in human rights (as not merely constructed by but a source of the moral quality of legal and political systems).\n\nLafont graduated ‘cum laude’ with a Licenciatura in philosophy from the Universidad de Valencia in 1987. From there, she moved to Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt (Main), where she obtained her PhD in philosophy (Dr. phil.) ‘summa cum laude’ in 1992 under the supervision of Jürgen Habermas. At the same university, she was awarded the Habilitation in the year 2000.\nCristina Lafont has held numerous positions as a distinguished lecturer or visiting professor in the English-speaking, Spanish-speaking and German-speaking academic world. Thus, she was Visiting professor at the Universidad Autónoma de Mexico (Mexico), Universidad Carlos III Madrid (Spain), Universidad de Oviedo (Spain), Lehrbeauftragte at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt.

{"id": "25683419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25683419", "title": "Eduard Pernkopf", "text": "Eduard Pernkopf\n\nEduard Pernkopf (November 24, 1888 – April 17, 1955) was an Austrian professor of anatomy who later served as rector of the University of Vienna, his \"alma mater\". He is best known for his seven-volume anatomical atlas, \"Topographische Anatomie des Menschen\" (translated as \"Atlas of Topographical and Applied Human Anatomy\"; often colloquially known as the Pernkopf atlas or just Pernkopf), prepared by Pernkopf and four artists over a 20-year period. While it is considered a scientific and artistic masterpiece, with many of its color plates reprinted in other publications and textbooks, it has been in recent years found that Pernkopf and the artists working for him, all of them ardent Nazis, used concentration camp inmates or condemned political prisoners as their subjects.\n\nPernkopf was born in 1888 in the Lower Austria village of Rappottenstein, near the border with Bavaria. The youngest of three sons, he seemed to be considering a career in music upon his completion of the \"Gymnasium\" in Horn. However, the death of his father, the village's doctor, in 1903 led him to pursue medicine instead, as his father's death caused the family considerable hardship that a career as a physician was more likely to reverse.\n\nHe began his studies at the University of Vienna's medical school in 1907. During his time there he became a member of the Student Academic Fraternity of Germany, a student group with a strong German nationalist persuasion. As a student he had worked under Ferdinand Hochstetter, director of the university's anatomy institute. Hochstetter became his mentor and one of his strongest influences. In 1912 he received his medical degree.\n\nFor the next eight years he taught anatomy at various institutions in Austria. He served in the military as a physician for a year during World War I. In 1920 he returned to Vienna to work as one of Hochstetter's assistants, lecturing to first- and second-year students about the peripheral nervous and cardiovascular systems.\n\nBack in Vienna he rose quickly in the academic ranks. In 1926 he earned the title of associate professor, with a promotion to full professor two years later. Five years after that, in 1933, he formally succeeded Hochstetter as the anatomical institute's director. At the ceremony installing him in that position, he acknowledged Hochstetter's tutelage by dropping to his knees in front of the older man and kissing him on the hand.\n\nAlso in 1933, he joined the Nazi Party's foreign organization. The following year he became a member of the \"Sturmabteilung\", better known as the SA, Storm Troopers or \"brownshirts\". In 1938 he was promoted again, becoming dean of the medical school. This occurred at about the same time as the \"Anschluss\", Germany's annexation of Austria into the Third Reich.\n\nIn his new position, in a supportive political environment, Pernkopf put his Nazi beliefs into action. He required medical faculty to declare their ethnic lineage as either \"Aryan\" or \"non-Aryan\" and swear loyalty to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. He forwarded a list of those who refused the latter to the university administration, who dismissed them from their jobs. This amounted to 77% of the faculty, including three Nobel laureates. All of the Jewish faculty were removed this way, making Pernkopf the first Austrian medical school dean to do so.\n\nFour days after becoming dean, he gave a speech to the medical faculty advocating Nazi racial hygiene theories and policies and urging his fellow physicians to implement them in their teaching and practice. They should \"[promote] those whose heredity is more valuable and whose biological constitution due to heredity gives the promise of healthy offspring [and prevent] offspring to those who are racially inferior and of those who do not belong.\" More specifically, he said, the latter could be accomplished by \"the exclusion of those who are racially inferior from the propagation of their offspring by means of sterilization and other means,\" language that has been seen as anticipating both the Nazi euthanasia programs and the Holocaust, the systematic extermination of European Jews and Romani. As he had begun his speech with \"Heil Hitler!\" and a Nazi salute, praising Hitler as \"a son of Austria who had to leave Austria in order to bring it back into the family of German-speaking nations\", he returned to that theme in his conclusion:\n\nAt the time he was first hired as Hochstetter's assistant, he began putting together an informal dissection manual for students. He kept expanding it, and it became popular with the rest of the university instructors and the Austrian medical community. As he attained his full professorship he was offered a contract to expand it into a publishable book, and he eagerly accepted. He was to deliver three volumes.\n\nPernkopf began his atlas in 1933. He worked 18-hour days dissecting corpses, teaching classes and discharging his administrative responsibilities while a team of artists created the images that would eventually be in the atlas. His days began at 5 a.m., when he left notes in shorthand for his wife to type. These became the descriptive text that accompanied the images.\n\nAt the beginning four artists—Erich Lepier, Ludwig Schrott, Karl Endtresser and Franz Batke—worked with Pernkopf. Lepier, Pernkopf's first hire, had largely learned on his own after having to cut short his architectural studies at what is now Vienna University of Technology due to the death of his father, a circumstance similar to that which had shaped Pernkopf's career choice. The other three all had some degree of formal training. Outside of these four, some other artists, mostly family members such as Schrott's father and Batke's wife, contributed some pictures during the atlas's early years.\n\nPernkopf instructed them to paint the organs they saw in as much detail as possible, to make them look like living tissue in print. This was enabled by a special treatment of the paper used for watercolor images that allowed greater detail than that type of paint normally did. The only deviation from this high level of realism was the use of color, where Pernkopf instructed them to use brighter hues than those found in real cadavers so that a reader would better learn to recognize and distinguish key anatomical landmarks.\n\nLike Pernkopf, the four artists were also members of the Nazi Party and committed to its goals. They signaled this through the use of Nazi symbols in their work for the atlas. In his signature, Lepier frequently used the \"r\" at the end of his name as the basis for a swastika, and Endtrasser likewise used two Sig runes, the lightning-bolt insignia of the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), for the \"ss\" in his name. For illustrations he made in 1944, Batke similarly dated them by stylizing the two \"4\"'s as Sig Runes.\n\nThe first volume of the atlas was published in 1937. It was large enough that it required two books, one devoted to anatomy in general and the other covering more specifically the chest and pectoral limbs. Four years later, in 1941, the second volume, likewise requiring two books, came out. It covered the abdomen, pelvis and pelvic limbs.\n\nThat year the war intervened. With the exception of Lepier, ineligible for service because of his severe varicose veins, all the artists entered military service. Lepier nevertheless volunteered as an air raid warden, as did Batke when he returned home after being wounded and receiving the Iron Cross on the Eastern front. These duties interrupted their artistic work.\n\nIn 1943, Pernkopf reached the pinnacle of the academic career ladder when he was named the University of Vienna's rector, its highest official. He continued to serve in those positions until World War II ended two years later, with the surrender of Germany, including Austria. His fortunes would change radically as a result.\n\nTwo days after the surrender, he was dismissed from his post as head of the university's anatomical institute. Fearing that he might suffer legal or political repercussions for his previous Nazi party membership and prewar actions, he went on what he claimed was a vacation to Strobl in the state of Salzburg. However, he was arrested by American military authorities in August 1945, and by May 1946 he had been terminated from all his remaining positions with the university.\n\nHe was held at the Allied prisoner of war (POW) camp in Glasenbach for three years. Although he was ultimately never charged with any crimes, he was required to do regular hard labor throughout his imprisonment. The experience left him drained and exhausted when he returned to Vienna after his release, hoping to continue his work on the atlas.\n\nHis former facilities at the university were unavailable to him since the anatomical institute had been bombed during the war. Hans Hoff, a Jewish physician who had left the Vienna faculty in 1938, gave him two rooms at the school's neurological institute. Pernkopf was reunited with his original artists, some of whom had also been held in POW camps, as well as some new ones, and resumed his earlier demanding schedule. They continued working in the small space Hoff gave them. There was some tension among them as the three who had served felt Lepier, with whom they had never been close personally to begin with, had had a much easier time of it during the war than they had, a bitterness aggravated by the Third Reich's defeat by the Allies. He worked by himself while Pernkopf resumed his prewar schedule despite the privations he had endured.\n\nThey were joined by two new painters. Wilhelm Dietz, older than the others, contributed paintings of the neck and pharynx during his two years on the project. Elfie von Siber painted facial muscles. The third volume, covering the head and neck, was released in 1952.\n\nAt the time of his death, Pernkopf was hard at work on the fourth volume. Two of his former colleagues, Alexander Pickler and Werner Platzer, completed it for its 1960 publication. A few years later, the publisher brought out a condensed two-volume set with all the color plates, removing most of Pernkopf's explanatory text (and, later, airbrushing out the Nazi symbols Lepier and the others added to their signatures). Since little translation was necessary, this was the version of the atlas which medical students and physicians elsewhere in the world came to know and revere.\n\nIn 1995 Pernkopf and his atlas came into the focus of a controversy in scientific ethics following the publication of a paper by Professor Edzard Ernst, who had recently been chair of Rehabilitative Medicine at the University of Vienna, that outlined the Nazi takeover of the university and highlighted the human experimentation that followed, including the role of Pernkopf himself. A year later Dr. Howard Israel, an oral surgeon at Columbia University, revealed that the subject bodies may have in some cases been those of executed political prisoners. Looking at older copies in the archives, Israel discovered many of the Nazi symbols in the artists' signatures, which had been removed from more widely circulated later versions. Since then physicians have discussed whether it is ethical to use the atlas as it resulted from Nazi medical research.\n\nWith the help of other parties, Dr. Israel directed a request to the University of Vienna to investigate the issue. This resulted in the establishment of the Senatorial Project of the University of Vienna \"Studies in Anatomical Science in Vienna from 1938 to 1945\" in 1997. The project confirmed that at least 1,377 bodies of executed persons were delivered to the University during the Nazi times and its usage cannot be excluded from at least 800 images of the atlas. As a result, the atlas' publisher directed that an insert noting this possibility be mailed to all libraries holding the atlas, and stopped printing new copies.\n\nSome readers have wondered if the bodies shown in cutaway may have been Jewish inmates at concentration camps, since they appear gaunt and have shaved heads or close-cropped haircuts. Israel asked the Simon Wiesenthal Center if this might have been the case. Wiesenthal himself answered that it was unlikely, since during the Third Reich the Vienna \"Landsgericht\", or district court, passed death sentences solely on \"non-Jewish Austrian patriots, communists and other enemies of the Nazis.\" Further, it has long been standard practice to shave the heads of cadavers prior to dissection.\n\nScientists and bioethicists have debated whether it is acceptable to continue to use the atlas for instructional purposes in light of its possible provenance. Opponents have asserted that \"any\" use of the atlas makes the user complicit in Nazi crimes and that modern technology, such as the Visible Human Project (based on the tomographic dissection of a man executed in the United States), will make the atlas redundant if it has not done so already. Proponents have countered that the knowledge gained from the atlas can be ethically separated from its origins nor can it be in some cases easily replaced by modern technology or other atlases. \"[Pernkopf's] atlas is still one of the very best in terms of accuracy, showing levels of detail concerning fascia and neurovascular structures that are of direct relevance for the actual dissection process,\" says Sabine Hildebrandt, a Michigan anatomy professor and German native who has researched him and other Nazi-era anatomists thoroughly.\n\nFurther, they say, its paintings are artistic masterpieces regardless of the politics of the artists. Finally, forcing it out of circulation would be no less an act of censorship than that perpetrated by Hitler's regime when it publicly burned books shortly after assuming power.\n\nSome of the scientists who were involved in bringing the activities of Pernkopf and other Nazi-era anatomists to light advocate for the atlas' continued use. \"[They] can remind us of suffering not only in the past but in the present, that we may be more compassionate physicians, more compassionate citizens of the world,\" says Garrett Riggs, a Florida neurologist and medical historian. \"[A] ban could not atone the great evil committed by human beings on other human beings,\" Hildebrandt argues. \"Rather, it is up to a new human generation to glean good from this murky history by continuing to use Pernkopf's atlas in a rational, historically conscious manner.\"\n\nOn the other hand, \"There can be no doubt that Pernkopf, as head of the Anatomy Institute, was instrumental in the procurement of the bodies of the victims of Nazi terror for dissection, and ultimately, for the creation of his Atlas,\" argues Pieter Carstens, a professor of public law at the University of Pretoria. \"In this sense he was an \"indirect perpetrator\" in the execution of the victims, but a \"direct perpetrator\" in the subsequent processing and pillaging of the bodies.\" Following the theories of bioethicist Charles A. Foster, he sees the anatomist's fundamental crime as a violation of his subjects' dignity. He concludes:\n\n"}

The concept is connected with an ongoing decentralization of energy systems with energy efficiency and renewable energy being used also for a strengthened local energy ownership. With new green technologies available, such a transition is possibly involving new actors: prosumers, renewable energy co-operatives and municipal, community-owned power stations which replace centralised, power corporations.\n\nThis concept is promoted by renewable energy business sector, local communities, labour unions (e.g. Global Labour Institute, Trade Unions for Energy Democracy), think tanks (e.g. Green Institute Foundation) etc. and NGO (e.g. Rosa Luxemburg Foundation).\n\nThere are various concepts of Energy Democracy. One early concept has been published by the Berlin-based group gegenstrom 2012. The thesis paper calls for “a 100% transition to renewable energy as quick as possible\" and a reform of ownership of energy production: “dash energy corporations! Socialise energy provision! The gamete of energy democracy will be publicly owned city utilities (Stadtwerke) and energy cooperatives”. The concept inspired the German climate camps in 2011, as a collection of theses and arguments. The 2012 climate camp Lausitzcamp in Lusatia published a short summary of the concept: “Energy Democracy means ensuring that everyone has access to enough energy. However, the energy must be produced in a way that it neither harms nor endangers the environmental or people. Concretely, this means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, socializing and democratizing the means of production and changing our attitude towards energy consumption.” \n\nIn 2014, a concept of energy democracy was promoted by the city of Boulogne-Billancourt in France. For its participation in the Bloomberg mayors challenge, the city presented an innovative vision of Energy democracy based on the reduction of the use of fossil fuels and a system of incentives to encourage citizens in reducing their energy consumption.\n\nEnergy-democracy has been a successful concept of grass roots movements to combine resistance against fossil fuel exploitation like coal or shale gas with a positive alternative agenda. \"The hope, moreover, is that energy democracy might offer new spaces for collaboration between ecological movements and movements for social, economic and workplace justice.\"\n\nAcademic, James Goodman, details the difference between energy policy in Germany and India, exploring public participation in approaches to renewable energy. He concludes that 'energy policies are found to be increasingly embedded in the wider 'climate dialectic', forcing new, more transformative possibilities onto the agenda.'\n\n"}

When the expenses of the state were greater than its revenue, it was usual for the prytaneis to summon an assembly of the people -- \"ecclesia\" -- and, after explaining the necessities of the state, to call upon the citizens to contribute according to their means.\n\nThose who were willing to contribute then rose and said what they would give; while those who were unwilling to give anything, remained silent or retired privately from the assembly. The names of those who had promised to contribute, together with the amount of their contributions, were written on tablets, which were placed before the statues of the Eponymi, where they remained until the amount was paid.\n\nThese voluntary contributions were frequently very large. Sometimes the more wealthy citizens voluntarily undertook a \"trierarchy\", or the expenses of equipping a trireme. We read that the freedman Pasion furnished 1000 shields, together with five triremes, which he equipped at his own expense. Chrysippus presented a talent to the state, when Alexander the Great moved against Thebes during the Battle of Thebes; Aristophanes, son of Nicophemus gave 30,000 drachmae for an expedition against Cyprus; Charidemus and Diotimus, two commanders, made a free gift of 800 shields; and similar instances of liberality are mentioned by German classical scholar August Böckh, from whom the preceding examples have been taken.\n"}
{"id": "315067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315067", "title": "Ethical relationship", "text": "Ethical relationship\n\nAn ethical relationship, in most theories of ethics that employ the term, is a basic and trustworthy relationship that one has to another human being, that cannot necessarily be characterized in terms of any abstraction other than trust and common protection of each other's body. Honesty is very often a major focus.\n\nUsually the most basic of these relationships studied is that between the mother and child, and second most basic is between sexual partners—the focus of feminism and Queer theory respectively, where relationships are central. Family role theory extends this to study paternalistic, maternalistic and sibling roles, and postulates that one's later relationships are formed largely in order to fill the roles one has grown to find comfortable as part of one's family environment—the family of origin thus setting pattern for the family of choice. Another type of ethical relationship is that between the student at an institution and his or her instructor. Because teaching is “leadership based upon moral and ethical principles.” The student is positioned into a role where participation means understanding and resolving multiple issues of ethics, including the actions of his or her professor or instructor.\n\nAs contrasted to theories of ethics that derive from dispute resolution, or the meta-ethics as defined in Western moral philosophy, ethical traditions emphasizing abstract moral codes expressed in some language with some judgmental hierarchy, ethical relationship theories tend to emphasize human development. Thus they focus on unequal power and such matters as sexual honesty, marital commitment, child-raising, and responsibility to conduct such essential body and care matters as toilet training, weaning, forming attitudes to sexuality and to masturbation. Failures to consider consequences of teachings or examples set in these matters is disastrous, as it leads to failures of the most fundamental relationship any person has: to their own body, shame in it, pride in it, care for it, etc. Care and concern for other's bodies follows.\n\nNo ethical tradition has failed to prescribe at least some rules for the conduct of such relationships.\n\nCarol Gilligan famously championed the role of relationships as central to moral reasoning, and superior as a basis for understanding human choices than any prior linguistic or meta-ethical concept. This perspective is now commonly called the ethics of care.\n\nLawrence Kohlberg, famous for work on moral development as a part of human development, eventually joined Gilligan in starting a descriptive ethics of relationship conduct in what they called the \"ethical community\" or \"just community\". This was in effect a community of practice which, at least in Kohlberg's conception, had a core epistemic community of those trusted to define and resolve the disputes between members, and to facilitate the growth of moral development, not only in children, but in prisoners and others.\n\nDonald R. C. Reed, whose book \"Following Kohlberg: Liberalism and the Practice of Democratic Community\" (1998) outlined the extension of these principles to deliberative democracy, claims that \"During the four years following publication of Gilligan's \"In a Different Voice\" (1982), Kohlberg and Gilligan both revised their accounts of moral development so that they converged far more than is commonly recognized.\" Reed argued for \"extending this convergence to include the understanding developed in the just community projects.\"\n\nThere is also potential for application of these methods to ethical tradition. Kohlberg's student Burton Visotzky, for instance, in \"The Genesis of Ethics\", 1997, applied the relationship approach to Ethics in the Bible. The book focuses on the choices and interactions of major characters in the \"Book of Genesis\". Visotzky exploits much of the Talmudic, midrash and magisterium, demonstrating that these Jewish theological traditions too had often focused on the ethical relationship, not only between Man and God, but between others in one's family, tribe or community.\n\nMohandas Gandhi, Confucius, Menno Simons and Baruch Spinoza are examples of figures in moral philosophy and political philosophy who focused first and foremost on the ethical choices made in the actual framing and encounter of moral interventions. Greens and New Confucians are two examples of modern movements that are derived in part from relational traditions.\n\n"}

They operate in the Midlothian, Scottish Borders and Edinburgh area of Scotland.\n\nThe \"Garvald School and Training Centre\" was founded near West Linton in 1944 by Dr Hans Schauder, his wife Lisl and others who decided to join him after having worked for some years at the Camphill community in Aberdeen. Dr Schauder himself was of Viennese origin and had fled Austria some years previously as he came from a Jewish family. Connected with Anthroposophy, the medical and therapeutic work of Rudolf Steiner and with the group around Dr Karl König, he had been among the founders of Camphill. After working at Garvald for some years he opened his own practice in Edinburgh and developed his own method of counselling until meeting the Dominican monk, Lefébure, with whom he wrote his best known and pioneering work Conversations on Counselling.\n\nThe Garvald school later became simply the Garvald Training Centre and continued to grow and expand over time into six independent communities:\n\nThe Centres draw their inspiration from the work of Rudolf Steiner, in particular his ideas on Social Therapy expressed through the type of opportunities provided, the approach and interdependence they try to create. It consists in giving structure and rhythm to member’s lives, bringing people together to form a solid community through common activities or the celebration of events and by emphasising the quality of what the workshops produce so that everyone can take pride in achieving the best possible. The items produced should have a value or benefit to others rather than making things for their own sake.\n\nThey provide creative working environments focusing mainly on craft, catering, artistic skills and agriculture. Craft offers a wide range of possibilities for people to express creativity and be connected to nature, so there is much focus on different craft activities. In addition they engage in approaches such as the Talking Points methodology, which focuses on outcomes for service-users and carers and have themselves produced Talking Points tools which have been designed specifically for people with learning disabilities. In this way there is an opportunity for anyone coming to one of the Garvald centres to affect their environment, and the local and often wider community. They become needed by others and relied upon to sustain the creativity and range of goods, art and craft work. A range of therapies like Eurythmy, Creative Speech, Massage and varies other therapeutic arts are also offered.\n\nIn addition to providing structured and creative working environments the majority of their studios and workshops have an enterprise focus, returning income to offset running costs. The opportunities they provide help people to gain confidence, particularly school leavers making the transition into an adult environment. The workshops teach skills that apply in mainstream employment or help an individual develop creativity over a longer period.\n\nThey have experience in supporting people with a range of needs and syndromes including Autism, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Epilepsy, Prader Willi Syndrome and Dual Diagnosis as well as physical and communication difficulties. Members’ ages range from sixteen to the mid seventies.\n\n"}

Her extant corpus of writing can be found in \"The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill\". As is often the case with female opinion-formers, she is now largely remembered for her influence upon her second husband, John Stuart Mill, one of the pre-eminent thinkers of the 19th century.\n\nHarriet Hardy was born in 1807 in Walworth, south London to parents Harriet and Thomas Hardy, a surgeon. Harriet was educated at home and expressed an early interest in writing poetry.\n\nShe married her first husband, John Taylor, in 1826 at age 18. Together, they had three children: Herbert, Algernon, and Helen Taylor. In 1831 Harriet met John Stuart Mill. Their meeting was planned by the leader of Harriet's Unitarian Congregation. John Taylor invited Mill to dinner because of his wife's mutual interest in women's rights. Taylor was already not only writing poetry, but was interested in social reform, and had written a lengthy \"Life of William Caxton\" (which is more of a comprehensive history of the printed and written word) for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Around the time she met Mill, she was, or began, also writing a series of unpublished pieces on women's rights, ethics, toleration and marriage.\n\nHer friendship with Mill quickly blossomed. Taylor was attracted to Mill, who treated her as an intellectual equal. Around eighteen months later, something made Taylor break off their friendship, causing Mill to write her a passionate love letter in French (the only piece of correspondence we have from either for this period of their relationship) in which he refuses to accept her 'eternal adieu', and, although saying 'her wish is his command', insists 'her path and mine are separated, she says; but they can, they must, meet again'. Evidently, she agreed, for they were soon closer than ever, exchanging a pair of lengthy essays, \"On Marriage\", in 1833.\n\nIn these essays, Taylor and Mill discuss the ethical questions of marriage, separation and divorce. Taylor insists that what needs to be done to 'rais[e] the condition of women' is 'to remove all interference with affection, or with anything which is, or which even might be supposed to be, demonstrative of affection'. She criticises the fact that 'women are educated for one single object, to gain their living by marrying'; that 'to be married is the object of their existence'; and 'that object being gained they do really cease to exist as to anything worth calling life or any useful purpose'. She also criticises the hypocrisy and unfairness of the fact that any girl who is seen as 'suitable' for marriage is – because only virgins are seen as suitable – by that very fact completely ignorant as to what marriage entails. She argues for rights to divorce, asking 'who would wish to have the person without the inclination?'. \n\nGoing against the prevailing view that she was rather anti-sex, Taylor says that though 'certain it is that there is equality in nothing now – all the pleasure...being men's, and all the disagreeables and pains being women's', it is equally certain that 'pleasure would be infinitely heightened both in kind and degree by the perfect equality of the sexes'. She adds, 'Sex in its true and finest meaning, seems to be the way in which is manifested all that is highest, best and beautiful in the nature of human beings – none but poets have approached to the perception of the beauty of the material world – still less of the spiritual – and there never yet existed a poet except by the inspiration of that feeling which is the perception of beauty in all forms and by all means which are given us, as well as by sight'. She ends the essay by saying 'It is for you' (i.e. Mill) 'the most worthy apostle of all the loftiest virtues – to teach such as may be taught, that the higher the kind of enjoyment, the greater the degree', and it is noteworthy that Mill is known, in his much-later essay Utilitarianism, for introducing the concept of differences in the quality of pleasures to a previously quantitative 'hedonic calculus' inherited from Jeremy Bentham. \n\nIn late September, or early October, 1833, Taylor's husband agreed to a trial separation. She went to Paris where, after what appears to have been an initial onset of cold feet regarding the possible repercussions of such a move for his, and her, reputation, Mill joined her. Despite evidently being extremely happy there with Mill, Taylor was conscience-stricken regarding her husband, keenly feeling the pain, and possible public humiliation, she was putting him through. Eventually, she decided to return to London, and her husband, yet by the summer of 1834 Harriet was living in her own house in Keston Heath. Mill visited Harriet frequently at her house in Keston Heath and travelled with her and sometimes her children throughout the next two decades.\n\nAfter John Taylor died in 1849, Taylor and Mill waited two years before marrying in 1851. Taylor was hesitant to create greater scandal than the pair already had. Mill's marriage proposal reflected his model of equality. She wrote a number of essays, including several joint-authored pieces with Mill on domestic violence and The Enfranchisement of Women, published in 1851.\n\nHarriet began publishing her works when she was pregnant with her third child, Helen. She provided a variety of literature for the Unitarian journal \"Monthly Repository\" and \"Enfranchisement of Women\". Though she made many contributions over the years, little of her own work was published under her own name during her lifetime. She was the co-author of several newspaper articles on domestic violence published anonymously in the \"Morning Chronicle\", \"Daily News\", and \"Sunday Times\" in the 1840s. She read and commented on all the material produced by John Stuart Mill. In his autobiography, Mill claimed Harriet as the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He added, \"when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen.\" The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.\n\nA letter written by Mill in 1854 suggests the attribution of credit goes both ways for her and John Stuart Mill; \"I shall never be satisfied unless you allow our best book, the book which is to come, to have our two names on the title page. It ought to be so with everything I publish, for the better half of it all is yours\". There is speculation that this indicates some reluctance on her part, potentially in response to a philosophical text published by Mill only or as a coauthored work, but this evidence as well as John Stuart Mill's comments on collaboration in his autobiography indicates the two worked as a pair for much of their work.\n\nJ. S. Mill called her a valuable contributor to much of his work, especially \"On Liberty\", which he later dedicated to her when it was published in 1859, a year after her death. She also contributed to \"Principles of Political Economy\".\n\nHarriet Taylor Mill died in the Hotel d'Europe in Avignon, France, on 3 November 1858 after developing severe lung congestion. Jo Ellen Jacobs has argued that Mill's cause of death may have been syphilis contracted from her first husband. \n\nUpon her death, John Stuart Mill wrote:\n\n\n\n"}

Skeptics sought to investigate the doctrines of the Qur'an, which until then had been accepted as divine revelation. The first independent protest was that of the Qadar (\"Destiny\"), whose partisans affirmed the freedom of the will, in contrast with the Jabarites (\"jabar\", force, constraint), who maintained the traditional belief in fatalism.\n\nIn the second century of the Hegira, a schism arose in the theological schools of Basra, over which Hasan al-Basri presided. A pupil, Wasil ibn Ata, who was expelled from the school because his answers were contrary to tradition, proclaimed himself leader of a new school, and systematized all the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Kadarites. This new school or sect was called Mutazilites (from 'tazala, to separate oneself, to dissent). The sect had three principal dogmas: (1) God is an absolute unity, and no attribute can be ascribed to Him. (2) Man is a free agent. Because of these two principles the Mutazilites designate themselves the \"AsḦab al-'Adl w'al TauḦid\" (The Partisans of Justice and Unity). (3) All knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason; he could acquire knowledge before as well as after Revelation, by the sole light of reason—a fact which, therefore, makes knowledge obligatory upon all men and women, at all times, and in all places.\n\nThe Mutazilites, compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islamic faith, looked for support to the doctrines of philosophy, and thus founded a rational theology, which they designated \" 'Ilm-al-Kalam\" (Science of the Word); and those professing it were called Motekallamin. This appellation, originally designating the Mutazilites, soon became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles. The first Motekallamin had to combat both the orthodox and the infidel parties, between whom they occupied the middle ground; but the efforts of subsequent generations were entirely concentrated against the philosophers. The later Motekallamin formed a school known as Ash'arism, which regarded itself as the champion of orthodoxy, and references by the later philosophers to \"Motekallamin\" (theologians) should usually be taken as meaning the Ash'arites.\n\nFrom the ninth century onward, owing to Caliph al-Ma'mun and his successor, Greek philosophy was introduced among the Arabs, and the Peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them; such were Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Roshd, all of whose fundamental principles were considered as heresies by the Motekallamin.\n\nAristotle, the prince of the philosophers, demonstrated the unity of God; but from the view which he maintained, that matter was eternal, it followed that God could not be the Creator of the world. Again, to assert, as the Peripatetics did, that God's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe, and not to individual and accidental things, is tantamount to giving denial to prophecy. One other point shocked the faith of the Motekallamin—the theory of the intellect. The Peripatetics taught that the human soul was only an aptitude—a faculty capable of attaining every variety of passive perfection—and that through information and virtue it became qualified for union with the active intellect, which latter emanates from God. To admit this theory would be to deny the immortality of the soul (see Alexander of Aphrodisias).\n\nWherefore the Motekallamin had, before anything else, to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter, and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by Democritus. They taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor extension. Originally atoms were created by God, and are created now as occasion seems to require. Bodies come into existence or die, through the aggregation or the sunderance of these atoms. But this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter. For, indeed, if it be supposed that God commenced His work at a certain definite time by His \"will,\" and for a certain definite object, it must be admitted that He was imperfect before accomplishing His will, or before attaining His object. In order to obviate this difficulty, the Motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to Time, and claimed that just as Space is constituted of atoms and vacuum, Time, likewise, is constituted of small indivisible moments. The creation of the world once established, it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a Creator, and that He is unique, omnipotent, and omniscient.\n\nToward the middle of the eighth century a dissenting sect—still in existence to-day—called Karaites, arose in Judaism. In order to give a philosophical tinge to their polemics with their opponents, they borrowed the dialectic forms of the Motekallamin, and even adopted their name (Mas'udi, in \"Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Royale,\" viii. 349-351), and thus transplanted the Kalam gradually to Jewish soil, to undergo the same transformations there as among the Arabs.\n\nOne of the most important early Jewish philosophers influenced by Islamic philosophy is Saadia Gaon (892-942). His most important work is \"Emunoth ve-Deoth\" (Book of Beliefs and Opinions). In this work Saadia treats of the questions that interested the Motekallamin so deeply—such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. — and he criticizes the philosophers severely.\n\nFor Saadia creation is not problematic: God created the world \"ex nihilo\", just as Scripture attests; and he contests the theory of the Motekallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter. To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Motekallamin. Only the attributes of essence (sifat-al-datiat) can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (sifat-al-af'aliyat). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres. Here Saadia contradicts the Motekallamin, who considered the soul an \"accident\" (compare \"Moreh,\" i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: \"Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident\" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: \"If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love,\" etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views; just as the Jewish and Muslim Peripatetics stopped short in their respective Aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion.\n\nJewish philosophy entered upon a new period in the eleventh century. The works of the Peripatetics —Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina (Avicenna)—on the one side, and the \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\"—a transformed Kalam founded on Neoplatonic theories—on the other side, exercised considerable influence upon Jewish thinkers of that age. The two leading philosophers of the period are Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron) and Bahya ibn Pakuda — the former standing upon a purely philosophical platform, the latter upon a religio-philosophical one; and both attaining similar results. Both believe in a universal matter as the substratum of all (except God) that exists; but Bahya goes further and determines what that matter is: it is Darkness (\"Ma'ani al-Nafs,\" translated by Broydé, p. 17). But this matter did not exist from all eternity, as the Peripatetics claimed. It is easy to perceive here the growth of the Peripatetic ideas as to substance and form; but influenced by religion, these ideas are so shaped as to admit the non-eternity of matter. In all that pertains to the soul and its action, Gabirol and Bahya are undoubtedly influenced by the \"Brethren of Purity.\" Man (the microcosm) is in every way like the celestial spheres (the macrocosm). Just as the heavenly spheres receive their motion from the universal soul—which is a simple substance emanating from God—so man receives his motion from the rational soul—another simple substance emanating from Him.\n\nIn fact, creation came through emanation, and in the following sequence: (1) The active intellect; (2) the universal soul—which moves the heavenly sphere; (3) nature; (4) darkness—which at the beginning was but a capacity to receive form; (5) the celestial spheres; (6) the heavenly bodies; (7) fire; (8) air; (9) water; (10) earth (\"Ma'ani al-Nafs,\" 72; compare Munk, l.c., p. 201). But as regards the question of the attributes which occupy the Jewish and Muslim theologians so much, Bahya, in his work on ethics, \"Hovot ha-Levavot,\" written in Arabic under the title of \"Kitab al-Hidayat fi faraidh al Kulub\" (The Duties of the Heart), is of the same opinion as the Motazilites, that the attributes by which one attempts to describe God should be taken in a negative sense, as excluding the opposite attributes. With reference to Gabirol, a positive opinion can not be given on this point, as his \"Fons Vitæ\" does not deal with the question; but there is reason to believe that he felt the influence of the Asharites, who admitted attributes. In fact, in his poetical philosophy, entitled \"Keter Malkut\" (The Crown of Royalty), Gabirol uses numerous attributes in describing God. By way of a general statement, one may say that the Neoplatonic philosophy among the Jews of the eleventh century marks a transitional epoch, leading either to the pure philosophy of the Peripatetics or to the mysticism of the Kabbalah.\n\nThe twelfth century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the Kalam, which latter, being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. This supreme exaltation of philosophy was due, in great measure, to Gazzali (1005-1111) among the Arabs, and to Judah ha-Levi (1140) among the Jews. In fact, the attacks directed against the philosophers by Gazzali in his work, \"TuḦfat al-Falasafa\" (The Destruction of the Philosophers), not only produced, by reaction, a current favorable to philosophy, but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism, they thereafter making their theories clearer and their logic closer. The influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the Arabic Peripatetic school ever produced, namely, Ibn Baja (Aven Pace) and Ibn Roshd (Averroes), both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy.\n\nSince no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, Gazzali found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This illustrious poet took upon himself to free religion from the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the \"Cuzari,\" in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Motekallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, \"I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them\" (\"Cuzari,\" v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Motekallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: \"Does the Kalam give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?\" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in his eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament.\n\nBut the Hebrew Gazzali was no more successful than his Arabian prototype; and his attacks, although they certainly helped to discredit the Kalam—for which no one cared any longer—were altogether powerless against Peripatetic philosophy, which soon found numerous defenders. In fact, soon after the \"Cuzari\" made its appearance, Abraham ibn Daud published his \"Emunah Ramah\" (The Sublime Faith), wherein he recapitulated the teachings of the Peripatetics, Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, upon the physics and metaphysics of Aristotle, and sought to demonstrate that these theories were in perfect harmony with the doctrines of Judaism. \"It is an error generally current,\" says Ibn Daud in the preface of his book, \"that the study of speculative philosophy is dangerous to religion. True philosophy not only does not harm religion, it confirms and strengthens it.\"\n\nThe authority of Ibn Daud, however, did not suffice to give permanence to Aristotelianism in Judaism. This accomplishment was reserved for Maimonides, who discussed the relevance of the philosophy of Aristotle to Judaism; and to this end he composed his immortal work, \"Dalalat al-Ḥairin\" (Guide for the Perplexed) —known better under its Hebrew title \"Moreh Nevuchim\"—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by Jewish thinkers.\n\nIn this work, Maimonides, after refuting the propositions of the Motekallamin, considers Creation, the Unity of God, the Attributes of God, the Soul, etc., and treats them in accordance with the theories of Aristotle to the extent in which these latter do not conflict with religion. For example, while accepting the teachings of Aristotle upon matter and form, he pronounces against the eternity of matter. Nor does he accept Aristotle's theory that God can have a knowledge of universals only, and not of particulars. If He had no knowledge of particulars, He would be subject to constant change. Maimonides argues: \"God perceives future events before they happen, and this perception never fails Him. Therefore there are no new ideas to present themselves to Him. He knows that such and such an individual does not yet exist, but that he will be born at such a time, exist for such a period, and then return into non-existence. When then this individual comes into being, God does not learn any new fact; nothing has happened that He knew not of, for He knew this individual, such as he is now, before his birth\" (\"Moreh,\" i. 20). While seeking thus to avoid the troublesome consequences certain Aristotelian theories would entail upon religion, Maimonides could not altogether escape those involved in Aristotle's idea of the unity of souls; and herein he laid himself open to the attacks of the orthodox.\n\nIbn Roshd (or Ibn Rushd or Averroes), the contemporary of Maimonides, closes the philosophical era of the Arabs. The boldness of this great commentator of Aristotle aroused the full fury of the orthodox, who, in their zeal, attacked all philosophers indiscriminately, and had all philosophical writings committed to the flames. The theories of Ibn Roshd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina and Al-Farabi. Like all Arabic Peripatetics, Ibn Roshd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world—hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter. But while Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and other Arab philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on religious dogmas, Ibn Roshd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, \"Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation ex nihilo (Munk, \"Mélanges,\" p. 444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Ibn Sina declared—in order to make concessions to the orthodox—but also a necessity. Driven from the Arabian schools, Arabic philosophy found a refuge with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men—such as the Tibbons, Narboni, Gersonides—joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Roshd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil Joseph ben Judah, spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Roshd's commentary.\n\nVahid Brown states that the cross-fertilizaton among Jewish and Islamic philosophical mysticism, including Kabbalah and Sufism, in Al-Andalus, Spain during its Golden Age, apart from its impact on European Renaissance, had a strong influence in later developments in both philosophies in the rest of the Jewish and Muslim world.\n\n"}

The Tibetan text was translated from the Sanskrit by Surendrabodhi () and Jñānasūtra.\n\nIn the short-verse text of the \"Madhyamakālaṃkāra\", Śāntarakṣita details his philosophical synthesis of the conventional truth of Yogacara with the ultimate truth of the Madhyamaka, assisted by Buddhist logic with a lengthy discussion of the \"neither one nor many\" argument.\n\nThe \"Madhyamakālaṃkāra\" is a brief doxographic reprise, a critical thumbnail survey of the philosophical history of Buddhism and its inter- and intra-Dharmic dialogue of medieval Islam. Though somewhat lyrical, it is a summary and a key to his encyclopedic \"Tattvasamgraha\". It has the fullness of the Sutrayana and Mahayana traditions' development in its place of origin before the Buddhist tradition of India was transposed by the cultures of the Far East (such as China and Japan) and elsewhere (such as Ceylon and Kashmir), where Buddhism was already flourishing in culturally specific forms. The text refutes challenges of Buddhist systems and tenets from within the tradition, and is a pedagogical discourse on the development of the yana; the philosophical challenges posed by the non-Buddhist religions and non-Dharmic traditions of India, and crystallizes a dialectical sophistication of Indian logic and the clarity of debate expected of a Khenpo of Nalanda Vihara. The text was seminal in the tradition of Samye which became known as a Nyingma institution in contrast to the emergent Sarma traditions of Atisha's (980-1054) translation phase. It documents the Nyingma view of the Two Truths, making it a canonical work. Although the text was marginalized due to the rise of the Prasaṅgika subschool of Mādhyamaka, it was revived by Ju Mipham's (1846–1912) 1876 \"Commentary\".\n\nThe \"Madhyamakālaṃkāra\" and its tradition survived the destruction of Nalanda Vihara and the ascendancy of the Muslim empire in India during the 13th-century eclipse of Buddhism through its transplantation to the Tibetan Plateau by Śāntarakṣita at the request of Trisong Detsen. It was taught at the Samye Monastery, which was safeguarded by the Himalayas.\n\nLipman (1979) published a study of the \"Madhyamakālaṃkāra\" in English. The text and Ju Mipham's commentary are available in studies by Doctor (2004) and the Padmakara Translation Group (2005). Blumenthal (2004) also provides a version of the \"Madhyamālaṃkāra\" with commentary by Gyaltsab Je (1364–1432).\nAccording to Doctor (2004: p.ix), the \"Madhyamakālaṃkāra\"\n\n ... is renowned as the principal scripture of the Yogācāramadhyamaka. Although masters such as Ārya Vimuktisena (6th century CE) are said to have set forth their presentations of the Madhyamaka in a way that employs the assertions specific to the Vijñānavāda, Śāntarakṣita was the one to found an actual system in which the ultimate freedom from constructs (Sanskrit \"niṣprapañca\", Tibetan \"spros bral\") is realized through insight into the non-existence of any external matter (\"bāhyārtha\", \"phyi don\"). This synthesis of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka, the two great currents of Mahāyāna philosophy, the principles of the vast and the profound as originally set forth by Asaṇga (fl. 4th century) and Nāgārjuna (possibly 150-250 CE) respectively, is also characterized by its use of the pramāṇa methods of Dignāga (5th-6th century) and Dharmakīrti (6th-7th century) as integral steps towards the realization of the ultimate. \n\nBerzin (2006) translates the title into English as \"A Filigree of the Middle Way (dBu-ma rgyan, Skt. Madhyamaka-alamkara)\".\n\nIndian logic is primarily a study of inferences and their patterns. A pramana is a means of knowledge. Indian logic was influenced by grammar, and Greek (or classical) logic was influenced by mathematics. Vidyabhusana (1921), Randle (1930) and Fyodor Shcherbatskoy (1930) used the terms \"Indian logic\" and \"Buddhist logic\".\n\nThe Padmakara Translation Group (2005: p. 157) rendered Mipham's advice that Buddhist logic is required to engage the text:\n\nIn general, it is important to be familiar with the teachings on probative signs and reasoning and, within that context, the notions of other-elimination, the three conditions of the correct sign, and all the methods of proof or refutation.\nAccording to the doctrine of \"apoha\" (\"gshan-sel-wa\" in Tibetan), an entity is defined as the negation of its opposite; a cow is not a non-cow.\n\nDignaga formulated three conditions (Sanskrit: \"trairūpya\"; Wylie: tshul-gsum) which a logical sign or mark (\"linga\") must fulfill:\nWhen a \"linga\" is identified, there are three possibilities; the sign may be present in all, some or none of the \"sapakṣas\" or \"vipakṣas\". Identifying a sign assumes that it is present in the \"pakṣa\", and the first condition is met. Dignaga combined these in his \"Hetucakra\".\n\nThe \"Commentary on Difficult Points\" (Sanskrit: Madhyamālaṃkāra-panjika, Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi dka' 'grel) was written by Kamalaśīla (fl. 713-763) Another commentary, \"Remembering The Ornament of the Middle Way\" (Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi brjed byang), was written by Gyaltsab Je (1364–1432). Lobzang Dongak Chökyi Gyatso (Wylie: blo bzang mdo sngags chos kyi rgya mtsho, 1903–1957), also known as Tulku Sungrap, wrote the commentary translated into English as \"The Sword to Cut Through False Views\" (Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi mchan 'grel nyung ngu lta ngan gcod pa'i ral gri).\n\nThe title of Ju Mipham's \"Commentary\" (Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi rnam bshad 'jam dbyangs bla ma dgyes pa'i zhal lung) conveys Mipham's precepts in honouring the dictate of his guru (\"rtsa ba'i bla ma\"), Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892), who charged him with the commentary. Manjushri is used as a term of respect for the scholarship and understanding beyond letters and words of his Rimé teacher. Suchness is the revelation of Mipham's vajrayana from the Padmakara Translation Group's colophon (2005: p. 382):\n\nSeeing that there are many reasons for expounding the Madhyamakalankara, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, our incomparable guide, unbounded in his kindness, whose very name I hardly dare to pronounce, who is the very personification of the compassion of the abbot Bodhisattva, of the master Padmasambhava, and of King Trisongdetsen, who is the sovereign among the learned and accomplished, who is supreme Manjushri appearing in the form of a monk in saffron robes, and whose renown fills the world, gave to me the Indian and Tibetan commentaries on the Madhyamakalankara, asking me to study them well and to compose a commentary. And as his diamondlike injunction came down upon my head, I earnestly gave myself to the task.\nRingu Tulku \"et al.\" (2006: pp. 193–194), in their survey of the Rimé movement, convey the importance of Mipham's \"Commentary\" to the Nyingmapa and their view of the Two Truths doctrine in light of the Svatantrika Madhyamaka (\"those who assert the ultimate is the illusory nature\") view and its Shentong Madhyamaka refinement as qualifying the Prasangika Madhyamaka (\"those who make no assertions\"):\n\nThen, for the ultimate truth, there are two schools of Madhyamaka: those who assert the ultimate is the illusory nature, and those who make no assertions. To explain further, the first says that the illusory nature is established when the perceiver of an object experiences a perception of that object as being unreal. This view was put forth by Kamalashila, Shantarakshita, and other proponents of the Svatantrika Madhyamaka school. Their view is clearly explained in Mipham Jamyang Gyatso's commentary on Shantarakshita's 'Ornament of the Middle Way.' This commentary by Mipham Rinpoche is often considered the most important philosophical text of the Nyingma lineage in Tibet, particularly for those who follow Mipham Rinpoche's understanding of the Shentong Madhyamaka view.\nThe mindstream of sentient beings is one application of the argument, neither one nor many. 'Neither one nor many' is an application of the third function of the catuṣkoṭi of Indian logic]]. Hopkins and Napper (1983, 1996: p. 160), in \"Meditation on Emptiness\", discussed whether or not a series may be considered a unit:\n\nWhen a continuum of a lifetime is sought in the individual moments of the continuum, it cannot be found. The continuum is not the individual moments nor their composite; if a continuum were a composite of the moments, either each moment would be a continuum or there would be no separate moments.\nIn the ninth shloka of the \"Madhyamālaṃkāra\", Śāntarakṣita refutes personal singularity; \"person\" is conveyed a continuum understood as \"neither one nor many\". The Padmakara Translation Group qualifies the word \"person\" (Wylie: gang zag), extending it to all sentient beings. The shloka is translated by the group and Doctor. Ju Mipham's commentary on the verse is likewise translated by both sources.\n\nJu Mipham made five assertions not unique to Śāntarakṣita's view:\n\nIn the first assertion, Śāntarakṣita makes the Sautrantika distinction that objects of cognition are of two kinds: abstract, theoretical mental objects (including generalities, like classes of objects and their names) and actual things, defined as things which function. Although the Sautantrika made that distinction for conventional and ultimate truth, Śāntarakṣita discards theoretical or general objects and discusses actual things as conventional truth. He incorporates Dharmakirti's cognition which analyzes conventionalities, connecting that with cognition which analyzes for ultimacy.\n\nIn the second assertion, a self-reflective awareness (svasaṃvedana) exists; consciousness can be aware of objects of cognition. This position was later critiqued by Je Tsongkhapa as implying that a self-reflective awareness is separate from objects of cognition. Ju Mipham later qualified its meaning; cognition is self-aware, not a separate material thing. \nIn the third assertion, the consciousness-only view of conventional appearances is the best way to progress. Still affirming the supremacy of the Madhyamaka school when students analyze for ultimacy, when relating to conventionalities the mind-only position is recommended.\n\nThe fourth assertion distinguishes between the ultimate way of abiding established by the Madhyamaka method (the non-enumerated ultimate) and an approximate (enumerated) ultimate: a lesser, conventional understanding of the ultimate which leads to the non-enumerated ultimate. As part of his explanation of why this is useful, Mipham quotes Gorampa (who references the four conceptual extremes) (Wylie: mtha' bzhi; Sanskrit: caturanta):\nTo analyze the extremes of existence and non-existence, Ju Mipham advises students to contemplate and establish the lack of inherent existence and then contemplate the extreme of non-existence. In contemplating step by step and enumerating the conceptual extremes, a student progresses toward the ultimate. When all extremes have been analyzed, they reach the non-enumerative (true) ultimate.\n\nIn the fifth assertion, analysis of objects with respect to approximate (enumerated) ultimates does not create a problem of true establishment. A distinction can be made when analyzing for each case, including the two approaches to cognition (one for the conventional domain and the other to analyze for ultimacy) which are his additions to the Pramana tradition of valid cognition. Mipham uses this demonstration in his commentary to point out a problem with Je Tsongkhapa's approach of negating the predicate of \"true establishment\" instead of the object of perception, which is avoided in Śāntarakṣita's approach. Mipham also notes that many Prasaṅgika writers (similar to their Svatantrika counterparts) made positive assertions to move students closer to the ultimate view, pointing out that the distinction between Prasangika and Svatantrika lies in how students are taught about conventionalities and not in the consideration of ultimate truth. He concludes that Je Tsongkhapa, in making a distinction based on true establishment, proposes a Svatantrika rather than a Prasangika approach.\n\n\n"}

In the past two decades, his work was mainly devoted to the study of Nietzsche and Heidegger.\n\nĐurić studied law, philosophy and classic philology in Belgrade, where he obtained his PhD with the thesis on \"Ideas of the Natural Law in Greek Sophists\" (1954). He was professor at Law School from 1954 until 1973, when, for political reasons, he was removed from the University. In 1954 he was appointed as Research Fellow at the University of Belgrade's Law School, where he was later promoted to Assistant Professor in 1957, Associate Professor in 1964, and full Professor in 1969. He taught History of Political Theory, General Sociology and Methodology of Social Science.\n\nIn 1972, Mihailo Đurić was expelled from the University, tried and sentenced to 9 months in prison for his criticism of the 1971 Constitutional Amendments as well as his opposition to demolishing of the Petar Petrović Njegoš chapel on Mount Lovćen. The discussion at the Law Faculty was delivered in a public discussion within the University building and the article on Njegoš in a literary review written in opposition to the destruction.\n\nDuring his trial and imprisonment, many public figures expressed their opposition to then Yugoslav communist government, among them philosopher Ernst Bloch.\n\nAfter the release from prison Đurić was formally employed at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, from 1974 until 1989, when he returned to University. From his release from prison (1972), he was also a visiting professor at the Universities of Vienna, Berlin and Augsburg. In 1991, after rehabilitation, he returned to Law School. For many years Đurić was a member of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy, the Scientific Council of which he chaired from 1986 until 1998.\n\nStarting from 1980s, Đurić's writings both in Serbian and in German fundamentally contributed to our understanding of the works of Nietzsche and Heidegger and the crucial link between these two philosophers. While his \"Nietzsche and the Metaphysics\" (1984) and \"The Challenge of Nihilism\" (1986) concentrate mainly on Nietzsche, the \"On the Need of Philosophy Today: Philosophy between East and West\" is mainly a book about Heidegger and his reading of Nietzsche.\n\n\n\n"}

Imagine an amoeba which undergoes symmetrical fission into two sister amoebae (call them B and C). We tend to think that before fission there was one amoeba (call it A), but what has happened to it? It has not died, for death is a biological state, and there are no dead amoebae lying around after the fission! In fact, there is more life after the fission than there was before, i.e. two live amoebae instead of just one. Has A somehow ceased to exist without dying? Is A still around, and identical with either B or C? It cannot be identified with both B and C, for identity is a transitive relation, and B is certainly not the same amoeba as C. Yet, the fission was symmetrical, so neither B nor C has any more or less claim to be A than the other. This is the problem. We seem to be forced to say that A has ceased to exist, but the m.o. view provides us with another option, consistent with all of the above considerations. The m.o. view is that there were two distinct but coincident amoebae before fission, occupying the same body of matter, but which diverge upon fission into the same two distinct, but no longer coincident, amoebae. The number of amoebae hasn't increased, i.e. there were two before fission, and there are the same two after fission. The amoeba has \"divided without multiplying\"! The m.o. view has also been applied to hypothetical cases of symmetrical fission involving persons. On the face of it, the m.o. view contravenes the principle of identity of indiscernibles. However, one and the same physical object can be a proper part of two or more distinct objects (e.g., a road intersection is part of two distinct roads), which leads to four-dimensionalism, whereby, for example, an amoeba at a time (amoeba stage) is a temporal part of an amoeba extended in time, i.e., objects have temporal parts.\n\n"}

He wrote the poem in the Spring of 1895 in New York. In this poem Vivekananda expressed his strong desire to return home. as he felt, the task of spreading his Master's message abroad was finally accomplished.\n\nIn 1893 Swami Vivekananda went to United States to join Parliament of the World's Religions. There he got overwhelming success and public attention. From 1893 to 1896, Vivekananda conducted a series of public lectures, religious classes, discourses in different states of United States and England. In the beginning of 1895, upon the requests of his disciples and followers of New York, he agreed to conduct a session of private classes for some of his selected disciples at the Thousand Island Park, New York. The session of private classes ran from mid-June to early August 1895. After finishing his works, he moved to New York.\n\nAt this time he was desperate to return home as he started feeling that the task of spreading the message of his Master, Ramakrishna abroad was finally accomplished.\n\nMy Play is Done (excerpt)\n<poem>\nEver rising, ever falling with the waves of time,\nFrom fleeting scene to scene ephemeral,\nOh! I am sick of this unending force;\nThis ever running, never reaching,\nFrom life to life I'm waiting at the gates,\nDim are my eyes with vain attempt\nOn little life's high, narrow bridge\nThe struggling, crying, laughing throng.\n</poem>\n\nIn this poem Vivekananda narrates and tries to explain the elements of human life from the aspect of philosophy and Vedanta. He observes the \"Bhavacakra\", the unending waves of \"Saṃsāra\", which are always rising and always falling. He confesses that he is sick of this unending force which is never reaching anywhere, nor can he see a distant glimpse of the shore. The poet feels, it is impossible to please the unending waves of time and life.\n\nHe fails to understand the reason and identify the destination of all the joys, sorrows, tears and struggling of men. He thinks not only he, but no one knows the answer of the question. He realizes, a man in this world has only two choices— either forgetting everything and attempting to enjoy the world as it is, where the enjoyment will be momentary and in every step he will face obstacles, or he may attempt to find the truth. When the poet chooses the second path and strives to find the truth, he discovers the whole world, \"(Samsara)\" is like \"floating bubble\", where everything is \"hollow\" including name, fame, life and death.\n\nThen, the poet confesses that he is tired, tired of his works, tired of the non-understandable unending ebb and flow of the life and praying to God, calling Him as \"Mother\", who sent the poet to the world, to provide him refuge. He prays to Mother to rescue him from the world of false aspirations, delusion and cycles to life and death, as he thinks, his play (i.e. work) is done and he should be given freedom now.\n\n"}

It is considered the most authoritative work on \"Juche\".\n\nThe work, although probably ghostwritten for him, legitimized Kim as the sole \"bona fide\" interpreter of the ideology. The treatise systemizes Kim Jong-il and his father Kim Il-sung's thought on the \"Juche\" philosophy. The treatise marks \"Juche\"s departure from the materialism of Marxism–Leninism and posits the consciousness of the massess as dependent on the working class leader.\n\nAccording to Kim Jong-il, the \"Juche\" idea is composed of a philosophical principle, socio-historical principles, and guiding principles. The philosophical principle can be summarized with Kim Il-sung's maxim that \"man is the master of everything and decides everything.\" The socio-historical principles entail that the working masses are the subject of history. The guiding principles are: independent stance, creative method, and giving precedence to ideological consciousness. Emphasis on independence in particular has given raise to Kim's \"Songun\", or military first, politics.\n\n\"On the Juche Idea\" is one of Kim Jong-il's major writings on \"Juche\" and considered the most authoritative work on it. It is a standard textbook on the subject. The treatise is a systematization of both President Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il's thought on \"Juche\" philosophy and offers the most comprehensive account of \"Juche\". Kim Il-sung's thought in particular began to be formulated as an original philosophy from the 1970s onward. \"On the Juche Idea\" was sent to the national seminar on the \"Juche\" idea on 31 March 1982 held on the occasion of the 70th birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung (15 April). The occasion was also honored with the unveiling of the \"Juche\" Tower in Pyongyang.\n\nIn the treatise, Kim Jong-il links the birth of the \"Juche\" idea to Kim Il-sung's personal history as a guerrilla fighter during the anti-Japanese struggle. \"On the Juche Idea\" thus furthered Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. Publishing the treatise helped Kim Jong-il to gain legitimacy, particularly emphasizing his intellectual prowess. At the time of writing Kim Jong-il was working as the ideological chief of the country on behalf of his father. Although it was probably ghostwritten for him, by being named as the author Kim Jong-il became the \"one and only bona fide interpreter of the 'immortal Juche idea' of Kim Il Sung.\"\n\nKim Jong-il explains that \"Juche\" is a departure from Marxism–Leninism rather than simply a reinterpretation of it. According to Kim, \"Juche\" offers not only an \"independent and creative\" direction to the Korean revolution, but also establishes a new era for human history. It is idealist as opposed to the materialism of Marxism. The work is considered somewhat abstract in style.\n\nIn comparison to Kim Il-sung's writings, Kim Jong-il pays particular attention to consciousness and the concept of the leader. These two are often linked. According to Charles K. Armstrong, the main message of the treatise is that \"regardless of material circumstances, the masses owe unquestioning obedience to the Great Leader, who alone can bring the masses to consciousness\", adding that the \"message would be extremely useful for the North Korean state in the difficult years ahead\", referring to the death of Kim Il-sung and the North Korean famine in the 1990s, soon after the publication of \"On the Juche Idea\".\n\nIn \"On the Juche Idea\", Kim Jong-il divides \"Juche\" into three components: the philosophical principle, the socio-historical principles, and the guiding principles of the \"Juche\" idea.\n\nThe philosophical principle entails that \"Juche\" is a man-centered philosophy. Man has independence, and , which places man at the center of the world. This is described by the maxim coined by Kim Il-sung in a 1972 interview with Japanese journalists: \"man is the master of everything and decides everything.\" Man transforms the world and embodies \"\", or independence and autonomy. By putting man at the center, Kim Jong-il denies the existence of any supernatural power, although the \"Juche\" philosophy itself can be said to have quasi-religious elements.\n\nThe socio-historical principles of \"Juche\" can be summarized as follows: the working masses are the subject of history. Human history is the struggle of the masses to realize their independence and defend it. Man's socio-historical mission is to transform both nature and society. Here Kim departs from Marxism–Leninism by primarily setting man against nature rather than the proletariat against the bourgeois class.\n\nThere are three guiding principles in \"Juche\":\n\n\"On the Juche Idea\" has been since used as a justification for Kim Jong-il's \"Songun\", or army-first, politics. The justification can be found in an aspect of one of the guiding principles of \"Juche\", which Kim has \"elevated\": self-reliance in defence. Kim went on to publish \"The Workers' Party of Korea Is a \"Juche\"-type Revolutionary Party which Inherited the Glorious Tradition of the DIU\" in October 1982 and focusing in it more on Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities.\n\n\n"}

Having studied at the University of Vienna, he finished his PhD in Law in 1906 and published his first book, \"Die Sozialdemokratie und die Nationalitätenfrage\", in 1907. Although he was politically active during his studies, his gradual rise in the Social Democratic Party of Austria began after he had finished his doctoral studies. He founded \"Der Kampf\", the theoretical journal of the party in 1907 and between 1907 and 1914 he was secretary of the party. As one of Austria's leading \"left\" socialists, Bauer was able to establish himself as a likely successor to Viktor Adler as party leader.\n\nBauer served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was captured on the Eastern Front in the early months of the First World War. He spent three years as a prisoner of war in Russia, returning to Austria in 1917. After Viktor Adler's death in 1918, Bauer became leader of the Austrian Social Democratic Party. From November 1918 to July 1919 the Austrian Social Democrats formed a coalition government with the Christian Social Party and Otto Bauer was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nDespite his Marxist socialism, he had pan-Germanic and nationalist ideas (he negotiated with the Weimar government an eventual accession of Austria into Germany by March 1919 during the German Revolution) and was disappointed when the Treaty of Versailles expressly prohibited the union of Austria with Germany.\n\nWhen Engelbert Dollfuss, with the assistance of elements of the Christian Social Party and the \"Heimwehr\", installed an authoritarian, corporatist dictatorship in 1933, the activities of the Austrian Social Democrats were severely curtailed.

{"id": "38920249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38920249", "title": "Pandeism", "text": "Pandeism\n\nPandeism (or pan-deism) is a theological doctrine first delineated in the 18th century which combines aspects of pantheism with aspects of deism. It holds that the creator deity became the universe (pantheism) and ceased to exist as a separate and conscious entity (deism holding that God does not interfere with the universe after its creation). Pandeism is proposed to explain, as it relates to deism, why God would create a universe and then appear to abandon it, and as to pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe.\n\nThe word pandeism is a hybrid blend of the root words pantheism and deism, combining with which means \"god\". It was perhaps first coined in the present meaning in 1859 by Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal.\n\nPandeism falls within the traditional hierarchy of monistic and nontheistic philosophies addressing the nature of God. It is one of several subsets of deism:\n\nFor the history of the root words, pantheism and deism, see the overview of deism section, and history of pantheism section. The earliest use of the term \"pandeism\" appears to have been 1787, with another use related in 1838, a first appearance in a dictionary in 1849 (in German, as 'Pandeismus' and 'Pandeistisch'), and an 1859 usage of \"pandeism\" possibly in contrast to both pantheism and deism by Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal. Physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein in his 1910 work \"Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis\" (\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\"), presented the broadest and most far-reaching examination of pandeism written up to that point. Weinstein noted the distinction between pantheism and pandeism, stating \"even if only by a letter (\"d\" in place of \"th\"), we fundamentally differ Pandeism from Pantheism.\" But it has been noted that some pantheists have identified themselves as pandeists as well, to underscore that \"they share with the deists the idea that God is not a personal God who desires to be worshipped\".\n\nNoting that Victorian scholar George Levine has suggested that secularism can bring the \"fullness\" which \"religion has always promised\", other authors have since observed:\n\nThis is classed within a general tendency of postmodernity to be \"a stunning amalgamation\" of the views of William James and Max Weber, representing \"the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural\", which \"promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature\". It has also been suggested that \"many religions may classify themselves as pantheistic\" but \"fit more essentially under the description of panentheistic or pandeistic.\"\n\nThe earliest seeds of pandeism coincide with notions of monotheism, which generally can be traced back to the Atenism of Akhenaten, and the Babylonian-era Marduk. Weinstein in particular identified the idea of primary matter derived from an original spirit as found by the ancient Egyptians to be a form of pandeism. Weinstein similarly found varieties of pandeism in the religious views held in China (especially with respect to Taoism as expressed by Lao-Tze), India, especially in the Hindu Bhagavad Gita, and among various Greek and Roman philosophers.\n\n6th century BC philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon has also been considered a pandeistic thinker. Weinstein wrote that Xenophanes spoke as a pandeist in stating that there was one god which \"abideth ever in the selfsame place, moving not at all\" and yet \"sees all over, thinks all over, and hears all over.\" He similarly found that ideas of pandeism were reflected in the ideas of Heraclitus, and of the Stoics. Weinstein also wrote that pandeism was especially expressed by the later students of the 'Platonic Pythagoreans' and the 'Pythagorean Platonists.' and among them specifically identified 3rd century BC philosopher Chrysippus, who affirmed that \"the universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul,\" as a pandeist as well.\n\nReligious studies professor, F. E. Peters, however, found that \"[w]hat appeared... at the center of the Pythagorean tradition in philosophy, is another view of \"psyche\" that seems to owe little or nothing to the pan-vitalism or \"pan-deism\" that is the legacy of the Milesians. Amongst the Milesians, English historian of philosophy Andrew Gregory notes in particular that \"some construction using pan-, whether it be pantheism, pandeism or pankubernism describes Anaximander reasonably well\", though he does go on to question whether Anaximander's view of the distinction between \"apeiron\" and \"cosmos\" makes these labels technically relevant at all. Gottfried Große in his 1787 interpretation of Pliny the Elder's Natural History, describes Pliny, a first-century figure, as \"if not a Spinozist, then perhaps a Pandeist.\"\n\nWeinstein examines the philosophy of 9th century theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena, who proposed that \"God has created the world out of his own being\", and identifies this as a form of pandeism, noting in particular that Eriugena's vision of God was one which does not know what it is, and learns this through the process of existing as its creation. In his great work, \"De divisione naturae\" (also called \"Periphyseon\", probably completed around 867 AD), Eriugena proposed that the nature of the universe is divisible into four distinct classes:\n\nThe first stage is God as the ground or origin of all things; the second is the world of Platonic ideals or forms; the third is the wholly physical manifestation of our Universe, which \"does not create\"; the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns to completeness with the additional knowledge of having experienced this world. A contemporary statement of this idea is that: \"Since God is not a being, he is therefore not intelligible... This means not only that we cannot understand him, but also that he cannot understand himself. Creation is a kind of divine effort by God to understand himself, to see himself in a mirror.\" French journalist agreed, writing that \"a certain pantheism, or rather \"pandeism\", emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy.\"\n\nWeinstein also found that thirteenth century Catholic thinker Bonaventure—who championed the Platonic doctrine that ideas do not exist in \"rerum natura\", but as ideals exemplified by the Divine Being, according to which actual things were formed—showed strong pandeistic inclinations. Of Nicholas of Cusa, who wrote of the enfolding of creation in God and the unfolding of the divine human mind in creation, Weinstein wrote that he was, to a certain extent, a pandeist. And, as to Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont, who had written \"A Cabbalistical Dialogue\" (Latin version first, 1677, in English 1682) placing matter and spirit on a continuum, and describing matter as a \"coalition\" of monads, Weinstein also found this to be a kind of pandeism. Weinstein found that pandeism was strongly expressed in the teachings of Giordano Bruno, who envisioned a deity which had no particular relation to one part of the infinite universe more than any other, and was immanent, as present on Earth as in the Heavens, subsuming in itself the multiplicity of existence. This was reiterated by others including \"Discover\" editor Corey S. Powell, who wrote that Bruno's cosmology was \"a tool for advancing an animist or Pandeist theology.\"\nIn the 1820s to 1830s, pandeism received some mention in Italy. In 1834, publisher Giovanni Silvestri posthumously published a volume of sermons of Italian Padre Filippo Nannetti di Bibulano (aka il Filippo Nani, Padre da Lojano; 1759–1829), who named pandeism as being among beliefs he condemned, railing against \"Jews, Muslims, Gentiles, Schismatics, Heretics, Pandeists, Deists, and troubled, restless spirits.\" Nannetti further specifically criticized pandeism, declaring, \"To you, fatal Pandeist! the laws that create nature are contingent and mutable, not another being in substance with forces driven by motions and developments.\" Within a few years thereafter came the 1838 publication of an anonymous treatise, \"Il legato di un vecchio ai giovani della sua patria\" (\"The Legacy of an Old Man to the Young People of his Country\"), whose author, discussing the theory of religion presented by Giambattista Vico a century earlier, mused that when man first saw meteor showers, \"his robust imagination recognized the effects as a cause, then deifying natural phenomena, he became a Pandeist, an instructor of Mythology, a priest, an Augur.\" Neither Nannetti nor the 1838 author defines pandeism distinctly enough to cleanly distinguish it from pantheism, or possibly polytheism. But, again in 1838, another Italian, phrenologist Luigi Ferrarese in \"Memorie Riguardanti la Dottrina Frenologica\" (\"Thoughts Regarding the Doctrine of Phrenology\") critically described Victor Cousin's philosophy as a doctrine which \"locates reason outside the human person, declaring man a fragment of God, introducing a sort of spiritual pandeism, absurd for us, and injurious to the Supreme Being.\"\n\nThe 1859 German work, \"Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft\" by philosophers and frequent collaborators Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal, distinguished pandeism unequivocally, declaring: \"Man stelle es also den Denkern frei, ob sie Theisten, Pan-theisten, Atheisten, Deisten (und warum nicht auch Pandeisten?)... (\"Man leaves it to the philosophers, whether they are Theists, Pan-theists, Atheists, Deists (and why not also Pandeists?)...\" Literary critic Hayden Carruth said of 18th century figure Alexander Pope that it was \"Pope's rationalism and pandeism with which he wrote the greatest mock-epic in English literature\" According to \"American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia\", \"later Unitarian Christians (such as William Ellery Channing), transcendentalists (such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau), writers (such as Walt Whitman) and some pragmatists (such as William James) took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world\". The Belgian poet Robert Vivier wrote of the pandeism to be found in the works of Nineteenth Century novelist and poet Victor Hugo. Similarly in the Nineteenth Century, poet Alfred Tennyson revealed that his \"religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism\". Charles Darwin has been described as having views that were \"a good match for deism, or possibly for pandeism.\" Friedrich Engels has also been described by historian Tristram Hunt as having pandeistic views.\n\nWeinstein asserted the presence of pandeism in China, including in Lao-Tze's Taoism, and in India, especially in the Hindu Bhagavad Gita. Other philosophers have also pointed to pandeism as having a presence in the cultures of Asia. In 1833, religionist Godfrey Higgins theorized in his \"Anacalypsis\" that \"Pandeism was a doctrine, which had been received both by Buddhists and Brahmins.\" In 1896, historian Gustavo Uzielli described the world's population as influenced \"by a superhuman idealism in Christianity, by an anti-human nihilism in Buddhism, and by an incipient but growing pandeism in Indian Brahmanism.\" But the following year, the Reverend Henry Grattan Guinness wrote critically that in India, \"God is everything, and everything is God, and, therefore, everything may be adored. ... Her pan-deism is a pandemonium.\" Likewise, twenty years earlier, in 1877, Peruvian scholar and historian Carlos Wiesse Portocarrero had written in an essay titled \"Philosophical Systems of India\" that in that country, \"Metaphysics is pandeistic and degenerates into idealism.\" German political philosopher Jürgen Hartmann observes that Hindu pandeism has contributed to friction with monotheistic Islam.\n\nPandeism (in Chinese, 泛自然神论) was described by Wen Chi, in a Peking University lecture, as embodying \"a major feature of Chinese philosophical thought\", in that \"there is a harmony between man and the divine, and they are equal.\" Zhang Dao Kui (张道葵) of the China Three Gorges University proposed that the art of China's Three Gorges area is influenced by \"a representation of the romantic essence that is created when integrating rugged simplicity with the natural beauty spoken about by pandeism.\" Literary critic Wang Junkang (王俊康) has written that, in Chinese folk religion as conveyed in the early novels of noted folk writer Ye Mei (叶梅), \"the romantic spirit of Pandeism can be seen everywhere.\" Wang Junkang additionally writes of Ye Mei's descriptions of \"the worship of reproduction under Pandeism, as demonstrated in romantic songs sung by village people to show the strong impulse of vitality and humanity and the beauty of wildness.\" It has been noted that author Shen Congwen has attributed a kind of hysteria that \"afflicts those young girls who commit suicide by jumping into caves-\"luodong\" 落洞\" to \"the repressive local military culture that imposes strict sexual codes on women and to the influence of pan-deism among Miao people\", since \"for a nymphomaniac, jumping into a cave leads to the ultimate union with the god of the cave\". Weinstein similarly found the views of 17th century Japanese Neo-Confucian philosopher Yamazaki Ansai, who espoused a cosmology of universal mutual interconnectedness, to be especially consonant with pandeism.\n\nIn \"\", Moncure Daniel Conway stated that the term, \"Pandeism\" is \"an unscholarly combination\". Ottmar Hegemann described the \"New Catholicism\" of Franz Mach as actually a form of pandeism, in 1905, a few years before Weinstein's own extensive review was published, in 1910. A critique of Pandeism similar to Conway's, as an 'unsightly' combination of Greek and Latin, was made in a review of Weinstein's discussion of Pandeism. The reviewer further criticises Weinstein's broad assertions that Scotus Eriugena, Anselm of Canterbury, Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, Mendelssohn, and Lessing all were Pandeists or leaned towards Pandeism. Towards the beginning of World War I, an article in the \"Yale Sheffield Monthly\" published by the Yale University Sheffield Scientific School commented on speculation that the war \"means the death of Christianity and an era of Pandeism or perhaps even the destruction of all which we call modern civilization and culture.\" The following year, early 19th-century German philosopher Paul Friedrich Köhler wrote that Pantheism, Pandeism, Monism and Dualism all refer to the same God illuminated in different ways, and that whatever the label, the human soul emanates from this God.\nPandeism was noted by literary critic Martin Lüdke as a philosophy expressed by early Twentieth-Century Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, especially as to those writings made under the pseudonym of Alberto Caeiro. Pandeism was likewise noted by authors like Brazilian journalist and writer Otávio de Faria, and British scholar and translator of Portuguese fiction Giovanni Pontiero, among others, to be an influence on the writings of noted mid-Twentieth-Century Brazilian poet Carlos Nejar, of whom de Faria wrote that \"the pandeism of Nejar is one of the strongest poetic ideas that we have reached in the world of poetry.\"\n\nPandeism was also examined by theologian Charles Hartshorne, one of the chief disciples of process philosopher Alfred North Whitehead. In his process theology, an extension of Whitehead's work, Hartshorne preferred pandeism to pantheism, explaining that \"it is not really the theos that is described\". However, he specifically rejected pandeism early on, finding that a God who had \"absolute perfection in some respects, relative perfection in all others\" was \"able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism.\" Hartshorne accepted the label of panentheism for his beliefs, declaring that \"panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations\".\n\nSeveral theologians examined the relationship between the Catholic Church and pandeism. Charles Anselm Bolton states in a 1963 article, \"Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism?\" that he \"first came upon this extension of ecumenism into pan-deism among some Roman Catholic scholars interested primarily in the 'reunion of the churches,' Roman, Orthodox, Anglican\", and wondered, \"what is the ultimate aim of the Curia in promoting the pan-deist movement.\" Bolton noted that \"to unite with Hindus and Buddhists, Christians should explore the hidden reality—the “ultimate reality,” the infinite, the absolute, the everlasting, the all-pervading spirit that marks the religious experience of the Orient.\" The impact of this line of thought on Christianity was examined by Rousas John Rushdoony, who wrote in his 1971 \"The One and the Many: Studies in the Philosophy of Order and Ultimacy\" that “The position of Pope Paul came close to being a pan-Deism, and pan-Deism is the logical development of the virus of Hellenic thought,” and further that “a sincere idealist, implicitly pan-Deist in faith, deeply concerned with the problems of the world and of time, can be a Ghibelline pope, and Dante's Ghibellines have at last triumphed.\" Theologian Bert B. Beach wrote in 1974 that \"during the Vatican Council there was criticism from WCC Circles\" to the effect that \"ecumenism was being contaminated by “pan-Deist” and syncretistic tendencies.\"\n\nRobert A. Heinlein especially enjoyed this idea, and raised it in several of his works. Literary critic Dan Schneider wrote of Heinlein's \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" that Jubal Harshaw's belief in his own free will, was one \"which Mike, Jill, and the Fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge, 'Thou art God! Heinlein himself, in his \"Aphorisms of Lazarus Long\", in his 1973 book \"Time Enough for Love\" wrote, \"God split himself into a myriad parts that he might have friends. This may not be true, but it sounds good—and is no sillier than any other theology.\"\n\nA 1995 news article quoted this use of the term by Jim Garvin, a Vietnam veteran who became a Trappist monk in the Holy Cross Abbey of Berryville, Virginia. Garvin described his spiritual position as \"'pandeism' or 'pan-en-deism,' something very close to the Native American concept of the all- pervading Great Spirit...\" The following year, Pastor Bob Burridge of the Geneven Institute for Reformed Studies wrote that: \"If God was the proximate cause of every act it would make all events to be \"God in motion\". That is nothing less than pantheism, or more exactly, pandeism.\" Burridge rejects this model, observing that in Christianity, \"The Creator is distinct from his creation. The reality of secondary causes is what separates Christian theism from pandeism.\" Burridge concludes by challenging that \"calling God the author of sin demand[s] a pandeistic understanding of the universe effectively removing the reality of sin and moral law.\"\n\nMore recently, pandeism has been classed as a logical derivation of German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's proposition that ours was the best of all possible worlds. In 2010, author William C. Lane contended that:\nAcknowledging that American philosopher William Rowe has raised \"a powerful, evidential argument against ethical theism\", Lane further contended that pandeism offers an escape from the evidential argument from evil:\n\nCartoonist and pundit Scott Adams has written two books on religion, \"God's Debris\" (2001), and \"The Religion War\" (2004), of which \"God's Debris\" lays out a theory of pandeism, in which God blows itself up to see what will happen, which becomes the cause of our universe. In \"God's Debris\", Adams suggests that followers of theistic religions such as Christianity and Islam are inherently subconsciously aware that their religions are false, and that this awareness is reflected in their consistently acting like these religions, and their threats of damnation for sinners, are false. In a 2017 interview Adams said these books would be \"his ultimate legacy.\"\n\nIn 2010 German astrophysicist and popular scientist Harald Lesch observed in a debate on the role of faith in science:\nIn 2011, social scientist Niall Douglas wrote that in pandeism, \"God \"is\" growth, God \"is\" structure/knowledge, God \"is\" everything and nothing simultaneously. And, rather heretically for the Abrahamic religions, to perceive i.e. to cognate i.e. to be of matter i.e. to be structured energy generating a gravimetric field is an aspect of God relating to another aspect of God through light, which is of course God. In this, the underlying metaphysics are most definitely Pandeist.\" Alan Dawe's 2011 book \"The God Franchise\", though mentioning pandeism in passing as one of numerous extant theological theories, declines to adopt any \"-ism\" as encompassing his view, though Dawe's theory includes the human experience as being a temporarily segregated sliver of the experience of God. This aspect of the theology of pandeism (along with pantheism and panentheism) has been compared to the Biblical exhortation in Acts that \"In him we live and move and have our being,\" while the \"Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia\" had in 1975 described the religion of Babylon as \"clearly a type of pan-deism formed from a synthesis of Christianity and paganism\". Another Christian theologian, Graham Ward, insists that \"Attention to Christ and the Spirit delivers us from pantheism, pandeism, and process theology,\" and Catholic author Al Kresta observes that:\n\nAlso in 2011, in a study of Germany's Hesse region, German sociologist of religion and theologian and German television presenter and author concluded that \"Six religious orientation types can be distinguished: \"Christians\" – \"non-Christian theists\" – \"Cosmotheists\" – \"Deists, Pandeists and Polytheists\" – \"Atheists\" – \"Others\".\" Pandeism has also been described as one of the \"older spiritual and religious traditions\" whose elements are incorporated into the New Age movement, but also as among the handful of spiritual beliefs which \"are compatible with modern science.\" In 2013, Australian religious studies scholar Raphael Lataster proposed that \"Pandeism could be the most likely God-concept of all.\"\n\nIn January 2016, a Kickstarter fundraising effort successfully funded a book titled \"Pandeism: An Anthology\", set to contain articles from over a dozen different writers examining pandeism from many different points of view, thus being the broadest examination of the theory yet made. The book includes writings by Bernardo Kastrup, Raphael Lataster, Anthony Peake, Michael Arnheim, Zoltan Istvan, Robert G. Brown, and William Walker Atkinson (father of the philosophy of the Law of Attraction).\n\n\n\n"}

Such a question is distinct from a question of fact, which must be answered by reference to facts and evidence as well as inferences arising from those facts. Answers to questions of law are generally expressed in terms of broad legal principles and can be applied to many situations rather than be dependent on particular circumstances or factual situations. An answer to a question of law as applied to the particular facts of a case is often referred to as a \"conclusion of law.\"\n\nIn several civil law jurisdictions, the highest courts consider questions of fact settled by the lower court and will only consider questions of law. They thus may refer a case back to a lower court to re-apply the law and answer any fact-based evaluations based on their answer on the application of the law. International courts such as the Benelux Court of Justice and the European Court of Justice will only answer questions of law, asked by judges of national courts if they are not certain about the interpretation of the law of multilateral organizations.\n\nWhile questions of fact are resolved by a \"trier of fact\", which in the common law system is often a jury, questions of law are always resolved by a judge or equivalent. Whereas findings of fact in a common law legal system are rarely overturned by an appellate court, conclusions of law are more readily reconsidered.\n\nIn law, a question of fact, also known as a point of fact, is a question that must be answered by reference to facts and evidence as well as inferences arising from those facts. Such a question is distinct from a question of law, which must be answered by applying relevant legal principles. The answer to a question of fact (a \"finding of fact\") usually depends on particular circumstances or factual situations.\n\nAll questions of fact are capable of proof or disproof by reference to a certain standard of proof. Depending on the nature of the matter, the standard of proof may require that a fact be proven to be \"more likely than not\" (there is barely more evidence for the fact than against, as established by a preponderance of the evidence) or true beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nAnswers to questions of fact are determined by a \"trier of fact\" such as a jury, or a judge. In many jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, appellate courts generally do not consider appeals based on errors of fact (errors in answering a question of fact). Rather, the findings of fact of the first venue are usually given great deference by appellate courts.\n\nThe distinction between \"law\" and \"fact\" has proved obscure wherever it is employed. For instance, the common law used to require that a plaintiff's complaint in a civil action only state the \"facts\" of his case, not any \"legal conclusions.\" Unfortunately, no one has ever been able to tell whether the allegation that \"on November 9, the defendant negligently ran over the plaintiff with his car at the intersection of State Street and Chestnut Street\" is a statement of fact or a legal conclusion. In fact, the distinction between law and fact is just the legal version of the philosophical distinction between \"empirical\" and \"analytical\" statements, a distinction on whose existence philosophers have been unable to agree to this day... we will see that many defendants charged with impossible attempts are not in fact attempting the crime they are charged with attempting. They merely think they are committing a crime... It would be merely foolish to assert that it is of no interest whatever to know that \"The Disciples\" is a forgery. But to the man who has never heard of either Vermeer or van Meegeren and who stands in front of \"The Disciples\" admiring it, it can make no difference whether he is told that it is a seventeenth-century Vermeer or a twentieth-century van Meegeren in the style of Vermeer. And when some deny this and argue vehemently that, indeed, it does make a great deal of difference, they are only admitting that \"they\" do know something about Vermeer and van Meegeren and the history of art and the value and reputation of certain masters. They are only admitting that they do not judge a work of art on purely aesthetic grounds, but also take into account when it was created, by whom, and how great a reputation it or its creator has.\n\n"}

Historically, it was felt that Royal Navy officers, like their British Army counterparts, should wear the full appropriate uniform for all formal events, whatever the temperature. The sole exception was in the Red Sea, where the heat and humidity often made this physically impossible. Here, officers were permitted to remove their jackets in the wardroom, provided they added a cummerbund to temper the somewhat informal look. Royal Air Force officers serving on Navy ships follow the naval tradition wearing a Red Sea rig version of their own mess dress.\n\nIn his reminiscences \"For King and Country\", Nelson Albert Tomalin describes a rather home-made version of Red Sea rig worn on board the whaler Southern Sea in 1943 as \"...white shirt with epaulettes and long blue trousers with a black scarf as a cummerbund...\".\n\nBecause of its obvious practicality, Red Sea rig was adopted into civilian life, first by British diplomats in the Red Sea town of Jeddah, and later by the local British Business Group.

{"id": "3796695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3796695", "title": "Sea of Faith", "text": "Sea of Faith\n\nThe Sea of Faith Network (SoF) is an organisation with the stated aim to explore and promote religious faith as a human creation.\n\nThe SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to Don Cupitt's book and television series, both titled \"Sea of Faith\". Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, Anglican priest, and former Dean of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the view that religion is simply a human creation.\n\nThe name Sea of Faith is taken from Matthew Arnold's nostalgic mid 19th century poem \"Dover Beach\", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the \"sea of faith\" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.\n\nFollowing the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988. A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since.\n\nThe Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.\n\nThe group's magazine \"Sofia\" is published bi-monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group.\n\nCurrently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members.\n\nSoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to \"explore and promote religious faith as a human creation\". In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other. Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see liberal Christianity) while others choose to call themselves religious or Christian humanists (see humanism). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see Christian atheism).\n\nSoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all.\n\nA number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non-realist approach to religion. This refers to the belief that God has no \"real\", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is \"real\" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion. Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits.\n\nCupitt wrote, \"God is the sum of our values, representing to us their ideal unity, their claims upon us and their creative power\". Cupitt calls this \"a voluntarist interpretation of faith: a fully demythologized version of Christianity\". It entails the claim that even after we have given up the idea that religious beliefs can be grounded in anything beyond the human realm, religion can still be believed and practised in new ways.\n\nSince he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change. In his early books such as \"Taking Leave of God\" and \"The Sea of Faith\" Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real, but by the end of the 1980s he moved into postmodernism, describing his position as empty radical humanism: that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated. Everything is non-real, including God.\n\nWhile Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club. Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.\n\n\n"}

Born in Trinidad, he grew up in the United States from the age of 11 and became an activist while attending Howard University. He eventually developed the Black Power movement, first while leading the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), later serving as the \"Honorary Prime Minister\" of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and lastly as a leader of the All-African People's Revolutionary Party (A-APRP).\n\nCarmichael was one of the original SNCC freedom riders of 1961 under Diane Nash's leadership. He became a major voting rights activist in Mississippi and Alabama after being mentored by Ella Baker and Robert Parris Moses. Like most young people in SNCC, he became disillusioned with the two-party system after the 1964 Democratic National Convention failed to recognize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party as official delegates from the state. Carmichael chose to develop independent black political organizations, such as the Lowndes County Freedom Organization and, for a time, the national Black Panther Party. Inspired by Malcolm X's example, he articulated a philosophy of \"black power,\" and popularized it both by provocative speeches and more sober writings. Carmichael became one of the most popular and controversial Black leaders of the late 1960s. J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, secretly identified Carmichael as the man most likely to succeed Malcolm X as America's \"black messiah.\" The FBI targeted him for personal destruction through its COINTELPRO program, and Carmichael fled to Africa in 1968. He re-established himself in Ghana, and then Guinea by 1969, where he adopted the new name of Kwame Ture.\n\nBorn in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Stokely Carmichael attended Tranquility School there before moving to Harlem, New York, in 1952 at the age of 11, to rejoin his parents. They had immigrated to the United States when he was age two, and he was raised by his grandmother and two aunts. He had three sisters.\n\nHis mother, Mabel R. Carmichael, was a stewardess for a steamship line. His father, Adolphus, was a carpenter who also worked as a taxi driver. The reunited Carmichael family eventually left Harlem to live in Van Nest in the East Bronx, at that time an aging neighborhood with residents who were primarily Jewish and Italian immigrants and descendants. According to a 1967 interview Carmichael gave to \"Life Magazine\", he was the only black member of the Morris Park Dukes, a youth gang involved in alcohol and petty theft. He and his family were members of the Westchester United Methodist Church. \n\nCarmichael attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York, being selected through high achievement on its standardized entrance examination. While at Bronx Science, he participated in a boycott of a local White Castle restaurant, which did not hire blacks. On student recognition Sunday at his church, Carmichael gave an eye-opening student sermon to the almost totally white congregation. Carmichael was acquainted with fellow Bronx Science student Samuel R. Delany during his time there.\n\nAfter graduation in 1960, Carmichael enrolled at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C.. His professors included Sterling Brown, Nathan Hare, and Toni Morrison, a young writer who later won the Nobel Prize for literature. Carmichael and Tom Kahn, a Jewish-American student and civil-rights activist, helped to fund a five-day run of the \"Three Penny Opera\", by Berthold Brecht and Kurt Weill:\n\nTom Kahn—very shrewdly—had captured the position of Treasurer of the Liberal Arts Student Council and the infinitely charismatic and popular Carmichael as floor whip was good at lining up the votes. Before they knew what hit them the Student Council had become a patron of the arts, having voted to buy out the remaining performances. It was a classic win/win. Members of the Council got patronage packets of tickets for distribution to friends and constituents.\n\nCarmichael's apartment on Euclid Street was a gathering place for his activist classmates. He graduated in 1964 with a degree in philosophy. Carmichael was offered a full graduate scholarship to Harvard University but turned it down.\n\nWhile at Howard, Carmichael had joined the Nonviolent Action Group (NAG), the Howard campus affiliate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Kahn introduced Carmichael and the other SNCC activists to Bayard Rustin, an African-American leader who became an influential adviser to SNCC. Inspired by the sit-in movement in the southern United States during college, Carmichael became more active in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn his first year at the university, in 1961, Carmichael participated in the Freedom Rides that the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) organized to desegregate the interstate buses and bus station restaurants along U.S. Route 40 between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., as they came under federal rather than state law. They had been segregated by custom. He was frequently arrested, and spent time in jail. He was arrested so many times for his activism that he lost count, sometimes estimating at least 29 or 32. In 1998, he told the \"Washington Post\" that he thought the total was fewer than 36.\n\nAlong with eight other riders, on June 4, 1961, Carmichael traveled by train from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Jackson, Mississippi, to integrate the formerly \"white\" section on the train. Before getting on the train in New Orleans, they encountered white protestors blocking the way. Carmichael says: \"They were shouting. Throwing cans and lit cigarettes at us. Spitting on us.\" Eventually, the group was able to board the train. When the group arrived in Jackson, Carmichael and the eight other riders entered a \"white\" cafeteria. They were charged with disturbing the peace, arrested, and taken to jail.\n\nEventually, Carmichael was transferred to the infamous Parchman Farm in Sunflower County, Mississippi, along with other Freedom Riders. He gained notoriety for being a witty and hard-nosed leader among the prisoners.\n\nHe served 49 days with other activists at the Parchman State Prison Farm. At 19, Carmichael was the youngest detainee in the summer of 1961. He spent 53 days at Parchman Farm in a six-by-nine cell. He and his colleagues were only allowed to shower twice a week, were not allowed books or any other personal effects, and were at times placed in maximum security to isolate them from one another.\n\nCarmichael said about the Parchman Farm sheriff:\n\nThe sheriff acted like he was scared of black folks and he came up with some beautiful things. One night he opened up all the windows, put on ten big fans and an air conditioner and dropped the temperature to 38 degrees [Fahrenheit; 3 °C]. All we had on was T-shirts and shorts.\n\nWhile being hurt one time, Carmichael began singing to the guards, \"I'm gonna tell God how you treat me,\" to which the rest of the prisoners joined in.\n\nCarmichael kept the group's morale up while in prison, often telling jokes with Steve Green and the other Freedom Riders, and making light of their situation. He knew their situation was serious.\n\nWhat with the range of ideology, religious belief, political commitment and background, age, and experience, something interesting was always going on. Because no matter our differences, this group had one thing in common, moral stubbornness. Whatever we believed, we really believed and were not at all shy about advancing. We were where we were only because of our willingness to affirm our beliefs even at the risk of physical injury. So it was never dull on death row.\n\nIn a 1964 interview with author Robert Penn Warren, Carmichael reflected on his motives for going on the rides, saying,\n\nI thought I have to go because you've got to keep the issue alive, and you've got to show the Southerners that you're not gonna be scared off, as we've been scared off in the past. And no matter what they do, we're still gonna keep coming back.\n\nIn 1964, Carmichael became a full-time field organizer for SNCC in Mississippi. He worked on the Greenwood voting rights project under Robert Parris Moses. Throughout Freedom Summer, he worked with grassroots African-American activists, including Fannie Lou Hamer, whom Carmichael named as one of his personal heroes. SNCC organizer Joann Gavin wrote that Hamer and Carmichael \"understood one another as perhaps no one else could.\"\n\nHe also worked closely with Gloria Richardson, who led the SNCC chapter in Cambridge, Maryland. During a protest with Richardson in Maryland in June 1964, Carmichael was hit directly in a chemical gas attack by the National Guard and had to be hospitalized.\n\nHe soon became project director for Mississippi's 2nd congressional district, made up largely of the counties of the Mississippi Delta. At that time, most blacks in Mississippi had been disenfranchised since passage of a new constitution in 1890. The summer project was to prepare them to register to vote and to conduct a parallel registration movement to demonstrate how much people wanted to vote. Grassroots activists organized the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), as the regular Democratic Party did not represent African Americans in the state. At the end of Freedom Summer, Carmichael went to the 1964 Democratic Convention in support of the MFDP, which sought to have its delegation seated. But, the MFDP delegates were refused voting rights by the Democratic National Committee, who chose to seat the regular white Jim Crow delegation. Carmichael, along with many SNCC staff members, left the convention with a profound sense of disillusionment in the American political system, and what he later called \"totalitarian liberal opinion.\"\n\nHaving developed aversion to working with the Democratic Party after the 1964 convention experience, Carmichael decided to leave the MFDP. Instead he began exploring SNCC projects in Alabama in 1965. During the period of the Selma to Montgomery Marches, he was recruited by James Forman to participate in a \"second front\" to stage protests at the Alabama State Capitol in March 1965. Carmichael became disillusioned with the growing struggles between SNCC and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), who opposed Forman's strategy. He thought SCLC was working with affiliated black churches to undercut it. He was also frustrated to be drawn again into nonviolent confrontations with police, which he no longer found empowering. After seeing protesters brutally beaten again, he collapsed from stress, and his colleagues urged him to leave the city.\n\nWithin a week, Carmichael returned to protesting, this time in Selma, to participate in the final march along Route 80 to the state capital. He initiated a grassroots project in \"Bloody Lowndes\" County, along the march route. This was a county known for white violence against blacks during this era, where SCLC and Dr. King had tried and failed to organize its black residents. In the period from 1877 to 1950, Lowndes County had 14 documented lynchings of African Americans.\n\nIn 1965, working as a SNCC activist in the black-majority Lowndes County, Carmichael helped to increase the number of registered black voters from 70 to 2,600—300 more than the number of registered white voters. Black voters had essentially been disfranchised by Alabama's constitution passed by white Democrats in 1901. After Congressional passage in August of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal government was authorized to oversee and enforce their rights. But there was still tremendous resistance by whites in the area, which endangered activists. Black residents and voters organized and widely supported the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), a party that had the black panther as its mascot, over the white-dominated local Democratic Party, whose mascot was a white rooster. Since federal protection from violent voter suppression by the Ku Klux Klan and other white opponents was sporadic, most Lowndes County activists openly carried arms.\n\nAlthough black residents and voters outnumbered whites in Lowndes, their candidate lost the county-wide election of 1965. In 1966, several LCFO candidates ran for office in the general election but failed to win. In 1970, the LCFO merged with the statewide Democratic Party, and former LCFO candidates won their first offices in the county.\n\nCarmichael became chairman of SNCC in 1966, taking over from John Lewis, an activist who later was elected to the US Congress, and has served since then. James Meredith had initiated a solitary March Against Fear in early June of that year from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. He did not want the big civil rights organizations or leaders involved, but was willing to have individual black men join him. On his second day out, Meredith was shot and wounded by a white sniper, and had to be hospitalized. Civil rights leaders vowed to finish the march in his name.\n\nCarmichael joined Martin Luther King Jr., Floyd McKissick, Cleveland Sellers and others to continue Meredith's march. He was arrested in Greenwood during the march. After his release, he gave his first \"Black Power\" speech at a rally that night, using the phrase to urge black pride and socio-economic independence:\n\nAccording to historian David J. Garrow, a few days after Carmichael spoke about \"Black Power\" slogan at the rally during \"Meredith March Against Fear,\" he reportedly told King: \"Martin, I deliberately decided to raise this issue on the march in order to give it a national forum and force you to take a stand for Black Power.\" King responded, \"I have been used before. One more time won't hurt.\"\n\nWhile Black Power was not a new concept, Carmichael's speech brought it into the spotlight. It became a rallying cry for young African Americans across the country who were frustrated about slow progress in civil rights, even after federal legislation had been passed to strengthen the effort. Everywhere that Black Power spread, if accepted, credit was given to the prominent Carmichael. If the concept was condemned, he was held responsible and blamed. According to Carmichael: \"Black Power meant black people coming together to form a political force and either electing representatives or forcing their representatives to speak to their needs [rather than relying on established parties]\". Strongly influenced by the work of Frantz Fanon and his landmark book \"The Wretched of the Earth\", along with others such as Malcolm X, Carmichael led SNCC to become more radical. The group focused on Black Power as its core goal and ideology.\n\nDuring the controversial Atlanta Project in 1966, SNCC, under the local leadership of Bill Ware, engaged in a voter drive to promote the candidacy of Julian Bond from an Atlanta district for a seat in the Georgia State Legislature. Ware excluded Northern white SNCC members from working on this drive. Initially, Carmichael opposed him and voted against this decision, but eventually changed his mind. At the urging of the Atlanta Project, the issue of whites being members in SNCC came up for a vote. Carmichael ultimately sided with those calling for the expulsion of whites. He said that whites should organize poor white southern communities, of which there were plenty, while SNCC focused on promoting African-American self-reliance through Black Power.\n\nCarmichael considered nonviolence to be a tactic, as opposed to an underlying principle, which separated him from civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Carmichael criticized civil rights leaders who called for the integration of African Americans into existing institutions of the middle-class mainstream.\n\nNow, several people have been upset because we've said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of white supremacy. Now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a \"thalidomide drug of integration,\" and that some Negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to Mississippi we did not go to sit next to Ross Barnett; we did not go to sit next to Jim Clark; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against white supremacy. Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom. No man can give anybody his freedom. A man is born free. You may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is in fact what this country does. It enslaves black people after they're born, so that the only acts that white people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop \"denying\" freedom. They never give it to anyone.\n\nDuring Carmichael's leadership, SNCC continued to maintain a coalition with several white radical organizations, most notably Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). It encouraged the SDS to focus on militant anti-draft resistance. At an SDS-organized conference at UC Berkeley in October 1966, Carmichael challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement. For a time in 1967, Carmichael considered an alliance with Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation, and generally supported IAF's work in Rochester's and Buffalo's black communities.\n\nSNCC conducted its first actions against the military draft and the Vietnam War under Carmichael's leadership. Carmichael popularized the oft-repeated anti-draft slogan, \"Hell no-We won't go!\" during this time.\n\nCarmichael encouraged Martin Luther King Jr. to demand an unconditional withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam, even as some King advisers cautioned him that such opposition might have an adverse effect on financial contributions to the SCLC. King preached one of his earliest speeches calling for unconditional withdrawal with Carmichael seated in the front row at his invitation. Carmichael privately took credit for pushing King towards anti-imperialism, and historians such as Dr. Peniel Joseph and Eric Dyson agree.\n\nCarmichael joined King in New York on April 15, 1967, to share his views with protesters on race related to the Vietnam War:\n\nIn May 1967, Carmichael stepped down as chairman of SNCC and was replaced by H. Rap Brown. SNCC was a collective and worked by group consensus rather than hierarchically; many members had become displeased with Carmichael's celebrity status. SNCC leaders had begun to refer to him as \"Stokely Starmichael\" and criticize his habit of making policy announcements independently, before achieving internal agreement. According to historian Clayborne Carson, Carmichael did not protest the transfer of power and was \"eager to relinquish the chair.\" It is sometimes mistakenly reported that Carmichael left SNCC completely at this time and joined the Black Panther Party, but those events did not occur until 1968. SNCC officially ended its relationship with Carmichael in August 1968; in a statement, Philip Hutchings wrote, \"It has been apparent for some time that SNCC and Stokely Carmichael were moving in different directions.\"\n\nDuring this period, Carmichael was targeted by a section of J. Edgar Hoover's COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence program) which focused on black activists; the program promoted slander and violence against targets whom Hoover considered to be enemies of the US government. It attempted to discredit them and worse. Carmichael accepted the position of Honorary Prime Minister in the Black Panther Party, but also remained on the staff of SNCC. He tried to forge a merger between the two organizations. A March 4, 1968 memo from Hoover states his fear of the rise of a black nationalist \"messiah\" and said that Carmichael alone had the \"necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way.\" In July 1968, Hoover stepped up his efforts to divide the black power movement. Declassifed documents show he launched a plan to undermine the SNCC-Panther merger, as well as to \"bad-jacket\" Carmichael as a CIA agent. Both efforts were largely successful: Carmichael was expelled from SNCC that year, and the rival Panthers began to denounce him, putting him at grave personal risk.\n\nAfter stepping down as SNCC chair, Carmichael wrote the book \"\" (1967) with Charles V. Hamilton, while clarifying his thinking. It is a first-person reflection on his experiences in SNCC and his dissatisfaction with the direction of the Civil Rights Movement in the late 1960s. Throughout the work he directly and indirectly criticizes the established leadership of the SCLC and NAACP for their tactics and results, often claiming that they were accepting symbols instead of change.\n\nHe promoted what he calls \"political modernization.\" This idea included three major concepts: \"1) questioning old values and institutions of the society; 2) searching for new and different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems; and, 3) broadening the base of political participation to include more people in the decision-making process\". By questioning \"old values and institutions\", Carmichael was referring not only to the established Black leadership of the time, but also to the values and institutions of the nation as a whole. He criticized the emphasis on the American \"middle-class.\" \"The values,\" he said, \"of that class are based on material aggrandizement, not the expansion of humanity.\" (40) Carmichael believed that blacks were being lured to enter the \"middle-class\" as a trap, in which they would be assimilated into the white world by turning their backs on others of their race who were still suffering. This assimilation, he thought, was an inherent indictment of blackness and validation of whiteness as the preferred state. He said, \"Thus we reject the goal of assimilation into middle-class America because the values of that class are in themselves anti-humanist and because that class as a social force perpetuates racism.\"\n\nSecondly, Carmichael discussed searching for different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems. At the time, the established forms of political structure were the SCLC and the NAACP. These groups were religiously and academically based and focused their attention on the concepts of non-violence and steady legal and legislative change, situated within the established systems and structures of the United States. Carmichael rejected these ideas, basing his assertions on his lived experience. He explores the development of the Mississippi Freedom Democrats, the 1966 local election in Lowndes County, AL, and the political history of the town of Tuskegee. He chose these examples as places where blacks changed the system by way of political and legal maneuvering within the system. But Carmichael said that they ultimately failed to achieve more than the bare minimum change. In the process, he believed they reinforced the political and legal structures that were perpetuating the racism they were fighting.\n\nIn response to these failures and to offer a way forward, Carmichael discussed the concept of coalition with regard to the Civil Rights Movement. The leadership of the movement had affirmed that anyone who truly believed in their cause was welcome to join and march. Carmichael offered a different vision. Influenced by the ideas of Franz Fanon in \"Wretched of the Earth\", wherein two groups were not \"complementary\" (could have no overlap) until they were mutually exclusive (were on an equal power footing economically, socially, politically, etc.), Carmichael said that blacks in the United States had to unite and build their power independent of the white structure. Otherwise they would never be able to build a coalition that would function for both parties, not just the dominant one. He said that \"we want to establish the grounds on which we feel political coalitions can be viable.\" For this to happen, Carmichael argued that blacks had to address three myths regarding coalition. First, \"that the interests of black people are identical with the interests of certain liberal, labor, or other reform groups.\" Second, that a viable coalition can be created between \"the politically and economically secure and the politically and economically insecure.\" And third, that a coalition can be \"sustained on a moral, friendly, sentimental basis; by appeals to conscience.\" He believed that each of these myths showed the need for two groups to be mutually exclusive, and on relatively equal footing, for them to be in a viable coalition.\n\nThis philosophy, grounded in the independence literature of Africa and Latin America (Fanon), became the basis for a great deal of Carmichael's work. He believed that the Black Power Movement had to be developed outside the white power structure.\n\nHe also continued as a strong critic of the Vietnam War, and imperialism in general. During this period he traveled and lectured extensively throughout the world; visiting Guinea, North Vietnam, China, and Cuba. Carmichael became more clearly identified with the Black Panther Party as its \"Honorary Prime Minister.\" During this period, he acted more as a speaker than an organizer, traveling throughout the country and internationally advocating for his vision of Black Power.\n\nCarmichael lamented the 1967 execution of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, saying:\n\nCarmichael visited the United Kingdom in July 1967 to attend the Dialectics of Liberation conference. After recordings of his speeches were released by the organizers, the Institute of Phenomenological Studies, he was banned from re-entering Britain. In August 1967, a Cuban government magazine reported that Carmichael met with Fidel Castro for three days and called it \"the most educational, most interesting, and the best apprenticeship of [my] public life.\" Because relations with Cuba were prohibited at the time, after his return to the US, the government withdrew his passport. In December 1967, he traveled to France to attend an antiwar rally. There, he was detained by police and ordered to leave the next day, but government officials eventually intervened and allowed him to stay.\n\nCarmichael was present in Washington, D.C. the night after King's assassination in April 1968. He led a group through the streets, demanding that businesses close out of respect. Although he tried to prevent violence, the situation escalated beyond his control. Due to his reputation as a provocateur, the news media blamed Carmichael for the ensuing violence as mobs rioted along U Street and other areas of black commercial development.\n\nCarmichael held a press conference the next day, at which he predicted mass racial violence in the streets. Since moving to Washington, D.C., Carmichael had been under nearly constant surveillance by the FBI. After the eruption of riots, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover instructed a team of agents to find evidence connecting Carmichael to these events. He was also subjected to COINTELPRO's bad-jacketing technique. Huey P. Newton suggested Carmichael was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent, a slander that led to Carmichael's break with the Panthers, and his exile from the U.S. the following year.\n\nCarmichael soon began to distance himself from the Panthers. He disagreed with them about whether white activists should be allowed to participate in the movement. The Panthers believed that white activists could help the movement, while Carmichael had come to agree with Malcolm X, and said that the white activists should organize their own communities first.\n\nIn 1968, he married Miriam Makeba, a noted singer from South Africa. They left the US for Guinea the next year. Carmichael became an aide to the Guinean president Ahmed Sékou Touré, and a student of the exiled Ghanaian president-for-life Kwame Nkrumah. Makeba was appointed Guinea's official delegate to the United Nations. Three months after his arrival in Guinea, in July 1969, Carmichael published a formal rejection of the Black Panthers, condemning them for not being separatist enough and for their \"dogmatic party line favoring alliances with white radicals\".\n\nCarmichael changed his name to \"Kwame Ture\", to honor the African leaders Nkrumah and Touré, who had become his patrons. At the end of his life, friends still referred to him interchangeably by both names, \"and he doesn't seem to mind\".\n\nCarmichael's suspicions about the CIA were affirmed in 2007, when previously secret CIA documents were declassified, revealing that the agency had tracked Carmichael from 1968 as part of their surveillance of black activists abroad. The surveillance continued for years.\n\nCarmichael remained in Guinea after separation from the Black Panther Party. He continued to travel, write, and speak in support of international leftist movements. In 1971 he published his collected essays in a second book, \"Stokely Speaks: Black Power Back to Pan-Africanism\". This book expounds an explicitly socialist, Pan-African vision, which he retained for the rest of his life. From the late 1970s until the day he died, he answered his phone by announcing, \"Ready for the revolution!\"\n\nIn 1986, two years after Sékou Touré's death in 1984, the military regime that took his place arrested Carmichael, for his past association with Touré, and jailed him for three days on suspicion of attempting to overthrow the government. Although Touré was known for jailing and torturing his opponents (some 50,000 people are believed to have been killed under his regime) Carmichael had never publicly criticized the man he had named himself after.\n\nFor the final 30 years of his life, Kwame Ture was devoted to the All-African People's Revolutionary Party (A-APRP). His mentor Kwame Nkrumah had many ideas for unifying the African continent, and Ture used those ideas in a broader scope involving the entire African diaspora. He was a central committee member for the entire time that he participated in the A-APRP and made many speeches in the Party's behalf.\n\nTure did not simply study with Sékou Touré and Kwame Nkrumah. The latter had been designated honorary co-president of Guinea after he was deposed by the US-backed coup in Ghana. Ture worked overtly and covertly to \"Take Nkrumah Back to Ghana\" (according to the movement's slogan). He became a member of the Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG), the revolutionary ruling party of Guinea. He sought Nkrumah's permission to launch the All-African People's Revolutionary Party (A-APRP), which Nkrumah had called for in his book \"Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare.\" After several discussions, Nkrumah gave his blessing.\n\nTure was convinced that the A-APRP was needed as a permanent mass-based organization on all continents and in all countries in which people of African descent lived. For the remainder of his life, a period often ignored by popular media, Ture worked for decades on a full-time basis as an \"organizer\" of the Party. He spoke on its behalf on several continents at innumerable college campuses, in community centers, and other venues. He was instrumental in strengthening ties between the African/Black liberation movement and several revolutionary or progressive organizations, both African and non-African. Notable among them were the American Indian Movement (AIM) of the United States, New Jewel Movement (Grenada), National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) of Trinidad and Tobago, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Pan Africanist Congress (South Africa) and the Irish Republican Socialist Party.\n\nRoutinely, Ture was regarded as the leader of the A-APRP, but his only title was \"Organizer\", and he was a member of the Central Committee. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the A-APRP began each May to sponsor African Liberation Day (ALD), a continuation of African Freedom Day begun by Kwame Nkrumah in 1958 in Ghana. Although the party was involved in or was primary or co-sponsor of other ALD annual observances, marches and rallies around the world, the best-known and largest celebration of the event was held annually in Washington, DC, usually at Meridian Hill Park (also known as Malcolm X Park) at 16th and W Streets, NW.\n\nWhile based in Guinea as home, Ture traveled a good part of the time. Britain and his birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, barred him from speaking at one time or another for fear that he would arouse African-descended people in those countries. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Ture became the world's most active and prominent exponent of pan-Africanism, defined by Nkrumah and the A-APRP as \"The Liberation and Unification of Africa Under Scientific Socialism.\"\n\nTure often returned to speak to large (1,000+) audiences at his alma mater, Howard University, which generally included students and community residents, and at other campuses. The Party worked to recruit students and other youth, and Ture hoped to attract them through his speeches. He also worked to raise the political consciousness of African/Black people in general. Shortly after the A-APRP was formed, he said that an initial goal was to put \"Africa\" on the lips of Black people throughout the African Diaspora. He knew that many may not have consciously related to the continent in a positive way after generations away. Ture was convinced, according to those who worked closely with him, that the party played a significant role in helping to raise international black consciousness of Pan-Africanism.\n\nUnder his leadership, the A-APRP organized the All African Women's Revolutionary Union and the Sammy Younge Jr. Brigade (named after the first black college student to die during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement) as component organizations.\n\nTure and Cuba's president Fidel Castro were mutual admirers, sharing a common opposition to imperialism. In Ture's final letter, he wrote:\n\nIt was Fidel Castro who before the OLAS (Organization of Latin American States) Conference said \"if imperialism touches one grain of hair on his head, we shall not let the fact pass without retaliation.\" It was he, who on his own behalf, asked them all to stay in contact with me when I returned to the United States to offer me protection.\n\nTure was ill when he gave his final speech at Howard University. A standing-room-only crowd in Rankin Chapel paid tribute to him and he spoke boldly, as usual. A small group of student leaders from Howard University and a former Party member traveled to Harlem (Sugar Hill) in New York City to bid farewell to Kwame Ture shortly before what was his final return to Guinea. Also present that evening were Kathleen Cleaver and another Black Panther, Dhoruba bin Wahad. Ture was in good spirits though in pain. The group bidding farewell to Kwame Ture included African/Black men and women born in Africa, South America, the Caribbean, and the USA.\n\nAfter his diagnosis of prostate cancer in 1996, Ture was treated for a period in Cuba, while receiving some support from the Nation of Islam. Benefit concerts for Ture were held in Denver; New York; Atlanta; and Washington, D.C., to help defray his medical expenses. The government of Trinidad and Tobago, where he was born, awarded him a grant of $1,000 a month for the same purpose. He went to New York, where he was treated for two years at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, before returning to Guinea.\n\nIn a final interview given in April 1998 to \"The Washington Post\", Ture had criticized the limited economic and electoral progress made by African Americans in the U.S. during the previous 30 years. He acknowledged that blacks had won election to the mayor's office in major cities, but said that, as the mayors' power had generally diminished over earlier decades, such progress was essentially meaningless.\nIn 1998 Ture died of prostate cancer at the age of 57 in Conakry, Guinea. He had said that his cancer \"was given to me by forces of American imperialism and others who conspired with them.\" He claimed that the FBI had infected him with cancer in an assassination attempt.\n\nThe civil rights leader Jesse Jackson spoke in celebration of Ture's life, stating: \"He was one of our generation who was determined to give his life to transforming America and Africa. He was committed to ending racial apartheid in our country. He helped to bring those walls down\". NAACP Chair Julian Bond said that Carmichael \"ought to be remembered for having spent almost every moment of his adult life trying to advance the cause of black liberation.\"\n\nCarmichael had married Miriam Makeba, the noted singer from South Africa, while in the US in 1968. They divorced in Guinea after separating in 1973.\n\nLater he married Marlyatou Barry, a Guinean doctor. They divorced some time after having a son, Bokar, in 1981. By 1998, Marlyatou Barry and Bokar were living in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, DC. Relying on a statement from the All-African People's Revolutionary Party, Carmichael's 1998 obituary in \"The New York Times\" referred to his survivors as two sons, three sisters, and his mother, without further details.\n\nKwame Ture, along with Charles V. Hamilton, is credited with coining the phrase \"institutional racism\"---defined as racism that occurs through institutions such as public bodies and corporations, including universities. In the late 1960s Ture defined \"institutional racism\" as \"the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin.\"\n\nIn his book on Martin Luther King, Jr., David J. Garrow criticized Ture's handling of the Black Power movement as \"more destructive than constructive.\" Garrow described the period in 1966 where Ture and other members of the SNCC managed to successfully register 2,600 African American voters in Lowndes County, Alabama, as the most consequential period in Ture's life \"in terms of real, positive, tangible influence on people's lives.\" Evaluations from Ture's associates are also mixed, with most praising his efforts and others criticizing him for failing to find constructive ways to achieve his objectives. SNCC's final Chair, Phil Hutchings, who expelled Ture over a dispute concerning the Black Panther Party, wrote that, \"Even though we kidded and called him 'Starmichael,' he could sublimate his ego to get done what was needed to be done...He would say what he thought, and you could disagree with it but you wouldn't cease being a human being and someone with whom he wanted to be in relationship.\" \"Washington Post\" staff writer Paula Span described Carmichael as someone who was rarely hesitant to push his own ideology.\nTufts University historian Peniel Joseph credits Ture with expanding the parameters of the civil rights movement, asserting that his black power strategy \"didn't disrupt the civil rights movement. It spoke truth to power to what so many millions of young people were feeling. It actually cast a light on people who were in prisons, people who were welfare rights activists, tenants' rights activists, and also in the international arena.\" Tavis Smiley calls Ture \"one of the most underappreciated, misunderstood, undervalued personalities this country's ever produced.\"\n\nIn 2002, the American-born scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Kwame Ture as one of his 100 Greatest African Americans.\n\nAlthough he stated in his posthumously published memoirs that he had never been anti-semitic, in 1970 Carmichael proclaimed: \"I have never admired a white man, but the greatest of them, to my mind, was Hitler.\" However, Carmichael in the same speech condemned Hitler on moral grounds, Carmichael himself stating:\n\nAdolph Hitler—I'm not putting a judgment on what he did—if you asked me for my judgment morally, I would say it was bad, what he did was wrong, was evil, etc. But I would say he was a genius, nevertheless . . . . You say he's not a genius because he committed bad acts. That's not the question. The question is, he does have genius. Now when we condemn him morally or ethically, we will say, well, he was absolutely wrong, he should be killed, he should be murdered, etc., etc. . . . But if we're judging his genius objectively, we have to admit that the man was a genius. He forced the entire world to fight him. He was fighting America, France, Britain, Russia, Italy once— then they switched sides—all of them at the same time, and whipping them. That's a genius, you cannot deny that.\n\nIn November 1964 Carmichael made a joking remark in response to a SNCC position paper written by his friends Casey Hayden and Mary E. King on the position of women in the movement. In the course of an irreverent comedy monologue he performed at a party after SNCC's Waveland conference, Carmichael said, \"The position of women in the movement is prone.\" A number of women were offended. In a 2006 \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" article, historian Peniel E. Joseph later wrote:\n\nWhile the remark was made in jest during a 1964 conference, Carmichael and black-power activists did embrace an aggressive vision of manhood — one centered on black men's ability to deploy authority, punishment, and power. In that, they generally reflected their wider society's blinders about women and politics.\n\nCarmichael's colleague, John Lewis, stated in his autobiography, \"March\", that the comment was a joke, uttered during moment when Carmichael and other SNCC officials were \"blowing off steam\" following the adjournment of a meeting at a staff retreat in Waveland, Mississippi. When asked about the comment, former SNCC field secretary Casey Hayden stated: \"Our paper on the position of women came up, and Stokely in his hipster rap comedic way joked that 'the proper position of women in SNCC is prone'. I laughed, he laughed, we all laughed. Stokely was a friend of mine.\" In her memoir, Mary E. King wrote that Carmichael was \"poking fun at his own attitudes\" and that \"Casey and I felt, and continue to feel, that Stokely was one of the most responsive men at the time that our anonymous paper appeared in 1964.\"\n\nCarmichael appointed several women to posts as project directors during his tenure as chairman of SNCC; by the latter half of the 1960s (considered to be the \"Black Power era\"), more women were in charge of SNCC projects than during the first half.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31480", "title": "Theosophy (Boehmian)", "text": "Theosophy (Boehmian)\n\nTheosophy, also known as Christian theosophy and Boehmian theosophy, refers to a range of positions within Christianity which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of divinity and the origin and purpose of the universe.\nThey have been characterized as mystical and occultist philosophies. Theosophy is considered part of Western esotericism, which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to enlightenment and salvation.\n\nThe foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher Jakob Böhme.\n\nIn 1875, the term \"theosophy\" was adopted and revived by the Theosophical Society, an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called Theosophy. In the twentieth century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.\n\nTheosophy comes from the Greek ' (), which combines ' (θεός), \"God\" and \"\" (), \"wisdom\". Its etymological meaning is thus \"wisdom of God.\" \n\nThe term \"theosophia\" appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early church fathers, as a synonym for theology: the \"theosophoi\" are \"those knowing divine things\". The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history. The adjective \"theosophos\" (θεόσοφος) \"wise in divine things\" was applied by Iamblichus to the gymnosophists (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian yogis or sadhus.\n\nScholars of esotericism such as Godwin and Faivre differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by Helena Blavatsky by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy. Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers. Causing some confusion was the fact that a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.\n\nAntoine Faivre suggested that it be called \"Boehmian theosophy\".\n\nThe term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE. The 13th century work \"Summa philosophiae\" attributed to Robert Grosseteste made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Origen were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, use of the term diverged to refer to gnostic knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits. Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of Paracelsus (1493–1541). The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century \"Theosophia\" by Johannes Arboreus provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian theosophy and Pietism arose in response to the orthodoxy of the Lutheran Reformation.\n\nThe work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic Jakob Boehme (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word \"theosophy\", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself. Moreover, Boehme gave the word \"theosophy\" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating nature with God. Boehme's work has been described as being \"foundational\" for Christian theosophy. There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific. Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by Jan Baptist van Helmont (1618–1699), Robert Fludd (1574–1637), John Pordage (1608–1681), Jane Leade (1623–1704), Henry More (1614–1687), Pierre Poiret (1646–1719), and Antoinette Bourignon (1616–1680). Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying active imagination in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries. In Athanasius Kircher's \"Oedipus Aegyptiacus\" (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in ancient Egypt, and to Neo-Platonism, and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.\n\nIn the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term \"theosophy\" was still \"practically absent\" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century. Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century. Johann Jakob Brucker (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word \"theosophy\" was often used in conjunction with The term \"theosophy\" is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.\n\nIn England, Robert Hindmarsh, a printer with a Methodist background, formed a \"Theosophical Society\" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg. This society was renamed in 1785 as \"The British Society for the Propagation of the Doctrines of the New Church\", consisting of Swedenborgian based beliefs. In France, Denis Diderot gave the word \"\" more attention than other encyclopedias of this period by including an article on it in his \"Encyclopédie\", published during the French Enlightenment. The article dealt mostly with Paracelsus and essentially plagiarized Brucker's \"Historia\".\n\nGroups such as the Martinist Order founded by Papus in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as Vladimir Solovyov (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: \"although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'\"\n\nFaivre stated that \"Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends.\"\n\nTheosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the \"theosophic current\" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought (i.e., alchemy, astrology, Neo-Alexandrian Hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the \"prognostications\" of Paracelsus), philosophia occulta and Rosicrucianism). \n\nFaivre noted that there are \"obvious similarities\" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier theosophy \"belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type\", while that of modern Theosophy \"reveals a more universal aspect\". Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences \"are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier\".\n\nTheosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. Antoine Faivre notes, \"the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail.\" The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.\n\nFaivre identified three characteristics of theosophy. The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.\n\n\"Theosophy\":\n\nThe scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff described Christian theosophy as \"one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism\". \n\nChristian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written. The French scholar Antoine Faivre had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Karl von Eckartshausen and Christian theosophy.\nScholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic \"Naturphilosophie\" and therefore creates an \"ideal\" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.\n\n"}
{"id": "55560712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55560712", "title": "Victorino Tejera", "text": "Victorino Tejera\n\nVictorino Tejera (born Tejera Márquez; November 2, 1922 - August 25, 2018) was a writer, scholar, and professor of philosophy with specializations in ancient Greek thought, Metaphysics, Aesthetics, and American philosophy (Naturalism, Semiotics). He was born in Caracas, Venezuela. He is known especially for his writing on Plato's \"Dialogues.\" Many scholars believe Tejera's work in this area is his most valuable contribution to philosophy (see Notes and Further reading). He was editor and contributor with Thelma Lavine on \"History and Anti-History in Philosophy\" (1989, 2012) who's \"From\" \"Socrates to Sartre\" (1984) was the basis for the PBS series of the same name.\n\nHis grandfather was the President of Venezuela, Victorino Marquez Bustillos, his great uncle was the Venezuelan writer and historian Felipe Tejera, and cousin to Enrique Tejera París.\n\nTejera attended St. Mary's College in Southampton, England, a boarding school, from 1930-1938, receiving his Matriculate (university entry status certificate) in London in 1939. He received a fellowship to study at Columbia University in the U.S., completing his Bachelor of Arts degree at the undergraduate college in philosophy (Phi Beta Kappa) in 1948 and his doctorate at the graduate school in philosophy in 1956 with a dissertation on \"Philosophy and the Art of Poetry\". He also completed his \"docente\" (teacher's training) at the Central University of Venezuela in 1951.\nIn his early career, Tejera held the following diplomatic posts:\n\n\nAs a student at Columbia University, some of the principal teachers and direct influences on his work included the renowned intellectual and cultural historians John H. Randall Jr., Justus Buchler, Herbert W. Schneider, Irwin Edman, Mark Van Doren, Jacques Barzun, and Lionel Trilling. While a PhD candidate, he was graduate assistant to Irwin Edman. He counts Andrew Chiappe, Alan Willard Brown, and Quentin Anderson all among his other outstanding teachers at Columbia.\n\nHis early philosophic passion was Greek Philosophy, and he received instruction in Classical Greek from Fred Householder. He studied History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, and Literary Theory. He also attended summer sessions in the late 1940's at the Kenyon School of English. He was profoundly affected by the writings of John Dewey and George Santayana, as well as by the work and literature of the New Critics John Crowe Ransom, and Ivor Winters. His art and literary interests in New York City enabled encounters with noted artists, writers, and poets of the beat generation such as Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Fritz Stern, and artist Jacob Kainen, with whom he formed an enduring friendship. He was identified as the character 'Victor Villanueva' in Kerouac's \"On the Road\", a Latin American poet. Tejera published and translated poems as well.\n\nA portrait of a gathering at Columbia mid-century with Tejera was printed in Fritz Stern's autobiography including the authors, and republished in the New York Times.\n\nAbove all, Tejera felt strongly influenced by Justus Buchler's metaphysics of literary art (metaphysics of human production) and the exhibitive nature of philosophy reflected in Buchler's \"Metaphysics of Natural Complexes\" and \"The Main of Light.\" The influence of Buchler is one of the most apparent in Tejera's published works. Buchler was his dissertation adviser at Columbia when he wrote \"Philosophy and the Art of Poetry\" (1956), and longtime colleague and correspondent.\n\nTejera lectured in History at Georgetown University from 1951 to 1954, and then taught Philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic from 1956 to 1960, Farleigh Dickinson University 1960 to 1961, and Howard University from 1961 to 1966. Afterward he accepted a permanent position of Professor of Philosophy and Comparative Literature at the State University of New York (SUNY) campus at Stony Brook. He was conferred the title of Stony Brook University Professor of Humanities in 1991, and has since received the title of University Professor Emeritus (1996).\n\nAt Stony Brook, he taught Ancient Greek Philosophy, History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, Classical Political Philosophy, American Philosophy, Ancient Greek, Philosophy of History, and Plato's Dialogues, in a teaching career spanning 40 years.\n\nTejera's extensive and varied research in the Humanities culminated in books including:\n\n\nHe added to the arts and human sciences with:\n\n\nTejera is the first American philosopher to apply Justus Buchler's modes of judgment to the study of history and aesthetics. Along with Beth J. Singer, Thelma Z. Lavine, and Horace S. Thayer, he helped revive interest in classic American thought via the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy (SAAP). He renewed interest in a John Dewey's philosophy of culture with an emphasis on poetics and rhetoric, Buchler's coordinative analysis, and philosophic historiography.\n\nHe contributed to the recovery of the Semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce, especially its application to literary theory and philosophy (Semiotics of Literature). Tejera's Semiotics books are a significant effort to mend the gap between scholars engaged in literary discourse and those who work in the social (or human) sciences and natural sciences. The central theme of art and spirituality in American philosophy permeates his Semiotics books, \"American Modern: The Path Not Taken,\" as well as later works.\n\nHis later work in American philosophy had taken two paths: (1) a theory of creative rationality via the aesthetically-aware metaphysical Naturalism of Justus Buchler and Peirce's semiotics, and (2) a fuller aesthetics and poetics-oriented theory in the human sciences and in interpretation theory (Hermeneutics). His latest book, \"Two Metaphysical Naturalisms,\" serves as a companion to \"American Modern,\" dwelling on some of the practical functions of American philosophical reflection. This alignment with classic American Philosophy also contrasts with the cognitivist aesthetics of Phenomenology which turns the aesthetic object into a cognitive object while failing to recognize its dimension of feeling, or the cognitive gain available in art as art in the fullest sense which both Charles S. Peirce and Justus Buchler defend.\n\nTejera's work in Plato studies emphasizes the nature of Plato's \"Dialogues\" as the dramatized conversational encounters and communicative interactions that their design shows them to be, as well as their character as literary works of art. He attends to the tone in which Plato's Socrates addresses his interlocutors to obtain satirical effects by persistent dialogical wit, humor and irony, often missed by readers. His published works on Plato establish that the dialogues are satirical of Spartan militarism and Pythagorean intellectuality, as well as of faction (reactionary dissent, partisanship, etc.) whether democratic or oligarchical. He has advanced this line of scholarship to counter the traditionalist reading of Plato with its predilection for ethical or political propositions, and supplanted it with the Columbia University School reading of the \"Dialogues\" through their literary construction and expressive speech.\n\nTejera offers the argument that nothing qualifies the works of Plato as expository tracts. Rather, they give every sign of being \"dialogical\" \"Dialogues\". That is, they are self-discovering works, highly orchestrated original queries\".\" Instead of supporting the dogma often labeled as \"Platonic Idealism,\" Tejera follows internal clues and self-focusing devices in examining the formative prose of the \"Dialogues\" in line with the interpretational poetics developed in his literary theory volume (\"Literature, Criticism, and the Theory of Signs\").\n\nTejera's most widely recognized book \"Plato's Dialogues: A Dialogical Interpretation\" (c. 1984, updated and revised 1999) advanced the dramatic and dialogical reading of Plato which influenced and precipitated a generation of Plato studies (cf. Gerald A. Press editions in Further reading below). Tejera invented and invoked a unique notation to address the confusion in Plato scholarship to address the Socratic problem in these and other papers, to disambiguate Plato's Socrates from the Historical Socrates, Xenophon's Socrates, and the various interpretations claimed to be Plato's own views. \"To keep track of the many \"composite\" Socrates, both of \"the tradition\" and of individual commentators, we use the label SocC, \"Socrates sub upper-case C.\" (cf. \"The Philosophy of Socrates Program Guide\" p. 106).\n\nThe conventions (subscripts) he used to note the \"kinds\" of Socrates that we are liable to encounter in discussions of Greek literature and philosophy include the following: \n\nTejera is the first to utilize such conventions and standards of source-critical practices in the study of Greek Philosophy. It was the first substantial utility since the writing of Eric Havelock on the Socratic problem of which modern scholars were plagued, and which had ended \"in a dilemma of contradiction\" (Havelock).\n\nEric Havelock had grouped the efforts of Plato interpretation scholars among the following 1) Sceptics, Olof Gigon and Anton-Hermann Chroust, 2) Alternatives to the Sceptics, Gregory Vlastos, Terence Irwin, and Gerasimos X. Santas 3) and the Reconstructionists of Socraticism, Kenneth J. Dover and W.K.C. Gutherie. This was ushered in by the earlier and now century old tradition of Plato interpretation via the John Burnet - A.E. Taylor thesis (my terminology, and first cited in an early article by Havelock), which in effect had rendered Plato as a mere reporter of the doctrines of Socrates (Theory of Forms, Ideas), and with the middle dialogues together comprising all of the historical Socrates, SocH. These concerns are also addressed in the recent works of Charles H. Kahn which are in contradistinction with Tejera's and Havelock's works that minimize the value of the early-middle-late dialogue categorization, and the stylometrics enforced accounts. With the utility of Tejera's conventions, modern scholars have the advantage of addressing such dilemmas in a progressive and orderly fashion, whether from classicist, philosophical and historical orientations. A fuller examination and citations of these approaches may be found in the recent work of the philologist Holger Thesleff, in which he notes Tejera's observations about the dogmatic interpretations of Plato, and the \"Post-Platonic dogmatization of Platonism\".\n\nTejera's three books on Aristotle (\"Return of the King\"\", Two Metaphysical Naturalisms\"\",\" and \"Aristotle in Epitome\") show how Aristotle was turned into a Platonizing logician by a long series of Alexandrian, Latin and Byzantine commentators, who in turn used Aristotle as a proper \"introduction to Plato\", a Plato that had been Pythagorized by the Academy (as an Academic reinterpretation of the dialogues) and initiated after his lifetime, in secondary literature. This long tradition of rendering Aristotle and misshaping of Plato is contested by Tejera as the dogmatic anti-dialogical and doxographical tradition of interpretation, and forms the basis of his inquiry into the pre-Scholastic Aristotle. These books help the reader to recover the Naturalist (nature-inquirer), and humanist Aristotle, lover of poetic drama.\n\nProfessor Tejera was a founding member of the International Plato Society in Perugia, Italy in 1989, a member of the International Organizing Committee for the International Conference on Greek Philosophy, and was made an Honorary Citizen of Lindos, Rhodes for his work on Greek Culture in 1992. He served as Program Chair for the Committee for Aesthetics in 1968 and on the Executive Committee of the Long Island Philosophy Society in 1976. In 1986, he was Program Director for the Society for Advancement of American Philosophy conference honoring John H. Randall Jr., and Herbert W. Schneider.\n\n\n\n"}

Channing was known for his articulate and impassioned sermons and public speeches, and as a prominent thinker in the liberal theology of the day. His religion and thought were among the chief influences on the New England Transcendentalists although he never countenanced their views, which he saw as extreme. He espoused, especially in his \"Baltimore Sermon\" of May5, 1819, given at the ordination of the theologian and educator Jared Sparks (1789–1866) as the first minister of the newly organized First Independent Church of Baltimore, the principles and tenets of the developing philosophy and theology of Unitarianism, leading to the organization in 1825 of the first Unitarian denomination in America (American Unitarian Association) and the later developments and mergers between Unitarians and Universalists, resulting finally in the Unitarian Universalist Association of America in 1961.\n\nChanning, the son of William Channing and Lucy Ellery, was born April7, 1780, in Newport, Newport County, Rhode Island. He was a grandson of William Ellery (1727–1820), a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, Deputy Governor of Rhode Island, Chief Justice, and influential citizen. He became a New England liberal, rejecting the Calvinist doctrines of total depravity and divine election.\n\nChanning enrolled at Harvard College at a troubled time, particularly because of the recent French Revolution. He later wrote of these years:\n\nGraduating first in his class in 1798, he was elected commencement speaker though he was prohibited by the Harvard College faculty from mentioning the Revolution and other political subjects in his address.\n\nIn opposition to traditional American Calvinist orthodoxy, Channing preferred a gentle, loving relationship with God. He opposed for\n\nChanning's inner struggle continued through two years during which he lived in Richmond, Virginia, working as a tutor for David Meade Randolph. He came to his definitive faith only through much spiritual turmoil and difficulty. Channing was called as pastor of the Federal Street Church in Boston in 1803, where he remained for the rest of his life. He lived through the increasing tension between religious liberals and conservatives and took a moderate position, rejecting the extremes of both groups. In 1809 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 1815 Channing engaged in a noted controversy on the principles of Unitarianism with Samuel Worcester, (1770–1821). A review of a pamphlet on American Unitarianism (\"American Unitarianism; or a Brief History of the Progress and Present State of the Unitarian Churches of America\"), attributed to Jeremiah Evarts, was published in \"The Panoplist\" in June 1815. Channing objected to the way Unitarians in the United States were portrayed in the review. Worcester replied to this objection, and an exchange of pamphlets followed.\n\nNotwithstanding his moderate position, Channing later became the primary spokesman and interpreter of Unitarianism, after sixteen years at Boston's Federal Street Church. He was invited to come south again to Maryland to preach the ordination sermon of the future noted educator and theologian Jared Sparks (1789–1866), the first minister (1819–1823) called to the newly organized congregation (1817) in Baltimore known as the First Independent Church of Baltimore (located at West Franklin and North Charles Streets, in a landmark two-year-old structure designed by noted French émigré architect J. Maximilian M. Godefroy), later known, after a merger with Second Universalist Church in 1935, as the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist), which was forever after known as \"The Baltimore Sermon\". The sermon, or address, was given on Wednesday, May5, 1819, and was entitled \"Unitarian Christianity\". In it, he explicated the distinctive tenets of the developing Unitarian movement, one of which was the rejection of the Trinity. Other important tenets were the belief in human goodness and the subjection of theological ideas to the light of reason. (The anniversary of the address is celebrated and observed annually by the Maryland churches of the Unitarian Universalist Association and its Joseph Priestley District as \"Union Sunday\", with occasional ecumenical guests from other Christian bodies.)\n\nIn 1828 he gave another famous ordination sermon, entitled \"Likeness to God\". The idea of the human potential to be like God, which Channing advocated as grounded firmly in scripture, was seen as heretical by the religious establishment of his day. It is in this address that Channing first advocated the possibility for revelation through reason rather than solely from Scripture. \"American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia\" classes him as one of several figures who \"took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.\"\n\nEven at the end of his life he adhered to the non-Socinian belief in the preexistence of Christ:\n\nIn later years Channing addressed the topic of slavery although he was never an ardent abolitionist. Channing wrote a book in 1835 entitled \"Slavery.\" Channing has, however, been described as a romantic racist. He held a common American belief about the inferiority of African people and slaves and held a belief that once freed, Africans would need overseers. The overseers (largely former slave masters) were necessary because the slaves would lapse into laziness. Furthermore, he did not join the abolitionist movement because he did not agree with their way of conducting themselves, and he felt that voluntary associations limited a person's autonomy. Therefore, he often chose to remain separate from organizations and reform movements. This middle position characterized his attitude about most questions although his eloquence and strong influence on the religious world incurred the enmity of many extremists. Channing had an enormous influence over the religious (and social) life of New England, and America, in the nineteenth century.\n\nToward the end of his life Channing embraced immediate abolitionism. His evolving view of abolitionism was fostered by the success of British abolition in the British West Indies in 1834 and the absence of the expected social and economic upheaval in the post-emancipated Caribbean.\n\nChanning wrote extensively about the emerging new national literature of the United States, saying that national literature is \"the expression of a nation's mind in writing\", and \"the concentration of intellect for the purpose of spreading itself abroad and multiplying its energy\".\n\nChanning died in Old Bennington, Vermont, where a cenotaph is placed in his memory. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
