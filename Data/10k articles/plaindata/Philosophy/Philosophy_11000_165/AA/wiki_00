The talks, held in Juba, the capital of autonomous Southern Sudan, began in July 2006 and were mediated by Riek Machar, the Vice President of Southern Sudan. The talks, which had resulted in a ceasefire by September 2006, were described as the best chance ever for a negotiated settlement to the 20-year-old war. However, LRA leader Joseph Kony refused to sign the peace agreement in April 2008. Two months later, the LRA carried out an attack on a Southern Sudanese town, prompting the Government of Southern Sudan to officially withdraw from their mediation role.\n\nA delegation from the LRA arrived in Juba, Sudan on 8 June 2006 to prepare for talks with the Ugandan government, to be mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan and by the Community of Sant'Egidio. These talks were agreed to after Kony released a video in May in which he denied committing atrocities and seemed to call for an end to hostilities, in response to an announcement by Museveni that he would guarantee the safety of Kony if peace was agreed to by July. Museveni had pledged to grant Kony total amnesty if he gave up \"terrorism\". Uganda's security minister Amama Mbabazi urged the International Criminal Court to drop the indictments issued in 2005 against leaders of the LRA, but LRA legal adviser Krispus Ayena Odongo rejected the offer, saying that accepting amnesty \"presupposes surrender\" and would mean the LRA was no longer available for discussions. Several organizations, including the ICC and the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute insisted that LRA leaders must be arrested in accordance with the Rome Statute. \n\nJoseph Kony gave his first interview to the press after 20 years of carrying out the conflict in late June 2006. He denied that the LRA had carried out any atrocities and blamed President Museveni for oppressing the Acholi. Regardless, in late June 2006, the Government of Southern Sudan formally invited Uganda to attend peace talks.\n\nOn 14 July 2006 talks began in Juba between delegations from the LRA and Uganda, with the Vice-president of Southern Sudan Riek Machar as the chief mediator. The leader of the Ugandan delegation, Internal Affairs Minister Ruhakana Rugunda stated that his priority was to obtain a quick ceasefire. The LRA delegation, led by Martin Ojul, said that LRA's acceptance of the peace talks should not be interpreted that LRA can no longer fight, but stressed that a negotiated settlement is the best way to end the conflict.\n\nThe initial delegation was criticized as largely consisting of expatriate Acholi, rather than members of the fighting force. However, after many delays Vincent Otti arrived for meetings on the 29th, followed the next day by Kony's 14-year-old son Salim Saleh Kony (sharing a name with brother of President Museveni, Salim Saleh). Kony himself met with local religious and political leaders from northern Uganda and southern Sudan on the following day. On 2 August, Kony held his first ever press conference in which he demanded a ceasefire before LRA-government negotiations resumed on the 7th and denied ever abducting children. Some media sources noted that, of the approximately 80 LRA fighters surrounding the press venue, several appeared to be in their early teens.\n\nThe broader context of the talks remained confused. The government of Southern Sudan views the talks as a means of ridding itself of a foreign army that is complicating their delicate relationship with the Khartoum government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda, led some political analysts to see Ugandan Government's request as a ploy to gain local support. The comment of a George Olara, an IDP living in a camp in Pader, was fairly typical: \"He [Kony] should not be taken to The Hague. Let him come back and live with the community because this is how reconciliation will be achieved. ... Peace will come if the talks succeed, but there is the potential that they may also fail like they have done before\".\n\nOn 4 August 2006, Vincent Otti declared a unilateral ceasefire and asked the Ugandan government to reciprocate. Ugandan Internal Affairs Minister Ruhakana Rugunda stated that they were waiting to see the effect on the ground. ICC indictee Raska Lukwiya was killed in battle on 12 August 2006; the LRA asked for three days of mourning though a spokesman said that talks would continue. Ugandan President Museveni set a 12 September 2006 deadline to finalize a peace deal. The government and LRA signed a truce on 26 August 2006. Under the terms of the agreement, LRA forces were required to leave Uganda and gather in two assembly areas, where the Ugandan government promised they would not attack and the government of Southern Sudan guaranteed their safety. Once this is accomplished, talks on a comprehensive peace agreement would begin. Although a final agreement was not reached by the 12 August deadline, LRA rebels began gathering in the assembly areas and the government delegation stated that they would not hold to the deadline. Machar stated that several hundred rebels, including Otti, had gathered either at Ri-Kwangba in West Equatoria or Owiny Ki-Bul in East Equatoria.\n\nThe government also began a process of creating \"satellite camps\" to decongest the main IDP camps. In Pader, 28 satellite sites were occupied out of 48 identified as of late September 2006, while the numbers in Kitgum were 21 of 36. IDPs farther south in Teso and Lango were being encouraged to return home directly. However, talks continued to be delayed. On 23 September, the LRA delegation threatened to walk out of the negotiations, claiming that the UPDF had attacked their forces at Owiny Ki-Bul and demanding that composition of the government delegation be changed and that the ICC warrants be voided before any agreement. Uganda denied the accusation of attacks. Both delegations met with mediator Riek Machar on 25 September 2006, but not with each other.\n\nThe negotiations were paused in early October while a Cessation of Hostilities monitoring team was sent to Owiny Ki-Bul. The team found that no attack had taken place, but that the LRA had simply moved away from the designated site. The team recommended that the LRA rebels regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, while stating that the LRA had not honored the agreement and was using hostile propaganda, that the UPDF was located close to the assembly points and that the mediators had failed to provide armed guards for the assembled rebels. On 11 October 2006, the LRA proposed that Uganda adopt a federalist structure, prompting criticism from the government spokesperson.\n\nOn 20 October 2006, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni traveled to Juba to meet the LRA negotiators face-to-face for the first time in an attempt to revive the talks, described as \"stalled\" by \"BBC News\" and \"faltering\" by \"The Monitor\" newspaper. A Uganda government source reported that the president spoke angrily and rebuked the LRA team several times, before later referring to the LRA as \"unserious\" in a subsequent address to South Sudan government officials. A pall had been thrown over the talks by the murder of several dozen civilians, including the shooting of women and children in the head, near Juba during the two previous days. The attacks were carried out by an as-yet unnamed group, but some suspected that the LRA was responsible for the mayhem.\n\nAfter a week-long impasse, the LRA and government signed a second truce on 1 November 2006 that mandated the monitoring team until 1 December. The previous agreement had technically expired in September. As part of the agreement, the army was to withdraw from Owiny Ki-Bul, past a 30-km (18-mi) buffer zone. The LRA was given a week to regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, and four weeks to gather at Ri-Kwangba. Both Kony and Otti refused to enter the camps, citing fear of arrest on the ICC warrants. The agreement further stated that food would not be provided to LRA units outside the assembly points except in \"exceptional circumstances\".\n\nIn one of the most significant moments for the LRA during the talks, United Nations Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland met with Kony and Otti in the hopes of pushing the talks forward on 12 November 2006. Egeland had previously stated that he would meet with Kony only if the LRA released abducted children and wounded members, but Kony denied that anyone in the LRA was either wounded or held against their will.\n\nThe LRA declared that it was withdrawing from the talks on November 30, stating that UPDF had killed three of its fighters. The deadline for the LRA fighters to finish gathering at the assembly points was 1 December. Uganda denied the charge. Also, outgoing United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Joaquim Chissano, former president of Mozambique, to be the UN envoy to the conflict. The truce was further extended for two more months on 18 December.\n\nOn 12 January 2007 Ojul stated that recent comments made by al-Bashir and Kiir clearly signified that the LRA was not welcome any longer in Sudan, and that further talks should occur in Kenya instead. On 14 March 2007 the LRA stated it would once again return to the Juba talks. After South Africa, Kenya and Mozambique agreed to join the peace talks (a demand the LRA had made before it would return to Juba), the next round of talks was held from 13 April to 14 April 2007. In this round, the ceasefire was extended until 30 June 2007, and Ri Kwangba was the agreed upon assembly point. The next round of talks was set for 25 April 2007.\n\nFollowing this suspension in the peace talks, the Juba Initiative Project enabled the resumption of the talks in May 2007, thanks to the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for LRA-affected areas Joaquim Chissano. The talks were again mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan, but with the support of the United Nations and logistic facilitation from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), under the leadership of her local head Eliane Duthoit.\n\nOn 29 June 2007, the sides agreed to the principles of how justice and reconciliation will be handled, the third of the five-point agenda. The LRA and government agreed that both formal justice procedures and the traditional Mato Oput ceremony of reconciliation would play a role. Government delegation spokesperson Barigye Ba-Hoku stated that they would attempt to convince the ICC that this would address their concerns about impunity and that arrests under ICC auspices would not be necessary. In November 2007, an LRA delegation led by Martin Ojul journeyed to Kampala to restate their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Ojul later led the delegation on a tour of northern Uganda to meet victims of the insurgency and ask their forgiveness. However, reports surfaced that LRA deputy commander Otti had been executed on or around 8 October 2007 over an internal power struggle with Kony.\n\nOn 20 December 2007 the government set an ultimatum for the peace talks to conclude by 31 January 2008, threatening that a new military offensive otherwise. The death of Vincent Otti, confirmed in mid-January 2008, was reported to threaten the success of the talks. Talks resumed on 30 January 2008, and the ceasefire was extended until 29 February 2008. The European Union and the United States joined the negotiations, increasing the number of observers to eight.\n\nA breakthrough in negotiations was reached on 3 February 2008 regarding accountability and reconciliation. A deal was signed on 19 February 2008 which decided that the war crimes would be tried in a special section of the High Court of Uganda, thus bypassing the International Criminal Court and also removing one of the last obstacles to a final peace deal. On 22 February 2008, the rebels walked out of the talks again after being denied senior government posts. However, shortly thereafter they signed another breakthrough agreement according to which they \"would be considered for government and army posts\", but not automatically appointed. A permanent ceasefire to come into effect 24 hours after the signing a comprehensive peace treaty (expected by 29 February 2008) was agreed upon on 23 February 2008.\n\nMore problems appeared on 28 February 2008: The rebels demand a retraction of the ICC indictments, but the Ugandan government only wants to ask the UN to do that after the rebels have demobilised. An accord on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration was signed late on 29 February 2008, leaving the signing of the peace treaty itself as the last missing action.\n\nThe truce was extended until 28 March 2008, and the final peace talks will continue on 12 March 2008. The ICC prosecutor-general Luis Moreno-Ocampo on 5 March 2008 rejected demands by the rebels for a meeting, stating that \"arrest warrants issued by the court... remain in effect and have to be executed\". it was reported that rebel leader Kony would nonetheless come out of the bush to sign the peace agreement on 28 March 2008, with the implicit agreement that he will not be apprehended and transferred to the ICC while out in the open; such an action was also thought to likely see a remobilisation of his rebel army. Furthermore, it was suggested that Uganda should lobby at the United Nations Security Council to suspend the ICC indictments for a year.\n\nOn 12 March 2008, as final talks were set to continue, the ICC inquired as to the precise definition of the powers of the proposed intra-Ugandan war crimes court section, in a move seen as softening the indictments on the LRA rebels. The final signing of the peace deal was delayed on 26 March 2008 from 28 March 2008 to 3 April 2008; while the ceasefire was not formally extended with this deadline, both parties were expected to continue adhering to it. The signing was then further delayed to 5 April 2008. It was later announced that Kony would sign the deal in the bush two days before that. However, this was postponed to 10 April 2008; reportedly, Kony was suffering from diarrhoea. \n\nThe ICC inquired as to the precise nature of the special courts in Uganda. Kony delayed the signing of the final treaty further on 10 April 2008, reportedly asking for more information about what kind of punishments he could face. He later clarified that he wanted to know further details about how \"mato-oput\", the Acholi traditional justice, would be used, and how exactly the special division of the High Court would work; he then suspended the peace talks and appointed a new negotiating team, claiming to \"have been misled\". Specifically, Kony fired chief LRA negotiator David Nyakorach Matsanga and replaced him with James Obita. Kony subsequently failed to show up at Nabanga to sign the treaty.\n\nThe government subsequently stated that they would return to Juba and Kampala, as the LRA had broken the agreement, and that the ceasefire agreement would not be extended. The next steps of both sides are unclear. Diplomats unsuccessfully tried to restart the talks on 26 April 2008. On 26 May 2008 the government set up a special war crimes court with the mandate to try the LRA in an attempt to convince the ICC to withdraw its indictments against LRA leaders.\n\nSince April 2008, the LRA had begun rearming and abducting recruits, with the \"BBC\" stating that 1000 new abductees had been added to the 600 old LRA fighters by June. Lord's Resistance Army negotiator James Obita stated that on 4 June 2008, the Southern Sudan army attacked an LRA encampment killing two, though this is unconfirmed. On 5 June 2008, the LRA attacked the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA) camp at Nabanga, killing 21, seven soldiers and 14 civilians, before killing a local chief in the nearby village of Yamba. The LRA fighters burnt the SPLA camp before returning to Ri-Kwangba. This occurred as Kony reappointed Matsanga as chief negotiator. Matsanga claimed on 6 June to have contacted UN Envoy Joaquim Chissano to revive the talks; Chissano subsequently arrived in Kampala for talks with President Museveni on 7 June. However, the Government of Southern Sudan announced on 8 June that they would no longer mediate, with Information Minister Gabriel Changson Cheng noting that there were multiple reasons for the decision, including the recent attack and the apparent lack of interest in the peace process on the part of the Ugandan government. The governments of the nations in which the LRA is active met earlier in the week and all suggested military action.\n\nIn December 2008 the United Nations Security Council agreed with a Joaquim Chissano's recommendation that the peace efforts should continue will continuing to support the ICC arrest warrants.\n\n"}
{"id": "295569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295569", "title": "Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten", "text": "Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\n\nAlexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (; ; 17 July 1714 – 27 May 1762) was a German philosopher. He was a brother to theologian Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten (1706–1757).\n\nBaumgarten was born in Berlin as the fifth of seven sons of the pietist pastor of the garrison, Jacob Baumgarten, and of his wife Rosina Elisabeth. Both his parents died early, and he was taught by Martin Georg Christgau where he learned Hebrew and became interested in Latin poetry.\n\nIn 1733, during his formal studies at the University of Halle, he attended lectures on the philosophy of Christian Wolff by at the University of Jena.\n\nWhile the meanings of words often change as a result of cultural developments, Baumgarten's reappraisal of aesthetics is often seen as a key moment in the development of aesthetic philosophy. Previously the word \"aesthetics\" had merely meant \"sensibility\" or \"responsiveness to stimulation of the senses\" in its use by ancient writers. With the development of art as a commercial enterprise linked to the rise of a \"nouveau riche\" class across Europe, the purchasing of art inevitably led to the question, \"what is good art?\". Baumgarten developed aesthetics to mean the study of good and bad \"taste\", thus good and bad art, linking good taste with beauty.\n\nBy trying to develop an idea of good and bad taste, he also in turn generated philosophical debate around this new meaning of aesthetics. Without it, there would be no basis for aesthetic debate as there would be no objective criterion, basis for comparison, or reason from which one could develop an objective argument.\n\nBaumgarten appropriated the word \"aesthetics\", which had always meant \"sensation\", to mean taste or \"sense\" of beauty. In so doing, he gave the word a different significance, thereby inventing its modern usage. The word had been used differently since the time of the ancient Greeks to mean the ability to receive stimulation from one or more of the five bodily senses. In his \"Metaphysic\", § 451, Baumgarten defined taste, in its wider meaning, as the ability to judge according to the senses, instead of according to the intellect. Such a judgment of taste he saw as based on feelings of pleasure or displeasure. A science of aesthetics would be, for Baumgarten, a deduction of the rules or principles of artistic or natural beauty from individual \"taste\". Baumgarten may have been motivated to respond to Pierre Bonhours' opinion, published in a pamphlet in the late 17th century, that Germans were incapable of appreciating art and beauty.\n\nIn 1781, Kant declared that Baumgarten's aesthetics could never contain objective rules, laws, or principles of natural or artistic beauty.\nNine years later, in his \"Critique of Judgment\", Kant conformed to Baumgarten's new usage and employed the word \"aesthetic\" to mean the judgment of taste or the estimation of the beautiful. For Kant, an aesthetic judgment is subjective in that it relates to the internal feeling of pleasure or displeasure and not to any qualities in an external object.\n\nIn 1897, Leo Tolstoy, in his \"What is Art?\", criticized Baumgarten's book on aesthetics. Tolstoy opposed \"Baumgarten's trinity — Good, Truth and Beauty….\" Tolstoy asserted that \"these words not only have no definite meaning, but they hinder us from giving any definite meaning to existing art….\" Baumgarten, he said, claimed that there are three ways to know perfection: \"Beauty is the perfect (the absolute) perceived by the senses. Truth is the perfect perceived by reason. The good is the perfect attained by the moral will.\" Tolstoy, however, contradicted Baumgarten's theory and claimed that good, truth, and beauty have nothing in common and may even oppose each other. \n\nWhatever the limitations of Baumgarten's theory of aesthetics, Frederick Copleston credits him with playing a formative role in German aesthetics, extending Christian Wolff's philosophy to topics that Wolff did not consider, and demonstrating the existence of a legitimate topic for philosophical analysis that could not be reduced to abstract logical analysis.\n\nFor many years, Kant used Baumgarten's \"Metaphysica\" as a handbook or manual for his lectures on that topic. <br> Georg Friedrich Meier translated the Metaphysics from Latin to German, an endeavour which - according to Meier - Baumgarten himself had planned, but could not find the time to execute.\n\n\n\n\n"}

One key component to this argument is that primates relied on sight over smell. They were able to develop a keen sense of depth perception, perhaps because of the constant leaping that was necessary to move about the trees. Primates also developed hands and feet that were capable of grasping. This was also a result of arboreal life, which required a great deal of crawling along branches, and reaching out for fruit and other food. These early primates were likely to have eaten foods found in trees, such as flowers, fruits, berries, gums, leaves, and insects. They are thought to have shifted their diets towards insects in the early Cenozoic era, when insects became more numerous.\n"}

He was also a Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics.\n\nLatour is best known for his books \"We Have Never Been Modern\" (1991; English translation, 1993), \"Laboratory Life\" (with Steve Woolgar, 1979) and \"Science in Action\" (1987). Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with social constructionist approaches to the philosophy of science, Latour has diverged significantly from such approaches. He is best known for withdrawing from the subjective/objective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice. Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.\nAlong with Michel Callon and John Law, Latour is one of the primary developers of actor–network theory (ANT), a constructionist approach influenced by the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel, the generative semiotics of Algirdas Julien Greimas, and (more recently) the sociology of Émile Durkheim's rival Gabriel Tarde.\n\nLatour's monographs earned him a 10th place among most-cited book authors in the humanities and social sciences for the year 2007.\n\nLatour is related to a well-known family of winemakers from Burgundy, but is not associated with the similarly named estate in Bordeaux.\n\nAs a student, Latour originally focused on philosophy and was deeply influenced by Michel Serres. Latour received his Ph.D. in theology at Université de Tours. He quickly developed an interest in anthropology, and undertook fieldwork in Ivory Coast which resulted in a brief monograph on decolonization, race, and industrial relations.\n\nAfter spending more than twenty years at the Centre de sociologie de l'innovation at the École des Mines in Paris, Latour moved in 2006 to Sciences Po, where he was the first occupant of a chair named for Gabriel Tarde. In recent years he also served as one of the curators of successful art exhibitions at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie in Karlsruhe, Germany, including \"Iconoclash\" (2002) and \"Making Things Public\" (2005). In 2005 he also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nOn 22 May 2008, Latour was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Université de Montréal on the occasion of an organizational communication conference held in honor of the work of James R. Taylor, on whom Latour has had an important influence. He holds several other honorary doctorates, as well as France's Légion d'Honneur (2012).\nOn 13 March 2013, he was announced as the winner of the 2013 Holberg Prize. The prize committee stated that \"Bruno Latour has undertaken an ambitious analysis and reinterpretation of modernity, and has challenged fundamental concepts such as the distinction between modern and pre-modern, nature and society, human and non-human.\" The committee states that \"the impact of Latour's work is evident internationally and far beyond studies of the history of science, art history, history, philosophy, anthropology, geography, theology, literature and law.\"\n\nA 2013 article in Aftenposten by Jon Elster criticised the conferment to Latour, by saying \"The question is, does he deserve the prize.\" …\"If the statutes [of the award] had used new knowledge as a main criteria, instead of one of several, then he would be completely unqualified in my opinion.\"\n\nAfter his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists. Latour rose in importance following the 1979 publication of \"Laboratory Life: the Social Construction of Scientific Facts\" with co-author Steve Woolgar. In the book, the authors undertake an ethnographic study of a neuroendocrinology research laboratory at the Salk Institute. This early work argued that naïve descriptions of the scientific method, in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.\n\nIn the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.\n\nLatour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences. Drawing on the work of Gaston Bachelard, they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are \"socially constructed\" within the laboratory—that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them. They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices— in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book \"Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society\" is one of the key texts of the sociology of scientific knowledge in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: \"Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor.\"\n\nSome of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed. Similarly, philosopher John Searle argues that Latour's \"extreme social constructivist\" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently \"comical results.\"\n\nAfter a research project examining the sociology of primatologists, Latour followed up the themes in \"Laboratory Life\" with \"Les Microbes: guerre et paix\" (published in English as \"The Pasteurization of France\" in 1988). In it, he reviews the life and career of one of France's most famous scientists Louis Pasteur and his discovery of microbes, in the fashion of a political biography. Latour highlights the social forces at work in and around Pasteur's career and the uneven manner in which his theories were accepted. By providing more explicitly ideological explanations for the acceptance of Pasteur's work more easily in some quarters than in others, he seeks to undermine the notion that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories is primarily, or even usually, a matter of experiment, evidence or reason. Another work, \"Aramis, or, The Love of Technology\" focuses on the history of an unsuccessful mass-transit project.\n\nLatour's work \"Nous n’avons jamais été modernes : Essais d’anthropologie symétrique\" was first published in French in 1991, and then in English in 1993 as \"We Have Never Been Modern\".\n\nLatour encouraged the reader of this anthropology of science to re-think and re-evaluate our mental landscape. He evaluated the work of scientists and contemplated the contribution of the scientific method to knowledge and work, blurring the distinction across various fields and disciplines. \n\nLatour argued that society has never really been modern and promoted nonmodernism (or amodernism) over postmodernism, modernism, or antimodernism. His stance was that we have never been modern and minor divisions alone separate Westerners now from other collectives. Latour viewed modernism as an era that believed it had annulled the entire past in its wake. He presented the antimodern reaction as defending such entities as spirit, rationality, liberty, society, God, or even the past. Postmoderns, according to Latour, also accepted the modernistic abstractions as if they were real. In contrast, the nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry between science and technology on the one hand and society on the other. Latour also referred to the impossibility of returning to premodernism because it precluded the large scale experimentation which was a benefit of modernism.\n\nLatour attempted to prove through case studies the fallacy in the old object/subject and Nature/Society compacts of modernity, which can be traced back to Plato. He refused the concept of \"out there\" versus \"in here\". He rendered the object/subject distinction as simply unusable and charted a new approach towards knowledge, work, and circulating reference. Latour considered nonmoderns to be playing on a different field, one vastly different than that of post-moderns. He referred to it as much broader and much less polemical, a creation of an unknown territory, which he playfully referred to as the Middle Kingdom.\n\nIn 1998, historian of science Margaret C. Jacob argued that Latour's politicized account of the development of modernism in the 17th century is \"a fanciful escape from modern Western history\".\n\n\"Pandora's Hope\" (1999) marks a return to the themes Latour explored in \"Science in Action\" and \"We Have Never Been Modern\". It uses independent but thematically linked essays and case studies to question the authority and reliability of scientific knowledge. Latour uses a narrative, anecdotal approach in a number of the essays, describing his work with pedologists in the Amazon rainforest, the development of the pasteurization process, and the research of French atomic scientists at the outbreak of the Second World War. Latour states that this specific, anecdotal approach to science studies is essential to gaining a full understanding of the discipline: \"The only way to understand the reality of science studies is to follow what science studies do best, that is, paying close attention to the details of scientific practice\" (p. 24). Some authors have criticized Latour's methodology, including Katherine Pandora, a history of science professor at the University of Oklahoma. In her review of \"Pandora's Hope\", Katherine Pandora states:\n\n\"[Latour's] writing can be stimulating, fresh and at times genuinely moving, but it can also display a distractingly mannered style in which a rococo zeal for compounding metaphors, examples, definitions and abstractions can frustrate even readers who approach his work with the best of intentions (notwithstanding the inclusion of a nine-page glossary of terms and liberal use of diagrams in an attempt to achieve the utmost clarity)\".\n\nIn addition to his epistemological concerns, Latour also explores the political dimension of science studies in \"Pandora's Hope\". Two of the chapters draw on Plato's \"Gorgias\" as a means of investigating and highlighting the distinction between content and context. As Katherine Pandora states in her review:\n\n\"It is hard not to be caught up in the author's obvious delight in deploying a classic work from antiquity to bring current concerns into sharper focus, following along as he manages to leave the reader with the impression that the protagonists Socrates and Callicles are not only in dialogue with each other but with Latour as well.\"\n\nAlthough Latour frames his discussion with a classical model, his examples of fraught political issues are all current and of continuing relevance: global warming, the spread of mad cow disease, and the carcinogenic effects of smoking are all mentioned at various points in \"Pandora's Hope\". In Felix Stalder's article \"Beyond constructivism: towards a realistic realism\", he summarizes Latour's position on the political dimension of science studies as follows: \"These scientific debates have been artificially kept open in order to render impossible any political action against these problems and those who profit from them\".\n\nIn a 2004 article, Latour questioned the fundamental premises on which he had based most of his career, asking, \"Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies?\" He undertakes a trenchant critique of his own field of study and, more generally, of social criticism in contemporary academia. He suggests that critique, as currently practiced, is bordering on irrelevancy. To maintain any vitality, Latour argues that social critiques require a drastic reappraisal: \"our critical equipment deserves as much critical scrutiny as the Pentagon budget.\" (p. 231) To regain focus and credibility, Latour argues that social critiques must embrace empiricism, to insist on the \"cultivation of a stubbornly realist attitude -- to speak like William James\". (p. 233)\n\nLatour suggests that about 90% of contemporary social criticism displays one of two approaches which he terms \"the fact position and the fairy position.\" (p. 237) The fairy position is anti-fetishist, arguing that \"objects of belief\" (e.g., religion, arts) are merely concepts created by the projected wishes and desires of the \"naive believer\"; the \"fact position\" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender). (p. 238) \"Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?” asks Latour: no matter which position you take, \"You’re always right!” (p. 238-239) Social critics tend to use anti-fetishism against ideas they personally reject; to use \"an unrepentant positivist\" approach for fields of study they consider valuable; all the while thinking as \"a perfectly healthy sturdy realist for what you really cherish.\" (p. 241) These inconsistencies and double standards go largely unrecognized in social critique because \"there is never any crossover between the two lists of objects in the fact position and the fairy position.\" (p. 241)\n\nThe practical result of these approaches being taught to millions of students in elite universities for several decades is a widespread and influential \"critical barbarity\" that has—like a malign virus created by a \"mad scientist\"—thus far proven impossible to control. Most troubling, Latour notes that critical ideas have been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including global warming skeptics and the 9/11 Truth movement: \"Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.\" (p. 230)\n\nThe conclusion of the article is to argue for a positive framing of critique, to help understand how matters of concern can be supported rather than undermined: \"The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by Goya, but the one for whom, if something is constructed, then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution.\"\n\nIn \"Reassembling the Social\" (2005), Latour continues a reappraisal of his work, developing what he calls a \"practical metaphysics\", which calls \"real\" anything that an actor (one whom we are studying) claims as a source of motivation for action. So if someone says, \"I was inspired by God to be charitable to my neighbors\" we are obliged to recognize the \"ontological weight\" of their claim, rather than attempting to replace their belief in God's presence with \"social stuff\", like class, gender, imperialism, etc. Latour’s nuanced metaphysics demands the existence of a plurality of worlds, and the willingness of the researcher to chart ever more. He argues that researchers must give up the hope of fitting their actors into a structure or framework, but Latour believes the benefits of this sacrifice far outweigh the downsides: \"Their complex metaphysics would at least be respected, their recalcitrance recognized, their objections deployed, their multiplicity accepted.\"\n\nFor Latour, to talk about metaphysics or ontology–what really is–means paying close empirical attention to the various, contradictory institutions and ideas that bring people together and inspire them to act. Here is Latour's description of metaphysics:\n\nIf we call metaphysics the discipline . . . that purports to define the basic structure of the world, then empirical metaphysics is what the controversies over agencies lead to since they ceaselessly populate the world with new drives and, as ceaselessly, contest the existence of others. The question then becomes how to explore the actors' own metaphysics.\n\nA more traditional metaphysicist might object, arguing that this means there are multiple, contradictory realities, since there are \"controversies over agencies\" – since there is a plurality of contradictory ideas that people claim as a basis for action (God, nature, the state, sexual drives, personal ambition, and so on). This objection manifests the most important difference between traditional philosophical metaphysics and Latour's nuance: for Latour, there is no \"basic structure of reality\" or a single, self-consistent world. An unknowably large multiplicity of realities, or \"worlds\" in his terms, exists–one for each actor’s sources of agency, inspirations for action. Actors bring \"the real\" (metaphysics) into being. The task of the researcher is not to find one \"basic structure\" that explains agency, but to recognize \"the metaphysical innovations proposed by ordinary actors\". Mapping those metaphysical innovations involves a strong dedication to relativism, Latour argues. The relativist researcher \"learns the actors' language,\" records what they say about what they do, and does not appeal to a higher \"structure\" to \"explain\" the actor's motivations. The relativist \"takes seriously what [actors] are obstinately saying\" and \"follows the direction indicated by their fingers when they designate what 'makes them act'\". The relativist recognizes the plurality of metaphysics that actors bring into being, and attempts to map them rather than reducing them to a single structure or explanation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Broad, was an English epistemologist, historian of philosophy, philosopher of science, moral philosopher, and writer on the philosophical aspects of psychical research. He was known for his thorough and dispassionate examinations of arguments in such works as \"Scientific Thought\", published in 1923, \"The Mind and Its Place in Nature\", published in 1925, and \"An Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy\", published in 1933.\n\nBroad's essay on \"Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism\" in \"Ethics and the History of Philosophy\" (1952) introduced the philosophical terms \"occurrent causation\" and \"non-occurrent causation\", which became the basis for today's \"agent causal\" and \"event causal\" distinctions in the debates on libertarian free will.\n\nBroad was born in Harlesden, in Middlesex, England. He was educated at Dulwich College from 1900 until 1906. He gained a scholarship to study at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1906. In 1910 he graduated with First-Class Honours, with distinction.\n\nIn 1911, he became a Fellow of Trinity College. This was a non-residential position, which enabled him to also accept a position he had applied for as an assistant lecturer at St Andrews University. He was later made a lecturer at St Andrews University, and remained there until 1920. He was appointed professor at Bristol University in 1920, and worked there until 1923, when he returned to Trinity College as a College lecturer. He was a lecturer in 'moral science' in the Faculty of philosophy at Cambridge University from 1926 until 1931. In 1931, he was appointed 'Sidgwick Lecturer' at Cambridge University. He kept this role until 1933, when he was appointed Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge University, a position he held for twenty years, until 1953.\n\nBroad was President of the Aristotelian Society from 1927 to 1928, and again from 1954 to 1955. He was also President of the Society for Psychical Research in 1935 and 1958.\n\nBroad was openly homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. In March 1958, Broad along with fellow philosophers A.J. Ayer and Bertrand Russell, writer J.B. Priestley and 27 others sent a letter to \"The Times\" which urged the acceptance of the \"Wolfenden Report's\" recommendation that homosexual acts should 'no longer be a criminal offence'.\n\nBroad argued that if research showed that psychic events occur, this would challenge philosophical theories of \"basic limiting principles\" in at least five ways:\n\n\nIn his essay \"Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism\", Broad argued for \"non-occurrent causation\" as \"literally determined by the agent or self.\" The agent could be considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a total cause which contains as factors events in and dispositions of the agent. Thus our efforts would be completely determined, but their causes would not be prior events.\n\nNew series of events would then originate which he called \"continuants.\" These are essentially \"causa sui\".\n\nPeter van Inwagen says that Broad formulated an excellent version of what van Inwagen has called the \"Consequence Argument\" in defense of incompatibilism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48539385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48539385", "title": "Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative", "text": "Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative\n\nDemocracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative is a 1998 book by philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger. In the book, Unger sets forth a program of \"democratic experimentalism\" that challenges and defies the neoliberal consensus that there are few alternatives for the progressive reform of democratic and market structures.\n\nIn \"Democracy Realized\", Unger describes the change in the locus of worldwide ideological conflict since the collapse of communism from the old conflict between statism and privatism, to the new ideological conflict about alternative forms of economic, social, and political organization. Unger notes the persistent difficulty in formulating credible alternatives to the neoliberal program in this setting. In the book, he presents a program for overcoming these difficulties through a practice he describes as “democratic experimentalism.”\n\nAt the heart of Unger’s productivist program is his explanation of the difference, in business firms, between vanguard production and rearguard production. He contends that the practices of vanguardist production, which include continuous education, a softened contrast between task-defining and task-executing activities, a culture of cooperation between vanguardist firms, and a practice of permanent experiment, already exist in relatively isolated segments of the economy that have greater links to each other, across national borders, than they do to the rearguard economies of their own countries. The vanguardist practices modeled by these firms and industries, Unger argues, are key to productive progress in the contemporary world, and should be extended beyond the productive vanguard to all areas of society, with the assistance of a government reconfigured along democratic experimentalist lines. Unger sets forth the changes he envisions in government, including mechanisms to break impasse between components of government, provisions to heighten political mobilization, expanded and democratized access to capital, a higher social savings rate, significant resources devoted to social endowment, and a central role to an emancipatory school that would train children, as little prophets, to become an informed, creative, and mobilized citizenry of the empowered democracy that Unger envisions.\n\nUnger concludes the book with a manifesto consisting of thirteen theses that sum up the principles of democratic experimentalism.\n\nAnthony Barnett, reviewing \"Democracy Realized\" in the \"Times Literary Supplement\", praised the book highly:\n\nA short, exceptionally sustained argument ... Here [Unger] is in top form, as he advocates the need for democracy. He is neither earnest nor predictable. ... Unger's arguments really are different from both sides of the familiar Lefts and Rights. His is an anti-Marxist, anti-Keynesian critique of neoliberalism ... In the course of it, he combines high theory with striking comparisons of Indian, American and Brazilian democracy.\n\nRuth Levitas, writing in the journal \"Critical Horizons\", considered \"Democracy Realized\" alongside Richard Rorty's book \"Achieving Our Country\". Levitas described \"Democracy Realized\" as a summary statement of Unger's hopes for a gradual move from the global \"status quo\" to a world that is more democratic and more economically just, through a process he describes as democratic experimentalism. Here Unger's arguments are pitched in terms of the institutional structures of society, and a process of change of those economic, social and political structures and processes through step-by-step improvisation and collective learning.\"\nLevitas concluded her review of Unger's work by stating that Unger's argument is marked by a \"cautious but deeply optimistic openness.\" Levitas suggests that although Unger \"reject[s] the terminology of utopia,\" he \"may actually be utopian in the best sense of the word.\"\n\nMichael Rustin, writing in the \"New Left Review\", noted that Unger's work first came to prominence before the collapse of Communist regimes around the world, and remarked that \"Democracy Realized\" shows \"how Unger's thought weathered the upheavals of the past decades...\" Unger, Rustin concludes, is \"defiantly committed to finding a radical alternative in the spirit of a new left ... As a global democratic movement against neoliberalism seems to be growing ... his moment as an inspirational social theorist may be about to arrive.\"\n\nFred Block reviewed \"Democracy Realized\" for \"Contemporary Sociology\". Block described \"Democracy Realized\" as \"Unger's effort to make his political vision accessible to readers who lack his erudition and theoretical sophistication.\" Block praised \"Democracy Realized\", writing, \nFor those who find current discussions of the \"Third Way\" lacking in both political and intellectual nourishment, Unger's book provides a veritable feast of ideas. His critiques of both social democracy and existing institutional arrangements are often eloquent and original, and the political program strikes the correct balance between radical aspirations and the imperatives of actual politics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57979", "title": "Disarmament", "text": "Disarmament\n\nDisarmament is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing weapons. Disarmament generally refers to a country's military or specific type of weaponry. Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear arms. General and Complete Disarmament was defined by the United Nations General Assembly as the elimination of all WMD, coupled with the “balanced reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, based on the principle of undiminished security of the parties with a view to promoting or enhancing stability at a lower military level, taking into account the need of all States to protect their security.”\n\nBefore World War I at the Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907 government delegations debated about disarmament and the creation of an international court with binding powers. The court was considered necessary because it was understood that nation-states could not disarm into a vacuum. After the war revulsion at the futility and tremendous cost of the war was widespread. A commonly held belief was that the cause of the war had been the escalating buildup of armaments in the previous half century among the great powers (see Anglo-German naval arms race). Although the Treaty of Versailles effectively disarmed Germany, a clause was inserted that called on all the great powers to likewise progressively disarm over a period of time. The newly formed League of Nations made this an explicit goal in the covenant of the league, which committed its signatories to reduce armaments ‘to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations’.\n\nOne of the earliest successful achievements in disarmament was obtained with the Washington Naval Treaty. Signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, it prevented the continued construction of capital ships and limited ships of other classification to under 10,000 tons displacement. The size of the three country's navies (the Royal Navy, United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy) was set at the ratio 5-5-3.\n\nIn 1921 the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments was set up by the League of Nations to explore possibilities for disarmament. Proposals ranged from abolishing chemical warfare and strategic bombing to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks. A draft treaty was assembled in 1923 that made aggressive war illegal and bound the member states to defend victims of aggression by force. Since the onus of responsibility would, in practice, be on the great powers of the League, it was vetoed by the British, who feared that this pledge would strain its own commitment to police the empire.\nA further commission in 1926, set up to explore the possibilities for the reduction of army size, met similar difficulties, prompting the French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand and US Secretary of State Frank Kellogg to draft a treaty known as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which denounced war of aggression. Although there were 65 signatories to the pact, it achieved nothing, as it set out no guidelines for action in the event of a war.\n\nA final attempt was made at the Geneva Disarmament Conference from 1932–37, chaired by former British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson. Germany demanded the revision of the Versailles Treaty and the granting of military parity with the other powers, while France was determined to keep Germany demilitarised for its own security. Meanwhile, the British and Americans were not willing to offer France security commitments in exchange for conciliation with Germany. The talks broke down in 1933, when Adolf Hitler withdrew Germany from the conference.\n\nNuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament held an inaugural public meeting at Central Hall, Westminster, on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at Downing Street.\n\nCND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention. The first Aldermaston March was organised by the CND and took place at Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.\n\nIn 1961, US President John F. Kennedy gave a speech before the UN General Assembly where he announced the US \"intention to challenge the Soviet Union, not to an arms race, but to a peace race - to advance together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been achieved.\" He went on to call for a global general and complete disarmament, offering a rough outline for how this could be accomplished:\n\nMajor nuclear disarmament groups include Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Greenpeace and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. There have been many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history.\n\n\n\nIn his definition of \"disarmament\", David Carlton writes in the Oxford University Press Political dictionary, \"But confidence in such measures of arms control, especially when unaccompanied by extensive means of verification, has not been strengthened by the revelation that the Soviet Union in its last years successfully concealed consistent and systematic cheating on its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention.\" He also notes, \"Now a freeze or a mutually agreed increase is not strictly speaking disarmament at all. And such measures may not even be intended to be a first step towards any kind of reduction or abolition. For the aim may simply be to promote stability in force structures. Hence a new term to cover such cases has become fashionable since the 1960s, namely, arms control.\"\n\nThe book by Seymour Melman, \"Inspection for Disarmament\", addresses various problems related to the problem of inspection for disarmament, evasion teams, and capabilities and limitations of aerial inspection. Gradually, as the idea of arms control displaced the idea of disarmament, the weaknesses of the present arms control paradigm have created problems for the idea of disarmament itself. \n\nSpecific references:\n\nGeneral references:\n\n\n"}

Long before most educators, Peabody embraced the premise that children's play has intrinsic developmental and educational value.\n\nPeabody also served as the translator for the first English version of a Buddhist scripture which was published in 1844.\n\nPeabody was born in Billerica, Massachusetts on May 16, 1804. She was the daughter of Nathaniel Peabody, a physician, and Elizabeth (\"Eliza\") Palmer (1778-1853), and spent her early years in Salem.\n\nAfter 1822, she resided principally in Boston where she engaged in teaching. She also became a writer and a prominent figure in the Transcendental movement. During 1834–1835, she worked as assistant teacher to Amos Bronson Alcott at his experimental Temple School in Boston. After the school closed, Peabody published \"Record of a School\", outlining the plan of the school and Alcott's philosophy of early childhood education, which had drawn on German models.\n\nShe later opened a book store, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody's West Street Bookstore, at her home in Boston (ca.1840-1852).\n\nIt was there that the \"Conversations\" were held, organized by Margaret Fuller. The first of these meetings between women was held on November 6, 1839. Topics for these discussions and debates varied but subjects were as diverse as fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature. Fuller served as the \"nucleus of conversation\" and hoped to answer the \"great questions\" facing women: \"What were we born to do? How shall we do it? which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by\". Many figures in the woman's rights movement took part, including Sophia Dana Ripley, Caroline Sturgis, and Maria White Lowell.\n\nThe 1840 \"Catalogue of the Foreign Library\" offered several hundred titles in German, French, Spanish, Italian and English languages, including:\n\n\nIn 1852, the bookstore and library located at 13-15 West Street in Boston closed down. Members of the Transcendentalist movement had begun to disperse since the mid-1840s and income from the bookstore had gradually declined. In 2011, the Boston Landmarks Commission designated the building as a Boston Landmark.\n\nFor a time, Peabody was the business manager of \"The Dial\", the main publication of the Transcendentalists. In 1843, she noted that the journal's income was not covering the cost of printing and that subscriptions totaled just over two hundred. In 1844 the magazine published Peabody's translation of a portion of the Lotus Sutra from French, which was the first English version of a Buddhist scripture. The publication ceased shortly thereafter in April 1844.\n\nWhen Peabody opened her kindergarten in 1860, the practice of providing formal schooling for children younger than six was largely confined to Germany. She had a particular interest in the educational methods of Friedrich Fröbel, particularly after meeting one of his students living in the U.S. 1859 named Margarethe Schurz. In 1867, she visited Germany for the purpose of studying Fröbel's teachings more closely. Through her own kindergarten, and as editor of the \"Kindergarten Messenger\" (1873–1877), Peabody helped establish kindergarten as an accepted institution in American education. She also wrote numerous books in support of the cause. The extent of her influence is apparent in a statement submitted to Congress on February 12, 1897, in support of free kindergartens:\n\nWith grounding in history and literature and a reading knowledge of ten languages, in 1840 she also opened a bookstore which held Margaret Fuller's \"Conversations\" and published books from Nathaniel Hawthorne and others in addition to the periodicals \"The Dial\" and \"Æsthetic Papers\". She was an advocate of antislavery and of Transcendentalism. Moreover, she also led decades of efforts for the rights of the Paiute Indians.\n\nHer sisters were painter Sophia Peabody Hawthorne (wife of writer Nathaniel Hawthorne) and writer Mary Tyler Peabody Mann (wife of educator Horace Mann). Peabody died January 3, 1894, aged 89. She is buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts.\n\nPeabody published a number of works, including:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31154724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31154724", "title": "Eugen Relgis", "text": "Eugen Relgis\n\nEugen D. Relgis (backward reading of Eisig D. Sigler; first name also Eugenio, Eugène or Eugene, last name also Siegler or Siegler Watchel; (22 March 1895 – 24 May 1987) was a Romanian writer, pacifist philosopher and anarchist militant, known as a theorist of humanitarianism. His internationalist dogma, with distinct echoes from Judaism and Jewish ethics, was first shaped during World War I, when Relgis was a conscientious objector. Infused with anarcho-pacifism and socialism, it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as Romain Rolland, Stefan Zweig and Albert Einstein. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for eugenics, which centered on the compulsory sterilization of \"degenerates\". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and sociological tracts.\n\nAfter an early debut with Romania's Symbolist movement, Relgis promoted modernist literature and the poetry of Tudor Arghezi, signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of Expressionism and didactic art, giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a hearing impairment. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as \"Sburătorul\", \"Contimporanul\" or \"Șantier\", but also close to the more mainstream journal \"Viața Românească\". His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both fascism and communism: persecuted during World War II, he eventually took refuge in Uruguay. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of South American circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to world peace, as well as a promoter of Latin American culture.\n\nThe future Eugen Relgis was a native of Moldavia region, belonging to the local Jewish community. His father, David Sigler, professed Judaism, and descended from tanners settled in Neamț County. Eisig had two sisters, Adelina Derevici and Eugenia Soru, both of whom had careers in biochemistry. Born in either Iași city of Piatra Neamț town, Eisig was educated in Piatra Neamț, where he became friends with the family of novelist and Zionist leader A. L. Zissu. It was in Zissu's circle that Relgis probably first met his mentor, the Romanian modernist author Tudor Arghezi; at the time, Arghezi was married to Constanța Zissu, mother of his photographer son Eli Lotar. The young writer later noted that he and Zissu were both touched by the wild landscape of the Ceahlău Massif and Piatra's \"shtetl\" atmosphere. In another one of his texts, Relgis recalled having been influenced in childhood by selective readings from the Romanian Jewish scholar Moses Schwarzfeld and his \"Anuarul pentru Israeliți\" journal (he told that, during later years, he had collected the entire \"Anuarul\" collection).\n\nTaking his first steps in literary life, Eisig Sigler adopted his new name through forms of wordplay which enjoyed some popularity among pseudonymous Jewish writers (the case of Paul Celan, born \"Ancel\"). He was from early on a promoter of Symbolist and modernist literature, a cause into which he blended his left-wing perspective and calls for Jewish emancipation. Writing in 2007, literary historian Paul Cernat suggested that Relgis, like fellow humanitarianist and Jewish intellectual Isac Ludo, had a \"not at all negligible\" part to play in the early diffusion of Romanian modernism. Relgis' main contribution in the 1910s was the Symbolist tribune \"Fronda\" (\"The Fronde\"), the three consecutive issues of which he edited, in Iași, between April and June 1912.\n\nLike Ludo's review \"Absolutio\" (which saw print two years later), \"Fronda\" stood for the radical branch of the Romanian Symbolist movement in Iași, in contrast to both the left-leaning but traditionalist magazine \"Viața Românească\" and the more conventional Symbolism of \"Versuri și Proză\" journal. Its editorial board, Relgis included, went anonymous, but their names were known to other periodicals of the day and to later researchers. According to Cernat, Relgis was \"the most significant \"Frondiste\"\", seconded by two future figures in Romanian Jewish journalism: Albert Schreiber and Carol Steinberg. Like Ludo and poet Benjamin Fondane, the \"Fronda\" group represented those Romanian Jewish aficionados in Iași who followed the Symbolist-modernist school of Arghezi, and who promoted Arghezi's poetry in northern Romania: \"Fronda\"s writers were noted for saluting \"Viața Românească\" when it too began hosting poems by Arghezi.\n\n\"Fronda\" put out three issues in all, after which time Relgis became an occasional contributor to more circulated periodicals, among them \"Rampa\" (founded by Arghezi and the socialist agitator N. D. Cocea) and \"Vieața Nouă\" (led by Symbolist critic Ovid Densusianu). In 1913, he collected his loose philosophical essays, or \"fantasies\", in the volume \"Triumful neființei\" (\"The Triumph of Non-Being\"). He published his first two books of poems during World War I, but before the end of Romania's neutrality period. The first one was a collection of sonnets, \"Sonetele nebuniei\" (\"Sonnets of Madness\"), printed at Iași in 1914; the second was published in the capital, Bucharest, as \"Nebunia\" (\"Madness\"). Some of these poems were illustrated with drawings in Relgis' own hand.\n\nAfter training in architecture, Relgis was enrolled at the University of Bucharest, where he took courses in Philosophy. During the period, he first left Romania on a trip to the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Greece. He interrupted his studies shortly after Romania entered the war, in the second half of 1916. Back in Iași after the Central Powers stormed into southern Romania, he was reportedly drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, but refused to take up arms as a conscientious objector; briefly imprisoned as a result, he was in the end discharged for his deafness.\n\nResuming his publishing activity upon the end of war, Eugen Relgis began publicizing his humanitarianist and pacifist agenda. In summer 1918, Relgis became one of the contributors to the Iași-based review \"Umanitatea\" (\"The Humanity\" or \"The Human Race\"). Historian Lucian Boia, who notes that \"Umanitatea\" was published when Romania's temporary defeat seemed to announce sweeping political reforms, believes that the magazine mainly reflected the \"nebulous\" agenda of a senior editor, the Bessarabian journalist Alexis Nour. In addition to Relgis and Nour, \"Umanitatea\" enlisted contributions from Ludo and Avram Steuerman-Rodion. The short-lived magazine, Boia writes, supported land reform, labor rights and, unusually in the context of \"pronounced Romanian antisemitism\", Jewish emancipation. On his own, Relgis published a magazine of the same title, issued during 1920. According to one account, \"Umanitatea\" was closed down by Romania's military censorship, which kept a check on radical publications. In 1921, an unsigned chronicle in the Cluj-based \"Gândirea\" journal recognized in Relgis \"the kind and enthusiastic young man who was propagating [...] the religion of man through \"Umanitatea\" magazine\".\n\nRelgis resumed his literary activity early in the interwar period. He authored his ideological essay \"Literatura războiului și era nouă\" (Bucharest, 1919); another such piece, \"Umanitarism sau Internaționala intelectualilor\" (\"Humanitarianism or the Intellectuals' Internationale\"), taken up by \"Viața Românească\" in 1922. \"Viața Românească\" also published Relgis' abridged translation of \"The Biology of War\", a pacifist treatise by German physician Georg Friedrich Nicolai. 1922 witnessed the birth of Relgis' manifesto \"Principiile umanitariste\" (\"Humanitarianist Principles\"), which offered Relgis' own conclusions on world peace, while reaffirming the need to create an international pacifist forum of intellectuals. It carried a preface by Nicolai.\n\nRelgis also set up the First Humanitarianist Group of Romania, as well as a leftist library, \"Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea\" (\"Freedom Circle Library\"). Joined in such efforts by the veteran anarchists Han Ryner and Panait Mușoiu, Relgis also circulated an \"Apel către toți intelectualii liberi și muncitorii luminați\" (\"Appeal to All the Free Intellectuals and the Enlightened Workers\"). Before 1932, the Humanitarianist Group created some 23 regional branches in Greater Romania. Beginning 1925, Relgis also represented Romanian pacifists within the War Resisters' International.\n\nIn the meantime, he continued to publish sporadic poems, such as \"Ascetism\" (\"Asceticism\"), featured in \"Gândirea\". The year 1923 witnessed the beginnings of a friendship between Relgis and the aspiring pacifist author George Mihail Zamfirescu. Relgis prefaced Zamfirescu's book \"Flamura albă\" (\"The White Flag\"), and contributed to Zamfirescu's magazine \"Icoane Maramureșene\" (\"Maramureș Icons\"). A prose volume, \"Peregrinări\" (\"Wanderings\"), saw print with Editura Socec the same year. Relgis also published, in 1924, the 3 volumes of his main novel \"Petru Arbore\" (a \"Bildungsroman\" named after its main protagonist). Two new volumes of his topical essays saw print in later years: the first one, published by the printing offices of fellow journalist Barbu Brănișteanu, was \"Umanitarism și socialism\" (\"Humanitarianism and Socialism\", 1925); the second, printed in 1926, was titled \"Umanitarismul biblic\" (\"Humanitarianism in the Bible\"). His press activity included contributions to Zionist papers: a writer for \"Știri din Lumea Evreiască\", he was also briefly on the staff of Zissu's \"Mântuirea\".\n\nAlso during the early 1920s, Eugen Relgis came into contact with the Bucharest-based \"Sburătorul\" circle, which stood for modernist literature and aesthetic relativism. The eponymous magazine published samples of his lyrical poetry. With his humanitarian literature, Relgis was a singular figure among the many \"Sburătorul\" factions, as later noted by literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu in discussing the studied eclecticism of \"Sburătorul\" doyen Eugen Lovinescu. Another Romanian researcher, Henri Zalis, notes that Relgis was one of the many Jewish intellectuals whom Lovinescu cultivated in reaction to the tradition of ethno-nationalist discrimination. However, according to critic Eugen Simion, Lovinescu also greatly exaggerated Relgis' literary worth.\n\nRelgis' contribution to Romanian literature was renewed in 1926, when he published \"Melodiile tăcerii\" (\"Melodies of Silence\") and the collection \"Poezii\" (\"Poems\"), followed in 1927 by \"Glasuri în surdină\" (\"Muted Voices\"). The latter novel, later republished with a foreword by Austrian author Stefan Zweig, chronicled Relgis' own difficulties with his post-lingual deafness.\n\nAt that stage in his career, Eugen Relgis was also a contributor to the Bucharest left-wing dailies \"Adevărul\" and \"Dimineața\", part of a new generation of radical or pacifist authors cultivated by the newspaper (alongside Zamfirescu, Ion Marin Sadoveanu and various others). His pieces for \"Adevărul\" include insights into medical sociology, such as the September 1922 \"Înapoi, la biologie!\" (\"Back to Biology!\"). The \"Adevărul\" publishing house issued his 1925 translation of Knut Hamsun's story \"Slaves of Love\". At around the same time, the Căminul Library, publishers of popular education books, issued Relgis' translation from \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", the classic novel of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It endured as one of two Romanian-language versions of Nietzsche's main works to be published before the 1970s, together with George B. Rateș's \"The Antichrist\". Relgis' work as a translator also included versions of writings by Zweig, Émile Armand, Selma Lagerlöf, Emil Ludwig and Jakob Wassermann.\n\nAfter editing the short-lived gazette \"Cugetul Liber\" (\"Freethought\"), Eugen Relgis put out the political and cultural review \"Umanitarismul\" (\"Humanitarianism\"). It enlisted contributions from the Romanian writers Ion Barbu, Alexandru Al. Philippide and Ion Vinea, and was positively reviewed by other cultural figures (Tudor Arghezi, Enric Furtună, Meyer Abraham Halevy, Perpessicius). He published his work in a variety of periodicals, from Vinea's modernist mouthpiece \"Contimporanul\", Ludo's \"Adam\" review and the Zionist \"Cuvântul Nostru\" to the Romanian traditionalist journal \"Cuget Clar\". With his publishing house Editura Umanitatea, Relgis also contributed a 1929 book of interviews, based on texts previously featured in \"Umanitarismul\": \"Anchetă asupra internaționalei pacifiste\" (\"An Inquiry about the Pacifist International\"). The same year, Relgis lectured at the Zionist Avodah circle about the opportunities of Jewish return to the Land of Israel.\n\nThe Romanian writer traveled extensively to promote his ideas of social change. By 1928, he was in regular correspondence with French writer and human rights activist Romain Rolland, who answered in writing to Relgis' various inquiries. He was a delegate to pacifist reunions in Hoddesdon, England and Sonntagberg, Austria (1928). Relgis also exchanged letters with various other prestigious left-wing intellectuals: Zweig, Upton Sinclair, Henri Barbusse, Max Nettlau etc. His various inquiries also enlisted positive replies from other international supporters of pacifism: physicist Albert Einstein, biologist Auguste Forel, writer Heinrich Mann and anarchist militant Paul Reclus. He became a contributor to Sebastien Faure's \"Anarchist Encyclopedia\", with the \"Humanitarianism\" entry. In 1929, Delpeuch company published his French-language essay \"L'Internationale pacifiste\" (\"The Pacifist International\"), reissued the same year in Valencia, Spain, as \"La Internacional Pacifista\".\n\nAround 1930, Relgis was in Paris, where he met with Han Ryner, and in Berlin, where he conversed with his mentor Nicolai. In its new translated editions, \"Apel către...\" was signed by a number of leading pacifist intellectuals of various persuasions, among them Zweig, Sinclair, Barbusse, Campio Carpio, Manuel Devaldès, Philéas Lebesgue, Rabindranath Tagore. While in France, where his work was notably popularized by \"L'EnDehors\" magazine and Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers's \"Bibliothèque de l'Artistocratie\" book collection, he was for a while close to Barbusse's \"Clarté\" circle, but left it after discovering its communist militancy and Soviet connections. His Intellectuals' Internationale therefore took distance from both the Comintern and the International Working Union of Socialist Parties.\n\nIn 1932, he published the German-language collection of interviews \"Wege zum Friede\" (\"Path toward Peace\"). His other travels into Bulgaria, where he represented Romanian vegetarians at an international congress, were discussed in his 1933 volume \"Bulgaria necunoscută\" (\"Unknown Bulgaria\"). The volume \"Cosmometápolis\", about the creation of a world government, was first published in Bucharest by Cultura Poporului imprint, and reissued in Paris by Mignolet et Storz.\n\nRelgis' participation in left-wing causes was attacked at home by the antisemitic and proto-fascist National Christian Defense League, whose press organ \"Înfrățirea Românească\" alleged that \"squire Siegler\" and his \"Umanitarismul\", together with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, were fostering communist agitation. After the 1933 establishment of a Nazi regime in Germany, Relgis' books of interviews became subject to ceremonial burnings.\n\nBy that moment in his career, Relgis became a contributor to \"Vremea\" newspaper and to Ion Pas' political and art magazine, \"Șantier\". The latter periodical was close to the Romanian Social Democratic Party, and had a strongly anti-fascist agenda. It published, in 1932, the Relgis essay \"Europa cea tânără\" (\"Young Europe\"), which talked about civilization, imperialism and war. Relgis' contributions to \"Șantier\" also include a January 12, 1934 essay about \"anonymous works\" and their impact on art history, which was later quoted in \"Viața Românească\". The same year, Relgis published the novel \"Prieteniile lui Miron\" (\"Miron's Friendships\") with Editura Cugetarea.\n\nIn his subsequent activity as a journalist and publisher, Relgis combined his humanitarianism with topical interests. He was by then an advocate of eugenics, an interest reflected in his 1934 (or 1935) tract \"Umanitarism și eugenism\" (\"Humanitarianism and Eugenism\"), published by Editura Vegetarianismul company. In 1936, he also released the collection \"Esseuri despre iudaism\" (\"Essays on Judaism\") with Cultura Poporului. He was at the time active within the Jewish Cultural Institute, an annex of the Bucharest Choral Temple. His international activity peaked during the Spanish Civil War, when he helped organize anarchist support for the Spanish Republican regime, elected Councilor of the International Antifascist Solidarity.\n\nEugen Relgis was still active on the literary scene during the first two years of World War II, before Romania formalized its military alliance with the Axis Powers. The Phoney War caught him in France, but he returned to Romania shortly after, exposing himself to persecution by the growing Romanian fascist movements. In February 1940, he gave a retrospective lecture, republished by the newspaper \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\", on the work of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Another book of his political prose, \"Spiritul activ\" (\"The Active Spirit\"), saw print the same year.\n\nThe emergence of antisemitic and fascist regimes (\"see Romania in World War II, Holocaust in Romania\") signified the beginning of Relgis' marginalization. During the short-lived National Legionary State, established by the Iron Guard fascists between 1940 and early 1941, the author lived in seclusion. His \"Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea\" was banned in 1940, but Relgis secretly moved the books into a stable. After the Guard fell from power, the Ion Antonescu dictatorship still included Relgis on a nationally circulated list of banned Romanian Jewish authors, but Relgis continued to write. His texts of the time include a posthumous praise of his pacifist disciple Iosif Gutman, the son of a Bucharest rabbi, who had been killed during the Bucharest pogrom. The essay was planned as part of Rabbi Gutman's volume \"Slove de martiri\" (\"Notes by Martyrs\"), which, although anti-Guard, was not given Antonescu's imprimatur. Relgis was however able to publish an article in the Jewish-only magazine \"Renașterea Noastră\", on the occasion of Iosif's \"yahrtzeit\", where he compared the Gutmans to Laocoön and His Sons. Relgis' own son fled Romania in 1942, and settled in Argentina.\n\nA final period in Relgis' Romanian activity came after the August 1944 Coup toppled Antonescu and denounced Romania's Axis alliance. In 1945, he was dedicated a public celebration at the Jewish Cultural Institute, which included a speech by Chief Rabbi Alexandru Șafran. \"Slove de martiri\" was eventually published that year, and a revised Romanian edition of \"Petru Arbore\" saw print in 1946. Also then, he completed work on an essay about Nazism, The Holocaust and sexuality: \"Eros în al treilea Reich\" (\"Eros in the Third Reich\"). Relgis was again active in the political press, lending his signature to several independent newspapers: Sebastian Șerbescu's \"Semnalul\", Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște's \"Jurnalul de Dimineață\" etc. He described himself as diametrically opposed to the process of communization, as well as to the Soviet occupation of Romania.\n\nWith refugee status, having reportedly been singled out for arrest by the Romanian Communist Party officials, Relgis departed from Romania in 1947, shortly before the communist regime took hold. After a brief stay in Paris, he spent some time in Argentina, with his son and his female companion Ana Taubes. He later went to Montevideo, in Uruguay, where he lived the remainder of his life. At home, his works were included in an official \"Publicații interzise\" (\"Works Forbidden from Publishing\") list, published by the communist censorship apparatus.\n\nDuring his last decades, Eugen Relgis dedicated himself to sociological research and political activism. He embarked on a series of university lectures, which carried him throughout Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. In 1950, he founded an international anarchist archive in Montevideo, reportedly one of the few political libraries in South America at the time of its creation. The effort was supported by the exiled Spanish anarchist Abraham Guillén, and received documentary funds from Europe, but reputedly drew suspicion from Uruguay police forces, and was consequently shut down.\n\nWith noted help from anarchist translator Vladimiro Muñoz, Relgis began his new career as a Spanish-language writer and publicist with a succession of works. \"Umanitarism și eugenism\" was translated into a Spanish edition: \"Humanitarismo y eugenismo\", Ediciones Universo, Toulouse, 1950. The same imprint released his essay \"Las aberraciones sexuales en la Alemania nazi\" (\"Sexual Aberrations in Nazi Germany\"), which discussed in some depth the characteristics of Nazi eugenics. Also in 1950, with his Montevideo printing office Ediciones Humanidad, Relgis released a Spanish edition of his \"Principiile\", a version of Max Nettlau's \"World Peace\" volume, as well as reissuing \"Cosmometápolis\". Two years later, Ediciones Humanidad published Relgis' biographical essay \"Stefan Zweig, cazador de almas\" (\"Stefan Zweig, the Soul Hunter\"), followed in 1953 by a Hachette version of \"De mis peregrinaciones europeas\" (\"From My Wanderings in Europe\"). Relgis also tried to get his contributions translated into Portuguese, asking anarchist philosopher José Oiticica for assistance. He was at the time employed by \"El Plata\" daily, editing its Wednesday literary page, and helping to discover, in 1954, the twelve-year-old poet Teresa Porzecanski.\n\nIn 1954, Relgis printed another biographical study, on Romain Rolland: \"El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria\" (\"A Free Man Confronts Totalitarian Barbarity\"). The following year, he gave a public lecture at the University of the Republic, titled \"A Writer's Confession\", and reissued \"Esseuri despre iudaism\" as \"Profetas y poetas. Valores permanentes y temporarios del judaísmo\" (\"Prophets and Poets. The Permanent and Timely Values of Judaism\"). A Spanish version of \"Umanitarism sau Internaționala intelectualilor\" was published, as \"El Humanitarismo\", by Editorial Americalee in Buenos Aires (1956). One edition of the latter was prefaced by Nicolai, who was at the time living in Argentina. In November 1956, the same company issued Relgis' \"Diario de otoño\" (\"Autumn Diary\"), a collection of notes he had kept during the war years. Another tract, \"Albores de libertad\" (\"Dawns of Freedom\"), was prefaced by Rudolf Rocker, the anarcho-syndicalist thinker.\n\nIn 1958, the University of the Republic published Eugen Relgis' acclaimed political essay \"Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica\" (\"Cultural Perspectives in South America\"), for which he received a prize from the Uruguayan Ministry of Public Instruction and Social Prevision. Relgis' reputation was consolidated in the intellectual circles and, in 1955, his name was unsuccessfully advanced for the Nobel Peace Prize. The same year, a volume of his collected Spanish texts and studies on his work was published in Montevideo, as \"Homenaje a Eugen Relgis en su 60º aniversario\" (\"Homage to Eugen Relgis on His 60th Anniversary\").\n\nRelgis returned to poetry in 1960 and 1961, with the volumes \"En un lugar de los Andes\" (\"Some Place in the Andes\") and \"Locura\" (\"Madness\"), both translated by Pablo R. Troise. They were followed by two other booklets, also in Troise's translation: \"Corazones y motores\" (\"Hearts and Engines\", 1963), \"Últimos poemas\" (\"The Last Poems\", 1967). His complete \"Obras\" (\"Works\") were published over the next decades, while the essay \"¿Qué es el humanitarismo? Principios y acción\" (\"What Is Humanitarianism? Principles and Action\") went through several successive editions and featured a prologue by Albert Einstein. Another one of Relgis' Spanish-language volumes, \"Testigo de mi tiempo\" (\"A Witness of My Time\"), with more essays on Judaism, came in 1961. His leading eugenics and sexology treatise, \"Historia sexual de la Humanidad\" (\"The Sexual History of Humanity\"), was also published in 1961 (Libro-Mex Editores, Mexico City), and, in 1965, his biography of Nicolai saw print in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1962, Eugen Relgis visited Israel and Jerusalem, tightening his links with the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David Șafran. It was in Israel that Relgis published another volume of memoirs, in his native Romanian language: \"Mărturii de ieri și de azi\" (\"Testimonies of Yesterday and Today\"). In 1972, he was made an honorary staff member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nFrom the early 1960s, Relgis was in correspondence with figures in the Italian radical circles, such as the anarchist Gaspare Mancuso. In 1964, Mancuso and Regis' other Italian disciples founded the political journal \"Quaderini degli amici di Eugen Relgis\" (\"The Friends of Eugen Relgis Notebooks\"). He also became an occasional contributor to \"Mujeres Libres\", the Spanish anarcha-feminist tribune in the United Kingdom. During the 1960s and '70s, as a spell of liberalization occurred in Nicolae Ceaușescu's Romania, Relgis was again in contact with Romanian intellectuals. Before the massive earthquake of 1977 devastated Bucharest, he was in regular correspondence with scholar Mircea Handoca.\n\nEugen Relgis lived the final decade of his life as a pensioner of the Uruguayan state—in 1985, a law raised his \"pensión graciable\" to 20,000 new pesos a month. In the 1980s, Relgis was exchanging letters with Romanian cultural historian Leon Volovici, and entertained thoughts about a recovery of his work by Romanian critics and historians. He died before this could happen, in Montevideo, at age 92.\n\nThroughout his career, Relgis was the proponent of anarchism. The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of \"state fetishism\", seeking to overturn it and create \"universal fraternity\", and, in \"Diario de otoño\", postulated a necessary distinction between Law (\"which may be interpreted for or against\") and Justice (\"elementary\" and unavoidable). Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled \"the three idols: State, Property, Money.\" Political philosopher Ángel Cappelletti argues: \"Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to libertarian ideas\".\n\nAccording to Stefan Zweig, Relgis fought \"tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity.\" The sentiment was echoed by Romain Rolland, who recognized in Relgis his disciple: \"There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and universalist idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being.\" Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian George Călinescu observed Relgis' anti-establishment and anti-artistic rhetoric, but described it as mere \"idealist reverie\", \"without any daring proposals that would threaten our self-preservation instincts\". Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as \"an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems\", \"a practical and not a utopian thinker\", and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved.\n\nRelgis' humanitarianism (also known as humanism or pan-humanism; ) was a practical extension of anarcho-pacifism. William Rose describes this doctrine as both \"universalist and pacifist\", noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things \"which separate man from man and cause wars\". Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of \"active thought\", and \"a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities\", while expressing admiration for the nonviolent resistance tactics advocated in British India by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or Rabindranath Tagore. At the time, he attacked all forms of pan-nationalism, from Pan-Germanism to Pan-European nationalism, defining pan-humanism as \"the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species\". In \"El humanitarismo\", he called all internationalist movements, except his own, corrupted by \"the practice of violence and intolerance\".\n\nWriting in 1933, the leftist literary columnist Ion Clopoțel stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with \"a lively, dynamic and innovating socialism\". Although left-wing, Relgis' vision also incorporated militant anti-communism. As noted by literary historian Geo Șerban, he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of \"social revolutions\" and Bolshevik insurgency. In the first issue of \"Umanitarianismul\", Relgis criticized both the far right and the far left, noting that his ideology was \"apolitical, in fact antipolitical\". In \"Europa cea tânără\", he referred to the Soviet Union as the home of \"proletarian imperialism\". These thoughts were detailed by \"Diario de otoño\", which drew a direct comparison between the Red Army, pushing Romania into an \"armed peace\", and the Wehrmacht.\n\nBeginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of Zionism, convinced that the path of Jewish assimilation was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents. He also adhered to philosopher Martin Buber's ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by diaspora Jews: universalism, Zionism and Conservative Judaism. In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the Land of Israel, and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the Palestine Arabs. In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, \"being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist.\" However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow \"the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism.\" The writer also described himself as committed to Romanian culture, and, as late as 1981, noted that Romanian was still his language of choice.\n\nHis essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David) speak about the threat of societal collapse, which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after World War I. His theory on \"dehumanization\" postulated: \"the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms.\" As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose monotheism and Messianism he decoded the basic representation of moral responsibility, and the immediate precursors of Christianity. The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of Jewish ethics which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the Bible as \"that most humane book\", and identifying himself with the lament of Malachi 2:10 (\"Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?\"). He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive \"the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith\", with creating \"new values from the old ones\". Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: \"Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe.\"\n\nIn tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where bigotry, and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric. He reserved special criticism for the notions of a \"vengeful God\" and \"Jewish chosenness\", arguing that they are \"primitive\", and expressed more sympathy for Buddhist universalism. His texts, including the 1922 \"Apel către...\", are thought by some to be purposefully reusing the pro-universalist vocabulary of Freemasons.\n\nRelgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet Moses, in whom he sees the symbol of \"great human aspirations\". Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from Baruch Spinoza to Charles Darwin), others talk about secular Jewish culture, and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, Edmond Fleg, Theodor Herzl. As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the modern art of Marcel Janco, Lazăr Zin or Reuven Rubin, and in the literature of Zweig, S. Ansky, Mendele Mocher Sforim and even Marcel Proust. Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from A. L. Zissu and Iosif Brucǎr to Avram Steuerman-Rodion and Enric Furtună. According to Geo Șerban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting \"a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world.\"\n\nA critic of antisemitism, Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of anti-fascism. Early on, he exposed claims about Judeo-Masonic domination as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture. He wrote: \"I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a phobia, that is to say an obsession. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world—and all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession.\"\n\nWriting in 1946, shortly after the scale of The Holocaust became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that Nazis fabricated human soap. Historian of ideas Andrei Oișteanu analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.\n\nAfter his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on Latin America as a \"neohumanist\" continent. Earlier, in \"Europa cea tânără\", Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its \"pathetic history\" of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of Eastern philosophy and United States models of industrialization. Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's \"spiritual renunciations\" were mirrored by a \"cancer of machinism\" in North America.\n\nWith \"Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica\", he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a Latin American culture was still ahead. Relgis identified this as a merit, describing South America in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a \"healthier\" example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the Cold War era. Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: \"the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world.\" Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and \"utilitarian mentality\", while fighting the \"false moral\" of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism. Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist José Enrique Rodó.\n\nRelgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was Argentine poet and historian Arturo Capdevila, who wrote about Relgis as a \"meritorious\" visionary with a \"grave and vital message\", assuring him: \"You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied.\" Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included Socialist Party leader Emilio Frugoni, Colorado Party politician Amílcar Vasconcellos, Zionist academic Joel Gak and poet Carlos Sabat Ercasty. While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of Antigone, Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with \"the constricting reality\". Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agustín Courtoisie calls Relgis \"eccentric and genial\", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in Jorge Luis Borges' fantasy literature.\n\nLike other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of \"social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement.\" Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for eugenics, advocating universal birth control and compulsory sterilization in cases of \"degeneration\". According to Agustín Courtoisie: \"Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]\". In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated neo-Malthusians, and especially with Manuel Devaldès. He praised Devaldès' call for vasectomy as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure \"a true revolution\" in population growth. His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and Pierre Ramus. According to Romanian biomedicine historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, \"forced [eugenic sterilization] into the realm of public debate\".\n\nTurda also notes that \"Umanitarism și eugenism\" went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the involuntary euthanasia of \"degenerate\" individuals: those with \"pathological characteristics or incurable diseases.\" Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: \"It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived.\" His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually \"prolific\", but otherwise \"degenerate\", individuals. To this goal, he supported abortion, both for eugenic and pro-choice reasons. Relgis also argued: \"Instead of natural selection, man should practice rational selection.\" With \"Las aberraciones sexuales...\", Relgis condemned Nazi eugenics as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as \"sub-humans\" needed to be reeducated and (if \"incurable\") sterilized by non-Nazi physicians.\n\nIn this context, Relgis identified multiracial society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a future American racial type. In this, Relgis saw the \"integral man\" of his humanitarianism, \"healthy and strong\", with a mind unbound by \"super-refined culture\", and without the traumatic experience of \"tyrannical ideologies\". The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but \"more universal\" than, the Cosmic Race theory of Mexican academic José Vasconcelos.\n\nEugen Relgis blended a critique of capitalism, advocacy of internationalism and modern art interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and \"all too cerebral\" novels, George Călinescu argues, Eugen Relgis was \"obsessed with humanitarianism\" and self-help techniques. With his 1934 piece for \"Șantier\", Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, individualist one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works (\"the pyramid, the temple, the cathedral\"), often demanding \"the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations.\" Presently, he thought, the combat against the \"imperative of Profit\" and \"vulgar materialism\" justified the \"ethical and aesthetic individualism\". Relgis' essay described industrial society in harsh terms, as directed by \"the bloody gods\" of \"Capitalism and War\", and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to kitsch (\"serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days\"). Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, \"needs to be the expression of length and depth.\"\n\nSome of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at \"Fronda\". Its art manifestos, described by Paul Cernat as \"virtually illegible\", announced radical ideals, such as art for art's sake through Neronian destruction: \"Qualis artifex pereo\". Leon Baconsky, a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all \"Frondistes\" were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist Remy de Gourmont, to whom Cernat adds philosopher Henri Bergson and Epicurean thinker Jean-Marie Guyau (both of them dedicated \"prolix-metaphoric commentary\" in the review's pages). In matters of poetics, the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of Tudor Arghezi (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three \"Fronda\" issues) and, to a lesser extent, Ion Minulescu—according to Baconsky, \"Fronda\" was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon.\n\nThe cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic Pompiliu Păltânea, believed that, with his contribution to Romanian literature, Relgis was part of a diverse anti-war \"ideological\" group of writers (alongside Felix Aderca, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești, Barbu Lăzăreanu and some others). According to Călinescu, Relgis' literary ideal became \"the living book\", the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such \"idols\" as Rolland, Zweig, Henri Barbusse, Heinrich Mann and Ludwig Rubiner. An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European Expressionism, in fashion at the start of Relgis' career.\n\nIn addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to travel literature, deemed \"his most characteristic works\" by William Rose. These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: Ion Clopoțel noted that, in his volume about interwar Bulgaria, Relgis went beyond the facade of \"savage\" Bulgarian militarism to depict the humanist, vegetarian and \"Tolstoyan\" civil society of that age. \"Bulgaria necunoscută\" also worked as a manifesto of anti-intellectualism, chastising the \"demagogue\" academics and praising the simplicity of \"collective life\". In a similar way, Relgis' scattered memoirs, among them \"Strămoșul meu, \"David Gugumanul\"\" (\"My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' \"), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism.\n\nOther such didactic texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. \"Glasuri în surdină\" is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' alter ego, Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life. However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron \"is not really representative of the deaf majority\", leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness. Relgis' patron Eugen Lovinescu was especially critical of the work, judging its \"self-analyzing\" internal monologue as burdensome.\n\nThe \"Bildungsroman\" \"Petru Arbore\" is noted by Geo Șerban as a \"rarity\" in Romanian literature, \"instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism.\" Eugen Lovinescu notes its traditional theme of social \"inadaptation\", which, to him, echoes the right-wing didacticism of \"Sămănătorul\" writers. Over the three volumes, the idealistic Arbore falls in love with women of various conditions, and, to the backdrop of World War I, tries to build a business as an army supplier. Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his autobiography, but as the \"spiritual mirror\" of each reader. Lovinescu believed the work to be heavily influenced by Rolland's \"Jean-Christophe\", lacking \"inventiveness\".\n\nCalled a \"sweet volume of essays\" by Clopoțel, \"Prieteniile lui Miron\" chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, \"who mistakes love for sport\", being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship. Clopoțel praised the text for its \"seriousness\", \"finesse\" and \"reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility\", concluding: \"[This is] a literature of moral health.\"\n\nThese characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to Latin American literature. Courtoisie found \"Diario de otoño\", a book that is \"miscellaneous, multithematic, [moving] between the poetic and the everyday\", comparable to the \"Fermentario\" essays of Uruguay's Carlos Vaz Ferreira. According to critic William T. Starr, \"El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria\" and other such recollections reveal \"more about Relgis than about Rolland\".\n\nDuring his time at \"Fronda\", Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published collective, experimental and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Cernat, \"aesthetically monstrous\". This perspective is echoed by Șerban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without \"convincing results\". In \"Triumful neființei\", the main stylistic reference was, according to Lovinescu, the Romanian Symbolist prose poet Dimitrie Anghel, imitated to the point of \"pastiche\".\n\nWith time, Relgis developed a style deemed \"the poetry of professions\" by George Călinescu. According to Călinescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists Alexandru Tudor-Miu and Barbu Solacolu, but also to Simona Basarab, Leon Feraru, Cristian Sârbu and Stelian Constantin-Stelian. The same critic notes that Relgis \"attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters.\" Lovinescu describes the poet in Relgis as one who \"survived\" through humanitarian propaganda, returning \"in a compact Verhaeren form, rhetorical and accumulative.\" Lovinescu includes the resulting works in a category of \"descriptive\" and \"social\" poems, relating Relgis to Feraru, Alice Călugăru, Aron Cotruș, Vasile Demetrius, Camil Petrescu and I. Valerian.\n\nRelgis' poems, Călinescu notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery (\"The Elevator\", \"The Cement Mixer\") or workers (\"The Builder\", \"The Day Laborer\"), as temples and deities; by \"natural association\", the critic suggests, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals (\"The Giraffe\", \"The Elephant\"), but \"this requires greater means of suggestion\". In one piece quoted by George Călinescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a scaffolding structure:\nThe political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the Romanian Revolution of 1989: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by \"four dictatorial regimes in his native country\". Before this, Șerban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of \"opinion maker\". Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as \"almost forgotten\" by Romanians after his self-exile. In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included Fălticeni journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle. According to journalist Victor Frunză, Relgis' targeting by communist censorship had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general.\n\nAttempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community. In April 1982, the Jewish cultural journal \"Revista Cultului Mozaic\" published Leon Volovici's note about Relgis and Judaism. Late in the 1980s, Volovici also contacted Relgis' surviving sisters, then Relgis himself, becoming curator of the manuscripts left behind by the philosopher upon his relocation to South America. These were later donated to the Philippide Institute of the Romanian Academy, where they are kept as the Eugen Relgis library fund.\n\nRelgis enjoys a more enduring reputation abroad. Initially, his anarchist eugenics enjoyed some popularity among Spanish anarchists; his pacifism also inspired Llorenç Vidal Vidal, the Balearic poet and educator. Some of his tracts have been reissued after 2001, with the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo). Italian-language versions of his novels, poems and political tracts, including \"Cosmometápolis\", were published by Gaspare Mancuso and his Libero Accordo group, over the 1960s and '70s.\n\nBy then, Relgis' works had been translated into fourteen languages, although they still remained largely unknown in the United States; \"Principiile umanitariste\" alone had been translated into some 18 languages before 1982. The popularization of Relgis' ideas in America was first taken up by reviews such as \"The Humanist\" and \"Books Abroad\", while Oriole Press reprinted \"Muted Voices\". A second revised edition of \"Profetas y poetas\", prefaced by the Spanish intellectual Rafael Cansinos-Asséns, saw print in Montevideo (1981). At around the same time, in Mexico, his poems were being reprinted in Alfonso Camín's \"Norte\" literary review.\n\nIn addition to the Philippide Institute collection, part of Relgis' personal archive is being preserved in Jerusalem, at the National Library of Israel. His other notebooks and letters are kept in the Netherlands, at the International Institute of Social History. Relgis' likeness is preserved in drawings by Marcel Janco, Lazăr Zin, Louis Moreau and Carmelo de Arzadun.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46219227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46219227", "title": "Evolution of metal ions in biological systems", "text": "Evolution of metal ions in biological systems\n\nEvolution of metal ions in biological systems refers to the incorporation of metallic ions into living organisms and how it has changed over time. Metal ions have been associated with biological systems for billions of years, but only in the last century have scientists began to truly appreciate the scale of their influence. Major (iron, manganese, magnesium and zinc) and minor (copper, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten) metal ions have become aligned with living organisms through the interplay of biogeochemical weathering and metabolic pathways involving the products of that weathering. The associated complexes have evolved over time.\n\nNatural development of chemicals and elements challenged organisms to adapt or die. Current organisms require redox reactions to induce metabolism and other life processes. Metals have a tendency to lose electrons and are important for redox reactions. “Metals have become so central to cellular function that the collection of metal-binding proteins (referred to as the metallomes) accounts for over 30% of all proteins in the cell. Metals are known to be involved in over 40% of enzymatic reactions, and metal-binding proteins carry out at least one step in almost all biological pathways”.Metals are also toxic so a balance must be acquired to regulate where the metals are in an organism as well as in what quantities. Many organisms have flexible systems in which they can exchange one metal for another if one is scarce. Metals in this discussion are naturally occurring elements that have a tendency to undergo oxidation. Vanadium, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, chromium, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc are deemed essential because without them biological function is impaired.\n\nThe Earth began as an iron aquatic world with low oxygen. The Great Oxygenation Event occurred approximately 2.4 Ga (billion years ago) as cyanobacteria and photosynthetic life induced the presence of dioxygen in the planet’s atmosphere. Iron became insoluble (as did other metals) and scarce while other metals became soluble. Sulfur was a very important element during this time. Once oxygen was released into the environment, sulfates made metals more soluble and released those metals into the environment; especially into the water. Incorporation of metals perhaps combatted oxidative stress.\n\nThe central chemistry of all these cells has to be reductive in order that the synthesis of the required chemicals, especially biopolymers, is possible. The different anaerobic, autocatalysed, reductive, metabolic pathways seen in the earliest known cells developed in separate energised vesicles, protocells, where they were produced cooperatively with certain bases of the nucleic acids.\n\nHypotheses proposed for how elements became essential is their relative quantity in the environment as life formed. This has produced research on the origin of life; for instance, Orgel and Crick hypothesized that life was extraterrestrial due to the alleged low abundance of molybdenum on early Earth (it is now suspected that there were larger quantities than previously thought). Another example is life forming around thermal vents based on the availability of zinc and sulfur. In conjunction with this theory is that life evolved as chemoautotrophs. Therefore, life occurred around metals and not in response to their presence. Some evidence for this theory is that inorganic matter has self-contained attributes that life adopted as shown by life's compartmentalization.\n\nThe prebiotic chemistry of life had to be reductive in order to obtain, e.g. Carbon monoxide (CO) and Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from existing CO and N in the atmosphere. CO and HCN were precursor molecules of the essential biomolecules, proteins, lipids, nucleotides and sugars. However, atmospheric oxygen levels increased considerably, and it was then necessary for cells to have control over the reduction and oxidation of such small molecules in order to build and break down cells when necessary, without the inevitable oxidation (breaking down) of everything. Transition metal ions, due to their multiple oxidation states, were the only elements capable of controlling the oxidation states of such molecules, and thus were selected for.\n\nO-donors such as HPO were abundant in the prebiotic atmosphere. Metal ion binding to such O-donors was required to build the biological polymers, since the bond is generally weak, it can catalyze the required reaction and dissociate after (i.e. Mg in DNA synthesis).\n\nAround 4 Ga , the acidic seawater contained high amounts of HS and thus created a reducing environment with a potential of around -0.2 V. So any element that had a large negative value with respect to the reduction potential of the environment was available in its free ionic form and can subsequently be incorporated into cells, i.e. Mg has a reduction potential of -2.372 V, and was available in its ionic form at that time.\n\nAround 2 Ga, an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels took place, causing an oxidation of HS in the surroundings, and an increase in the pH of the sea water. The resulting environment had become more oxidizing and thus allowed the later incorporation of the heavier metals such as copper and zinc.\n\nAnother factor affecting the availability of metal ions was their solubilities with HS. Hydrogen sulfide was abundant in the early sea giving rise to HS in the prebiotic acidic conditions and HS in the neutral (pH = 7.0) conditions. In the series of metal sulfides, insolubility increases at neutral pH following the Irving-Williams series:\n\nMn(II) < Fe(II) < Co(II) ≤ Ni(II) < Cu(II) > Zn(II)\n\nSo in high amounts of HS, which was the prebiotic condition, only Fe was most prominently available in its ionic form due to its low insolubility with sulfides. The increasing oxidation of HS into SO leads to the later release of Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn since all of their sulfates are soluble.\n\nThe Earth began as an iron aquatic world with low oxygen.

In the series of metal sulfides, insolubility increases at neutral pH following the Irving-Williams series:\n\nMn(II) < Fe(II) < Co(II) ≤ Ni(II) < Cu(II) > Zn(II)\n\nSo in high amounts of HS, which was the prebiotic condition, only Fe was most prominently available in its ionic form due to its low insolubility with sulfides. The increasing oxidation of HS into SO leads to the later release of Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn since all of their sulfates are soluble.\n\nMagnesium is the eighth most abundant element on earth. It is the fourth most abundant element in vertebrates and the most abundant divalent cation within cells. The most available form of magnesium (Mg) for living organisms can be found in the hydrosphere. The concentration of Mg in seawater is around 55 mM. Mg is readily available to cells during early evolution due to its high solubility in water. Other transition metals like calcium precipitate from aqueous solutions at much lower concentrations than the corresponding Mg salts.\n\nSince magnesium was readily available in early evolution, it can be found in every cell type living organism. Magnesium in anaerobic prokaryotes can be found in MgATP. Magnesium also has many functions in prokaryotes such as glycolysis, all kinases, NTP reaction, signalling, DNA/RNA structures and light capture. In aerobic eukaryotes, magnesium can be found in cytoplasm and chloroplasts. The reactions in these cell compartments are glycolysis, photophosphorylation and carbon assimilation.\n\nATP, the main source of energy in almost all living organisms, must bind with metal ions such as Mg or Ca to function. Examination of cells with limited magnesium supply has shown that a lack of magnesium can cause a decrease in ATP. Magnesium in ATP hydrolysis acts as a co-factor to stabilize the high negative charge transition state. MgATP can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes cells. However, most of the ATP in cells is MgATP. Following the Irving–Williams series, magnesium has a higher binding constant than the Ca. Therefore, the dominant ATP in living organisms is MgATP. A greater binding constant also given magnesium the advantage as a better catalyst over other competing transition metals.\n\nEvidence suggests that manganese (Mn) was first incorporated into biological systems roughly 3.2 - 2.8 billion years ago, during the Archean Period. Together with calcium, it formed the manganese-calcium oxide complex (determined by X-ray diffraction) which consisted of a manganese cluster, essentially an inorganic cubane (cubical) structure. The incorporation of a manganese center in photosystem II was highly significant, as it allowed for photosynthetic oxygen evolution of plants. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is a critical component of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for terminal photooxidation of water during light reactions.\n\nThe incorporation of Mn in proteins allowed the complexes the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species in Mn-superoxide dismutatse (MnSOD) and catalase, in electron transfer-dependent catalysis (for instance in certain class I ribonucleotide reductases) and in the oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII), where the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances is decreased. This is due to manganese's ability to reduce superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals as well as its chain-breaking capacity.\n\nIron (Fe) is the most abundant element in the Earth and the fourth most abundant element in the crust, approximately 5 percent by mass. Due to the abundance of iron and its role in biological systems, the transition and mineralogical stages of iron have played a key role in Earth surface systems. It played a larger role in the geological past in marine geochemistry, as evidenced by the deposits of Precambrian iron-rich sediments. The redox transformation of Fe(II) to Fe(III), or vice versa, is vital to a number of biological and element cycling processes. The reduction of Fe(III) is seen to oxidize sulfur (from HS to SO), which is a central process in marine sediments. Many of the first metalloproteins consisted of iron-sulphur complexes formed during photosynthesis. Iron is the main redox metal in biological systems. In proteins, it is found in a variety of sites and cofactors, including, for instance, haem groups, Fe–O–Fe sites, and iron–sulfur clusters.\n\nThe prevalence of iron is apparently due to the large availability of Fe(II) in the initial evolution of living organisms, before the rise of photosynthesis and an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels which resulted in the precipitation of iron in the environment as Fe(OH). It has flexible redox properties because such properties are sensitive to ligand coordination, including geometry. Iron can be also used in enzymes due to its Lewis acid properties, for example in nitrile hydratase. Iron is frequently found in mononuclear sites in the reduced Fe(II) form, and functions in dioxygen activation; this function is used as a major mechanism adopted by living organisms to avoid the kinetic barrier hindering the transformation of organic compounds by O. Iron can be taken up selectively as ferredoxins, Fe-O-Fe (hemerythrin and ribonucleotide reductase), Fe (many oxidases), apart from iron porphyrin. Variation in the related proteins with any one of these chemical forms of iron has produced a wide range of enzymes. All of these arrangements are modified to function both in the sense of reactivity and the positioning of the protein in the cell. Iron can have various redox and spin states, and it can be held in many stereochemistries.\n\nAround 4-3 Ga, anaerobic prokaryotes began developing metal and organic cofactors for light absorption. They ultimately ended up making chlorophyll from Mg(II), as is found in cyanobacteria and plants, leading to modern photosynthesis. However, chlorophyll synthesis requires numerous steps. The process starts with uroporphyrin, a primitive precursor to the porphyrin ring which may be biotic or abiotic in origin, which is then modified in cells differently to make Mg, Fe, nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co) complexes. The centers of these rings are not selective, thus allowing the variety of metal ions to be incorporated. Mg porphyrin gives rise to chlorophyll, Fe porphyrin to heme proteins, Ni porphyrin yields factor F-430, and Co porphyrin Coenzyme B12.\n\nBefore the Great Oxygenation Event, copper was not readily available for living organisms. Most early copper was Cu and Cu. This oxidation state of copper is not very soluble in water. One billion years ago, after the great oxidation event the oxygen pressure rose sufficiently to oxidise Cu to Cu, increasing its solubility in water. As a result, the copper became much more available for living organisms.\n\nMost copper-containing proteins and enzymes can be found in eukaryotes. Only a handful of prokaryotes such as aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria contain copper enzymes or proteins. Copper can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme. There are three distinct types of SOD, containing Mn, Fe and Cu respectively. Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD are found in most prokaryotes and mitochondria of the eukaryotic cell. Cu-SOD can be found in the cytoplasmic fraction of the eukaryotic cells. The three elements, copper, iron and manganese, can all catalyze superoxide to ordinary molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. However, Cu-SOD is more efficient than Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD. Most prokaryotes only utilize Fe-SOD or Mn-SOD due to the lack of copper in the environment. Some organisms did not develop Cu-SOD due to the lack of a gene pool for the Cu-SOD adoption.\n\nZinc (Zn) was incorporated into living cells in two waves. Four to three Ga, anaerobic prokaryotes arose, and the atmosphere was full of HS and highly reductive. Thus most zinc was in the form of insoluble ZnS. However, because seawater at the time was slightly acidic, some Zn(II) was available in its ionic form and became part of early anaerobic prokaryotes’ external proteases, external nucleases, internal synthetases and dehydrogenases.\n\nDuring the second wave, once the Great Oxygenation Event occurred, more Zn(II) ions were available in the seawater. This allowed its incorporation in the single-cell eukaryotes as they arose at this time. It is believed that the later addition of ions such as zinc and copper allowed them to displace iron and manganese from the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Fe and Mn complexes dissociate readily (Irving-Williams series) while Zn and Cu do not. This is why eukaryotic SOD contains Cu or Zn and its prokaryotic counterpart contains Fe or Mn.\n\nZn (II) doesn’t pose an oxidation threat to the cytoplasm. This allowed it to become a major cytoplasmic element in the eukaryotes. It became associated with a new group of transcription proteins, zinc fingers. This could only have occurred due to the long life of eukaryotes, which allowed time for zinc to exchange and hence become an internal messenger coordinating the action of other transcription factors during growth.\n\nMolybdenum (Mo) is the most abundant transition element in solution in the sea (mostly as dianionic molybdate ion) and in living organisms, its abundance in the Earth’s crust is quite low. Therefore, the use of Mo by living organisms seems surprising at first glance. Archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, including humans, require molybdenum. It is also found in over 50 different enzymes. Its hydrolysis to water-soluble oxo-anionic species makes Mo readily accessible. Mo is found in the active sites of metalloenzymes that perform key transformations in the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur, and chlorine compounds.\nThe mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO). Nitrate reductases enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C, N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans. Due to the oxidation of sulfides, The first considerable development was that of aerobic bacteria which could now utilize Mo. As oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere and oceans, the reaction of MoS to MoO also increased. This reaction made the highly soluble molybdate ion available for incorporation into critical metalloenzymes, and may have thus allowed life to thrive. It allowed organisms to occupy new ecological niches. Mo plays an important role in the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia, which occurs in one type of nitrogenases. These enzymes are used by bacteria that usually live in a symbiotic relationship with plants; their role is nitrogen fixation, which is vital for sustaining life on earth. Mo enzymes also play important roles in sulfur metabolism of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.\n\nTungsten is one of the oldest metal ions to be incorporated in biological systems, preceding The Great Oxygenation Event. Before the abundance of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere, oceans teemed with sulfur and tungsten, while molybdenum, a metal that is highly similar chemically, was inaccessible in solid form. The abundance of tungsten and lack of free molybdenum likely explains why early marine organisms incorporated the former instead of the latter. However, as cyanobacteria began to fill the atmosphere with oxygen, molybdenum became available (molybdenum becomes soluble when exposed to oxygen) and molybdenum began to replace tungsten in the majority of metabolic processes, which is seen today, as tungsten is only present in the biological complexes of prokaryotes (methanogens, gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes), and is only obligated in hyperthermophilic archaea such as P. furiosus. Tungesten's extremely high melting point (3,422C), partially explains its necessity in these archaea, found in extremely hot areas.\n\nAlthough research into the specific enzyme complexes in which tungsten is incorporated is relatively recent (1970s), natural tungstoenzymes are abundantly found in a large number of prokaryotic microorganisms. These include formate dehydrogenase, formyl methanufuran dehydrogenase, acetylene hydratase, and a class of phylogenetically related oxidoreductases that catalyze the reversible oxidation of aldehydes. The first crystal structure of a tungsten- or pterin-containing enzyme, that of aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase from P. furiosus, has revealed a catalytic site with one W atom coordinated to two pterin molecules which are themselves bridged by a magnesium ion.\n"}

If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a theorem of the formal system. The notion of theorem is not in general effective, therefore there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concept of natural deduction is a generalization of the concept of proof.\n\nThe theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some formal system to the previous well-formed formulae in the proof sequence. \n\nFormal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in interactive theorem proving. Significantly, these proofs can be checked automatically, also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of \"finding\" proofs (automated theorem proving) is usually computationally intractable and/or only semi-decidable, depending upon the formal system in use.\n\nA \"formal language\" is a set of finite sequences of symbols. Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning. Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages.\n\nA \"formal grammar\" (also called \"formation rules\") is a precise description of the well-formed formulas of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).\n\nA \"formal system\" (also called a \"logical calculus\", or a \"logical system\") consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a \"deductive system\"). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called \"inference rules\") or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions.\n\nAn \"interpretation\" of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called formal semantics. \"Giving an interpretation\" is synonymous with \"constructing a model.\n\n\n"}

It provides an explanation as to why there may be an evolutionary advantage to genetic recombination.\n\nIn a population of finite size which is subject to natural selection, random linkage disequilibria will occur. These can be caused by genetic drift or by mutation, and they will tend to slow down the process of evolution by natural selection. This is most easily seen by considering the case of disequilibria caused by mutation:\n\nConsider a population of individuals whose genome has only two genes, \"a\" and \"b\". If an advantageous mutant (\"A\") of gene \"a\" arises in a given individual, that individual's genes will through natural selection become more frequent in the population over time. However, if a separate advantageous mutant (\"B\") of gene \"b\" arises before \"A\" has gone to fixation, and happens to arise in an individual who does not carry \"A\", then individuals carrying \"B\" and individuals carrying \"A\" will be in competition. If recombination is present, then individuals carrying both \"A\" and \"B\" (of genotype \"AB\") will eventually arise. Provided there are no negative epistatic effects of carrying both, individuals of genotype \"AB\" will have a greater selective advantage than \"aB\" or \"Ab\" individuals, and \"AB\" will hence go to fixation.\nHowever, if there is no recombination, \"AB\" individuals can only occur if the latter mutation (\"B\") happens to occur in an \"Ab\" individual. The chance of this happening depends on the frequency of new mutations, and on the size of the population, but is in general unlikely unless \"A\" is already fixed, or nearly fixed. Hence one should expect the time between the \"A\" mutation arising and the population becoming fixed for \"AB\" to be much longer in the absence of recombination. Hence recombination allows evolution to progress faster.\n\nJoe Felsenstein (1974) showed this effect to be mathematically identical to the Fisher–Muller model proposed by R. A. Fisher (1930) and H. J. Muller (1932), although the verbal arguments were substantially different.\n\n"}

Since more than thousand years ago there has been a conflict in Persia between the search for modernity and the forces of religious obscurantism.\n\nSome twenty-five hundred years ago, when Herodotus was writing his \"Histories\", Persia was the West's ultimate \"other\".\n\nIt has been a common belief of scholars that modernity began in the West and is by its philosophical nature, economic underpinning, and cultural exigencies a uniquely western phenomenon. All \"other\" cultures, those who have lived on the \"darker side of Renaissance\" must emulate the Western experience, if they want to be modern. From Max Weber to Milan Kundera, many Western scholars and writers have argued that everything from representative democracy and rational thought to the art of the novel and the essay are not only western in origin but also uniquely suited to its culture, and native to its temperature climes.\n\nPersia with its impressively rich and varied cultural legacy had a formative role in shaping Western consciousness. The Bible is replete with profuse praise for Persia and its kings. The Bible's praise for Cyrus the Great was partially in recognition of his role in freeing the Jews from their Babylonian captivity; of equal importance was the fact that the vast Persian empire of the time was a paragon of religious and cultural tolerance.\n\nHegel whose writings are considered by many as the apex of the Western philosophical tradition, uses superlatives in praising the role of Persia and Zarathustra in history.\n\nFollowing Hegel in 19th-century Germany, Nietzsche wrote his magnum opus, \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" that similarly touched upon this key figure of the Persian imagination. Nietzsche's book offers a radical critique, almost a total debunking, of the whole Western tradition of philosophy. It is no mere accident that Nietzsche chose to articulate his critical views in the name of Zarathustra. The end of the 19th century was not the only or the last time Zarathustra played a prominent role in shaping Western consciousness and philosophic discourse. In 1990s Persian influences on the millennial fever, and on other New Age themes, were so strong that Harold Bloom, the eminent American critic, suggested that the last decade of the twentieth century should in truth be called \"a return to Zoroastrian origins.\"\n\nWestern art, no less than history and theology, bear testimony to the ubiquity of the Persian presence in antiquity. Of all the extant works of Greek tragedy, for example, the only one that is about a non-Greek subject is Aeschylus' play \"The Persians\".\n\nThe nineteenth century Persian reformers who are considered as the \"first generation of Iranian intellectuals\" were perfectly conscious of the fact that it was not enough to rely upon the antiquity of Persian civilization to think about its continued ability to survive. They tried to establish a relationship with men of power that would have permitted them to dictate their blueprints for reforms. These blueprints naturally remained without immediate impact among the men of power to whom they were addressed. These intellectual reforms encountered a widespread opposition from the court and the Ulama. Abd al-Rahim Talebof, Fath-'Ali Akhoundzadeh, and Sani o Doleh belong to this generation.\n\nThe second generation intended to introduce modern civilization to Persia, not only by imitating the West, but through a coherent and systematic approach to European culture. Mohammad-Taqi Bahar, Ali Dashti, Ali Akbar Davar, Mohammad-Ali Foroughi, Sadeq Hedayat, Bozorg Alavi, Ahmad Kasravi, Saeed Nafisi, Hasan Taqizadeh, Abdolhossein Teymourtash and `Abdu'l-Bahá belong to this generation.\n\nThe third generation of Iranian intellectuals signify the absorption of Russian Marxism into Iranian political and social thought. With the popularity of Marxist ideology among the third generation of Iranian intellectuals, the new culture for translation and knowledge of modernity was drawn inevitably toward moral and political absolutes. Intellectuals claimed to be \"givers of lessons\" and acted as \"moral legislators\" who were critics of both the state and the society. Jalal Al-e-Ahmad and Ali Shariati belong to this generation.\n\nFourth generation of Iranian intellectuals are mainly characterized by the journals such as \"Goftegu\" and \"Kiyan\". In contrast with the ideological generation of Iranian intellectuals who in their encounter with the western modernity favoured a monistic attitude exemplified by Marxist and Heideggerian philosophies, the Fourth Generation of Iranian intellectuals decided on a move away and a critical distanciation from master ideologies.\nThe methodological position of the new generation of Iranian intellectuals is characterized by two main philosophical attitudes: the extension of an anti-utopian thinking on an intersubjective basis on the one hand, and the urge for a non-imitative dialogical exchange with the modern values of the West on the other.\n\nJavad Tabatabaei and Abdolkarim Soroush among many others belong to the fourth generation.\n\nIranian experience and development of modernity led to a unique style of cinema, painting and music. Iranian \"New wave\", a movement in Iranian cinema, has found worldwide reputation due to its deeply Philosophical, poetic and artistic style. Abbas Kiarostami is the most notable figure in the \"New wave\" of Iranian cinema. In the artistic and aesthetic realm, features of New wave of Persian cinema, for example the works of Abbas Kiarostami, can be classified as postmodern.\n\nIn his book \"Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future\" (2001) describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [\"Iranian\"] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity. According to Dabashi, \"the visual possibility of seeing the historical person (as opposed to the eternal Qur'anic man) on screen is arguably the single most important event allowing Iranians access to modernity.\"\n\nMehdi Saeedi, is an internationally renowned artist and designer. His aesthetics have become a mainstay of design in many regions, especially in those using the Arabic script as their alphabet. And on November (2009) he won Grand Price for the Five Star Designers at International Invitational Poster Triennial in Osaka, Japan.\n\nOn 13 December 2006, graphic designer, Reza Abedini, received the Principal Award in the Prince Claus Awards for his way of applying the knowledge and accomplishments of Iran's artistic heritage, renewing them, and making them exciting again. Reza Abedini's Persian Sym style unites the rich calligraphic tradition of Persian culture with \"modernity\".\n\nIt is believed that Ebrahim Golestan, Fereydoon Rahnama and Farrokh Ghaffari founded Iran's \"different\" cinematic style and Iranian intellectual movement in the 20th century.\n\nMarcos Grigorian and Hossein Zenderoudi were pioneers of Iranian modern painting and Sculpture.\n\nAlthough the new era in Iranian architecture began with the rise of Safavid dynasty, (1501 - 1736), in fact, it is in the early decades of the twentieth century that the first generation of modern Iranian architects, almost like every generation of modern architects in the world, appears as being influenced by the Modern Movement and rationalism in architecture. Architects such as Vartan Hovanesian, Ali Sadegh, Mohsen Foroughi, Paul Akbar, Gabriel Guevrekian, Heydar Ghiai, Abdolaziz Farmanfarmaian and Hooshang Seyhoun are examples of this movement.\nLater, in the mid-1960s, Ali Sardar Afkhami, Kamran Diba and Nader Ardalan are among those Iranian architects who have opened their design approach to the history and traditions to represent a trend of Iranian Post-Modernism.\nAttention for the new trends in international architecture, is being carried out by Iranian architects, even after the Islamic Revolution. Like most architectural milieu of the world, in the 1980s the experiments on the transition from post-modernism to new developments, has influenced many Iranians architects, in architects such as Reza Daneshmir, Farhad Ahmadi, and Darab Diba.\nIn this context, It is of interest the attempt by some architects like Abbas Gharib or Bahram Shirdel to go in deep within the most advanced theory and trends in contemporary and Post-contemporary architecture, such as the theory of Complex systems in architecture in the case of Gharib and folding Theory in the case of Shirdel. These experiments are valid methods and contribution to liberate architecture and design, from abstraction, flatness, stiffness, forced rectangular and Heterotopia of the modernist spaces for a more fluid, flexible, soft and dynamic architecture, open to the complexities of its environment and context\n\nSimultaneous with the constitutional revolution in Iran, young musicians sought new forms of music to synchronize with the tide of social changes. In 1937, Tehran's Symphonic Orchestra started working and performing western as well as Iranian music.\nThe 1979 revolution launched a renaissance in Persian classical music. The emergence of three ensembles, the Aref Ensemble, the Sheyda Ensemble and the Masters of Persian Music revolutionized Iranian music during the late 20th century and at the turn of the millennium.\nNew figures emerged in Persian Symphonic Music, and several symphony orchestras started their work despite a lack of support from national governments or international bodies. The new wave can be characterized by growing interest in using both Iranian and European instruments and musical genres. Perhaps the best examples are the Melal Orchestra and the National Iranian Symphony Orchestra.\n\nFolk music also enjoyed the emergence of figures such as Sima Bina and Kamkar. These musicians introduced Iranian folk music (Khorasani, Kurdish, Bandari, Mazandarani music, among others) to the international community by organizing numerous concerts worldwide.\n\nModern Persian poetry came into existence after Nima Yushij. Some notable figures include:\n\n\nLiterary criticism and comparative literature in Iran entered a new phase in the 19th century. Persian literature enjoyed the emergence of influential figures as Sadeq Hedayat, Ahmad Kasravi, Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, Shahrokh Meskoob, Ebrahim Golestan and Sadegh Choubak.\n\nThe history of modern science in Iran dates back to the year 1851 and the establishment of Darolfonoon – which was founded as a result of the efforts of Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir, aiming at training and teaching Iranian experts on many fields of sciences, and it was the future minded Abbas Mirza who first dispatched students to Europe to obtain a western education.\n\nBy the establishment of Tehran University, science in Iran entered a new phase. Mahmoud Hessaby, Ali Asghar Hekmat, Moslem Bahadori and many others played roles in initiating and forming these movements. The outcome of the movement has been the emergence of researchers who have been trained and received doctorate degrees in the country and have found international reputations.\nModernization of Iranian medicine did not occur through the straightforward replacement of traditional Persian medicine by modern European medicine. Rather, the integration of modern medicine went through a long process that included both the reinterpretation of traditional theories by traditional physicians and the assimilation of modern theories through the prism of traditional medicine.\n\nOne of the main Iranian scientific movements in the late 20th century was in the field of chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. The main leaders of this movement were Abbas Shafiee, Bijan Farzami, Mohammad-Nabi Sarbolouki, Issa Yavari and Ahmad Reza Dehpour. The movement resulted in hundreds of research papers in peer reviewed international journals.\n\nOther notable figures who promoted world-class research in Iran during the 20th century are: Reza Mansouri and Yousof Sobouti (Physics), Abolhassan Farhoudi (Immunology), Mohammad Reza Zarrindast (Pharmacology), Fereydoun Davatchi (Rheumatology), Taher Movassaghian (Chemistry), Ardeshir Ghavamzadeh (Hematology), Ali Radmehr (Radiology), Hossein Najmabadi (Medical genetics), Hormoz Shams (Ophthalmology), Moslem Bahadori (Pathology), Hormoz Dabirashrafi (Obstetrics and Gynecology), Hossein Esteky (Neuroscience), G.R.

Indeed, in Iran some 70% of science and engineering students are women.\n\nIran is now a world leader in some areas like string theory. When a reporter for \"Nature\" asked Reza Mansouri: \"Why do I see so many string theory papers coming out of Iran?\" He explained how Iranian scientists worked together under revolution, sanctions and war to bring Iran to such a position: \"I remember exactly the beginning of the revolution, some old colleagues just sat together and spoke about what we could do for Iran. Is it understood that we have to look for excellence, in some areas that we may be strong and that we may get strong at that so that will be the field of physics. So we began with that. It happens that the most active field physicists in our country were working on the string theory at that time. So they tried to be of a school, so to speak, and we did know that that was the only way which was somehow independent of all these political fluctuations regarding war, regarding cultural revolution, all that, and we really tried hard to build up schools. So we have it now, string schools, so to say somehow.\"\n\nIn 2007 United Nations awarded Hossein Malek-Afzali with the prestigious UN Population Award. Malek Afzali has helped design strategies to improve health procedures, particularly adolescent health, reproductive health and family planning. In the field of reproductive health, he has engaged policymakers and religious leaders in the planning and implementation of reproductive health programmes in Iran.\n\nCurrently women's rights groups are among the most active social rights groups in Iran and are mostly involved in an effort to gain equal rights for women in the Iranian legal system by opposing specific discriminatory laws. However, under the Presidential regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, elected President in 2005, women's rights advocates have been beaten, jailed and persecuted.\n\nThe presence of women in Iranian intellectual movements (science, modern literature, cinema, human-rights activism, etc.) has been remarkable throughout the history of modern Iran. According to the research ministry of Iran, women accounted for 56% of all university students in the natural sciences, including one in five Ph.D. students. Such education and social trends are increasingly viewed with alarm by the Iranian government.\n\nIn cinema and the visual arts, Shirin Neshat, Tahmineh Milani, Rakhshan Bani Etemad, and Samira Makhmalbaf created new cinematic styles which have attracted many from all over the world and in international festivals.\nPersian poet and literary figure Simin Behbahani was nominated for 1997 Nobel Prize for literature. The 2003 Nobel Peace Prize went to Shirin Ebadi for her efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children.\nSimin Daneshvar's \"Savushun\" is a novel about the Iranian experience of modernity during the 20th century.\n\nIranian writer and satirist, Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi was perhaps the first professional female satirist, critic and one of the notable figures involved in Persian constitutional revolution.\nIn the early 20th century, Persian music enjoyed the emergence of Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri, the \"Lady of Iranian music\".\n\nIran had undergone a phenomenal constitutional revolution at the turn of the twentieth century. The constitutional movement was concerned with modernity and human rights. It led to the establishment of a parliament in Iran. Mirza Jahangir-Khan Shirazi and Farrokhi Yazdi were among the most notable writers and critics of this era who sacrificed their lives for establishment of democracy and freedom in Iran.\n\nIn the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the \"28 Mordad coup\", the Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown on 19 August 1953. The coup d'état was orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name 'Operation Boot') and the United States (under the name \"TPAJAX\" Project).\n\nMossadegh had sought to reduce the semi-absolute role of the Shah granted by the Constitution of 1906, thus making Iran a full democracy, and to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, consisting of vast oil reserves and the Abadan Refinery, both owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation (now BP).\nA military government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king), to effectively rule the country as an absolute monarch according to the constitution. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power until his own overthrow in February 1979. In August 2013 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) admitted that it was involved in both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda. The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out \"under CIA direction\" and \"as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government.\"\n\nSome researchers believe that the Iranian Revolution was not a simple clash between modernity and tradition but an attempt to accommodate modernity within a sense of authentic Islamic identity, culture and historical experience.\n\nPerceived by many as a revolt against the secular modernity of the West, Iranian revolution was welcomed by some Western thinkers as a triumph of spiritual values over the profane world of capitalist materialism. For others the Iranian revolution was a protest against the very political rationality of the modern era.\n\nThe election of the former President Mohammad Khatami in May 1997 was through the emergence of a new political force, the youth. Inspired by simultaneously individualist and democratic ideals that are incompatible in every respect with the authoritarian values and symbols traditionally associated in the Iranian intellectual arena with Marxist and Heideggerian World views. It is in this new social atmosphere that the emergence of a global community or a cyberpolis was able to reveal to the Iranian youth the true nature of instrumental rationality as modern universal standards. Saeed Hajjarian was widely believed to be the main strategist behind the 1997 reform movement of Iran. He allegedly showed the supremacy of politics as such over any religious norm when he said that the survival of the Islamic Republic was paramount and that no religious ritual should stand in its way. This kind of decision, he states, means that politics are more important than religion and that this acknowledges the secularization of religion. In this context, he argues, it is possible to reassess velayat faqih and to reject its supremacy within the political field in Iran. While calling to build a new reform movement, Hajjarian believes that the reform movement started in 1997, died during Khatami's second term. He believes that the reform project started by Persian constitutional revolution, has not been completed yet.\"(ref: Farhad Khosrokhavar, The New Intellectuals in Iran, Social Compass, Vol. 51, No. 2, 191-202 (2004))\"\n\nThe scope of 2nd of Khordad movement was much broader than President Khatami's reform plan. The latter has been criticised for wanting slow progress and not producing a real democratic alternative for the current Islamic republic. When asked about this during Khatami's visit to United Kingdom, he said \"You know for centuries we have been under dictatorship so we cannot get to a democracy all of a sudden, we have to go step by step\"\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution, the Cultural Revolution and the Chain murders of Iran were two major campaigns that involved the imprisonment, torture, emigration, and massacre of Iranian scholars.\n\nIntellectual circles in postrevolutionary Iran can be classified into the following categories:\n\nThe main figures in this category are Ali Shariati, Jalal Al Ahmad and Morteza Motahhari. Morteza Motahhari was the main theorist and thinker behind Iranian revolution. He is considered to be one of the most influential philosophical leaders of pre-revolutionary Iran and the impact and popularity of his thought continues to be felt throughout Iranian society many years later.\n\nMain figures in this category are Mehdi Bazargan, Abdolkarim Soroush, Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari, Mostafa Malekian, Mohsen Kadivar, Alireza Alavitabar and Hossein Bashiriyeh.\n\nThe unifying traits of these intellectuals include their recognition of reform in the Islamic thought, democracy, civil society and religious pluralism and their opposition to the absolute supremacy of the Faqih. The rise of religious intellectuals can be followed through the writings of Abdolkarim Soroosh. Soroosh's main idea is that there are perennial unchanging religious truths, but our understanding of them remains contingent on our knowledge in the fields of science and philosophy. Unlike Ali Shariati, who turned to Marxism to bring a historicist perspective to the Shiite thought, Soroosh debates the relation between democracy and religion and discusses the possibility of what he calls \"religious democracy\".\n\nInfluenced by Persian mysticism, Soroush advocated a type of reformist Islam that went beyond most liberal Muslim thinkers of the 20th century and argued that the search for reconciliation of Islam and democracy was not a matter of simply finding appropriate phrases in the Qur'an that were in agreement with modern science, democracy, or human rights. Drawing on the works of Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Popper, and Erich Fromm, Soroush called for a reexamination of all tenets of Islam, insisting on the need to maintain the religion's original spirit of social justice and its emphasis on caring for other people.\n\nOther influential figures in these circles are Saeed Hajjarian, Ahmad Sadri, Mahmoud Sadri, Ezzatollah Sahabi, Ahmad Ghabel and Hassan Yousefi Eshkevari. Akbar Ganji had also been associated with this circle before he published his \"Manifest of Republicanism\". Moreover, Akbar Ganji took a tour around the world in order to invite non Iranian intellectuals to join Iran's intellectual movement. Many Persian scholars believe that such interactions with world scholars would promote Iranian intellectualism and democratic reform. Richard Rorty, Noam Chomsky, Anthony Giddens, David Hild, Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt among a few others accepted the honorary membership of Iranian intellectual society.\n\nPerhaps the most important achievement of this circle was training a new generation of Iranian intellectuals who are far ahead of their mentors and do not belong to any of well-established intellectual circles in Iran. Ahmad Zeidabadi and Mehdi Jami belong to this new generation of Persian scholars.\n\nThese groups are characterized by the followings:\n\nThe main thinker and theorist of this circle is Mohammad Khatami, former president of Iran. Other notable figures include Yousef Sanei, Abdollah Noori, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mostafa Moin. They are mainly under the influence of ideas of Ayatollah Mirza Hossein Na'eeni and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\nUnlike the reformist intellectuals, the neo- conservative intellectuals in Iran are in favor of the supremacy of the Leader and against concepts such as democracy, civil society and pluralism. This movement includes figures such as Reza Davari Ardakani, Javad Larijani and Mehdi Golshani. The famous personality among these is Reza Davari Ardakani, who as an anti- Western philosopher is very familiar with the works of Martin Heidegger. Davari, unlike Soroosh, takes some of the features of Heidegger's thought, mainly the critic of modernity and puts it into an Islamic wording. He rejects the Western model of democracy, which is based on the separation of politics and religion.\n\nMain figures in this category are Javad Tabatabaei, Dariush Shayegan, Amir Hossein Aryanpour, Ramin Jahanbegloo, Ehsan Naraghi, Khosro Naghed, Abbas Milani, and Aramesh Doustdar.\n\nJavad Tabtabaei deplores the deep roots of religion in the Iranian culture. For Tabatabai, the decline of the Iranian political thought goes back to the 9th and 10th centuries and, since then, it has been impossible for them to adequately understand the modernity. The social sciences, according to him, have been introduced in Iran without the secularization of thought and its rationalization and therefore, they reproduce in an unconscious way the ancient prejudices and the inability to think adequately.\n\nDariush Shayegan criticizes a view of religion that does not take into account the major trends of the modern world where cultural homogeneity and religious absolutism are questioned. The quest for a holistic identity based on a monolithic view of Islam is alien to the evolution of modern world and means the isolation and regression of the (Iranian) society.\n\nDariush Shayegan, who writes mainly in French (but has been extensively translated into Persian), shares some of the views of these particular intellectuals, but his major contribution is to invite Iranians to accept the ‘‘fragmented identity’’ of the modern world and to renounce a unitary view of the Self which leads to a fascination with utopian and mythological ideologies. He insists that, since Iran has undergone the change directly from tradition to postmodernity without the mediation of modernity, it is experiencing a strong malaise. His solution is to open up Iran to the new multicultural world in which one has to accept the diversity of the perspectives and, therefore, to be tolerant towards others who do not think and behave in the same way as the Self. This invitation to become open-minded and to give up the idea of a homogeneous culture exerts an undeniable influence on many young people in Iran.\n\nThe most notable circle was associated with Hossein Nasr, founder of Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy. For Nasr, the traditional world was pervaded by a tremendous sense of the Sacred and the Absolute, whereas the inception of modernity involved precisely the severing off of that awareness, resulting in what Max Weber would later dub the \"disenchantment of the world.\"\nNasr has been an unrelenting opponent of Islamic fundamentalism in all its forms throughout his career because he sees it as a somewhat vigilante reactionary movement operating within the paradigm of the modern nation state, but even more so, because it lacks a well thought out metaphysical basis rooted in a traditional Muslim understanding of the world which respects both nature and human dignity.\n\nThere are several intellectual figures who continue to be very influential in Iranian society, while they do not belong to any of the above-mentioned philosophical circles:\n\nScholars:\n\nEconomists:\n\nExperts on law and political sciences:\n\nPhilosophy has become a popular subject of study during last few decades in Iran. Comparing the number of philosophy books currently published in Iran with that in other countries, Iran possibly ranks first in this field but it is definitely on top in terms of publishing philosophy books. Currently different approaches are working in a diverging fields of philosophy:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "206342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206342", "title": "James McCosh", "text": "James McCosh\n\nJames McCosh (April 1, 1811 – November 16, 1894) was a prominent philosopher of the Scottish School of Common Sense. He was president of Princeton University 1868-1888.\n\nMcCosh was born of a Covenanting family in Ayrshire, and studied at the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, obtaining his M.A. at the latter, at the suggestion of Sir William Hamilton, for an essay on stoicism. He became a minister of the Established Church of Scotland in 1834, serving as pastor first at Arbroath and then at Brechin. He sided with the Free Church of Scotland in the Disruption of 1843, becoming minister at Brechin's new East Free Church. In 1850 or 1851 he was appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at Queen's College, Belfast (now Queen's University Belfast).\n\nIn 1868 he travelled to the United States to become president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He resigned the presidency in 1888, but continued to teach philosophy until his death. McCosh Hall (home of the English department) and a cross-campus walkway are named in his honor. The campus infirmary is named after his wife, Isabella McCosh. A school on the South Side of Chicago was named after him, but has since been renamed the Emmett Louis Till Math & Science Academy.\n\nMcCosh's position was mainly in the tradition of Thomas Reid and other Scottish common-sense philosophers. He denied that our beliefs about the nature of the external world rest on causal or other inferences from perceptual ideas, but held that they are the direct accompaniments of sensation, and thus not open to question. He also argued for the \"a priori\" nature of fundamental principles such as those of causality and morality. Our judgements and other cognitions are regulated by such principles, though that is not to say that everyone is aware of them; they can be reached through reflection on our experience, when they are recognised as self-evidently necessary. In his moral theory, especially, McCosh differed from many of his contemporaries in being relatively uninfluenced by Kant.\n\nMcCosh's most original work concerned the attempt to reconcile evolution and Christianity. In 1874, Charles Hodge, the theologian and intellectual leader at the Presbyterian Seminary in Princeton, published \"What is Darwinism?\", claiming that Darwinism, was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Hodge's views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. Hodge simply refused to accept that natural laws alone could create complex organisms that fit into their niches so perfectly and that evolution could explain origins. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile at the college across town (a totally separate institution) President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However in 1868, McCosh became president at the college. McCosh realized that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus demonstrated that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. McCosh thus argued that evolution, far from being inconsistent with belief in divine design, glorifies the divine designer (see for example his \"Christianity and Positivism\"). This aspect of his work found popularity among most Presbyterians clergy, who found his arguments useful in their attempts to cope with scientific philosophy. The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge's position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college (Princeton University) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.\n\nThe debate between McCosh as president of the college and Charles Hodge, head of Princeton Seminary, during the late 1860s and 1870s exemplified the classic conflict between science and religion over the question of Darwin's evolution theory. McCosh offered the first public endorsement of evolution by an American religious leader. However, the two men showed greater similarities regarding matters of science and religion than popularly appreciated. Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion. The debate vitalized the college.\n\n\n"}

He became a major figure in the disturbances of the 1970s that split the university's Department of Philosophy.\n\nIn his book \"Is Democracy Possible? The alternative to electoral politics\" (1985) Burnheim used the term \"demarchy\" (created by Friedrich Hayek in his Law, Legislation and Liberty) to describe a political system without the state or bureaucracies, and based instead on randomly selected groups of decision makers. This has striking resemblances to classical democratic ideas, as reported by Thucydides. In 2006 Burnheim published a second edition with a new preface in which he directed the reader to an emphasis that \"a polity organised by negotiation between specialised authorities would work much better than one based on centralised authority\".\n\nDemarchy as Burnheim conceives it has two features that distinguish it from other proposals for selection by lot in politics:\n\n\n\nIn 2016 John Burnheim published \"The Demarchy Manifesto: for better public policy.\" Where \"Is Democracy Possible\" is theoretical, the manifesto suggests a practical approach to current problems, aimed at divorcing the process of \"enlightening, articulating and giving effect to public opinion\" on selected issues of policy from the electoral party system. It envisaged setting up a public foundation, financed by private contributions, to conduct the proceedings, relying on the complete transparency and participatory amplitude of it proceedings to justify its claim to articulate a view that deserved to be seen as serious public opinion on a range of important matters. The key to complete openness is a website to which anybody who chooses to do so may contribute, dedicated to deciding the best way of dealing with a specific problem. Contributors would be expected to appeal to considerations that most people would accept as directly relevant to the particular problem. The editors would attempt to see that all the considerations that either ordinary people or experts might have were thoroughly debated, establishing the considerations a good solution should take into account. That discussion should lead to clarity about just what facts and values are relevant, but still leave a lot of disagreement about the relative weight placed on them in articulating an acceptable decision. A second small body would be charged with attempting to arrive at a practical compromise between conflicting considerations. The suggestion is that this should be a small committee, statistically representative of the interests most strongly advantaged or disadvantaged by what is to be decided. This body would also operate entirely by correspondence online, open to comment at every stage.\n\nThe book tries to tie this proposal up with a realistic approach to the more general issues of public goods, practical uncertainty, social processes and global problems.\n\n"}

{"id": "15626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15626", "title": "John Stuart Mill", "text": "John Stuart Mill\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 – 8 May 1873), usually cited as J. S. Mill, was a British philosopher, political economist, and civil servant. One of the most influential thinkers in the history of liberalism, he contributed widely to social theory, political theory, and political economy. Dubbed \"the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century\", Mill's conception of liberty justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control.\n\nMill was a proponent of utilitarianism, an ethical theory developed by his predecessor Jeremy Bentham. He contributed to the investigation of scientific methodology, though his knowledge of the topic was based on the writings of others, notably William Whewell, John Herschel, and Auguste Comte, and research carried out for Mill by Alexander Bain. Mill engaged in written debate with Whewell.\n\nA member of the Liberal Party, he was also the first Member of Parliament to call for women's suffrage.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was born at 13 Rodney Street in Pentonville, Middlesex, the eldest son of the Scottish philosopher, historian and economist James Mill, and Harriet Barrow. John Stuart was educated by his father, with the advice and assistance of Jeremy Bentham and Francis Place. He was given an extremely rigorous upbringing, and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings. His father, a follower of Bentham and an adherent of associationism, had as his explicit aim to create a genius intellect that would carry on the cause of utilitarianism and its implementation after he and Bentham had died.\n\nMill was a notably precocious child. He describes his education in his autobiography. At the age of three he was taught Greek. By the age of eight, he had read \"Aesop's Fables\", Xenophon's \"Anabasis\", and the whole of Herodotus, and was acquainted with Lucian, Diogenes Laërtius, Isocrates and six dialogues of Plato. He had also read a great deal of history in English and had been taught arithmetic, physics and astronomy.\n\nAt the age of eight, Mill began studying Latin, the works of Euclid, and algebra, and was appointed schoolmaster to the younger children of the family. His main reading was still history, but he went through all the commonly taught Latin and Greek authors and by the age of ten could read Plato and Demosthenes with ease. His father also thought that it was important for Mill to study and compose poetry. One of Mill's earliest poetic compositions was a continuation of the Iliad. In his spare time he also enjoyed reading about natural sciences and popular novels, such as \"Don Quixote\" and \"Robinson Crusoe\".\n\nHis father's work, \"The History of British India\" was published in 1818; immediately thereafter, at about the age of twelve, Mill began a thorough study of the scholastic logic, at the same time reading Aristotle's logical treatises in the original language. In the following year he was introduced to political economy and studied Adam Smith and David Ricardo with his father, ultimately completing their classical economic view of factors of production. Mill's \"comptes rendus\" of his daily economy lessons helped his father in writing \"Elements of Political Economy\" in 1821, a textbook to promote the ideas of Ricardian economics; however, the book lacked popular support. Ricardo, who was a close friend of his father, used to invite the young Mill to his house for a walk in order to talk about political economy.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Mill stayed a year in France with the family of Sir Samuel Bentham, brother of Jeremy Bentham. The mountain scenery he saw led to a lifelong taste for mountain landscapes. The lively and friendly way of life of the French also left a deep impression on him. In Montpellier, he attended the winter courses on chemistry, zoology, logic of the \"Faculté des Sciences\", as well as taking a course in higher mathematics. While coming and going from France, he stayed in Paris for a few days in the house of the renowned economist Jean-Baptiste Say, a friend of Mill's father. There he met many leaders of the Liberal party, as well as other notable Parisians, including Henri Saint-Simon.\n\nMill went through months of sadness and pondered suicide at twenty years of age. According to the opening paragraphs of Chapter V of his autobiography, he had asked himself whether the creation of a just society, his life's objective, would actually make him happy. His heart answered \"no\", and unsurprisingly he lost the happiness of striving towards this objective. Eventually, the poetry of William Wordsworth showed him that beauty generates compassion for others and stimulates joy. With renewed joy he continued to work towards a just society, but with more relish for the journey. He considered this one of the most pivotal shifts in his thinking. In fact, many of the differences between him and his father stemmed from this expanded source of joy.\n\nMill had been engaged in a pen-friendship with Auguste Comte, the founder of positivism and sociology, since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comte's \"sociologie\" was more an early philosophy of science than we perhaps know it today, and the \"positive\" philosophy aided in Mill's broad rejection of Benthamism.\n\nAs a nonconformist who refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, Mill was not eligible to study at the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge. Instead he followed his father to work for the East India Company, and attended University College, London, to hear the lectures of John Austin, the first Professor of Jurisprudence. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1856.\n\nMill's career as a colonial administrator at the British East India Company spanned from when he was 17 years old in 1823 until 1858, when the Company was abolished in favor of direct rule by the British crown over India. In 1836, he was promoted to the Company's Political Department, where he was responsible for correspondence pertaining to the Company's relations with the princely states, and in 1856, was finally promoted to the position of Examiner of Indian Correspondence. In \"On Liberty\", \"A Few Words on Non-Intervention\", and other works, Mill defended British imperialism by arguing that a fundamental distinction existed between civilized and barbarous peoples. Mill viewed countries such as India and China as having once been progressive, but that were now stagnant and barbarous, thus legitimizing British rule as benevolent despotism, \"provided the end is [the barbarians'] improvement.\" When the crown proposed to take direct control over the colonies in India, he was tasked with defending Company rule, penning \"Memorandum on the Improvements in the Administration of India during the Last Thirty Years\" among other petitions. He was offered a seat on the Council of India, the body created to advise the new Secretary of State for India, but declined, citing his disapproval of the new system of rule.\n\nIn 1851, Mill married Harriet Taylor after 21 years of intimate friendship. Taylor was married when they met, and their relationship was close but generally believed to be chaste during the years before her first husband died. Brilliant in her own right, Taylor was a significant influence on Mill's work and ideas during both friendship and marriage. His relationship with Harriet Taylor reinforced Mill's advocacy of women's rights. He cites her influence in his final revision of \"On Liberty\", which was published shortly after her death. Taylor died in 1858 after developing severe lung congestion, after only seven years of marriage to Mill.\n\nBetween the years 1865 and 1868 Mill served as Lord Rector of the University of St. Andrews. During the same period, 1865–68, he was a Member of Parliament for City and Westminster. He was sitting for the Liberal Party. During his time as an MP, Mill advocated easing the burdens on Ireland. In 1866, Mill became the first person in the history of Parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote, vigorously defending this position in subsequent debate. Mill became a strong advocate of such social reforms as labour unions and farm cooperatives. In \"Considerations on Representative Government\", Mill called for various reforms of Parliament and voting, especially proportional representation, the single transferable vote, and the extension of suffrage. In April 1868, Mill favoured in a Commons debate the retention of capital punishment for such crimes as aggravated murder; he termed its abolition \"an effeminacy in the general mind of the country.\"\n\nHe was godfather to the philosopher Bertrand Russell.\n\nIn his views on religion, Mill was an agnostic.\n\nMill died in 1873 of erysipelas in Avignon, France, where his body was buried alongside his wife's.\n\nMill joined the debate over scientific method which followed on from John Herschel's 1830 publication of \"A Preliminary Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy\", which incorporated inductive reasoning from the known to the unknown, discovering general laws in specific facts and verifying these laws empirically. William Whewell expanded on this in his 1837 \"History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time\" followed in 1840 by \"The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon their History\", presenting induction as the mind superimposing concepts on facts. Laws were self-evident truths, which could be known without need for empirical verification. Mill countered this in 1843 in \"A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive, Being a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence, and the Methods of Scientific Investigation.\" In Mill's Methods of induction, like Herschel's, laws were discovered through observation and induction, and required empirical verification.\n\nMill's \"On Liberty\" addresses the nature and limits of the power that can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. However Mill is clear that his concern for liberty does not extend to all individuals and all societies. He states that \"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians\".\n\nMill states that it is acceptable to harm oneself as long as the person doing so is not harming others. He also argues that individuals should be prevented from doing lasting, serious harm to themselves or their property by the harm principle. Because no one exists in isolation, harm done to oneself may also harm others, and destroying property deprives the community as well as oneself. Mill excuses those who are \"incapable of self-government\" from this principle, such as young children or those living in \"backward states of society\".\n\nThough this principle seems clear, there are a number of complications. For example, Mill explicitly states that \"harms\" may include acts of omission as well as acts of commission. Thus, failing to rescue a drowning child counts as a harmful act, as does failing to pay taxes, or failing to appear as a witness in court. All such harmful omissions may be regulated, according to Mill. By contrast, it does not count as harming someone if – without force or fraud – the affected individual consents to assume the risk: thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others, provided there is no deception involved. (Mill does, however, recognise one limit to consent: society should not permit people to sell themselves into slavery). In these and other cases, it is important to bear in mind that the arguments in \"On Liberty\" are grounded on the principle of Utility, and not on appeals to natural rights.\n\nThe question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions, whether of omission or commission, constitute harmful actions subject to regulation, continues to exercise interpreters of Mill. It is important to emphasise that Mill did not consider giving offence to constitute \"harm\"; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society.\n\n\"On Liberty\" involves an impassioned defense of free speech. Mill argues that free discourse is a necessary condition for intellectual and social progress. We can never be sure, he contends, that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth. He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons. First, individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas. Second, by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate, these beliefs are kept from declining into mere dogma. It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one. Along those same lines Mill wrote, \"unmeasured vituperation, employed on the side of prevailing opinion, really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who express them.\"\n\nMill believed that \"the struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history\". For him, liberty in antiquity was a \"contest ... between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government.\" Mill defined \"social liberty\" as protection from \"the tyranny of political rulers\". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and tyranny of the majority.\n\nSocial liberty for Mill meant putting limits on the ruler's power so that he would not be able to use his power on his own wishes and make decisions which could harm society; in other words, people should have the right to have a say in the government's decisions. He said that social liberty was \"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual\". It was attempted in two ways: first, by obtaining recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights; second, by establishment of a system of \"constitutional checks\".\n\nHowever, in Mill's view, limiting the power of government was not enough. He stated, \"Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.\"\n\nJohn Stuart Mill's view on liberty, which was influenced by Joseph Priestley and Josiah Warren, is that the individual ought to be free to do as she/he wishes unless she/he harms others. Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well being. Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society. Mill explained:\n\nThe sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right ... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns him, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\n\nAn influential advocate of freedom of speech, Mill objected to censorship. He says:\n\nI choose, by preference the cases which are least favourable to me – In which the argument opposing freedom of opinion, both on truth and that of utility, is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality ... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question \"for others\", without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However, positive anyone's persuasion may be, not only of the faculty but of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of opinion. – yet if, in pursuance of that private judgement, though backed by the public judgement of his country or contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal.\n\nMill outlines the benefits of 'searching for and discovering the truth' as a way to further knowledge. He argued that even if an opinion is false, the truth can be better understood by refuting the error. And as most opinions are neither completely true nor completely false, he points out that allowing free expression allows the airing of competing views as a way to preserve partial truth in various opinions. Worried about minority views being suppressed, Mill also argued in support of freedom of speech on political grounds, stating that it is a critical component for a representative government to have in order to empower debate over public policy. Mill also eloquently argued that freedom of expression allows for personal growth and self-realization. He said that freedom of speech was a vital way to develop talents and realise a person's potential and creativity. He repeatedly said that eccentricity was preferable to uniformity and stagnation.\n\nThe belief that the freedom of speech will advance the society was formed with trust of the public's ability to filter. If any argument is really wrong or harmful, the public will judge it as wrong or harmful, and then those arguments cannot be sustained and will be excluded. Mill argued that even any arguments which are used in justifying murder or rebellion against the government shouldn't be politically suppressed or socially persecuted. According to him, if rebellion is really necessary, people should rebel; if murder is truly proper, it should be allowed. But, the way to express those arguments should be a public speech or writing, not in a way that causes actual harm to others. This is the harm principle.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made the standard of \"clear and present danger\" based on Mill's idea. In the majority opinion, Holmes writes:\n\nHolmes suggested that shouting out \"Fire!\" in a dark theatre, which makes people panic and gets them injured, would be such a case of speech that creates an illegal danger. But if the situation allows people to reason by themselves and decide to accept it or not, any argument or theology should not be blocked.\n\nNowadays, Mill's argument is generally accepted by many democratic countries, and they have laws at least guided by the harm principle. For example, in American law some exceptions limit free speech such as obscenity, defamation, breach of peace, and \"fighting words\".\n\nMill, an employee for the British East India Company from 1823 to 1858, argued in support of what he called a 'benevolent despotism' with regard to the colonies. Mill argued that \"To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error. ... To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations, only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject.\"\n\nIn 1850, Mill sent an anonymous letter (which came to be known under the title \"The Negro Question\"), in rebuttal to Thomas Carlyle's anonymous letter to \"Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country\" in which Carlyle argued for slavery. Mill supported abolition in the United States.\n\nIn Mill's essay from 1869, \"The Subjection of Women\", he expressed his opposition to slavery:\n\nThis absolutely extreme case of the law of force, condemned by those who can tolerate almost every other form of arbitrary power, and which, of all others, presents features the most revolting to the feeling of all who look at it from an impartial position, was the law of civilized and Christian England within the memory of persons now living: and in one half of Angle-Saxon America three or four years ago, not only did slavery exist, but the slave trade, and the breeding of slaves expressly for it, was a general practice between slave states. Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it, but, in England at least, a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it, than of any other of the customary abuses of force: for its motive was the love of gain, unmixed and undisguised: and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country, while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it, was unmitigated abhorrence.\n\nMill's view of history was that right up until his time \"the whole of the female\" and \"the great majority of the male sex\" were simply \"slaves\". He countered arguments to the contrary, arguing that relations between sexes simply amounted to \"the legal subordination of one sex to the other – [which] is wrong itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality.\" With this, Mill can be considered among the earliest male proponents of gender equality. His book \"The Subjection of Women\" (1861, published 1869) is one of the earliest written on this subject by a male author. In \"The Subjection of Women\" Mill attempts to make a case for perfect equality. He talks about the role of women in marriage and how it needed to be changed. There, Mill comments on three major facets of women's lives that he felt are hindering them: society and gender construction, education, and marriage. He argued that the oppression of women was one of the few remaining relics from ancient times, a set of prejudices that severely impeded the progress of humanity.\n\nAs a Member of Parliament, Mill introduced an unsuccessful amendment to the Reform Bill to substitute the word 'person' in place of 'man'.\n\nThe canonical statement of Mill's utilitarianism can be found in \"Utilitarianism\". This philosophy has a long tradition, although Mill's account is primarily influenced by Jeremy Bentham and Mill's father James Mill.\n\nJeremy Bentham's famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the \"greatest-happiness principle\". It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings, within reason. In a similar vein, Mill's method of determining the best utility is that a moral agent, when given the choice between two or more actions, ought to choose the action that contributes most to (maximizes) the total happiness in the world. Happiness in this context is understood as the production of pleasure or privation of pain. Given that determining the action that produces the most utility is not always so clear cut, Mill suggests that the utilitarian moral agent, when attempting to rank the utility of different actions, should refer to the general experience of persons. That is, if people generally experience more happiness following action X than they do action Y, the utilitarian should conclude that action X produces more utility than, and is thus favorable to, action Y.\n\nUtilitarianism is built upon the basis of consequentialism, that is, the means are justified based solely off the result of said actions. The overarching goal of Utilitarianism – the ideal consequence – is to achieve the \"greatest good for the greatest number as the end result of human action\". Mill states in his writings on Utilitarianism that \"happiness is the sole end of human action.\" This statement brought about a bit of controversy, which is why Mill took it a step further, explaining how the very nature of humans wanting happiness, and who \"take it to be reasonable under free consideration\", demands that happiness is indeed desirable. In other words, free will leads everyone to make actions inclined on their own happiness, unless reasoned that it would improve the happiness of others, in which case, the greatest utility is still being achieved. To that extent, the Utilitarianism that Mill is describing is a default lifestyle that he believes is what people who have not studied a specific opposing field of ethics would naturally and subconsciously utilize when faced with decision. Utilitarianism is thought of by some of its activists to be a more developed and overarching ethical theory of Kant's belief in good will however, and not just some default cognitive process of humans. Where Kant would argue that reason can only be used properly by good will, Mill would say that the only way to universally create fair laws and systems would be to step back to the consequences, whereby Kant's ethical theories become based around the ultimate good – utility. By this logic the only valid way to discern what is proper reason would be to view the consequences of any action and weigh the good and the bad, even if on the surface, the ethical reasoning seems to indicate a different train of thought.\n\nMill's major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (higher pleasures) are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (lower pleasures). Mill distinguishes between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter, a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that \"it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.\"\n\nMill defines the difference between higher and lower forms of pleasure with the principle that those who have experienced both tend to prefer one over the other. This is, perhaps, in direct contrast with Bentham's statement that \"Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry\", that, if a simple child's game like hopscotch causes more pleasure to more people than a night at the opera house, it is more imperative upon a society to devote more resources to propagating hopscotch than running opera houses. Mill's argument is that the \"simple pleasures\" tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art, and are therefore not in a proper position to judge. Mill also argues that people who, for example, are noble or practice philosophy, benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure, which are lower forms of happiness. It is not the agent's own greatest happiness that matters \"but the greatest amount of happiness altogether\".\n\nMill separated his explanation of Utilitarianism into five different sections; General Remarks, What Utilitarianism Is, Of the Ultimate Sanction of the Principle of Utility, Of What Sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible, and Of the Connection between Justice and Utility. In the General Remarks portion of his essay he speaks how next to no progress has been made when it comes to judging what is right and what is wrong of morality and if there is such a thing as moral instinct (which he argues that there may not be). However he agrees that in general \"Our moral faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of moral judgments\". In the second chapter of his essay he focuses no longer on background information but Utilitarianism itself. He quotes Utilitarianism as \"The greatest happiness principle\" And defines this theory by saying that pleasure and no pain are the only inherently good things in the world and expands on it by saying that \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.\" He views it not as an animalistic concept because he sees seeking out pleasure as a way of using our higher facilities. He also says in this chapter that the happiness principle is based not exclusively on the individual but mainly on the community.\n\nIn his next chapter he focuses in more on the specifics of Utilitarianism when he writes about the sanctions of oneself. He states that a person possesses two sanctions; the internal sanction and the external sanction. According to Mill, the internal sanction is \"a feeling in our own mind; a pain, more or less intense, attendant on violation of duty, which in properly cultivated moral natures rises, in the more serious cases, into shrinking from it as an impossibility.\" Shorthand, he basically just explains that your internal sanction is your conscience. The external sanction he says is \"the hope of favour and the fear of displeasure, from our fellow creatures or from the Ruler of the Universe\". This states that the external sanction is almost a form of fear of God himself. The sanctions are mentioned because according to Mill the internal sanction is what grasps onto the concept of Utilitarianism and is what makes people want to accept Utilitarianism.\n\nIn Mill's fourth chapter he speaks of what proofs of Utility are affected. He starts this chapter off by saying that all of his claims cannot be backed up by reasoning. He claims that the only proof that something is brings one pleasure is if someone finds it pleasurable. Next he talks about how morality is the basic way to achieve happiness. He also discusses in this chapter that Utilitarianism is beneficial for virtue. He says that \"it maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be desired disinterestedly, for itself.\" In his final chapter Mill looks and the connection between Utilitarianism and justice. He contemplates the question of whether justice is something distinct from Utility or not. He reasons this question in several different ways and finally comes to the conclusion that in certain cases justice is essential for Utility, but in others social duty is far more important than justice. Mill believes that \"justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case.\"\n\nThe qualitative account of happiness that Mill advocates thus sheds light on his account presented in \"On Liberty\". As Mill suggests in that text, utility is to be conceived in relation to humanity \"as a progressive being\", which includes the development and exercise of rational capacities as we strive to achieve a \"higher mode of existence\". The rejection of censorship and paternalism is intended to provide the necessary social conditions for the achievement of knowledge and the greatest ability for the greatest number to develop and exercise their deliberative and rational capacities.\n\nMill redefines the definition of happiness as; \"the ultimate end, for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is an existence as free as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments\". He firmly believed that moral rules and obligations could be referenced to promoting happiness, which connects to having a noble character. While John Stuart Mill is not a standard act or rule utilitarian, he is a minimizing utilitarian, which \"affirms that it would be \"desirable\" to maximize happiness for the greatest number, but not that we are not morally \"required\" to do so\".\n\nMill's thesis distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures. He frequently discusses the importance of acknowledgement of higher pleasures. \"To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure- no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit they designate as utterly mean and groveling; as a doctrine worthy only of swine\". When he says higher pleasures, he means the pleasures that access higher abilities and capacities in humans such as intellectual prosperity, whereas lower pleasures would mean bodily or temporary pleasures. \"But it must be admitted that when utilitarian writers have said that mental pleasures are better than bodily ones they have mainly based this on mental pleasures being more permanent, safer, less costly and so on – i.e. from their circumstantial advantages rather than from their intrinsic nature\". All of this factors into John Mill's own definition of utilitarianism, and shows why it differs from other definitions.\n\nMill's early economic philosophy was one of free markets. However, he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare. Mill originally believed that \"equality of taxation\" meant \"equality of sacrifice\" and that progressive taxation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore \"a mild form of robbery\".\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that inheritance should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes – some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.\n\nLater he altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes. Within this revised work he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained, albeit altered in the third edition of the \"Principles of Political Economy\" to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on \"unearned\" incomes, which he favoured, and those on \"earned\" incomes, which he did not favour.\n\nMill's \"Principles\", first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period. As Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\" had during an earlier period, Mill's \"Principles\" dominated economics teaching. In the case of Oxford University it was the standard text until 1919, when it was replaced by Marshall's \"Principles of Economics\".\n\nMill promoted economic democracy instead of capitalism, in the manner of substituting capitalist businesses with worker cooperatives. He says:\n\nThe form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.\n\nMill's major work on political democracy, \"Considerations on Representative Government\", defends two fundamental principles: extensive participation by citizens and enlightened competence of rulers. The two values are obviously in tension, and some readers have concluded that he is an elitist democrat, while others count him as an earlier participatory democrat. In one section he appears to defend plural voting, in which more competent citizens are given extra votes (a view he later repudiated). But in chapter 3 he presents what is still one of the most eloquent cases for the value of participation by all citizens. He believed that the incompetence of the masses could eventually be overcome if they were given a chance to take part in politics, especially at the local level.\n\nMill is one of the few political philosophers ever to serve in government as an elected official. In his three years in Parliament, he was more willing to compromise than the \"radical\" principles expressed in his writing would lead one to expect.\n\nMill demonstrated an early insight into the value of the natural world – in particular in Book IV, chapter VI of \"Principles of Political Economy\": \"Of the Stationary State\" in which Mill recognised wealth beyond the material, and argued that the logical conclusion of unlimited growth was destruction of the environment and a reduced quality of life. He concluded that a stationary state could be preferable to unending economic growth:\n\nI cannot, therefore, regard the stationary states of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested towards it by political economists of the old school.\n\nIf the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or a happier population, I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compel them to it.\n\nMill regarded economic development as a function of land, labour and capital. While land and labour are the two original factors of production, capital is \"a stock, previously accumulated of the products of former labour.\" Increase in wealth is possible only if land and capital help to increase production faster than the labour force. It is productive labour that is productive of wealth and capital accumulation. \"The rate of capital accumulation is the function of the proportion of the labour force employed productively. Profits earned by employing unproductive labours are merely transfers of income; unproductive labour does not generate wealth or income\". It is productive labourers who do productive consumption. Productive consumption is that \"which maintains and increase the productive capacity of the community.\" It implies that productive consumption is an input necessary to maintain productive labourers.\n\nMill supported the Malthusian theory of population. By population he meant the number of the working class only. He was therefore concerned about the growth in number of labourers who worked for hire. He believed that population control was essential for improving the condition of the working class so that they might enjoy the fruits of the technological progress and capital accumulation. Mill advocated birth control. In 1823 Mill and a friend were arrested while distributing pamphlets on birth control by Francis Place to women in working class areas.\n\nAccording to Mill, supply is very elastic in response to wages. Wages generally exceed the minimum subsistence level, and are paid out of capital. Hence, wages are limited by existing capital for paying wages. Thus, wage per worker can be derived by dividing the total circulating capital by the size of the working population. Wages can increase by an increase in the capital used in paying wages, or by decrease in the number of workers. If wages rise, supply of labour will rise. Competition among workers not only brings down wages, but also keeps some workers out of employment. This is based on Mill's notion that \"demand for commodities is not demand for labourers\". It means that income invested as advances of wages to labour creates employment, and not income spent on consumer goods. An increase in consumption causes a decline in investment. So increased investment leads to increases in the wage fund and to economic progress.\n\nIn 1869, Mill recanted his support of the Wage-Fund Doctrine due to recognition that capital is not necessarily fixed in that it can be supplemented through \"income of the employer which might otherwise go into saving or be spent on consumption.\" Walker also states in \"The Wages Question\" that the limits on capital and the growth in population \"were accidental, not essential\" to the formation of the doctrine. The limitation on the growth of industrial capacity placed a limit on the number of workers who could be accommodated more than the limit on capital. Furthermore, English agriculture \"had reached the condition of diminishing returns.\"; therefore, each additional worker was not providing more output than he needed for himself for survival. Given the improvements in technology and productivity that followed 1848, the original reasons that gave rise to the doctrine were seen to be unusual and not the basis for a universal law.\n\nAccording to Mill, the rate of capital accumulation depends on: (1) \"the amount of fund from which saving can be made\" or \"the size of the net produce of the industry\", and (2) the \"disposition to save\". Capital is the result of savings, and the savings come from the \"abstinence from present consumption for the sake of future goods\". Although capital is the result of saving, it is nevertheless consumed. This means saving is spending. Since saving depends on the net produce of the industry, it grows with profits and rent which go into making the net produce. On the other hand, the disposition to save depends on (1) the rate of profit and (2) the desire to save, or what Mill called \"effective desire of accumulation\". However, profit also depends on the cost of labour, and the rate of profit is the ratio of profits to wages. When profits rise or wages fall, the rate of profits increases, which in turn increases the rate of capital accumulation. Similarly, it is the desire to save which tends to increase the rate of capital accumulation.\n\nAccording to Mill, the ultimate tendency in an economy is for the rate of profit to decline due to diminishing returns in agriculture and increase in population at a Malthusian rate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied philosophy at University College, Oxford, where he received his Bachelor of Philosophy in 1972. He has won several prizes for his academic work, such as the Henry Wilde Prize (in 1969) and the John Locke Prize (in 1971) from Oxford University.\n\nPlatts was a lecturer at Birkbeck College, University of London, for a period in the 1970s and 1980s, where he lectured on philosophical logic and the philosophy of language and also on Descartes and Locke. His colleagues included Roger Scruton, Ian McFetridge, and Samuel Guttenplan. \n\nPlatts was a strong believer in the tutorial system at Birkbeck.\n\nSome of Platts's work has been highly influential. He is well known for his criticisms of the Humean theory of motivation and is considered an \"Anti-Humean\" (along with philosophers like John McDowell). This issue has generated a large body of research in the late 20th century. For example, Michael Smith discusses Platts's Anti-Humeanism at length in his influential book \"The Moral Problem\" (1994), which won the Book Prize of the American Philosophical Association in 2000. \n\nPlatts's book, \"Ways of Meaning\" (1979/1997) has been cited by many prominent philosophers, such as Simon Blackburn, Philip Pettit, William Lycan, Christopher Peacocke, and Ernest Lepore---to name a few.

He was then more attracted to sociology, due to his field experiences (monograph campaigns) under the coordination of professor Dimitrie Gusti.

Vulcănescu was convicted for ”permitting the entry of the German army on the country's territory\" and for \"declaring or continuing the war against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Nations\".\n\nNicolae Mărgineanu, a teacher at the King Ferdinand I University of Cluj-Napoca and a post-mortem member of the Romanian Academy, claimed that the accusations that were brought against Vulcănescu were false and that he was a victim of the Communist regime., as part of a larger scheme of the regime whose aim was to slowly kill of Romanian intellectuals, especially those who opposed the regime.\n\nAccording to Zigu Ornea, Vulcănescu considered himself a sympathizer of the Iron Guard. Other scholars considered him to be \"a supporter of discrimination based on ethnicity\", who, according to the director of the Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania, \"supported spiritually and morally the antisemitism of the government.\"\n\nDespite these claims, in one of his works, Vulcănescu reportedly considered the Iron Guard as a terrorist movement controlled by the Nazi Germany. For these reasons, he refused to join the government lead by The Legionary Movement in 1940.\n\nHe was married twice: to Anina Rădulescu-Pogoneanui, and to Margareta Ioana Niculescu. He had three daughters: Mariuca, Vivi, and Sandra.\n\n"}

It remained unpublished until 1496. The \"Pico Project,\" a collaboration between University of Bologna, Italy, and Brown University, United States, dedicated to the \"Oration\", and others have called it the \"Manifesto of the Renaissance\".\n\nPico, who belonged to the family that had long dwelt in the Castle of Mirandola, left his share of the ancestral principality to his two brothers to devote himself wholly to study. In his fourteenth year, 1477, he went to Bologna accompanied by his mother to study canon law and fit himself for the ecclesiastical career. Following his mother's death in 1478, Pico in 1479 requested from the Marquess of Mantua a free passage to Ferrara, where he would devote himself to the study of philosophy and theology. He spent the following seven years variously in Ferrara, Padua, Florence and Paris, studying Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic at the chief universities of Italy and France.\n\nPico's \"Oration\" attempted to remap the human landscape to center all attention on human capacity and human perspective. Arriving in a place near Florence, he taught the amazing capacity of human achievement. \"Pico himself had a massive intellect and studied everything there was to be studied in the university curriculum of the Renaissance; the \"Oration\" in part is meant to be a preface to a massive compendium of all the intellectual achievements of humanity, a compendium that never appeared because of Pico's early death.\"\n\nPico della Mirandola intended to speak in front of an invited audience of scholars and clerics of the dignity of the liberal arts and about the glory of angels. Of these angels he spoke of three divisions in particular: the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones. These are the highest three choirs in the angel hierarchy, each one embodying a different virtue. The Seraphim represent charity, and in order to obtain the status of Seraphim, Mirandola declares that one must \"burn with love for the Creator\". The Cherubim represent intelligence. This status is obtained through contemplation and meditation. Finally, Thrones represent justice, and this is obtained by being just in ruling over \"inferior things\". Of these three, the Thrones is the lowest, Cherubim the middle, and Seraphim the highest. In this speech, Mirandola emphasizes the Cherubim and that by embodying the values of the Cherub, one can be equally prepared for \"the fire of the Seraphim and the judgement of the Thrones\". This deviation into the hierarchy of angels makes sense when Pico della Mirandola makes his point that a philosopher \"is a creature of Heaven and not of earth\" because they are capable of obtaining any one of the statuses.\n\nIn the \"Oration\", Pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a Neoplatonic framework. He writes that after God had created all creatures, He conceived of the desire for another sentient being who would appreciate all His works, but there was no longer any room in the chain of being; all the possible slots from angels to worms had been filled. So, God created man such that he had no specific slot in the chain. Instead, men were capable of learning from and imitating any existing creature. When man philosophizes, he ascends the chain of being towards the angels, and communion with God. When he fails to exercise his intellect, he vegetates. Pico did not fail to notice that this system made philosophers like himself among the most dignified human creatures.\n\nThe idea that men could ascend the chain of being through the exercise of their intellectual capacities was a profound endorsement of the dignity of human existence in this earthly life. The root of this dignity lay in his assertion that only human beings could change themselves through their own free will, whereas all other changes in nature were the result of some outside force acting on whatever it is that undergoes change. He observed from history that philosophies and institutions were always in change, making man's capacity for self-transformation the only constant. Coupled with his belief that all of creation constitutes a symbolic reflection of the divinity of God, Pico's philosophies had a profound influence on the arts, helping to elevate writers and painters from their medieval role as mere artisans to the Renaissance ideal of the artist as genius.\n\nThe \"Oration\" also served as an introduction to Pico's 900 theses, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are a good example of humanist syncretism, because Pico combined Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics. Pico also argued in this oration that his youth should not discredit any of the content of his 900 theses (he was in his twenties).\n\nPico had \"cosmic ambitions\": in his letters and early texts, he hinted that debate of the 900 theses (the first printed book ever universally banned by the Church) might trigger Christ's Second Coming and the end of the world.. Innocent VIII condemned the theses in general but declared the author to be free from censure. This was written in August 5, 1487 but it was not issued until the following December. In a letter to Lorenzo dated August 27, 1489, Pico affirms among other things some of his thesis refer purely to profane matters and were never intended for general reading, but for private debate among the learned.\n\nIn the \"Oration\" he writes that \"human vocation is a mystical vocation that has to be realized following a three stage way, which comprehends necessarily moral transformation, intellectual research and final perfection in the identity with the absolute reality. This paradigm is universal, because it can be retraced in every tradition.\"\n\nHere Pico explains why he chose to become a philosopher. A paraphrase of paragraph 24:\nThese are the reasons why I decided to study philosophy. And I'm not going to explain them to anyone except those who condemn philosophy. Philosophy is not something to be used scornfully or as insult, but for honor and glory. People are beginning to think wrongly in that philosophy should only be studied by very few, if any at all, as if it is something of little worth. We have reduced philosophy to only being useful when being used for profit. I say these things with regret and indignation for the philosophers who say it should not be pursued because it has no value, thus disqualifying themselves as philosophers. Since they are in it for their own personal gain, they miss the truth for its own sake. I'm going to say, not to brag, but I've never philosophized except for the sake of philosophy, and have never desired it for my own cultivation. I have been able to lose myself in philosophy and not be influenced by others who try to pull me away from it. Philosophy has taught me to rely on my own convictions rather than on the judgments of others and to concern myself less with whether I am well thought of than whether what I do or say is evil.\n\nPico was prevented from holding his Oration. It was penned as the opening speech for a public disputation of his 900 theses, planned for early 1487, but Pope Innocent VIII suspended the event and instead set up a commission to examine the theses for heresy. A presentation of the full text in English in front of a live audience read by Sebastian Michael took place at TU Wien (University of Technology Vienna) as part of the opening event of the first Sophistication Conference organised by the Department for Architecture Theory and Philosophy of Technics on 7 December 2017. \n\n"}

Therefore, it also means invisible, remote, hidden or mysterious. \nThe Aitareya Brahmana VII.30 gives its meaning as \"mysterious\" and \"mystery\" – \"\"tan nayogrohan santan nyogrodhan ity achakshate parokshena, paroksha-priya iva hi deva\" (The nyogodha is called nyogrodha after the mysterious (etymology) for the gods like mystery.) \n\nThe Caravaka school of thought which does not believe in causation and its universality, advocating naïve realism and empiricism rejects inference as a means of valid knowledge because it depends upon \"vyapti\" i.e. the universal concomitance between the middle term and the major term, and because one \"vyapti\" is based on another \"vyapti\" thus involving an infinite argument. According to this school \"vyapti\" can only be known through perception of perceptible things alone and therefore, perception is the only means of valid knowledge. This school does not consider imperceptible things to exist.\n\nGautama Buddha is believed to have directed all monks and scholars to thoroughly analyze his words and not adopt them for the sake of respect. He taught rationalism and trust in one's own reasoning and belief, and spoke about the distinction between the mere reception of truth and the knowledge of truth which involves rational conviction. The later Buddhist thinkers such as the Sautrantikas, opposed to the Yogacaras who deny the reality of external objects reducing them to cognitions, advocating indirect realism recognized the reality of external objects which produced their own cognitions and imprinted their forms on them as being basically perceptible; they developed the doctrine of impermanence into the ontological doctrine of momentariness Dharmakirti considered the so-called external objects as mere sensations, that all object-cognitions are due to the revival of the sub-conscious impressions deposited in the mind which are not excited by external objects. The Madhyamakas regard external objects and subjective cognitions to be equally essenceless with Sunya as their eternal basis and reject the plurality of external objects and internal cognitions because of their relativity. Buddha’s teachings lend support to the three valid cognizers which are the three consciousnesses that comprehend the manifest (visible phenomena), the slightly hidden phenomena or \"kimchid-paroksha\" (which can be inferred) and the very hidden phenomena or \"atyartha-paroksha\" (which is known through the power of belief).\n\nThe followers of the Jain School of Thought consider knowledge as emanating from the soul to be \"Pratyaksha\" (direct cognition) and the knowledge which is inherited from the senses, \"Paroksha\" (indirect cognition); paroksha-knowledge is gained with the help of the mind and senses (\"Mati\") or through what is heard or learnt (\"Shruti\"). According to this school Mediate knowledge (Paroksha), which is Valid knowledge (Pramana), though indistinct and devoid of perceptual vividness, is of five kinds – Recollection that determines the real nature of an object perceived in the past, Recognition that knows a present perceived object as known in the past, Induction which is knowledge of the past invariable \"vyapti\" arising from the observation of their co-presence and co-absence, Deduction or Inference (anumana) which is based on \"vyapti\" derived induction and Testimony is the knowledge of objects derived from words of reliable persons, which are all secondary sources that involve conceptualization of the object of knowledge by means of rational or analytical thought processes. Thus, Paroksha is second-hand knowledge.\n\nAccording to the Advaita school \"Paroksha\" consists in the intellectual assent to a stated proposition and \"Aparoksha\" consists in the actual realization of that proposition. In \"Paroksha\" there is the distinction between the subjective concept and the objective reality which that concept represents in consciousness but which distinction is irrelevant in the case of \"Aparoksha\" knowledge. A man is said to attain \"paroksha\" (indirect) wisdom when he knows (theoretically) that Brahman exists; but he is said to attain \"sakshatkara\" (direct cognition) when he knows (or realises) that he is himself Brahman. Then, he becomes Jivanmukta. Vedanta conveys the \"aparoksha\" Absolute in a \"paroksha\" way which is a valid way because while referring to certain facts about Brahman \"paroksha\" does not refer to unrealities. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (XI.xxi.35) it refers to the indirect (\"proksha\") statements of the rishis. The rishis of the Vedas are found to speak variously about Brahman in an indirect manner (\"proksha-vada\") e.g. \"The eye, O Emperor, is the Supreme Brahman\" or \"This being who is in the right eye is named Indha. Though he is Indha , he is indirectly called Indra, for the gods have a fondness, as it were, for indirect names, and hate to be called indirectly\"\". Thus, \"paroksha\" is \"This\", and \"aparoksha\" is \"That\" of the Upanishads. \"Paroksha wisdom\" or mediate knowledge, which is right perception, does not liberate a person from Saṃsāra but it is confirmed by \"Aparoksha wisdom\". The \"paroksha-vada\" (indirect injunctions) of the Vedic rishis indirectly leads one to the path of liberation Srimad-Bhagavatam (XI.iii.44).\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita XIII.12-13, Krishna tells Arjuna about that which is to be known, and also about that by realizing which one attains immortality. This is \"paroksha wisdom\" by which the attention of the listener is aroused and the fruit of such knowledge is indicated viz - the knowledge of the knowable beginningless attributeless Brahman gaining which one gains the \"aparoksha wisdom\", the knowledge of the Knower of the field, Brahman who exists but transcends all verbal expressions, who cannot be expressed in terms like existence and non-existence.\n\nShankara explains that Krishna objectifies the acosmic through the process of superimposition and sublation by designating Brahman as the field-knower by employing the adjunct, field, variously pluralised due to hands, feet, etc. Brahman is to be realised as existing. And, Badarayana (Brahma Sutras III.ii.15) states that like light, the non-dual formless Brahman in connection with Upadhis (limiting adjuncts) appears to have a form.\n"}

{"id": "94721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=94721", "title": "Robert Grosseteste", "text": "Robert Grosseteste\n\nRobert Grosseteste ( ; ;  – 9 October 1253) was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents at Stradbroke in Suffolk. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. A. C. Crombie calls him \"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\".\n\nThere is very little direct evidence about Grosseteste's education. He may have received a liberal arts education at Hereford, in light of his connection with the Bishop of Hereford William de Vere in the 1190s and a recommendation from Gerald of Wales. It is fairly certain that Grosseteste was a \"master\" by 1192, but whether that indicated that he had completed a course of studies is unclear. Grosseteste acquired a position in the bishop's household, but at the death of this patron he disappears from the historical record for several years. He appears again in the early thirteenth century as a judge-delegate in Hereford, but there are no surviving details of where he resided or whether he had continued to study.\n\nBy 1225, he had gained the benefice of Abbotsley in the diocese of Lincoln, by which time he was a deacon. On that period in his life, scholarship is divided. Some historians argue that he began his teaching career in theology at Oxford in this year, whereas others have more recently argued that he used the income of his ecclesiastical post to support studies in theology at the University of Paris. However, there is clear evidence that by 1229/30 he was teaching at Oxford, but on the periphery as the lector in theology to the Franciscans, who had established a convent in Oxford about 1224. He remained in this post until March 1235.\n\nGrosseteste may also have been appointed Chancellor of the University of Oxford. However, the evidence for this comes from a late thirteenth century anecdote whose main claim is that Grosseteste was in fact entitled the master of students (\"magister scholarium\").\n\nAt the same time he began lecturing in theology at Oxford, Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, appointed him as Archdeacon of Leicester, and he also gained a prebend that made him a canon in Lincoln Cathedral. However, after a severe illness in 1232, he resigned all his benefices (Abbotsley and Leicester), but retained his prebend. His reasons were due to changing attitudes about the plurality of benefices (holding more than one ecclesiastical position simultaneously), and after seeking advice from the papal court, he tendered his resignations. The angry response of his friends and colleagues to his resignations took him by surprise and he complained to his sister and to his closest friend, the Franciscan Adam Marsh, that his intentions had been completely misunderstood.\n\nAs a master of the sacred page (manuscripts of theology in Latin), Grosseteste trained the Franciscans in the standard curriculum of university theology. The Franciscan Roger Bacon was his most famous disciple, and acquired an interest in the scientific method from him. Grosseteste lectured on the Psalter, the Pauline epistles, Genesis (at least the creation account), and possibly on Isaiah, Daniel and Sirach. He also led disputations on such subjects as the theological nature of truth and the efficacy of the Mosaic Law. Grosseteste also preached at the university and appears to have been called to preach within the diocese as well. He collected some of those sermons, along with some short notes and reflections, not long after he left Oxford; this is now known as his \"Dicta\". His theological writings reveal a continual interest in the natural world as a major resource for theological reflection and an ability to read Greek sources (if he ever learned Hebrew, it would be not until he became bishop of Lincoln). His theological index (\"tabula distinctionum\") reveals the breadth of his learning and his desire to communicate it in a systematic manner. However, Grosseteste's own style was far more unstructured than many of his scholastic contemporaries, and his writings reverberate with his own personal views and outlooks.\n\nIn February 1235, Hugh of Wells died, and the canons of Lincoln cathedral met to elect his successor. They soon were at a deadlock and could not reach a majority. Fearing that the election would be taken out of their hands, they settled on a compromise candidate, Grosseteste. He was consecrated in June of that same year at Reading. He instituted an innovative programme of visitation, a procedure normally reserved for the inspection of monasteries. Grosseteste expanded it to include all the deaneries in each archdeaconry of his vast diocese. The scheme brought him into conflict with more than one privileged corporation, in particular with his own chapter, who vigorously disputed his claim to exercise the right of visitation over their community. The dispute raged hotly from 1239 to 1245, with the chapter launching an appeal to the papacy. In 1245, while attending the First Council of Lyons, the papal court ruled in favour of Grosseteste. Dean William de Thornaco is recorded as being suspended by Bishop Grosseteste in 1239, together with precentor and subdean in relation to the aforementioned matter.\n\nIn ecclesiastical politics the bishop belonged to the school of Becket. His zeal for reform led him to advance, on behalf of the courts, Christian pretensions which it was impossible that the secular power should admit. He twice incurred a rebuke from Henry III upon this subject although it was left for Edward I to settle the question of principle in favour of the state. The devotion of Grosseteste to the hierarchical theories of his age is attested by his correspondence with his chapter and the king. Against the former he upheld the prerogative of the bishops; against the latter he asserted that it was impossible for a bishop to disregard the commands of the Holy See. Where the liberties of the national church came into conflict with the pretensions of Rome he stood by his own countrymen.\n\nThus in 1238 he demanded that the King should release certain Oxford scholars who had assaulted the legate Otto Candidus. But at least up to the year 1247 he submitted patiently to papal encroachments, contenting himself with the protection (by a special papal privilege) of his own diocese from alien clerks. Of royal exactions he was more impatient; and, after the retirement of Archbishop (Saint) Edmund, constituted himself the spokesman of the clerical estate in the Great Council.\n\nIn 1244 he sat on a committee which was empanelled to consider a demand for a subsidy. The committee rejected the demand, and Grosseteste foiled an attempt on the king's part to separate the clergy from the baronage. \"It is written\", the bishop said, \"that united we stand and divided we fall.\"\n\nThe last years of Grosseteste's life and episcopacy were embroiled in a conflict with the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface of Savoy. In 1250, he travelled to the papal court, where one of the cardinals read his complaints at an audience with Innocent IV. He claimed not only that Boniface was threatening the health of the church but also that the pope was just as guilty for not reining him in and that that was symptomatic of the current malaise of the entire church. Most observers noted the personal animus between the bishop of Lincoln and the pope, but it did not stop the pope from agreeing to most of Grosseteste's demands about the way the English church ought to function.\n\nGrosseteste continued to keep a watchful eye on ecclesiastical events. In 1251 he protested against a papal mandate enjoining the English clergy to pay Henry III one-tenth of their revenues for a crusade; and called attention to the fact that, under the system of provisions, a sum of 70,000 marks was annually drawn from England by the alien nominees of Rome. In 1253, upon being commanded to provide in his own diocese for a papal nephew, he wrote a letter of expostulation and refusal, not to the pope himself but to the commissioner, Master Innocent, through whom he received the mandate. The text of the remonstrance, as given in the Burton Annals and in Matthew Paris, has possibly been altered by a forger who had less respect than Grosseteste for the papacy. The language is more violent than that which the bishop elsewhere employs. But the general argument, that the papacy may command obedience only so far as its commands are consonant with the teaching of Christ and the apostles, is only what should be expected from an ecclesiastical reformer of Grosseteste's time. There is much more reason for suspecting the letter addressed \"to the nobles of England, the citizens of London, and the community of the whole realm\", in which Grosseteste is represented as denouncing in unmeasured terms papal finance in all its branches. But even in this case allowance must be made for the difference between modern and medieval standards of decorum.\n\nGrosseteste numbered among his most intimate friends the Franciscan teacher, Adam Marsh. Through Adam he came into close relations with Simon de Montfort. From the Franciscan's letters it appears that the earl had studied a political tract by Grosseteste on the difference between a monarchy and a tyranny and that he embraced with enthusiasm the bishop's projects of ecclesiastical reform. Their alliance began as early as 1239, when Grosseteste exerted himself to bring about a reconciliation between the king and the earl. But there is no reason to suppose that the political ideas of Montfort had matured before the death of Grosseteste; nor did Grosseteste busy himself overmuch with secular politics, except insofar as they touched the interest of the Church. Grosseteste realised that the misrule of Henry III and his unprincipled compact with the papacy largely accounted for the degeneracy of the English hierarchy and the laxity of ecclesiastical discipline. But he can hardly be termed a constitutionalist.\n\nGrosseteste died on 9 October 1253 He was aged between seventy and eighty.\n\nHe is buried in a tomb within his memorial chapel within Lincoln Cathedral. Its dedicatory plaque reads as follows:\n\nGrosseteste was already an elderly man, with a firmly established reputation, when he became a bishop. As an ecclesiastical statesman, he showed the same fiery zeal and versatility of which he had given proof in his academic career; but the general tendency of modern writers has been to exaggerate his political and ecclesiastical services, and to neglect his performance as a scientist and scholar. The opinion of his own age, as expressed by Matthew Paris and Roger Bacon, was very different. His contemporaries, while admitting the excellence of his intentions as a statesman, lay stress upon his defects of temper and discretion. But they see in him the pioneer of a literary and scientific movement; not merely a great ecclesiastic who patronised learning in his leisure hours, but the first mathematician and physicist of his age. He anticipated, in these fields of thought, some of the striking ideas to which Roger Bacon subsequently gave a wider currency.\n\nBishop Grosseteste University, a stone's throw away from Lincoln Cathedral, is named after Robert Grosseteste. The university provides Initial Teacher Training and academic degrees at all levels. In 2003, it hosted an international conference on Grosseteste in honour of the 750th anniversary of his death.\n\nGrosseteste wrote a number of early works in Latin and French while he was a clerk (see biography above), including one called \"Chasteau d'amour\", an allegorical poem on the creation of the world and Christian redemption, as well as several other poems and texts on household management and courtly etiquette. He also wrote a number of theological works including the influential \"Hexaëmeron\" in the 1230s. He was also a highly regarded author of manuals on pastoral care and produced treatises that dealt with a variety of penitential contexts, including monasteries, the parish and a bishop's household.\n\nHowever, Grosseteste is best known as an original thinker for his work concerning what would today be called science or the scientific method.\n\nFrom about 1220 to 1235 he wrote a host of scientific treatises including:\n\n\nIn 1242, having been introduced to the Greek work by John of Basingstoke, Grosseteste had the \"Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs\" brought from Greece and translated it with help of a clerk of St. Albans:\nHe also wrote a number of commentaries on Aristotle, including the first in the West of \"Posterior Analytics\", and one on Aristotle's \"Physics\", which has survived as a loose collection of notes or glosses on the text. Moreover, he did a lot of very interesting work on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy: he translated both the text and the scholia from Greek into Latin and wrote a commentary \n\nIt has been argued that Grosseteste played a key role in the development of the scientific method. Grosseteste did introduce to the Latin West the notion of controlled experiment and related it to demonstrative science, as one among many ways of arriving at such knowledge. Although Grosseteste did not always follow his own advice during his investigations, his work is seen as instrumental in the history of the development of the Western scientific tradition.\n\nGrosseteste was the first of the Scholastics to fully understand Aristotle's vision of the dual path of scientific reasoning: generalising from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this \"resolution and composition\". So, for example, looking at the particulars of the moon, it is possible to arrive at universal laws about nature. Conversely once these universal laws are understood, it is possible to make predictions and observations about other objects besides the moon. Grosseteste said further that both paths should be verified through experimentation to verify the principles involved. These ideas established a tradition that carried forward to Padua and Galileo Galilei in the 17th century.\n\nAs important as \"resolution and composition\" would become to the future of Western scientific tradition, more important to his own time was his idea of the subordination of the sciences. For example, when looking at geometry and optics, optics is subordinate to geometry because optics depends on geometry, and so optics was a prime example of a subalternate science. Thus Grosseteste concluded, following much of what Boethius had argued, that mathematics was the highest of all sciences, and the basis for all others, since every natural science ultimately depended on mathematics. He supported this conclusion by looking at light, which he believed to be the \"first form\" of all things, the source of all generation and motion (approximately what is now known as biology and physics). Hence, since light could be reduced to lines and points, and thus fully explained in the realm of mathematics, mathematics was the highest order of the sciences.\n\nGrosseteste's work in optics was also relevant and would be continued by Roger Bacon, who often mentioned his indebtedness to him although there is no proof that the two ever met. In \"De Iride\" Grosseteste writes:\n\nThis part of optics, when well understood, shows us how we may make things a very long distance off appear as if placed very close, and large near things appear very small, and how we may make small things placed at a distance appear any size we want, so that it may be possible for us to read the smallest letters at incredible distances, or to count sand, or seed, or any sort of minute objects.\n\nEditions of the original Latin text may be found in: \"Die Philosophischen Werke des Robert Grosseteste, Bischofs von Lincoln\" (Münster i. W., Aschendorff, 1912.), p. 75.\n\nGrossesteste is now believed to have had a very modern understanding of colour, and supposed errors in his account have been found to be based on corrupt late copies of his essay on the nature of colour, written in about 1225 (\"De Luce\"). In 2014 Grosseteste's 1225 treatise \"De Luce\" (\"On Light\") was translated from Latin and interpreted by an interdisciplinary project led by Durham University, that included Latinists, philologists, medieval historians, physicists and cosmologists. \"De Luce\" explores the nature of matter and the cosmos. Four centuries before Isaac Newton proposed gravity and seven centuries before the Big Bang theory, Grosseteste described the birth of the Universe in an explosion and the crystallisation of matter to form stars and planets in a set of nested spheres around Earth. \"De Luce\" is the first attempt to describe the heavens and Earth using a single set of physical laws. The 'Ordered Universe' collaboration of scientists and historians at Durham University studying medieval science regard him as a key figure in showing that pre-Renaissance science was far more advanced than previously thought.\n\nUpon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, with miracles reported at his shrine and pilgrims to it granted an indulgence by the bishop of Lincoln. Attempts by the Lincoln bishops, the University of Oxford, and Edward I to secure a formal canonization, however, failed. In most of the modern Anglican Communion, Grosseteste is considered beatified and commemorated on 9 October. However, the Episcopal Church (USA) commemorates him with St. Hugh of Lincoln on 17 November.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "144175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144175", "title": "Sai Baba of Shirdi", "text": "Sai Baba of Shirdi\n\nSai Baba of Shirdi, also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees as a saint, a fakir, a \"satguru\" and an incarnation (avatar) of Lord Shiva and Dattatreya. He is revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees during, as well as after his lifetime. \nSaibaba is now revered as incarnation of Sri Dattatreya, and considered as Saguna Brahma. He is attributed to be the creator, sustainer and destroyer of this universe by his devotees. He is decorated with jewels and all forms of Hindu vedic deities as he is believed by his followers to be the supreme God.\nAccording to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of \"realization of the self\", and criticized \"love towards perishable things\". His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true \"Satguru\", who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.\n\nSai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains unclear if he was a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name \"Dwarakamayi\" to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, \"Allah Malik\" (\"God is King\") and \"Sabka Malik Ek\" (\"Everyone's Master is One\"), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said \"Look to me, and I shall look to you\".\n\nSai Baba's date of birth including his birthplace remains unknown and is debatable due to lack of evidence and no definitive information exists to prove it. Most definitive information about Shirdi Sai Baba tends to be derived from a book called Shri Sai Satcharitra written by a disciple called Hemadpant (also known as Annasaheb Dabholkar / Govind Raghunath) in 1922 in Marathi. The book itself is a compilation based on accounts by his various disciples and Hemadpant's personal observations observing Sai Baba from 1910 onwards.\n\nSai Baba's real name remains unknown. The name 'Sai' was given to him by \"Mhalsapati\" when he arrived at Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word 'Sai' refers to a religious mendicant but can also mean 'God'. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term 'Baba' is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes \"holy father\", \"saintly father\" or (venerable) poor old man.\n\nSome of Sai Baba's disciples became famous as spiritual figures and saints, such as Mhalsapati, a priest of the Khandoba temple in Shirdi, and Upasni Maharaj. He was revered by other saints as well, such as Saint Bidkar Maharaj, Saint Gangagir, Saint Janakidas Maharaj, and Sati Godavari Mataji. Sai Baba referred to several saints as 'my brothers', especially the disciples of Swami Samartha of Akkalkot.\n\nAlthough Sai Baba's origins are unknown, some indications exist that suggest that he was born not far from Shirdi. Historical researches into genealogies in Shirdi give support to the theory that Baba could have been born with the name \"Haribhau Bhusari\". Baba was notorious for giving vague, misleading and contradictory replies to questions concerning his parentage and origins, brusquely stating the information was unimportant. He had reportedly stated to a close follower, Mhalsapati, that he has been born of Brahmin parents in the village of Pathri and had been entrusted into the care of a fakir in his infancy. On another occasion, Baba reportedly said that the fakir's wife had left him in the care of a Hindu guru, Venkusa of Selu, and that he had stayed with Venkusa for 12 years as his disciple. This dichotomy has given rise to two major theories regarding Baba's background, with the majority of writers supporting the Hindu background over the Islamic, while others combine both the theories (that Sai Baba was first brought up by a fakir and then by a guru).\n\nBaba reportedly arrived at the village of Shirdi in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, India, when he was about sixteen years old. Although there is no agreement among biographers about the date of this event, it is generally accepted that Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year and returned permanently around 1858, just after the Indian Sepoy mutiny. This which posits a possible birth year of 1838. He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a neem tree and meditating while sitting in an asana. The Sai Satcharita recounts the reaction of the villagers\nThe people of the village were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practicing hard penance, not minding heat or cold. By day he associated with no one, by night he was afraid of nobody. His presence attracted the curiosity of the villagers and the religiously-inclined such as Mhalsapati, Appa Jogle and Kashinatha regularly visited him, while others such as the village children considered him mad and threw stones at him.After some time he left the village, and it is unknown where he stayed at that time or what happened to him. However, there are some indications that he met with many saints and fakirs, and worked as a weaver; he claimed to have fought with the army of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nSai Baba returned to Shirdi in 1858. He appeared at the Khandoba Mandir in Shirdi. The temple priest, Mhalsapati, upon seeing him for the very first time, welcomed him by saying 'Aao, Sai!' ('Come Sai'). From then on, He was known by the name (Sai Baba).\n\nAround this time he adopted his famous style of dressing, consisting of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down to the end of his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.\n\nFor four to five years, Baba lived under a neem tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. His manner was said to be withdrawn and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation. He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms, and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and Qur'an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's name (dhikr, and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols and allegories).\n\nBaba is believed to have grown and cultivated a garden called Lendi Baug, named after a riverlet called Lendi which flowed nearby. The garden continues to be a place visited by pilgrims, and has temples, samadhis of people and animals associated with Shirdi Sai Baba's life and temples.\n\nIn 1910, Sai Baba's fame began to spread in Mumbai. Numerous people started visiting him, because they regarded him as a saint with the power of performing miracles or even as an avatar. They built his first temple at Bhivpuri, Karjat.\n\nIn August 1918, Shirdi Sai Baba told some of his devotees that he would soon be \"leaving his mortal body\" (dying). Towards the end of September, he had high fever and stopped eating. As his condition deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him and continued to meet visitors. On 15th October 1918, he breathed his last. The day coincided with the Hindu calendar date that year for Vijaydashami.\n\nSai Baba opposed all persecution based on religion or caste. He was an opponent of religious orthodoxy — Christian, Hindu and Muslim.\n\nSai Baba encouraged his devotees to pray, chant God's name, and read holy scriptures. He told Muslims to study the Qur'an and Hindus to study texts such as the Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita, and Yoga Vasistha. He was impressed by the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita and encouraged people to follow it in their own lives. He advised his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any discrimination, and develop two important features of character: devotion (\"Shraddha\") and patience (\"Saburi\"). He criticised atheism.\n\nIn his teachings, Sai Baba emphasised the importance of performing one's duties without attachment to earthly matters and of being content regardless of the situation. In his personal practice, Sai Baba observed worship procedures belonging to Islam; he shunned any kind of regular rituals but allowed the practice of Salah, chanting of Al-Fatiha, and Qur'an readings at Muslim festival times. Occasionally reciting the Al-Fatiha, Baba enjoyed listening to mawlid and qawwali accompanied with the tabla and sarangi twice daily.\n\nSai Baba interpreted the religious texts of both Islam and Hinduism. He explained the meaning of the Hindu scriptures in the spirit of Advaita Vedanta. His philosophy also had numerous elements of bhakti. The three main Hindu spiritual paths — Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga — influenced his teachings.\n\nSai Baba encouraged charity and stressed the importance of sharing. He said\n\nThe Shirdi Sai Baba movement began in the 19th century, while he was living in Shirdi. A local Khandoba priest, Mhalsapati Nagre, is believed to have been his first devotee. In the 19th century, Sai Baba's followers were only a small group of inhabitants of Shirdi, and a few people from other parts of India.\n\nBecause of Sai Baba, Shirdi has become a place of importance and is counted among the major Hindu places of pilgrimage. The first Sai Baba temple is situated at Kudal, Sindhudurg. This temple was built in 1922. It is believed that Sai Baba gave one Rupee to Dada Madye ji with which he built the temple in Kudal.\n\nToday, The Sai Baba Temple in Shirdi is visited by an average of 25,000 pilgrims a day, and during religious festivals, this number can reach up to 100,000. The Sai Baba temple in Shirdi is managed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust. Sai Baba accepted the state of samadhi and attained nirvana in Dwarkamai. His remains were buried at Buti Wada, today known as the Shree Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi. Inside the temple, The statue of Sai Baba and the Samadhi is carved out of Italian marble and is seen draped with royal cloth, wearing a gold crown and adorned with fresh flower garlands. The interior is made of old stone bricks. The interior, as well as the exterior (cone) of the temple, is covered with gold. As per rituals and traditions dating back to when Baba was still alive, Four Aarti's are held daily (corresponding to the time of the day) inside the Samadhi Mandir.\n\n\nThe Palanquin procession of Sai Baba takes place every Thursday from the Samadhi Mandir to Dwarkamayi, onward to Chavdi and back to the Sai Baba Mandir. Devotees belonging to all faiths are welcome to take Darshan in the Samadhi Mandir and have free meals in the Prasadalaya, irrespective of caste, creed, and religion as these were one of the ideal principles of Sai Baba.\n\nSai Baba of Shirdi is especially revered and worshiped in the states of Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. In August 2012, an unidentified devotee, for the first time, donated two expensive diamonds valuing ₹11.8 million at the Shirdi temple, as revealed by Saibaba trust officials.\n\nIn recent years, the Shirdi Sai movement has spread to the Caribbean and to countries such as the Nepal, Canada, United States, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Singapore.\n\nBaba himself maintained an ambiguous profile, unwilling to identify with either of the two religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: \"You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?\" Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was \"Allah rakhega vaiia rahena\", that is, \"Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah.\" On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.\n\nHis notion of the unity of all mankind that appealed to everyone was very congruous with Sufism of Islam. \"God being one and the master of all also meant that all his creatures were part of one big family,\" writes Sikand. \"This belief was entirely in keeping with ... the teachings of Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation.\" Sai Baba urged his Hindu followers to read their holy books and find their own path. For him, all paths were equally valid, \"Ishwar\" (the Hindu God) and \"Allah\" being synonymous. People coming to his abode were so taken aback to see Hindus, Muslims, and others living together so peacefully that in many instances it changed their entire lives and belief systems.\n\nSai Baba's disciples and devotees claim that he performed many miracles such as bilocation, levitation, mindreading, materialisation, exorcisms, entering a state of Samādhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines and sticking them back to his body (\"khandana yoga\"), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling down on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) to people in the form of Sri Rama, Krishna, Vithoba, Shiva and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.\n\nAccording to his followers, he appeared to them in their dreams and gave them advice. His devotees have documented many stories.\nSai Baba left behind no spiritual heirs, appointed no disciples, and did not provide formal initiation (diksha), despite requests. Some disciples of Sai Baba achieved fame as spiritual figures, such as Upasni Maharaj of Sakori. After the demise of Sai Baba, his devotees offered the daily Aarti to Upasni Maharaj when he paid a visit to Shirdi twice within 10 years.\n\nDuring Sai Baba's lifetime, the Hindu saint Anandanath of Yewala declared Sai Baba to be a \"spiritual diamond.\" Another saint, Gangagir, also called him a \"jewel.\" Sri Beedkar Maharaj greatly revered Sai Baba, and in 1873, when he met him he bestowed the title Jagad guru upon him. Sai Baba was also greatly respected by Vasudevananda Saraswati (known as Tembye Swami). He was also revered by a group of Shaivic yogis, known as the \"Nath-Panchayat\". He is considered an avatar of the \"Supreme Reality\" (Brahman or God), a satguru, or saint, depending on individual proclivities. This is not uncommon in Hinduism where there is no central doctrine or cosmology, but a basis in individual faith and spirituality.\n\nSaibaba was revered by prominent Zoroastrians such as Nanabhoy Palkhivala, Farhaad Panthaky and Homi Bhabha, and has been cited as the Zoroastrians' most popular non-Zoroastrian religious figure.\n\nMeher Baba, who was born into a Zoroastrian family, met Sai Baba once, during World War I, in December 1915. This event is considered as the most significant in Meher Baba's life.\n\"Shri Sai Satcharita\" (Sai Baba's life story), makes no mention of Meher Baba but \"Lord Meher\", the life story of Meher Baba, there are numerous references to Sai Baba.\n\nMeher Baba, who claimed he was an (the) Avatar, credited his Avataric advent to Upasni, Sai Baba, and three other Perfect Masters: Hazrat Babajan, Hazrat Tajuddin Baba, and Narayan Maharaj. He declared Sai Baba to be a \"Qutub-e-Irshad\" (the highest of the five Qutubs, a \"Master of the Universe\" in the spiritual hierarchy). This classification of avatar and satgurus and the associated name is applied within the Meher Baba community alone.\n\nShri Sai tends to be a very common name for establishments in Mumbai in particular and Maharashtra in general. It tends to be popular for a variety of establishments including restaurants, real estate agencies and hotels.\n\nThere are many temples of Sai Baba in India. Temples are also located in countries outside India, including the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Netherlands, Kenya, Benin, Cuba, Canada, Pakistan, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and New Zealand. Present in the mosque in Shirdi in which Sai Baba lived, is a life-size portrait of him by Shama Rao Jaykar, an artist from Mumbai. Numerous monuments and statues depicting Sai Baba which serve a religious function have been made. One of them, made of marble by a sculptor named Balaji Vasant Talim, is in the Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi where Sai Baba was buried.\n\nIn 2008, India Post has issued a commemorative postage stamp of ₹5.00 to honour Sai Baba.\n\nSai Baba has been the subject of several feature films in many languages produced by India's film industry.\n\n\n"}

Self-acceptance involves self-understanding, a realistic, albeit subjective, awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses. It results in an individual's feeling about oneself, that they are of \"unique worth\".\n\nIn clinical psychology and positive psychology, self-acceptance is considered the prerequisite for change to occur. It can be achieved by stopping criticizing and solving the defects of one's self, and then accepting them to be existing within one's self. That is, tolerating oneself to be imperfect in some parts.\n\nSome distinguish between \"conditional\" and \"unconditional\" self-acceptance.\n\nSelf-acceptance is one of the six factors in Carol D. Ryff's structure for eudaimonic well-being.\n\nA person who scores high on self-acceptance:\n\nIn the past, the practice of self-acceptance was reproved by the Greeks. However, the need to know about and understand “the self” eventually became an important, underlying point in several psychological theories, such as:\n\nIn addition to that, the life-span theories of Erikson and Neugarten mention the importance of self-acceptance including one's past life, and Carl Jung's process of individuation also emphasizes coming to terms with the dark side of one's self, or \"the shadow\".\n\nWith respect to positive psychology, self-acceptance, as a component of eudaimonic well-being (EWB), is an indicator and a measure of psychological well-being. For instance, Alfred Adler, founder of individual psychology, observed that people who thought of themselves as inferior also observed a depreciation of others.\n\nSome psychological benefits of self-acceptance include mood regulation, a decrease in depressive symptoms, and an increase in positive emotions. \nAn example of this can be seen in a 2014 study that looked at affective profiles. The results yielded suggest that individuals categorized as self-fulfilling (as compared to the other profiles) tended to score higher on all the factors of Ryff's eudaimonic well-being dimensions (self-acceptance included). \nIn addition to that, self-acceptance (and environmental mastery) specifically and significantly predicted harmony in life across all affective profiles.\n\nOther psychological benefits include:\n\nSelf-acceptance is also thought to be necessary for good mental health.\n\nIn addition to psychological benefits, self-acceptance may have physical benefits as well. For example, the results of a 2008 study propose that older women with higher levels of environmental mastery, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance showed lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, which is a marker for glucose levels/insulin resistance.\n\n"}
{"id": "7913958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7913958", "title": "The Art of Loving", "text": "The Art of Loving\n\nThe Art of Loving is a 1956 book by psychoanalyst and social philosopher Erich Fromm, which was published as part of the \"World Perspectives Series\" edited by Ruth Nanda Anshen. In this work, Fromm develops his perspective on human nature, from his earlier work, \"Escape from Freedom\" and \"\" – principles which he revisits in many of his other major works.\n\nFromm presents love as a skill that can be taught and developed, rejecting the idea of loving as something magical and mysterious that cannot be analyzed and explained. He is therefore skeptical about popular ideas such as \"falling in love\" or being helpless in the face of love.\n\nBecause modern humans are alienated from each other and from nature, we seek refuge from our lonesomeness in romantic love and marriage (pp. 79–81). However, Fromm observes that real love \"is not a sentiment which can be easily indulged in by anyone.\" It is only through developing one's total personality to the capacity of loving one's neighbor with \"true humility, courage, faith and discipline\" that one attains the capacity to experience real love. This should be considered a rare achievement (p. vii). Fromm defended these opinions also in interview with Mike Wallace when he states: \"love today is a relatively rare phenomenon, that we have a great deal of sentimentality; we have a great deal of illusion about love, namely as a...as something one falls in. But the question is that one cannot fall in love, really; one has to be in love. And that means that loving becomes, and the ability to love, becomes one of the most important things in life.\"\n\n\"The Art of Loving\" argues that the active character of true love involves four basic elements: care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge (p. 24). Each of these is difficult to define and can differ markedly depending on the people involved and their circumstances. Seen in these terms, love is hard work, but it is also the most rewarding kind of work.\n\nOne of the book's concepts is self-love. According to Fromm, loving oneself is quite different from arrogance, conceit or egocentrism. Loving oneself means caring about oneself, taking responsibility for oneself, respecting oneself, and knowing oneself (e.g. being realistic and honest about one's strengths and weaknesses). In order to be able to truly love another person, one needs first to love oneself in this way.\n\nFromm calls the general idea of love in contemporary Western society \"\" – a relationship in which each person is entirely focused on the other, to the detriment of other people around them. The current belief is that a couple should be a well-assorted team, sexually and functionally, working towards a common aim. This is in contrast with Fromm's description of true love and intimacy, which involves willful commitment directed toward a single unique individual. One cannot truly love another person if one does not love all of mankind including oneself.\n\nThe book includes explorations of the theories of brotherly love, motherly and fatherly love, erotic love, self-love, and the love of God (pp. 7–76), and an examination into love's disintegration in contemporary Western culture (pp. 77–98).\n\nTo be able to fully comprehend the ideas illustrated in Fromm's book, one must understand the concept of paradoxical thought, or the ability to reconcile opposing principles in one same instance. Fromm himself explains paradoxical thought in the chapters dedicated to the love of God and erotic love.\n\nFromm begins the last chapter \"The Practice of Love\" saying: \"[...] many readers of this book, expect to be given prescriptions of 'how to do it to yourself' [...]. I am afraid that anyone who approaches this last chapter in this spirit will be gravely disappointed\".\n"}

The practice is common in Zen, Chan Buddhism, Korean Seon and Vietnamese Thiền.\n\nPractitioners walk clockwise around a room while holding their hands in \"shashu\" (): one hand closed in a fist while the other hand grasps or covers the fist. During walking meditation each step is taken after each full breath.\n\nThe pace of walking meditation may be slow (several steady steps per each breath) or brisk, almost to the point of jogging.\n\nThe terms consist of the Chinese words 經 \"to go through (like the thread in a loom)\", with sutra as a secondary meaning, and 行 \"walk\". Taken literally, the phrase means \"to walk straight back and forth.\" The opposite in Japanese to kinhin is zazen, \"sitting meditation\".\n\n\n"}

Both of these dates are impossible, since, as Scott points out: \"the only Spaniards in the Philippines in 1524 or 1539 were captive survivors of Magellan's fleet, and none of them were either priests or bishops.\"\n\nScott notes that these dates could not simply be errors of Malang Balagtas when he executed the will, because the Certificate of Death, an official Spanish document, was attached to the document and bore the same dates. Scott notes that these historical inconsistencies:\n\"\"... may be simple mistakes on the part of a senile illiterate on his deathbead, but similar details in an official death certificate appended to the will cannot be dismissed so lightly.\"\"\n\nFurthermore, Scott notes that the death certificate was supposedly sworn by a church official who never existed historically:\"\"The death certificate purports to have been sworn, in the first-person singular, by Augustinian Procurator Fray Juan de Jesus in the Mission of San Carlos on March 21 of the year \"mil quinientos treinta y nueve.\" Aside from the curious date and the even more curious circumstance of the testator's death having preceded the execution of the will by four days, both Isabelo (de Los Reyes) and the othrs who examined the documents were aware that there had been no Augustinian Friar by the name of Juan de Jesus in the Philippines in the 16th century, nor had there been any mission or town of San Carlos at that time. As a topnothcer in graduate courses in paleography, and the theory and practice of editing public documents, Isabelo wisely refrained from attributing authenticity to either document.\"\"\n\nThe occasional reference to the Will of Pansomun can be traced to the September 1919 issue of Philippine Historical Quarterly, which published a copy of the will with the date \"25 March 1589\" instead of 1539. A large part of this text was recently requoted by historian Luis Camara Dery in his 2001 book \"A History of the Inarticulate.\" It should be noted, however, that despite the somewhat more palatable 1589 date, this 1919 printing of the will still contains the anachronistic 1524 date of the baptism.\n\nThe will claims to document seven generations of the family of Fernando Malang Balagtas, whose name before his baptism into Catholicism had been \"Pansomun.\" It places Malang Balagtas in the 5th generation of that family tree, which means that the will purportedly documents two generations of relatives younger than him, and four generations of relatives older than him.\n\nThe first two generations of the family tree includes various legendary names from the folklore of the polities in Maynila, Tondo, Namayan, and Pasig while the third and fourth generations supposedly link Malang Balagtas to the ruling houses of Maynila, Tondo: \"namely Lacandola and the two rulers, Ladiamora\" - first degree cousins once removed. (The document does not mention Rajah Matanda and Rajah Sulayman by name, so Dery notes is uncertain whether this refers to Matanda and Sulayman themselves. \"Ladiamora,\" meaning \"young rajah (rajah mora)\", is generally acknowledged as a descriptive phrase and could refer to either a descendant or ancestor of Matanda and Sulayman.)\n\nThe last generations of the family tree supposedly identify the individuals who should be included in the property inheritances due to the descendants of these \"great houses.\"\n\nAlthough the provenance of the Will of Fernando Malang Balagtas is in question, there are a number of other historical documents containing similar information about the genealogies of the royal houses of Maynila and Tondo. These include the notarized Spanish era wills held by the Philippine National Archives, collectively known as the \"Lakandula Documents\" because they are mostly documents executed by direct descendants of Rajah Lakandula (Bunao); and other miscellaneous genealogies, such as another genealogy printed in Volume 2 of El Folklore Filipino, which both De los Reyes and Scott consider more authoritative than the supposed Will of Pansonum.\n"}

It is one of the works which he published under his own name, as opposed to his more famous \"pseudonymous\" works. \"Works of Love\" deals primarily with the Christian conception of ' love in contrast with erotic love (') or preferential love (\"\") given to friends and family. Kierkegaard uses this value/virtue to understand the existence and relationship of the individual Christian. Having helped found Existentialism, he uses it and a high-level of theology citing the scriptures of the Christian Bible. Many of the chapters take a mention of love from the New Testament and center reflections about the transfer of individuals from secular modes (the stages of the aesthetic and ethical) to genuine religious experience and existence. Since human experience is a key to understanding Kierkegaard, the actual relationships and experiences of disciples and of Christ are characterized here as tangible models for behavior.\n\nKierkegaard as a Christian ethicist (represented by this work) is likely to be considered distinct from many ways in which the religion's mainstream seems to function from the viewpoint of an outside observer. This is not only a function of Christian existentialism but also of his time period and political events occurring in his native Denmark.\n\n\nThe \"Works\" as Kierkegaard himself states are Christian reflections and not discourses. It is written in a rhetorical style where he often repeats his words and gives numerous examples.\n\n"}
