Such doctrines are usually invoked where lawsuits involving the same issues are brought in two different court systems at the same time (such as federal and state courts).\n\nThe United States has a federal court system with limitations on the cases that it can hear, while each state has its own individual court system. In some instances, the jurisdiction of these courts overlap, so a lawsuit between two parties may be brought in either or both courts. The latter circumstance can lead to confusion, waste resources, as well as cause the appearance that one court is disrespecting the other. Both federal and state courts have developed rules determining when one court will defer to another's jurisdiction over a particular case.\n\nThe various abstention doctrines applied by federal courts are named for the United States Supreme Court cases in which they were enunciated.\n\n\"Pullman\" abstention was the first \"doctrine of abstention\" to be announced by the Court, and is named for \"Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co.\", 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Concisely, the doctrine holds that \"the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass on them.\" This doctrine permits a federal court to stay a plaintiff's claim that a state law violates the United States Constitution until the state's judiciary has had an opportunity to apply the law to the plaintiff's particular case. The hope is to avoid a federal constitutional ruling by allowing the state courts to construe the law in a way that eliminates the constitutional problem or to rule it void under the state's own constitution.\n\nFor \"Pullman\" abstention to be invoked, three conditions must be apparent:\n\nUnder \"Pullman\" abstention, the federal court retains jurisdiction to hear the constitutional issues in the case if the state court's resolution is still constitutionally suspect. In \"Government and Civil Employees Organizing Committee, CIO v. Windsor\", 353 U.S. 364 (1957), the Supreme Court held that litigants must \"inform\" the state court that they are contending that the state law violates a federal constitutional provision, so that the state court may take that into consideration when interpreting the state statute. However, in \"England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners\", 375 U.S. 411 (1964), the Supreme Court noted that the litigants must not ask the state court to \"resolve\" the constitutional issue itself, or the federal court would be bound by \"res judicata\" to follow the decision of the state court. In such a case, the litigant seeking a judgment that the law is unconstitutional must usually appeal to the higher courts of the state, rather than seeking review in a federal court.\n\n\"Younger\" abstention, named for \"Younger v. Harris\", 401 U.S. 37 (1971), is less permissive to the federal courts, barring them from hearing civil rights tort claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim in state court. For example, if an individual who was charged with drug possession under a state law believes that the search was illegal, and in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights, that person may have a cause of action to sue the state for illegally searching him. However, a federal court will not hear the case until the person is convicted of the crime. The doctrine has been extended to state civil proceedings in aid of and closely related to state criminal statutes, administrative proceedings initiated by a state agency, or situations where the State has jailed a person for contempt of court. The doctrine applies even where the state does not bring an action until after the person has filed a lawsuit in federal court, provided that the federal court has not yet undergone proceedings of substance on the merits of the federal suit.\n\nThere are three exceptions to \"Younger\" abstention:\n\n\"Burford\" abstention, derived from \"Burford v. Sun Oil Co.\", 319 U.S. 315 (1943), allows a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction to abstain where the state courts likely have greater expertise in a particularly complex area of state law (the case itself dealt with the regulation of oil drilling operations in Texas). \"Burford\" allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if:\n\n\n\"Burford\" abstention is closely related to \"Thibodaux\" abstention, derived from \"Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux\", 360 U.S. 25 (1959), which occurs when a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction chooses to allow a state to decide issues of state law that are of great public importance to that state, to the extent that a federal determination would infringe on state sovereignty. \n\nUnlike the abstention doctrines raised in federal question cases, there is a strong presumption that federal courts should \"not\" apply \"Burford\" or \"Thibodaux\" Abstention.\n\nFinally, \"Colorado River\" abstention, from \"Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States\", 424 U.S. 800 (1976) comes into play where parallel litigation is being carried out, particularly where federal and state court proceedings are simultaneously being carried out to determine the rights of parties with respect to the same questions of law. Under such circumstances, it makes little sense for two courts to expend the time and effort to achieve a resolution of the question.\n\nUnlike other abstention doctrines, application of the \"Colorado River\" doctrine is prudential and discretionary, and is based less on comity or respect between different court systems than on the desire to avoid wasteful duplication of litigation. The classification of the doctrine as a form of abstention has been disputed, with some courts simply calling it a \"doctrine of exceptional circumstances\". Each of the various federal circuits has come up with its own list of factors to weigh in determining whether a federal court should abstain from hearing a case under this doctrine. Typically, such factors include:\n\nThe \"Rooker-Feldman\" doctrine has some characteristics of an abstention doctrine, because it prohibits federal court review of state court actions. However, it does not require federal courts to abstain from hearing cases pending action in the state court, but instead deems that federal courts lack jurisdiction to hear cases already fully decided in state courts. The doctrine is not a judicially created exception to federal jurisdiction. Rather, the Rooker and Feldman cases simply recognized the fact that Congress has not granted the federal district or appeals courts statutory jurisdiction to consider appeals of state court decisions, only the US Supreme Court via a writ of \"certiorari\"). It is an open question whether Congress could grant such jurisdiction.\n\nNo national rule requires state courts to abstain from hearing cases brought in federal courts or in courts of other states, though the All Writs Act permits federal courts to enjoin state courts from hearing matters if necessary to preserve the jurisdiction of the federal court. But every state has some doctrine that lets its courts stay actions to avoid duplicative litigation.\n\nSome states have doctrines that let state courts abstain from hearing cases already pending in other kinds of tribunals. For example, in \"Gavle v. Little Six, Inc.,\" 555 N.W.2d 284 (Minn. 1996), the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld abstention where the state court might \"undermine the authority of the tribal courts over Reservation affairs\" or \"infringe on the right of Indians to govern themselves\".\n\n"}

After the war he was than especially close to workers who were part of the newly founded General Workers Union, particularly at the shipyards.

She spent her childhood in Japan, where her father was appointed as the Military attaché in the Embassy of Turkey and also as the Liaison officer of the Turkish Brigade in Korea to the United Nations.\n\nAlev Alatlı attended the American School in Japan in Nakameguro, Meguro, Tokyo. After finishing high school there, her family returned to Turkey, and Alev studied economics at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, from where she graduated in 1963 with a Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nFollowing graduation, she married her classmate Alper Orhon, a Turkish Cypriot. She was granted a Fulbright Scholarship and her husband a scholarship from the Ford Foundation to conduct postgraduate study in the USA. Educated at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, she earned a Master of Arts in Development Economics and Econometrics.\n\nBy this time, she had started to think about the importance of formulas and figures in explaining the world, and decided to pursue studies in philosophy. Although she enrolled at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire for doctoral studies on philosophy of religion and philosophy of history she doesn't have a Ph.D. degree. \n\nIn 1974, Alatlı returned to Turkey. She jobbed a while as a lecturer at Istanbul University and later at the State Planning Organization (DPT) in Ankara in her capacity as an economist.\n\nIn the next five years after her return from the USA, Alev Alatlı spent her time mainly in studying Islam. She was also involved in a psycholinguistic project of the University of California, Berkeley on language learning patterns of Turkish children. She published a magazine titled \"\"Bizim İngilizce\" ) in co-operation with the newspaper \"Cumhuriyet\" for Turks based on native tongue and culture.\n\nIn 1982, she quit her other activities to stay at home and to devote herself to writing. Her first book titled \"Aydın Despotizmi...\" (\"Despotism of the Intellectuals...\") was a philosophical study.\n\nAlatlı's next work and first novel \"Yaseminler Tüter mi Hala?\" (\"Jasmines Smoke No More!\") appeared in 1985. It was inspired by the true story of a Greek Cypriot woman.

{"id": "2097128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097128", "title": "Anti-art", "text": "Anti-art\n\nAnti-art is a loosely used term applied to an array of concepts and attitudes that reject prior definitions of art and question art in general. Somewhat paradoxically, anti-art tends to conduct this questioning and rejection from the vantage point of art. The term is associated with the Dada movement and is generally accepted as attributable to Marcel Duchamp pre-World War I around 1914, when he began to use found objects as art. It was used to describe revolutionary forms of art. The term was used later by the Conceptual artists of the 1960s to describe the work of those who claimed to have retired altogether from the practice of art, from the production of works which could be sold.\n\nAn expression of anti-art may or may not take traditional form or meet the criteria for being defined as a work of art according to conventional standards. Indeed, works of anti-art may express an outright rejection of having conventionally defined criteria as a means of defining what art is, and what it is not. Anti-artworks may reject conventional artistic standards altogether, or focus criticism only on certain aspects of art, such as the art market and high art. Some anti-artworks may reject individualism in art, whereas some may reject \"universality\" as an accepted factor in art. Additionally, some forms of anti-art reject art entirely, or reject the idea that art is a separate realm or specialization. Anti-artworks may also reject art based upon a consideration of art as being oppressive of a segment of the population.\n\nAnti-art artworks may articulate a disagreement with the generally supposed notion of there being a separation between art and life. Indeed, anti-art artworks may voice a question as to whether \"art\" really exists or not. \"Anti-art\" has been referred to as a \"paradoxical neologism\", in that its obvious opposition to art has been observed concurring with staples of twentieth-century art or \"modern art\", in particular art movements that have self-consciously sought to transgress traditions or institutions. Anti-art itself is not a distinct art movement, however. This would tend to be indicated by the time it spans—longer than that usually spanned by art movements. Some art movements though, are labeled \"anti-art\". The Dada movement is generally considered the first anti-art movement; the term anti-art itself is said to have been coined by Dadaist Marcel Duchamp around 1914, and his readymades have been cited as early examples of anti-art objects. Theodor W. Adorno in \"Aesthetic Theory\" (1970) stated that \"...even the abolition of art is respectful of art because it takes the truth claim of art seriously\".\n\nAnti-art has become generally accepted by the artworld to be art, although some people still reject Duchamp's readymades as art, for instance the Stuckist group of artists, who are \"anti-anti-art\".\n\nAnti-art can take the form of art or not. It is posited that anti-art need not even take the form of art, in order to embody its function as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some of the forms of anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.\n\nSome instances of anti-art are suggestive of a reduction to what might seem to be fundamental elements or building blocks of art. Examples of this sort of phenomenon might include monochrome paintings, empty frames, silence as music, chance art. Anti-art is also often seen to make use of highly innovative materials and techniques, and well beyond—to include hitherto unheard of elements in visual art. These types of anti-art can be readymades, found object art, détournement, combine paintings, appropriation (art), happenings, performance art, and body art.\n\nAnti-art can involve the renouncement of making art entirely. This can be accomplished through an art strike and this can also be accomplished through revolutionary activism. An aim of anti-art can be to undermine or understate individual creativity. This may be accomplished through the utilization of readymades. Individual creativity can be further downplayed by the use of industrial processes in the making of art. \"Anti-artists\" may seek to undermine individual creativity by producing their artworks anonymously. They may refuse to show their artworks. They may refuse public recognition. Anti-artists may choose to work collectively, in order to place less emphasis on individual identity and individual creativity. This can be seen in the instance of happenings. This is sometimes the case with \"supertemporal\" artworks, which are by design impermanent. Anti-artists will sometimes destroy their works of art. Some artworks made by anti-artists are purposely created to be destroyed. This can be seen in auto-destructive art.\n\nAndré Malraux has developed a concept of anti-art quite different from that outlined above. For Malraux, anti-art began with the 'Salon' or 'Academic' art of the nineteenth century which rejected the basic ambition of art in favour of a semi-photographic illusionism (often prettified). Of Academic painting, Malraux writes, 'All true painters, all those for whom painting is a value, were nauseated by these pictures – \"Portrait of a Great Surgeon Operating\" and the like – because they saw in them not a form of painting, but the negation of painting'. For Malraux, anti-art is still very much with us, though in a different form. Its descendants are commercial cinema and television, and popular music and fiction. The 'Salon', Malraux writes, 'has been expelled from painting, but elsewhere it reigns supreme'.\n\nAnti-art is also a tendency in the theoretical understanding of art and fine art.\n\nThe philosopher Roger Taylor puts forward that art is a bourgeois ideology that has its origins with capitalism in \"Art, an Enemy of the People\". Holding a strong anti-essentialist position he states also that art has not always existed and is not universal but peculiar to Europe, a claim that is factually inaccurate as proven by many substantial archaeological findings on the Asian and African continents.\n\n\"\" by Larry Shiner is an art history book which fundamentally questions our understanding of art.\n\"The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.\" (Shiner 2003, p. 3)\nShiner presents (fine) art as a social construction that has not always existed throughout human history and could also disappear in its turn.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the separation between performer and spectator, life and theatre. Karl Marx posited that art was a consequence of the class system and therefore concluded that, in a communist society, there would only be people who engage in the making of art and no \"artists\".\n\nArguably the first movement that deliberately set itself in opposition to established art were the Incoherents in late 19th. century Paris. Founded by Jules Lévy in 1882, the Incoherents organized charitable art exhibitions intended to be satirical and humoristic, they presented \"...drawings by people who can't draw...\" and held masked balls with artistic themes, all in the greater tradition of Montmartre cabaret culture. While short lived – the last Incoherent show took place in 1896 – the movement was popular for its entertainment value. In their commitment to satire, irreverence and ridicule they produced a number of works that show remarkable formal similarities to creations of the avant-garde of the 20th century: ready-mades, monochromes, empty frames and silence as music.\n\nBeginning in Switzerland, during World War I, much of Dada, and some aspects of the art movements it inspired, such as Neo-Dada, Nouveau réalisme, and Fluxus, is considered anti-art. Dadaists rejected cultural and intellectual conformity in art and more broadly in society. For everything that art stood for, Dada was to represent the opposite.\n\nWhere art was concerned with traditional aesthetics, Dada ignored aesthetics completely. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend. Through their rejection of traditional culture and aesthetics the Dadaists hoped to destroy traditional culture and aesthetics. Because they were more politicized, the Berlin dadas were the most radically anti-art within Dada. In 1919, in the Berlin group, the Dadaist revolutionary central council outlined the Dadaist ideals of radical communism.\n\nBeginning in 1913 Marcel Duchamp's readymades challenged individual creativity and redefined art as a nominal rather than an intrinsic object.\n\nTristan Tzara indicated: \"I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none.\" In addition, Tzara, who once stated that \"logic is always false\", probably approved of Walter Serner's vision of a \"final dissolution\". A core concept in Tzara's thought was that \"as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society.\"\n\nOriginating in Russia in 1919, constructivism rejected art in its entirety and as a specific activity creating a universal aesthetic in favour of practices directed towards social purposes, \"useful\" to everyday life, such as graphic design, advertising and photography. In 1921, exhibiting at the 5x5=25 exhibition, Alexander Rodchenko created monochromes and proclaimed the end of painting. For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko's radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of art along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture.\n\nBeginning in the early 1920s, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Surrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, Surrealism was ultra-leftist, communist, or anarchist. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the Surrealists as communist. In 1925, the Bureau of Surrealist Research declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. Breton and his comrades supported Leon Trotsky and his International Left Opposition for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II.\n\nLeader André Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. Breton believed the tenets of Surrealism could be applied in any circumstance of life, and is not merely restricted to the artistic realm. Breton's followers, along with the Communist Party, were working for the \"liberation of man.\" However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the proletarian struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Louis Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists. In 1929, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and theoretical refinements included in the second \"manifeste du surréalisme\" excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action\n\nBy the end of World War II the surrealist group led by André Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\"\n\nFounded in the mid-1940s in France by Isidore Isou, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of 'détournement') in Situationist films. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman's \"The Anticoncept\" and Debord's \"Howls for Sade\" abandoned images altogether.\n\nIn 1956, recalling the infinitesimals of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the founder of Lettrism, Isidore Isou, developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\n\nIn 1960, Isidore Isou created supertemporal art: a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.\n\nIn Japan in the late 1950s, Group Kyushu was an edgy, experimental and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see.\n\nOther similar anti-art groups included Neo-Dada (Neo-Dadaizumu Oganaizazu), Gutai (Gutai Bijutsu Kyokai), and Hi-Red-Center. Influenced in various ways by L'Art Informel, these groups and their members worked to foreground material in their work: rather than seeing the art work as representing some remote referent, the material itself and the artists' interaction with it became the main point. The freeing up of gesture was another legacy of L'Art Informel, and the members of Group Kyushu took to it with great verve, throwing, dripping, and breaking material, sometimes destroying the work in the process.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s in France, the Letterist International and after the Situationist International developed a dialectical viewpoint, seeing their task as \"superseding\" art, abolishing the notion of art as a separate, specialized activity and transforming it so it became part of the fabric of everyday life. From the Situationist's viewpoint, art is revolutionary or it is nothing. In this way, the Situationists saw their efforts as completing the work of both Dada and surrealism while abolishing both.\nThe situationists renounced the making of art entirely.\n\nThe members of the Situationist International liked to think they were probably the most radical, politicized, well organized, and theoretically productive anti-art movement, reaching their apex with the student protests and general strike of May 1968 in France, a view endorsed by others including the academic Martin Puchner.\n\nIn 1959 Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio proposed Industrial Painting as an \"industrial-inflationist art\"\n\nSimilar to Dada, in the 1960s, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to blur the distinction between life and art.\n\nIn 1962 Henry Flynt began to campaign for an anti-art position. Flynt wanted avant-garde art to become superseded by the terms of \"veramusement\" and \"brend\" – neologisms meaning approximately pure recreation.\n\nIn 1963 George Maciunas advocated revolution, \"living art, anti-art\" and \"non art reality to be grasped by all peoples\". Maciunas strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist's 'non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness' and that 'anything can be art and anyone can do it.'\n\nIn the 1960s, the Dada-influenced art group Black Mask declared that revolutionary art should be \"an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth\". Black Mask disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks. Later, the Motherfuckers were to grow out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts.\n\nThe BBC aired an interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1966 which expressed some of Duchamps more explicit Anti-Art ideas.\nDuchamp compared art with religion, whereby he stated that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that \"the word art etymologically means to do\", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates \"purely artificial\" distinctions of being an artist.\n\nDuring the 1970s, King Mob was responsible for various attacks on art galleries. According to the philosopher Roger Taylor the concept of art is not universal but is an invention of bourgeois ideology helping to promote this social order. He compares it to a cancer that colonises other forms of life so that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other.\n\nStewart Home called for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of Gustav Metzger in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. As Black Mask had done in the 1960s, Stewart Home disrupted cultural events in London in the 1990s by giving made up flyers of literary events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.\n\nThe K Foundation was an art foundation that published a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, they burnt a million pounds in cash.\n\nPunk has developed anti-art positions. Some \"industrial music\" bands describe their work as a form of \"cultural terrorism\" or as a form of \"anti-art\". The term is also used to describe other intentionally provocative art forms, such as nonsense verse.\n\nParadoxically, most forms of anti-art have gradually been completely accepted by the art establishment as normal and conventional forms of art. Even the movements which rejected art with the most virulence are now collected by the most prestigious cultural institutions.\n\nDuchamp's readymades are still regarded as anti-art by the Stuckists, who also say that anti-art has become conformist, and describe themselves as anti-anti-art.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1336396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1336396", "title": "Antony Flew", "text": "Antony Flew\n\nAntony Garrard Newton Flew (; 11 February 1923 – 8 April 2010) was an English philosopher. Belonging to the analytic and evidentialist schools of thought, Flew was most notable for his work related to the philosophy of religion. During the course of his career he taught at the universities of Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele and Reading, and at York University in Toronto.\n\nFor much of his career Flew was known as a strong advocate of atheism, arguing that one should presuppose atheism until empirical evidence of a God surfaces. He also criticised the idea of life after death, the free will defence to the problem of evil, and the meaningfulness of the concept of God. In 2003 he was one of the signatories of the Humanist Manifesto III.\n\nHowever, in 2004 he changed his position, to acknowledge the existence of an Intelligent Creator of the universe, shocking his fellow colleagues and atheists. In order to further clarify his personal concept of God, Flew openly made an allegiance to deism, more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian God, and dismissed on many occasions a hypothetical conversion to Christianity or any other religion. He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment to go where the evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God.\n\nIn 2007 a book outlining his reasons for changing his position, \"There is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind\" was written by Flew in collaboration with Roy Abraham Varghese. The book (and Flew's conversion to Deism) has been the subject of controversy, following an article in \"The New York Times Magazine\" alleging that Flew's intellect had declined due to senility, and that the book was primarily the work of Varghese; Flew himself specifically denied this, stating that the book represented his views, and he acknowledged that due to his age Varghese had done most of the actual work of writing the book.\n\nHe was also known for the development of the no true Scotsman fallacy, and his debate on retrocausality with Michael Dummett.\n\nFlew, the son of Methodist minister/theologian Robert Newton Flew (1886–1962) and his wife Winifred \"née\" Garrard (1887–1982), was born in London. He was educated at St Faith's School, Cambridge followed by Kingswood School, Bath. He is said to have concluded by the age of 15 that there was no God. During the Second World War he studied Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and was a Royal Air Force intelligence officer. After a period with the Inter-Services Topographical Department in Oxford, he was posted to Bletchley Park in June 1944.\n\nAfter the war, Flew achieved a first class degree in \"Literae Humaniores\" at St John's College, Oxford (1947). He also won the John Locke Scholarship in Mental Philosophy in the following year. Flew was a graduate student of Gilbert Ryle, prominent in ordinary language philosophy. Both Flew and Ryle were among many Oxford philosophers fiercely criticised in Ernest Gellner's book \"Words and Things\" (1959). A 1954 debate with Michael Dummett over backward causation was an early highlight in Flew's career.\n\nFor a year, 1949–50, Flew was a lecturer in philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford. From 1950 to 1954 he was a lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, and from 1954 to 1971 he was a professor of philosophy at the University of Keele. He held a professorship at the University of Calgary, 1972–73. Between 1973 and 1983 he was professor of philosophy at the University of Reading. At this time, he developed one of his most famous arguments, the No true Scotsman fallacy in his 1975 book, \"Thinking About Thinking\". Upon his retirement, Flew took up a half-time post for a few years at York University, Toronto.\n\nPolitically Flew was a libertarian-leaning conservative and wrote articles for \"The Journal of Libertarian Studies\". His name appears on letterheads into 1992 as a Vice-President of the Conservative Monday Club, and he held the same position in the Western Goals Institute. He was one of the signatories to a letter in \"The Times\" along with Lord Sudeley, Sir Alfred Sherman, and Dr. Harvey Ward, on behalf of the Institute, \"applauding Alfredo Cristiani's statesmanship\" and calling for his government's success in defeating the Cuban and Nicaraguan-backed communist FMLN terrorists in El Salvador.\n\nFlew married on 28 June 1952. He had two daughters. Flew died on 8 April 2010, while nursed in an Extended Care Facility in Reading, England, suffering from dementia.\n\nWhile an undergraduate, Flew attended the weekly meetings of C. S. Lewis's Socratic Club fairly regularly. Although he found Lewis to be \"an eminently reasonable man\" and \"by far the most powerful of Christian apologists for the sixty or more years following his founding of that club\", he was not persuaded by Lewis's argument from morality as found in \"Mere Christianity\". Flew also criticised several of the other philosophical proofs for God's existence. He concluded that the ontological argument in particular failed because it is based on the premise that the concept of Being can be derived from the concept of Goodness. Only the scientific forms of the teleological argument ultimately impressed Flew as decisive.\n\nDuring the time of his involvement in the Socratic Club, Flew also wrote the article \"Theology and Falsification\", which argued that claims about God were merely vacuous where they could not be tested for truth or falsehood. Though initially published in an undergraduate journal, the article came to be widely reprinted and discussed.\n\nFlew was also critical of the idea of life after death and the free will defence to the problem of evil. In 1998, he debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig over the existence of God.\n\nOne of Antony Flew's most influential professional works was his 1976 \"The Presumption of Atheism\" in which Flew forwarded the proposition that the question of God's existence should begin with the presumption of atheism:\"What I want to examine is the contention that the debate about the existence of God should properly begin from the presumption of atheism, that the onus of proof must lie upon the theist. The word 'atheism', however, has in this contention to be construed unusually. Whereas nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts that there is no such being as God, I want the word to be understood not positively but negatively... in this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist.The introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear to be a piece of perverse Humpty-Dumptyism, going arbitrarily against established common usage. 'Whyever', it could be asked, don't you make it not the presumption of atheism but the presumption of agnosticism?Flew's proposal to change his profession's use of the term atheism saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew's negative sense of 'atheism' came to be forwarded more commonly. The impact of Flew's proposed negative atheism, which is often referred to today as 'weak atheism' or 'soft atheism', is illustrated by analytic Philosopher William Lane Craig's 2007 assessment that the presumption of atheism had become \"one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism.\" And BBC journalist William Crawley 2010 analysis: \"The Presumption of Atheism (1976) made the case, now followed by today's new atheism, that atheism should be the ... default position\". In recent debates, atheists often forward the Presumption of Atheism referring to atheism as the \"default position\" or has \"no burden of proof\" or asserting that the burden of proof rests solely on the theist.\n\nOn several occasions, starting in 2001, rumors circulated claiming that Flew had converted from atheism to deism. Flew denied these rumours on the Secular Web website.\n\nIn January 2004 Flew and Gary Habermas, his friend and philosophical adversary, took part in and conducted a dialogue on the resurrection at California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo. During a couple of telephone discussions shortly after that dialogue, Flew explained to Habermas that he was considering becoming a theist. While Flew did not change his position at that time, he concluded that certain philosophical and scientific considerations were causing him to do some serious rethinking. He characterized his position as that of atheism standing in tension with several huge question marks.\n\nIn a 2004 interview (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, said that he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated (\"While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings\"). Flew stated that \"the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries\" and that \"the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it\". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, whichever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, \"So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?\". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with \"the characteristics of power and also intelligence\", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created \"a lot of\" evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.\n\nFlew was particularly hostile to Islam, and said it is \"best described in a Marxian way as the uniting and justifying ideology of Arab imperialism.\" In a December 2004 interview he said: \"I'm thinking of a God very different from the God of the Christian and far and away from the God of Islam, because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic Saddam Husseins\".\n\nIn October 2004 (before the December publication of the Flew–Habermas interview), in a letter written to the historian and atheist Richard Carrier of the Secular Web Flew stated that he was a deist, and wrote \"I think we need here a fundamental distinction between the God of Aristotle or Spinoza and the Gods of the Christian and the Islamic Revelations.\" Flew also said: \"My one and only piece of relevant evidence [for an Aristotelian God] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species... [In fact] the only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms.\"\n\nIn the months following the Habermas interview, Flew contradicted some statements made in the interview and retracted others. When asked in December 2004 by Duncan Crary of Humanist Network News if he still stood by the argument presented in \"The Presumption of Atheism\", Flew replied he did but he also restated his position as deist: \"I'm quite happy to believe in an inoffensive inactive god.\" When asked by Crary whether or not he has kept up with the most recent science and theology, he responded with \"Certainly not,\" stating that there is simply too much to keep up with. Flew also denied that there was any truth to the rumours of 2001 and 2003 that he had converted to Christianity.\n\nIn a letter to Carrier of 29 December 2004 Flew retracted his statement that a deity or a \"super-intelligence\" was the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature:\n\nHe blamed his error on being \"misled\" by the (supposed) fact that Richard Dawkins had \"never been reported as referring to any promising work on the production of a theory of the development of living matter.\n\nHis 2007 book \"There is a God\" (see below) revisited the question, however, and questioned contemporary models: \"the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done.\" He added: \"The philosophical question that has not been answered in origin-of-life studies is this: How can a universe of mindless matter produce beings with intrinsic ends, self-replication capabilities, and 'coded chemistry'? Here we are not dealing with biology, but an entirely different category of problem\". Geneticists, Evolutionary Biologists, and Astrophysicists wholly deny the idea that any current holes in modern theories and models of abiogenesis directly point to any primordial replicative DNAs needing to be designed by specific or vague postulated \"powerful intelligences\". \nThe work of the Orthodox Jewish nuclear physicist Gerald Schroeder had been influential in Flew's new belief, but Flew told Carrier that he had not read any of the critiques of Schroeder that Carrier referred him to.\n\nHowever, in spring 2005 when atheist Raymond Bradley, emeritus professor of philosophy at Simon Fraser University and a member of the editorial board of \"The Open Society\" journal, wrote an open letter to Flew accusing him of not \"check[ing] the veracity of [Schroeder's] claims before swallowing them whole,\" Flew responded strongly to that charge in a letter published in the same journal in summer 2006, describing the content of Bradley's letter \"extraordinarily offensive\" and the accusation made by him as an \"egregiously offensive charge\"; he also implied that Bradley was a \"secularist bigot,\" and suggested that he should follow Socrates's advice (as scripted in Plato's \"Republic\") of \"follow[ing] the argument wherever it leads.\" Other prominent atheists, such as Richard Dawkins, suggested Flew's deism was a form of God of the gaps.\n\nConcerning other critics (both the Christians when he was an Atheist, and the Atheists when he decided to become an Aristotelian Diest) Flew said in December 2004:\nA letter on evolution and theology which Flew published in the August/September 2004 issue of \"Philosophy Now\" magazine closed with, \"Anyone who should happen to want to know what I myself now believe will have to wait until the publication, promised for early 2005, by Prometheus of Amherst, NY of the final edition of my \"God and Philosophy\" with a new introduction of it as ‘an historical relic’.\"\n\nThe preface of \"God and Philosophy\" states that the publisher and Flew went through a total of four versions (each extensively peer-reviewed) before coming up with one that satisfied them both. The introduction raises ten matters that came about since the original 1966 edition. Flew states that any book to follow \"God and Philosophy\" will have to take into account these ideas when considering the philosophical case for the existence of God:\n\n\nIn an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005, Flew rejected the fine-tuning argument as a conclusive proof: \"I don't think it proves anything but that it is entirely reasonable for people who already have a belief in a creating God to regard this as confirming evidence. And it's a point of argument which I think is very important – to see that what is reasonable for people to do in the face of new evidence depends on what they previously had good reason to believe.\" He also said it appeared that there had been progress made regarding the naturalistic origins of DNA. However, he restated his deism, with the usual provisos that his God is not the God of any of the revealed religions. In the same interview, Flew was asked whether he was retracting belief in an Aristotelian God, but answered no.\n\nOne month later, Flew told \"Christianity Today\" that although he was not on the road to becoming a Christian convert, he reaffirmed his deism: \"Since the beginning of my philosophical life I have followed the policy of Plato's Socrates: We must follow the argument wherever it leads.\"\n\nIn late 2006, Flew joined 11 other academics in urging the British government to teach intelligent design in the state schools.\n\nIn 2007, in an interview with Benjamin Wiker, Flew said again that his deism was the result of his \"growing empathy with the insight of Einstein and other noted scientists that there had to be an Intelligence behind the integrated complexity of the physical Universe\" and \"my own insight that the integrated complexity of life itself – which is far more complex than the physical Universe – can only be explained in terms of an Intelligent Source.\" He also restated that he was not a Christian theist.\n\nIn 2007, Flew published a book titled \"There is a God\", which was listed as having Roy Abraham Varghese as its co-author. Shortly after the book was released, the New York Times published an article by historian of religion Mark Oppenheimer, who stated that Varghese had been almost entirely responsible for writing the book, and that Flew was in a serious state of mental decline, having great difficulty remembering key figures, ideas, and events relating to the debate covered in the book. His book praises several philosophers (like Brian Leftow, John Leslie and Paul Davies), but Flew failed to remember their work during Oppenheimer's interview.\n\nA further article by Anthony Gottlieb noted a strong difference in style between the passages giving Flew's biography, and those laying out the case for a god, with the latter including Americanisms such as \"beverages\", \"vacation\" and \"candy\". He came to the same conclusion as Oppenheimer, and stated that \"Far from strengthening the case for the existence of God, [the book] rather weakens the case for the existence of Antony Flew\". Varghese replied with a letter disputing this view.\n\nFlew later released a statement through his publisher stating:\n\nChristian writer Regis Nicoll claims that \"Moreover, in a signed, handwritten letter (a copy of which I now have) sent to Roy Varghese, the legendary philosopher reaffirmed his conversion while criticising Oppenheimer for drawing attention away from the book’s central argument: the collapse of rationalism.\" He argues that \"Even Mark Oppenheimer described the ex-atheist 'flaunt[ing] his allegiance to deism' in May 2006 to a Christian audience at Biola University.\"\n\nPerhaps most definitively, Christian apologist Anthony Horvath corresponded with Antony Flew before it was publicly known there would even be a book. In 2010, he published his letters. The letters contain Flew's description of the outline of the book, his Deism in the pattern of Einstein's, and his high praise of N.T. Wright's arguments for Christianity. All of these elements are present in the book.\n\nHowever, in 2014 the blog Skeptical Science, following Oppenheimer's investigation on the authorship and content of the book, concluded that Varghese and a few other \"ghostwriters\" (evangelical pastors) psychologically manipulated Flew quite easily due to his vulnerability, old age and their persistent love-bombing, exploiting him, and presenting typical rough creationist arguments in favor of the Intelligent design theory and appraisal of Christianity that Flew would have never agreed upon:\n\nFlew was awarded the Schlarbaum Prize by the Ludwig von Mises Institute for his \"outstanding lifetime achievement in the cause of liberty.\" Upon acceptance of the award in Auburn, Alabama, in September 2001, Flew delivered an address entitled \"Locke versus Rawls on Equality.\" Of his choice of topics, he stated \"I am the first Englishman and the first professional philosopher to receive the Schlarbaum Prize. So it seems appropriate to begin by talking about the greatest English philosopher, John Locke.\"\n\nOn 11 May 2006, Antony Flew accepted the second \"Phillip E. Johnson Award for Liberty and Truth\" from Biola University. The award, named for its first recipient, was given to Flew \"for his lifelong commitment to free and open inquiry and to standing fast against intolerant assaults on freedom of thought and expression\". When informed of his award, Flew remarked, \"In light of my work and publications in this area and the criticism I’ve received for changing my position, I appreciate receiving this award\".\n\nHe was an honorary associate of the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In 1985, Flew was awarded the \"In Praise of Reason Award\" the highest honor the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awards. The award was presented by Chairman Paul Kurtz in London \"'[I]n recognition of his long-standing contributions to the use of methods of critical inquiry, scientific evidence, and reason in evaluating claims to knowledge and solving social problems.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2524491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2524491", "title": "Argument from a proper basis", "text": "Argument from a proper basis\n\nThe argument from a proper basis is an ontological argument for the existence of God related to fideism. Alvin Plantinga argued that belief in God is a properly basic belief, and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.\n\nThe best-known defender of this argument is Alvin Plantinga. According to the argument from a proper basis, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is properly basic, and, owing to a religious externalist epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called \"Proper functionalism\", is a form of epistemological reliabilism.\n\nPlantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, \"Warrant: The Current Debate\", Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of Roderick Chisholm, Laurence BonJour, William Alston, and Alvin Goldman. Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls \"warrant\"—what many others have called justification (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one's epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.\n\nIn the second book of his three book philosophical series, \"Warrant and Proper Function\", he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability. Plantinga's \"proper function\" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's \"belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers\" are functioning properly—\"working the way it ought to work\". Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a \"design plan\", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: \"it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans\", but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological naturalism- i.e. epistemology that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a creator God or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.\n\nAccording to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:\n\n(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.\n\nPlantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as \"naturalistic\", including the \"functional generalization\" view of John Pollock, the evolutionary/etiological account provided by Ruth Millikan, and a dispositional view held by John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter. Plantinga also discusses his evolutionary argument against naturalism in the later chapters of \"Warrant and Proper Function\".\n\nIn 2000 Plantinga's third volume, \"Warranted Christian Belief\", was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the \"A/C\" (Aquinas/Calvin) model, and the \"Extended A/C\" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the Trinity, the Incarnation, the resurrection of Christ, the atonement, salvation, etc. can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.\n\nThe best known objection to the argument from a proper basis is known as 'The Great Pumpkin Objection'. Alvin Plantinga brought it up in his 1983 book \"Warrant: The Current Debate\", and described it as follows:\nIt is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that the Great Pumpkin returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)\n\nPlantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for \"proper basicality\" propounded by classical foundationalism (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.\n\nPlantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector \"knows\" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.\n\n"}

For some of these the work of Austrian philosopher and social thinker Rudolf Steiner is a reference. Steiner gave a course of lectures in 1922 in which he set out his view that with the advent of global economy, the science of economics would need to take a further step, which included an elaboration of the economic process, a more precise monetary analysis, and a clearer understanding of how, through the division of labour, the associative basis of economic life becomes apparent. Associative economics emphasizes the development of conscious coordination of producers, distributors, and consumers. It understands the global economy as a single unified domain, through which human beings meet one another's needs. It is called \"associative economics\" because its goal is an economic sector which is managed by associations of business corporations (industry associations) and consumer associations instead of by the invisible hand of the blind market (capitalist economics) and instead of by the government (socialist economics).\n\nSome of the themes central to/addressed by associative economics include the following: how the three functions of money become three qualities; why the ‘factors of production’ are better described as ‘factors of price formation’; true pricing (in lieu of the efficient market hypothesis); the concepts of gift money (not synonymous with donations) and ‘loan money’ (not synonymous with loans); moving from real to personal credit; property rights in terms of the 'fundamental sociological law'; understanding that land is not in the market ever – what is in the market is the right to own or use land; understanding in detail and technically how one overcomes the gold standard, or what happens to balance of payments, or whether there can be banking in an associative economy.\n\nThe idea of associative economics is often also the inspiration behind such things as community supported agriculture, ethical banking, social finance, community land trusts, and local currencies.\n\nAssociative economics recognizes the central role of the individual entrepreneur and the inherent regulatory effect of face-to-face transactions between producers and consumers. At the same time, it sees that the economic organism has become truly global – has moved beyond national boundaries – so that when the economy is seen from a national perspective this is only partial and potentially harmful. Though within the context of a legislative and regulatory framework, the economy is best conducted not by the State but by those who are responsible for economic activities, potentially everyone!, working in association with one another rather than unto themselves. It has also been described as an \"altruistic stakeholder-managed economy\"). \nThis picture of an autonomously conducted economy belongs to Steiner's overall conception of the threefold nature of social life.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Rudolf Steiner spoke in detail about the threefold nature of social life; not as an invention or theory, but as observable fact (also known as the \"threefold social organism\" or \"social threefolding\"). Central to this perception is the need for autonomy (separate yet conscious interaction) on the part of the three realms of social life: the economy, the rights life (including politics and law), and spiritual-cultural life, meaning the many worldviews that human beings cherish. Though historically premature, they see in the cry of the French Revolution (\"Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité\") three fundamental ideals of the modern human being, each of which can only find its proper place in one of these three spheres. Freedom and pluralism in the spiritual-cultural realm, including in education; uncoerced cooperation in the economic realm – where through the division of labor individuals come together to meet one another’s needs; and democracy and equality in the political rights realm – where everyone comes together to sense and make agreements that are right for all.\n\nMany things which today are considered commodities within the ‘free-market’ paradigm are differently understood within an associative paradigm. For example: land, labor, and capital. The so-called ‘factors of production’ are seen as 'factors of price formation', essentially matters of right which simply border the economic realm on all sides. However, in the associative paradigm, these 'factors of price formation' do not fall into the hands of the state.\n\nLand is part of the commons. It is our common heritage, a resource that, in a wider sense, belongs to all (including future generations, but, again, \"not\" to the State), and which needs to be entrusted by voluntary groups and individuals to those whom such groups and individuals consider most capable of using it to meet current social needs. \nSteiner views labor as a form of \"wagery,\" the remnant of serfdom and slavery (where once we sold our whole body, now we sell our ’labor power’). But it is also an economic untruth, an impossibility which we allow to persist: \"[People] actually speak as though a kind of sale and purchase took place between the wage-earner who sells his labour and the man who buys it from him. But this sale and purchase is fictitious. It does not in reality take place... [In reality] it is values which are exchanged. The worker produces something directly; he delivers a product, and it is this product which the enterpriser [Unternehmer] really buys from him. In actual fact, down to the last farthing, the enterpriser pays for the products which the workers deliver to him. It is time we began to see these things in their right light.\"\nCapital creates value by the application of intelligence to labor. It is the human spirit manifest in the economic process. An interesting analysis of this viewpoint is provided by Folkert Wilken in his book \"The Liberation of Capital\". Often taking the form of money, it further frees and empowers the entrepreneur to apply their intelligence. The artist Joseph Beuys famously expressed this as \"Art=Capital\" (Kunst=Kapital), or alternatively, for his art piece in the 'Luna Luna' art fair in 1987, \"Money is not CAPITAL at all. CAPACITY is CAPITAL.\" Capital is therefore intimately linked to the individual, although it also owes much to our common heritage, especially the way we are educated.\n\nIn an associative economy, therefore, land, labor, and capital are understood as rights phenomena. Some interpret this to mean they are held in trust on behalf of the community (but not held by the state) and consequently managed by those with both the desire and capacity, but how precisely this idea is given practical expression is one of the key, and liveliest, areas of research in associative economics.\n\nLand trusts, which remove land from the private market, but also keep it out of the hands of the state, have been developed for the protection of the environment and in order to make home ownership more accessible to low income people.\n\nAs for labor, many different kinds of efforts have been made to treat laborers not as a mere company expense or a mere factor of production, but as partners and associates in the business. That entails profit sharing, and a number of profound changes in the way workers are involved in companies.\n\nAs for capital, the associative idea broadly speaking is that the buildup of capital is a social phenomenon due to many more stakeholders than are acknowledged under traditional capitalism. As a social phenomenon, accumulations of capital by a company should be administered in a way that reflects social consideration among many stakeholders: Not just investors, but workers, the local and to some extent global community and environment, and independent educational institutions, are the sources of profits and profitable ideas and capital, and should have some share in the company and in its profits. An associative company would be set up so that it cannot be sold off by investors, since the company is not merely the creation of investors. But many different arrangements are possible.\n\nOne example is the Mondragon Industrial Cooperatives (started by Catholic priest José Mª Arizmendiarrieta, who was not associated with Rudolf Steiner, but whose economic views overlapped in important ways with Steiner's economic views). By the end of 2011, the Mondragon Industrial Cooperatives employed 83,869 people working in 256 companies in four areas of activity: finance, industry, retail and knowledge.\n\nIn an associative enterprise, distant investors, if allowed to invest at all, might not be given any voting rights, or the ability to take control of the company and sell it unilaterally without regard to other stakeholders. An emphasis might be placed on getting investment capital from a company's workers, who could be asked to invest part of their earnings or profits in a company investment fund to help expand the company and develop new offshoots. When a worker leaves the company, he withdraws his invested capital, plus its earnings and interest, and some sort of pension given enough years of service. The company is set up so that no one can amass company shares, and thus the company itself cannot be sold and remains a resource for the community, which after all has been a part of the company's success. The company, while for-profit, might be held in trust by a non-profit board, which ensures the company remains as a resource for the community. The broad guiding lines of associative economic enterprise are that economic life should not be owned or managed by the state (which however of course legislates and makes sure that laws and regulations are followed by companies, including basic rights for workers), nor should economic life be owned or managed merely by those who have lots of capital to invest; ownership should be spread among all the stakeholders, with an emphasis on those who work in a company, the local community, and independent schools. Management of the company should be determined not by the state, but by talent, know-how, and success: i.e., whoever can manage the company profitably and for the benefit of all stakeholders, might be selected in various ways by various stakeholders, depending on circumstances.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "175567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175567", "title": "Bhakti", "text": "Bhakti\n\nBhakti () literally means \"attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity\". In Hinduism, it refers to devotion to, and love for, a personal god or a representational god by a devotee. In ancient texts such as the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\", the term simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor, while in the \"Bhagavad Gita\", it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards moksha, as in \"bhakti marga\".\n\nBhakti in Indian religions is \"emotional devotionalism\", particularly to a personal god or to spiritual ideas. The term also refers to a movement, pioneered by Alvars and Nayanars, that developed around the gods Vishnu (Vaishnavism), Brahma (Brahmanism), Shiva (Shaivism) and Devi (Shaktism) in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. It grew rapidly in India after the 12th century in the various Hindu traditions, possibly in response to the arrival of Islam in India.\n\nBhakti ideas have inspired many popular texts and saint-poets in India. The \"Bhagavata Purana\", for example, is a Krishna-related text associated with the Bhakti movement in Hinduism. Bhakti is also found in other religions practiced in India, and it has influenced interactions between Christianity and Hinduism in the modern era. \"Nirguni bhakti\" (devotion to the divine without attributes) is found in Sikhism, as well as Hinduism. Outside India, emotional devotion is found in some Southeast Asian and East Asian Buddhist traditions, and it is sometimes referred to as \"Bhatti\".\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"bhakti\" is derived from the verb root \"bhaj-\", which means \"to divide, to share, to partake, to participate, to belong to\". The word also means \"attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation\".\n\nThe meaning of the term \"Bhakti\" is analogous to but different from Kama. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection. Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement. She adds that, in the concept of \"bhakti\" in Hinduism, the engagement involves a simultaneous tension between emotion and intellection, \"emotion to reaffirm the social context and temporal freedom, intellection to ground the experience in a thoughtful, conscious approach\". One who practices \"bhakti\" is called a \"bhakta\".\n\nThe term bhakti, in Vedic Sanskrit literature, has a general meaning of \"mutual attachment, devotion, fondness for, devotion to\" such as in human relationships, most often between beloved-lover, friend-friend, king-subject, parent-child. It may refer to devotion towards a spiritual teacher (Guru) as \"guru-bhakti\", or to a personal god, or for spirituality without form (nirguna).\n\nAccording to the Sri Lankan Buddhist scholar Sanath Nanayakkara, there is no single term in English that adequately translates or represents the concept of \"bhakti\" in Indian religions. Terms such as \"devotion, faith, devotional faith\" represent certain aspects of \"bhakti\", but it means much more. The concept includes a sense of deep affection, attachment, but not wish because \"wish is selfish, affection is unselfish\". Some scholars, states Nanayakkara, associate it with \"saddha\" (Sanskrit: \"Sraddha\") which means \"faith, trust or confidence\". However, \"bhakti\" can connote an end in itself, or a path to spiritual wisdom.\n\nThe term \"Bhakti\" refers to one of several alternate spiritual paths to moksha (spiritual freedom, liberation, salvation) in Hinduism, and it is referred to as \"bhakti marga\" or \"bhakti yoga\". The other paths are \"Jnana marga\" (path of knowledge), \"Karma marga\" (path of works), \"Rāja marga\" (path of contemplation and meditation).\n\nThe term \"bhakti\" has been usually translated as \"devotion\" in Orientalist literature. The colonial era authors variously described \"Bhakti\" as a form of mysticism or \"primitive\" religious devotion of lay people with monotheistic parallels. However, modern scholars state \"devotion\" is a misleading and incomplete translation of \"bhakti\". Many contemporary scholars have questioned this terminology, and most now trace the term \"bhakti\" as one of the several spiritual perspectives that emerged from reflections on the Vedic context and Hindu way of life. Bhakti in Indian religions is not a ritualistic devotion to a god or to religion, but participation in a path that includes behavior, ethics, mores and spirituality. It involves, among other things, refining one's state of mind, knowing god, participating in god, and internalizing god. Increasingly, instead of \"devotion\", the term \"participation\" is appearing in scholarly literature as a gloss for the term \"bhakti\".\n\nDavid Lorenzen states that \"bhakti\" is an important term in Sikhism and Hinduism. They both share numerous concepts and core spiritual ideas, but \"bhakti\" of \"nirguni\" (devotion to divine without attributes) is particularly significant in Sikhism. In Hinduism, diverse ideas continue, where both \"saguni\" and \"nirguni\" bhakti (devotion to divine with or without attributes) or alternate paths to spirituality are among the options left to the choice of a Hindu.\n\nThe last of three epilogue verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, dated to be from 1st millennium BCE, uses the word \"Bhakti\" as follows,\n\nThis verse is one of the earliest use of the word \"Bhakti\" in ancient Indian literature, and has been translated as \"the love of God\". Scholars have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms \"Bhakti\" and \"Deva\" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the modern era. Max Muller states that the word \"Bhakti\" appears only once in this Upanishad, that too in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later addition and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later \"Sandilya Sutras\". Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is also notable for its use of the word \"Deva Prasada\" (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that \"Deva\" in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to \"pantheistic Brahman\" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean \"gift or grace of his Soul\".\n\nScholarly consensus sees \"bhakti\" as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the Epics and Puranas era of Indian history. The \"Bhagavad Gita\" is the first text to explicitly use the word \"bhakti\" to designate a religious path, using it as a term for one of three possible religious approaches. The Bhagavata Purana develops the idea more elaborately, while the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents evidence of \"guru-bhakti\" (devotion to one's spiritual teacher).\n\nThe \"Bhakti Movement\" was a rapid growth of bhakti, first starting in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE. The Alvars (\"those immersed in God\") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple singing the praises of Vishnu. They established temple sites (Srirangam is one) and converted many people to Vaishnavism.\nLike the Alvars the Saiva Nayanar poets were influential. The \"Tirumurai\", a compilation of hymns by sixty-three Nayanar poets, is still of great importance in South India. Hymns by three of the most prominent poets, Appar (7th century CE), Campantar (7th century) and Sundarar (9th century), were compiled into the \"Tevaram\", the first volumes of the \"Tirumurai\". The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread devotion to Shiva. Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets are quoted the Black Yajurveda. The Alwars and Nayanars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition. The Bhagavata Purana's references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on \"bhakti\", have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that \"bhakti\" movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.\n\nScholars state that the \"bhakti\" movement focused on the gods Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and other deities, that developed and spread in India, was in response to the arrival of Islam in India about 8th century CE, and subsequent religious violence. This view is contested by other scholars.\n\nThe Bhakti movement swept over east and north India from the fifteenth-century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE. Bhakti poetry and ideas influenced many aspects of Hindu culture, religious and secular, and became an integral part of Indian society. It extended its influence to Sufism, Christianity, and Jainism. Sikhism was founded by Nanak in the 15th century, during the bhakti movement period, and scholars call it a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.\n\nThe movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's birth caste or gender. Postmodern scholars question this traditional view and whether the Bhakti movement were ever a social reform or rebellion of any kind. They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualization of ancient Vedic traditions.\n\nThe \"Bhagavad Gita\", variously dated to have been composed in 5th to 2nd century BCE, introduces bhakti yoga in combination with \"karma yoga\" and \"jnana yoga\", while the \"Bhagavata Purana\" expands on bhakti yoga, offering nine specific activities for the bhakti yogi. Bhakti in the \"Bhagavad Gita\" offered an alternative to two dominant practices of religion at the time: the isolation of the sannyasin and the practice of religious ritual. \"Bhakti Yoga\" is described by Swami Vivekananda as \"the path of systematized devotion for the attainment of union with the Absolute\". In various chapters, including the twelfth chapter of the \"Bhagavad Gita\", Krishna describes \"bhakti yoga\" as one of the paths to the highest spiritual attainments. In the sixth chapter, for example, the Gita states the following about bhakti yogin,\nShandilya and Narada produced two important Bhakti texts, the \"Shandilya Bhakti Sutra\" and \"Narada Bhakti Sutra\". They define devotion, emphasize its importance and superiority, and classify its forms.\n\nAccording to Ramana Maharishi, states David Frawley, bhakti is a \"surrender to the divine with one's heart\". It can be practiced as an adjunct to self-inquiry, and in one of four ways:\n\nThe \"Navaratnamalika\" (garland of nine gems), nine forms of \"bhakti\" are listed: (1) \"śravaṇa\" (listening to ancient texts), (2) \"kīrtana\" (praying), (3) \"smaraṇa\" (remembering teachings in ancient texts), (4) \"pāda-sevana\" (service to the feet), (5) \"archana\" (worshiping), (6) \"namaskar\" or \"vandana\" (bowing to the divine), (7) \"dāsya\" (service to the divine), (8) \"sākhyatva\" (friendship with the divine), and (9) \"ātma-nivedana\" (self-surrender to the divine).\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana teaches nine similar facets of bhakti.\n\nTraditional Hinduism speaks of five different \"bhāvas\" or \"affective essences\". In this sense, \"bhāvas\" are different attitudes that a devotee takes according to his individual temperament to express his devotion towards God in some form. The different \"bhāvas\" are:\n\nSeveral saints are known to have practiced these \"bhavas\". The nineteenth century mystic, Ramakrishna is said to have practiced these five \"bhavas\". The attitude of Hanuman towards lord Rama is considered to be of \"dasya bhava\". The attitude of Arjuna and the shepherd boys of Vrindavan towards Krishna is regarded as \"sakhya bhava\". The attitude of Radha towards Krishna is regarded as \"madhura bhava\". The attitude of Yashoda, who looked after Krishna during his childhood is regarded as \"vatsalya bhava\". Caitanya-caritamrta mentions that Mahaprabhu came to distribute the four spiritual sentiments of Vraja loka: dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and sringara. Sringara is the relationship of the intimate love.\n\nDevotionalism, similar to \"Bhakti\", states Michael Pasquier, has been a common form of religious activity in world religions throughout human history. It is found in Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Judaism.\n\nBhakti (called \"bhatti\" in Pali language) has been a common aspect of Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to images such the images of the Buddha and the \"Bodhisattvas\", or to deities such as wrathful deities. Karel Werner notes that Bhakti has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states, \"there can be no doubt that deep devotion or \"bhakti / bhatti\" does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days\".\n\nAccording to Sri Lankan scholar Indumathie Karunaratna, the meaning of \"bhatti\" changed throughout Buddhist history, however. In early Buddhism, such as in the text Theragāthā, \"bhatti\" had the meaning of 'faithful adherence to the [Buddhist] religion', and was accompanied with knowledge. In later text tradition, however, the term developed the meaning of an advanced form of emotional devotion. Examples of the latter include the veneration of Buddha Amitabha and those in the \"Saddharmapundrarika Sutra\". This changed the meaning of Buddhist devotion to a more person-centered sense, similar to a theist sense used in Hindu scriptures. This sense of devotion was no longer connected with a belief in a religious system, and had little place for doubt, contradicting the early Buddhist concept of \"saddhā\". \"Saddhā\" did not exclude reasonable doubt on the spiritual path, and was a step in reaching the final aim of developing wisdom, not an end in itself.\n\nIn early Buddhism, states Sanath Nanayakkara, the concept of taking refuge to the Buddha had the meaning of taking the Buddha as an ideal to live by, rather than the later sense of self-surrender. But already in the Commentary to the Abhidhamma text \"Puggalapaññatti\", it is mentioned that the Buddhist devotee should develop his \"saddhā\" until it becomes \"bhaddi\", a sense not mentioned in earlier texts and probably influenced by the Hindu idea of \"bhakti\". There are instances where commentator Buddhaghosa mentions taking refuge in the Buddha in the sense of mere adoration, indicating a historical shift in meaning. Similar developments took place with regard to the term \"puja\" (honor) and the role of the Buddha image. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the doctrine of the trikāya (three bodies) and the devotion towards \"Bodhisattvas\" all indicating a shift of emphasis toward devotion as a central concept in later Buddhism.\n\nIn later faith-oriented literature, such as the Avadānas, faith is given an important role in Buddhist doctrine. Nevertheless, faith (\"śraddhā\") is discussed in different contexts than devotion (\"bhakti\"). \"Bhakti\" is often used disparagingly to describe acts of worship to deities, often seen as ineffective and improper for a Buddhist. Also, \"bhakti\" is clearly connected with a person as an object, whereas \"śraddhā\" is less connected with a person, and is more connected with truthfulness and truth. Śraddhā focuses on ideas such as the working of karma and merit transfer.\n\nNevertheless, affective devotion is an important part of Buddhist practice, not only in Mahāyāna Buddhism. According to Winston King, a scholar on Theravāda Buddhism in Myanmar, \"warm, personalized, emotional\" \"bhakti\" has been a part of the Burmese Buddhist tradition apart from the monastic and lay intellectuals. The Buddha is treasured by the everyday devout Buddhist, just like Catholics treasure Jesus. The orthodox teachers tend to restrain the devotion to the Buddha, but to the devout Buddhist populace, \"a very deeply devotional quality\" was and remains a part of the actual practice. This is observable, states King, in \"multitudes of pagoda worshippers of the Buddha images\" and the offerings they make before the image and nowhere else. Another example is the worship of the \"Bodhisattvas\" and various deities in Tibetan and other traditions of Buddhism, including the so-called wrathful deities.\n\nBhakti has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (\"Jina\") and human \"gurus\" have been venerated with offerings, songs and Āratī prayers.\n\nJainism participated in the Bhakti school of medieval India, and has a rich tradition of bhakti literature (\"stavan\") though these have been less studied than those of the Hindu tradition. The \"Avasyaka sutra\" of Jains includes, among ethical duties for the devotee, the recitation of \"hymns of praise to the Tirthankaras\" as the second Obligatory Action. It explains this \"bhakti\" as one of the means to destroy negative karma. According to Paul Dundas, such textual references to devotional activity suggests that \"bhakti\" was a necessary part of Jainism from an early period.\n\nAccording to Jeffery Long, along with its strong focus on ethics and ascetic practices, the religiosity in Jainism has had a strong tradition of \"bhakti\" or devotion just like their Hindu neighbors. The Jain community built ornate temples and prided in public devotion for its fordmakers, saints and teachers. \"Abhisekha\", festival prayers, community recitals and \"Murti puja\" (rituals before an image) are examples of integrated bhakti in Jain practice.\n\n\"Bhakthi\" is also used as a unisex name.\n\n\n\n"}

In the late 1970s and early 1980s CBE expanded to California, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Today, CBE is active primarily in California having established itself in San Francisco in 1978 and expanded to Los Angeles in 1982. CBE, now based in Oakland, CA and Huntington Park, CA, has succeeded in affecting communities throughout California, including: Richmond, East Oakland, Vernon, Huntington Park, Boyle Heights, Pacoima, Wilmington, and SE Los Angeles. CBE was the first environmental organization to practice door-to-door canvassing by directly involving community members. In 1980 CBE won the United States Supreme Court decision Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment 444 U.S. 620 protecting the 1st and 14th Amendment Rights of door-to-door activists with CBE and countless other public interest organizations. CBE's early combination of grassroots organizing with research and legal work provided the innovative edge needed to challenge large scale industries, refineries, and policies.\n\nCBE aims to strengthen low-income communities of color to achieve environmental health and justice by reduction and prevention of pollution, while creating a network of sustainable communities. CBE focuses on urban areas which maintain a disproportionate concentration of low-income minorities with some of the poorest environmental health conditions due to heavy pollution from refineries, ports, power plants, freeways, etc. These communities are more susceptible to cancer and diseases including asthma, heart disease, premature deaths, birth defects, etc. CBE values environmental and social sustainability as an intrinsic right for all humans to access clean air and drinking water regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, culture, ability, nationality, or income. CBE is committed to empowering the community by giving organizational skills, leadership training, legal, scientific, and technical assistance to communities that may effectively fight injustice and create durable change.\n\nCBE began to set the precedent for water, air, and toxic pollution advocating for community concerns and environmental regulation. In 1977, CBE organized with community members against the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in San Francisco, California. In 1983, landmark report and investigation of Bay Area toxic secretion, \"Toxics in the Bay\", held Chevron and others accountable of toxic discharge in the 1985 Basin Plan Discharge Program. The Basin Plan expanded to become the San Francisco Bay Region Basin Plan in 2004. The plan complied with California State and Federal anti-degradation policies awaiting approval by San Francisco State Water Board and the US Environmental Protection Agency. CBE pressured Bay Area Quality Management District to reevaluate permit granted to Kaiser Cement and Gypsum Corporation resulting in sulfur dioxide reduction by 50%. As well as, limited use of perchloroethylene, a.k.a. Tetrachloroethylene, in Vallejo, California dry cleaners.\n\nSeveral studies support the idea that low-income communities of color bear the burden of unequal access to a healthy environment, which prioritizes CBE's effort to work with communities to fight such injustices.\nCBE focuses on educating low-income communities of color and advocating engagement by community meetings, political education, and school groups where people are empowered to fight local pollution by working together towards achieving healthier communities. CBE also values scientific research to fully comprehend the direct and indirect consequences of toxicity and chemical secretion. Using secondary data and partnering with health providers and academic institutions, CBE practices human subjects research and online training for human subject protection via the National Institute of Health website. They are effectively committed to finding ‘who’ and ‘where’ the most affected communities are today, as well as ways of prevention for the community's tomorrow. CBE uses Community-based participatory research, by actively working together to gather their own research, which increases knowledge and awareness of local issues by creating a community where members are encouraged to participate in fighting against pollution. Outreach and awareness are promoted by leading toxic tours of oil refineries, ports, and facilities where community members share their personal stories sparking advocacy and a better understanding about pollution. The pay-it-forward affect, has the ability to reach thousands of communities by encouraging active participation against injustices.\n\n1. Community-Based Participatory Research as a Tool for Policy Change: A Case Study of the Southern California Environmental Justice Collaborative.\nCBE collaborated with Liberty Hill Foundation and an academic research team from University of California, Santa Cruz, Brown University, and Occidental College to have Rule 1402 reviewed. Rule 1402, included in the South Coast Air Quality Management District was the state’s goal in 1994 to reduce public health risk from cancerous and noncancerous emissions by large industries. The maximum individual cancer risk was initially set at 100 cancer risks per million, yet due to CBE’s collaboration, it was reduced to 25 cancer risks per million 6 years later, representing a reduction in acceptable risk levels to 75%. This collaboration led to more efforts in the reduction of allowable risk level faced by various communities and encouraged the California Environmental Protection Agency to broaden their view on issues such as these, to put more emphasis on risk exposure when making new policies.\n\n2. Linking Exposure Assessment Science With Policy Objectives for Environmental Justice and Breast Cancer Advocacy: The Northern California Household Exposure Study. \nCBE’s research contributed to an investigation of a high amount of pollutants increasing a woman's chance of getting cancer. In the United States, African American women have the highest rate of cancer and mortality than any other race.\n\nStudies reflect their chances are higher even when African American women have the same accessibility to mammograms and other treatments as white women. In a study done by Brody et al. indoor and outdoor air pollution, compared Richmond communities near oil refineries and shipping facilities with communities in Bolinas, a rural town just north of San Francisco found that Richmond had a higher concentration of pollutants in their indoor air. The study brought awareness to how indoor air can indicate and reflect outdoor air quality. CBE worked to set up various sampling equipment in the interviewers’ homes, making the research more personal by having the interviewee feel comfortable with sharing their stories. The research method also allowed the community to be more knowledgeable of where the chemicals around them came from. By becoming aware, they are able to get involved in environmental justice and begin voicing their opinion. CBE connected scientific research with the personal aspect of interviewing which reassures people that they are not only a ‘test subject’, but those that have an honest voice in the fight for justice.\n\nCBE uses their Community Based Participatory Research method in cities throughout California, focusing on northern and southern California. They focus on Richmond, California and East Oakland to make sure both cities have the resourced needed to reduce pollution. Richmond is known for the Chevron Richmond Refinery, emitting various carcinogens to the communities that surround it. Oakland is home to the Port of Oakland which emits particulate matter and various fumes from the diesel trucks that transport material to and from the location.\n\n\nCBE and two organizations conducted the research in the Richmond health survey and it showed that the chemical exposures in Richmond were extremely high. When contrasted with Bolinas, as seen in the case study, Richmond’s air pollution was far worse and this can be due to the Chevron Refinery. Chevron is the largest employer in town but as CBE research has shown, compared with the statewide average for all business activity oil refining creates ten times fewer jobs.\n\n\nCBE works with various southern California communities especially the most polluted in the country. The Los Angeles area, Riverside communities, San Bernardino, and Orange County were ranked the smoggiest area in the nation in 2012 when it comes to air pollution. CBE works with other cities in southern California like Wilmington, Huntington Park, and the various cities that surround the Interstate 710, to minimize the exposure from residents living near it. The Southern California offices are also well versed in community active with subgroups of youths joining CBE ranks to fight environmental injustice in their heavily impacted, people of color communities. Beginning in 1997, the sub-program Youth for Environmental Justice has extended in numbers over the past few year, displaying influence in California's capitol, Sacramento; to providing support to at the grassroot march in Paris 2016. \n\n\n\n\nAs an active statewide California environmental justice organization, CBE has built a number of strategic alliances over its 34 years of work to work with partners that share a common vision of building power in marginalized communities. They are one of many organizations that make up the California Environmental Justice Alliance (CEJA), which organize in communities affected by pollution, working towards getting better protection for their community and environment. Over 35 community-based organizations, including CBE, make up the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) where they work towards the usage of sustainable energy in local communities. Grassroots Global Justice Alliance (GGJ), is made of various community groups including CBE, working with communities of color faced with the most environmental pollution and toxics. In regards to the expansion of the I-710, CBE and the Coalition for Environmental Health and Justice (CEHAJ) have worked together to create the Community Alternative 7 to improve the environmental conditions along I-710 corridor. CBE focuses on the people employed by toxic facilities and works with Don’t Waste LA, in order to create a proposal for community protection to further exposure. This proposal would require them to reduce toxic waste. Green LA Coalition, Communities for a Better Environment, and other environmental justice groups, are focusing on LA in order to minimize the communities’ exposure to pollutants. In the chevron case CBE also worked alongside Asian Pacific Environmental Network to have Chevron's permit reviewed. Local Clean Energy Alliance is made up of 70 organizations that call for renewable energy, pollutant reduction, and green jobs in California. It is also a member of the Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative (BAEHC) working towards the reduction of pollution in vulnerable low income communities of color. CBE and Ditching Dirty Diesel work to bring awareness and advocacy on the issue of health problems and diesel pollution correlation. CBE also has a partnership with Richmond Equitable Development Initiative’s to brainstorm activities which may increase the communities’ advocacy for a specific problem. CBE has been a member of the Oakland Climate Action Coalition (OCAC), their efforts have allowed the inclusion of climate justice and health policies into the Oakland’s Climate Action Plan.\n\nIn recent media, Communities for a Better Environment is mentioned as being an expert in environmental issues advocating policy, organizational strategies, and seen on the forefronts of current issues and cases. CBE lawyer Shana Lazero, seen as an expert in power plants in low-income communities; CBE Attorney Maya Golden-Krasner, gives expertise on how agencies can help address needs of communities in toxic environments; Andres Soto, CBE organizer, expresses his discontent with the permit process of BAAQMD in local Bay Area newspaper and is featured in YouTube's News Channel, \"The Nation's\" moving eight-minute documentary about living in Richmond as living and breathing in the shadow of Chevron. The documentary also highlights injustices found in California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB32) cap-and-trade policy also known as emission trading Internationally, CBE is mentioned in UK news outlet, The Guardian, as a key leader with Asian Pacific Environmental Network in fighting refinery and industry expansion.\nLocal news station KTVU illustrates the tension as Richmond Chevron Refinery plans to expand as one of the largest refineries in California. Chevron's representative, says the one billion dollar expansion project will not increase crude oil, emissions, pollutants, health risk, or greenhouse gases. CBE's Greg Karras advocates on behalf of the community's skepticism for an informed review before moving forward in expansion. CBE's opinion and expertise is often highlighted as dual representation experts in environmental fields and community members. CBE encourages community members to share their stories in the media and the general public so that their experiences can affect people within and from other communities.\n\nCBE expresses urgency to implement and influence environmental justice in California. They are also committed to global participation in addressing present and future environmental concerns. CBE Communications Coordinator, Steven Low, says the future of CBE will involve Urban Agriculture, Food Justice, and “Adaptation” as a response to Global Warming and Climate Change. CBE is sponsoring the Charge Ahead Campaign which will \"help put one million electric cars, trucks and busses on California's roads, reducing air pollution, improving health and saving money\". Charge Ahead is sponsored by several organizations and designated $200 million from the states cap and trade auctions, whereby CBE advocates for low income communities of color's access to zero emission transportation.\n"}

However, some mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers have been attracted to the idea that a proposition might be \"more or less\" true, rather than wholly true or wholly false. Consider \"My coffee is hot\".\n\nIn mathematics, this idea can be developed in terms of fuzzy logic. In computer science, it has found application in artificial intelligence.

{"id": "24480631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24480631", "title": "Divine madness", "text": "Divine madness\n\nDivine madness, also known as theia mania and crazy wisdom, refers to unconventional, outrageous, unexpected, or unpredictable behavior linked to religious or spiritual pursuits. Examples of \"divine madness\" can be found in Hellenism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Shamanism.\n\nIt is usually explained as a manifestation of enlightened behavior by persons who have transcended societal norms, or as a means of spiritual practice or teaching among mendicants and teachers. These behaviors may seem to be symptoms of mental illness to mainstream society, but are a form of religious ecstasy, or deliberate \"strategic, purposeful activity,\" \"by highly self-aware individuals making strategic use of the theme of madness in the construction of their public personas\".\n\nAccording to June McDaniel and other scholars, divine madness is found in the history and practices of many cultures and may reflect religious ecstasy or expression of divine love. Plato in his \"Phaedrus\" and his ideas on theia mania, the Hasidic Jews, Eastern Orthodoxy, Western Christianity, Sufism along with Indian religions all bear witness to the phenomenon of divine madness. It is not the ordinary form of madness, but a behavior that is consistent with the premises of a spiritual path or a form of complete absorption in God.\n\nDiValerio notes that comparable \"mad saint\" traditions exist in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and Christian cultures, but warns against \"flights of fancy\" that too easily draw comparisons between these various phenomena.\n\nFeuerstein lists Zen-poet Han-shan (fl. 9th century) as one of the divinely mad, explaining that when people would ask him about Zen, he would only laugh hysterically. The Zen master Ikkyu (15th century) used to run in his town with a human skeleton to spread the message of the impermanence of life and the grim certainty of death. According to Feuerstein, similar forms of abnormal social behavior and holy madness is found in the history of the Christian saint Isadora and the Sufi Islam storyteller Mulla Nasruddin. Divine madness has parallels in others religions, such as Judaism and Hinduism.\n\n\"Theia mania\" () is a term used by Plato and his protagonist Socrates to describe a condition of \"divine madness\" (unusual behavior attributed to the intervention of a god) in the Platonic dialogue \"Phaedrus\". In this work, dating from around 370 BC, Socrates' character describes this state of divine inspiration as follows:\nPlato further described Divine Madness as a gift of god, with Socrates stating in \"Phaedrus\", \"in fact the best things we have comes from madness\", and expounds upon the concept in Plato's \"Ion\". In eastern cultures, it has been deployed as a catalyst and means for the deeper understanding of spiritual concepts.\n\nThe poet Virgil, in his \"Aeneid\", describes the Delphian priestess (\"Pythia\") as prophesying in a frenzied state:\nIn the classical world, the phenomenon of \"love at first sight\" was understood within the context of a more general conception of passionate love, a kind of madness or, as the Greeks put it, \"theia mania\" (\"madness from the gods\").\n\nThe 6th-century Saint Simeon, states Feuerstein, simulated insanity with skill. Simeon found a dead dog, tied a cord to the corpse's leg and dragged it through the town, outraging the people, but to Simeon the dead dog represented a form of baggage people carry in their spiritual life. He would enter the local church and throw nuts on the congregation during the liturgy, which he later explained to his friend was him denouncing the hypocrisy in worldly acts and prayers.\n\nThe interpretation of madness in Christianity, states Screech, adopted the Platonic belief that madness comes in two forms: bad and good, depending on the assumptions about \"the normal\" by the majority. Early Christians cherished madness, and being called \"mad\" by non-Christians. To them it was \"glossolalia\" or the \"tongue of angels\". Christ's behavior and teachings were blasphemous madness in his times, and according to Simon Podmore, \"Christ's madness served to sanctify blasphemous madness\".\n\nReligious ecstasy-type madness was interpreted as good by early Christians, with the help of the Platonic framework. Yet, as Greek philosophy went out of favor in Christian theology, so did these ideas. In the age of Renaissance, charismatic madness regained interest and popular imagination, as did the Socratic proposal of four types of \"good madness\":\nIn theological context, these were interpreted in part as divine rapture, an escape from the restraint of society, a frenzy for freedom of the soul.\n\nIn the 20th-century, Pentecostalism – the charismatic movements within Protestant Christianity particularly in the United States, Latin America and Africa – has encouraged the practice of divine madness among its followers. The wisdom and healing power in the possessed, in these movements, is believed to be from the Holy Spirit, a phenomenon called charism (\"spiritual gifts\"). According to Tanya Luhrmann, the associated \"hearing of spiritual voices\" may seem to be \"mental illness\" to many people, but to the followers who shout and dance together as a crowd it isn't. The followers believe that there is a long tradition in Christian spirituality, where saints such as Augustine are stated to have had similar experiences of deliberate hallucinations and madness.\n\nOther adepts that have attained \"mad\" mental states, according to Feuerstein, include the masts and the intoxicated Sufis associated with \"shath\". In parts of Gilgit (Pakistan), the behavior of eccentric faqirs dedicated to mystical devotionalism is considered as \"crazy holiness\". In Somalia, according to Sheik Abdi, Moḥammed ʻAbdulle Hassan eccentric behavior and methods led some colonial era writers to call him \"mad mullah\", \"crazy priest of Allah\" and others.\n\nAccording to Sadeq Rahimi, the Sufi description of divine madness in mystical union mirrors those associated with mental illness. He writes,\n\nIn West African version of Sufism, according to Lynda chouiten, examples of insane saints are a part of \"Maraboutisme\" where the mad and idiotic behavior of a marabout was compared to a mental illness and considered a form of divine folly, of holiness. However, adds Chouiten, Sufism has been accommodating of such \"divine madness\" behavior unlike orthodox Islam.\n\nThe theme of divine madness appears in all major traditions of Hinduism (Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism), both in its mythologies as well as its saints, accomplished mendicants and teachers. They are portrayed as if they are acting mad or crazy, challenging social assumptions and norms as a part of their spiritual pursuits or resulting thereof.\n\nAccording to Feuerstein, the designation \"avadhūta\" (Sanskrit: अवधूत) came to be associated with the mad or eccentric holiness or \"crazy wisdom\" of some paramahamsa, liberated religious teachers, who reverted the social norms, as symbolized by their being \"skyclad\" or \"naked\" (Sanskrit: digambara). \"Avadhuta\" are described in the Sannyasa Upanishads of Hinduism, early mediaeval Sanskrit texts that discuss the monastic (\"sannyasa\", literally \"house-leaver\") life of Hindu \"sadhus\" (monks) and \"sadhvis\" (nuns). The \"Avadhuta\" is one category of mendicants, and is described as antinomian. The term means \"shaken off, one who has removed worldly feeling/attachments, someone who has cast off all mortal concerns\". He is described as someone who is actually wise and normal, but appears to others who don't understand him as \"mad, crazy\". His behavior may include being strangely dressed (or naked), sleeping in cremation grounds, acting like an animal, a \"lunatic\" storing his food in a skull, among others. According to Feuerstein, \"the \"avadhuta\" is one who, in his [or her] God-intoxication, has \"cast off\" all concerns and conventional standards.\" Feuerstein further states that in traditional Tibet and India, \"the \"holy fool\" or \"saintly madman\" [and madwoman] has long been recognized as a legitimate figure in the compass of spiritual aspiration and realization.\"\n\nThe \"bhakti\" tradition emerged in Hinduism in the medieval era. It is related to religious ecstasy, and its accompanying states of trance and intense emotions. According to McDaniel, devotional ecstasy is \"a radical alteration of perception, emotion or personality which brings the person closer to what he regards as sacred.\" It may be compared to \"drsti\", direct perception or spontaneous thought, as opposed to learned ideas. The \"bhakta\" establishes a reciprocal relationship with the divine. Though the participation in the divine is generally favoured in Vaishnava bhakti discourse throughout the sampradayas rather than imitation of the divine 'play' (Sanskrit: \"lila\"), there is the important anomaly of the Vaishnava-Sahajiya sect.\n\nMcDaniel notes that the actual behavior and experiences of ecstatics may violate the expected behavior as based on texts. While texts describe \"stages of religious development and gradual growth of insight and emotion,\" real-life experiences may be \"a chaos of states that must be forced into a religious mold,\" in which they often don't fit. This discrepancy may lead to a mistaken identification of those experiences as \"mad\" or \"possessed,\" and the application of exorcism and Ayurvedic treatments to fit those ecstatics into the mold.\n\nMcDaniel refers to William James, who made a distinction between gradual and abrupt change, while Karl Potter makes a distinction between \"progress\" and \"leap\" philosophies. Progress philosophy is \"jativada\", gardual development; leap philosophy is \"ajativada\", \"sudden knowledge or intuition.\" Both approaches can also be found in Bengal \"bhakti\". In ritual ecstasy, \"yogic\" and \"tantric\" practices have been incorporated, together with the idea of a gradual development through spiritual practices. For spontaneous ecstatics, the reverse is true: union with the divine leads to bodily control and detachment. The same distinction is central in the classical Zen-rhetorics on sudden insight, which developed in 7th-century China.\n\nThe path of gradual progression is called \"sastriya dharma\", \"the path of scriptural injunctions.\" It is associated with order and control, and \"loyalty to lineage and tradition, acceptance of hierarchy and authority, and ritual worship and ptractice.\" In contrast, the path of sudden breakthrough is \"asastriya\", \"not according to the sscriptures.\" It is associated with \"chaos and passion, and the divine is reached by unpredictable visions and revelations.\" The divine can be found is such impure surroundings and items as burning grounds, blood and sexuality. Divine experience is not determined by loyalty to lineage and gurus, and various gurus may be followed. According to McDaniel, \"divine madness\" is a major aspect of this breakthrough approach.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, \"nyönpa\" (), tantric \"crazy yogis,\" are part of the Nyingma-tradition and the Kagyu-tradition. Their behavior may seem to be scandalous, according to conventional standards, but the archetypal \"siddha\" is a defining characteristic of the nyingma-tradition, which differs significantly from the more scholarly orientated Gelugpa-tradition. Its founder, Padmasambhava (India, 8th century), is an archetypal \"siddha\", who is still commemorated by yearly dances. Milarepa (c.1052–c.1135 CE), the founder of the Kagyu-school, is also closely connected to the notion of \"divine madness\" in Tibetan Buddhism. His biography was composed by Tsangnyön Heruka (1452-1507), \"the Madman of Tsang,\" a famous \"nyönpa\". Other famous madmen are Drukpa Kunley (1455–1529) and the Madman of Ü. Together they are also known as \"the Three Madmen\" (\"smyon pa gsum\"). Indian siddhas, and their Tibetan counterparts, also played an essential role in the Tibetan Renaissance (c.950-1250 CE), when Buddhism was re-established in Tibet.\n\nAccording to DiValerio, the Tibetan term \"nyönpa\" refers to \"siddhas\", \"yogins\" and \"lamas\" whose \"mad\" behavior is \"symptomatic of high achievement in religious practice.\" This behavior is most widely understood in Tibet as \"a symptom of the individuals being enlightened and having transcended ordinary worldly delusions.\" Their unconventional behavior is seen by Tibetans as a sign of their transcendence of \"namtok\" (Sanskrit: \"vipalka\"), \"conceptual formations or false ideations.\" While their behavior may be seen as repulsive from a dualistic point of view, the enlightened view transcends the dualistic view of repulsive and nonrepulsive.\n\nIt is regarded as manifesting naturally, not intentionally, though it is sometimes also interpreted as intentional behavior \"to help unenlightened beings realize the emptiness of phenomena, or as part of the yogin's own training toward that realization.\" It may also be seen as a way of training, to transcend the boundaries of convention and thereby the boundaries of one's ordinary self-perception, giving way to \"a more immediate way of experiencing the world - a way that is based on the truth of emptiness, rather than our imperfect habits of mind.\" While the well-known \"nyönpa\" are considered to be fully enlightened, the status of lesser-known \"yogins\" remains unknown, and the nature of their unconventional behavior may not be exactly determinable, also not by \"lamas\".\"\n\nAccording to DiValerio, the term \"drupton nyönpa\" is regarded by Tibetans as an oxymoron, a \"contradictio in terminis\": \nYet, DiValerio also argues that their unconventional behavior is \"strategic, purposeful activity, rather than being the byproduct of a state of enlightenment,\" and concludes that \"the \"holy madman\" tradition is constituted by highly self-aware individuals making strategic use of the theme of madness in the construction of their public personas,\" arguing that\nIn some Buddhist literature, the phrase \"crazy wisdom\" is associated with the teaching methods of Chögyam Trungpa, himself a Nyingma and Kagyu master, who popularized the notion with his adepts Keith Dowman and Georg Feuerstein. The term \"crazy wisdom\" translates the Tibetan term \"drubnyon\", a philosophy which \"traditionally combines exceptional insight and impressive magical power with a flamboyant disregard for conventional behavior.\" In his book \"Crazy Wisdom\", which consists of transcripts of seminars on the eight aspects of Padmasambhava given in 1972, the Tibetan tülku Chögyam Trungpa describes the phenomenon as a process of enquiry and letting go of any hope for an answer:\nSince Chögyam Trungpa described crazy wisdom in various ways, DiValerio has suggested that Trungpa did not have a fixed idea of crazy wisdom.\n\nAccording to DiValerio, Keith Dowman's \"The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa Kunley\" is \"the single most influential document in shaping how Euro-Americans have come to think about Tibetan holy madman phenomenon.\" Dowman's understanding of the holymadmen is akin to the Tibetan interpretations, seeing the Tibetan holy madmen as \"crazy\" by conventional standards, yet noting that compared to the Buddhist spiritual ideal \"it is the vast majority of us who are insane.\" Dowman also suggests other explanations for Drukpa Künlé’s unconventional behavior, including criticising institutionalized religion, and acting as a catalysator for direct insight. According to DiValerio, Dowman's view of Künlé as criticising Tibetan religious institutions is not shared by contemporary Tibetan religious specialist, but part of Dowman's own criticism of religious institutions. DiValerio further notes that \"Dowman’s presentation of Drukpa Künlé as roundly anti-institutional [had] great influence [...] in shaping (and distorting) the Euro-American world’s thinking on the subject.\"\n\nAccording to Feuerstein, who was influenced by Chogyam Trungpa, \"divine madness\" is unconventional, outrageous, unexpected, or unpredictable behavior that is considered to be a manifestation of spiritual accomplishment. This includes archetypes like the holy fool and the trickster.\n\nArthur Versluis notes that several or most of the teachers who are treated by Feuerstein as exemplary for \"divine madness,\" or \"crazy wisdom,\" are exemplary for \"immediatism.\" These include Adi Da, the teacher of Feuerstein, and Rajneesh. \"Immediatism\" refers to \"a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term \"enlightenment\".\" According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want \"the fruit of religion, but not its obligations.\" Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history as far back as Platonism, and also includes Perennialism, Versluis points to Ralph Waldo Emerson as its key ancestor, who \"emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power.\"\n\nVersluis notes that traditional Tibetan Buddhism is not immediatist, since Mahamudra and Dzogchen \"are part of a fairly stricted controlled ritual and meditative practice and tradition.\" yet, he also refers to R.C. Zaehner, \"who came to regard Asian-religion-derived nondualism as more or less inexorably to antonimianism, immorality, and social dissolution.\" Versluis further notes that in traditional Mahamudra and Dzogchen, access to teachings is restricted and needs preparation. Versluis further notes that immediatist teachers may be atttractive due to their sense of certainty, which contrasts with the post-modernist questioning of truth-claims. He further notes the lack of compassion which is often noted in regard to those immediatist teachers.\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, divine madness is a part of Shamanism, a state that a pathologist or psychologist is likely to diagnose as a mental disease or aberrant psychological condition. However, state Eliade and Harry Eiss, this would be a misdiagnosis because the Shaman is \"in control of the mystic state, rather than the psychotic state being in control of him\". A Shaman predictably enters into the trance state, with rituals such as music and dance, then comes out of it when he wants to. A mental illness lacks these characteristics. Further, at least to the participants, the Shaman's actions and trance has meaning and power, either as a healer or in another spiritual sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16183619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16183619", "title": "Donkey sentence", "text": "Donkey sentence\n\nDonkey sentences are sentences that contain a pronoun whose reference is clear to the reader (it is bound semantically) but whose syntactical role in the sentence poses challenges to grammarians. \nThe pronoun in question is sometimes termed a donkey pronoun or donkey anaphora.\n\nThe following sentences are examples of donkey sentences.\n\nSuch sentences defy straightforward attempts to generate their formal language equivalents. The difficulty is with understanding how English speakers parse such sentences.\n\nWalter Burley, a medieval scholastic philosopher, introduced donkey sentences in the context of the theory of \"suppositio\", the medieval equivalent of reference theory.\n\nPeter Geach reintroduced donkey sentences as a counterexample to Richard Montague's proposal for a generalized formal representation of quantification in natural language (see Geach 1962). His example was reused by David Lewis (1975), Gareth Evans (1977) and many others, and is still quoted in recent publications.\n\nFeatures of the sentence, \"Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it,\" require careful consideration for adequate description (though reading \"each\" in place of \"every\" does simplify the formal analysis). The donkey pronoun in this case is the word \"it\". The indefinite article 'a' is normally understood as an existential quantifier, but the most natural reading of the donkey sentence requires it to be understood as a nested universal quantifier.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with donkey sentences: they are grammatically correct, they are well-formed, their syntax is regular. They are also logically meaningful, they have well-defined truth conditions, and their semantics are unambiguous. However, it is difficult to explain how donkey sentences produce their semantic results, and how those results generalize consistently with all other language use. If such an analysis were successful, it might allow a computer program to accurately translate natural language forms into logical form. The question is, how are natural language users, apparently effortlessly, agreeing on the meaning of sentences like these?\n\nThere may be several equivalent ways of describing this process. In fact, Hans Kamp (1981) and Irene Heim (1982) independently proposed very similar accounts in different terminology, which they called discourse representation theory (DRT) and file change semantics (FCS) respectively.\n\nIn 2007, Adrian Brasoveanu published studies of donkey pronoun analogs in Hindi, and analysis of complex and modal versions of donkey pronouns in English.\n\nDonkey sentences became a major force in advancing semantic research in the 1980s, with the introduction of discourse representation theory (DRT). During that time, an effort was made to settle the inconsistencies which arose from the attempts to translate donkey sentences into first-order logic. \n\nDonkey sentences present the following problem, when represented in first-order logic: The systematic translation of every existential expression in the sentence into existential quantifiers produces an incorrect representation of the sentence, since it leaves a free occurrence of the variable y in BEAT(\"x\".\"y\"):\n\nTrying to extend the scope of existential quantifier also does not solve the problem:\n\nIn this case, the logical translation fails to give correct truth conditions to donkey sentences: Imagine a farmer not beating his donkey. The formula will be true in that situation, because for each farmer we need to find at least one object that either is not a donkey, or not owned by this farmer, or is beaten by the farmer. Hence, if this object denotes a pig he also owns, anything unrelated, or even the farmer himself, the sentence will be true in that situation.\n\nA correct translation into first-order logic for the donkey sentence seems to be:\n\nUnfortunately, this translation leads to a serious problem of inconsistency. One possible interpretation, for example, might be that every farmer that owns any donkeys beats every donkey. Clearly this is rarely the intentional meaning. Indefinites must sometimes be interpreted as existential quantifiers, and other times as universal quantifiers, without any apparent regularity. \n\nThe solution that DRT provides for the donkey sentence problem can be roughly outlined as follows: The common semantic function of non-anaphoric noun phrases is the introduction of a new discourse referent, which is in turn available for the binding of anaphoric expressions. No quantifiers are introduced into the representation, thus overcoming the scope problem that the logical translations had.\n\n\n\n"}

Along with Ita Wegman, she belonged to the innermost circle of founders of anthroposophy and those around Rudolf Steiner.\n\nEdith Maryon was the second of six children. Her parents were John Maryon Simeon and his wife Louisa Church who lived in London where she grew up. She attended a girls school and later went to a boarding school in the Swiss city of Geneva. During the 1890s she studied sculpture in London at the Central School of Design, and from 1896 at the Royal College of Arts. She exhibited at the Royal Academy. Her works of that period showed her leaning toward the subject of Christianity, such as a model of Michael, the relief \"The Seeker of Divine Wisdom\" and \"The Cross of Golgotha\".\n\nMaryon met Rudolf Steiner in 1912/13 and after the summer of 1914 she moved to Dornach. She worked with Steiner on the construction of the first Goetheanum, and with him on the modelling and carving of the wooden sculpture \"The Representative of Humanity\". Steiner designed the nine-metre high sculpture to be placed in the first Goetheanum. Now on permanent display at the second Goetheanum, it shows a central, free-standing Christ holding a balance between the beings of Lucifer and Ahriman, representing opposing tendencies of expansion and contraction.

{"id": "440260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440260", "title": "Enlightenment in Buddhism", "text": "Enlightenment in Buddhism\n\nThe English term enlightenment is the western translation of the abstract noun bodhi, (; Sanskrit: बोधि; Pali: \"bodhi\"), the knowledge or wisdom, or awakened intellect, of a Buddha. The verbal root \"budh-\" means \"to awaken,\" and its literal meaning is closer to \"awakening.\" Although its most common usage is in the context of Buddhism, the term \"buddhi\" is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions. The term \"enlightenment\" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of Max Müller. It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth or reality.\n\nThe term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote insight (\"prajna\", \"kensho\" and \"satori\"); knowledge (\"vidhya\"); the \"blowing out\" (\"Nirvana\") of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release (\"vimutti\"); and the attainment of Buddhahood, as exemplified by Gautama Buddha.\n\nWhat exactly constituted the Buddha's awakening is unknown. It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and \"dhyāna\", applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between \"dhyana\" and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice.\n\nIn the western world the concept of (spiritual) enlightenment has taken on a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self and false self, being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.\n\n\"Bodhi\", Sanskrit बोधि, \"awakening,\" \"perfect knowledge,\" \"perfect knowledge or wisdom (by which a man becomes a बुद्ध [Buddha] or जिन [\"jina\", \"arahant\"; \"victorious,\" \"victor\"], the illuminated or enlightened intellect (of a Buddha or जिन).\"\n\nIt is an abstract noun, formed from the verbal root \"*budh-\", Sanskrit बुध, \"to awaken, to know,\" \"to wake , wake up , be awake,\" \"to recover consciousness (after a swoon),\" \"to observe , heed , attend to.\"\n\nIt corresponds to the verbs \"bujjhati\" (Pāli) and \"bodhati\", बोदति, \"become or be aware of, perceive, learn, know, understand, awake\"or \"budhyate\" (Sanskrit).\n\nThe feminine Sanskrit noun of \"*budh-\" is बुद्धि, \"buddhi\", \"prescience, intuition, perception, point of view.\"\n\nRobert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term \"enlightenment\" to translate the term \"bodhi\". The root \"budh\", from which both \"bodhi\" and \"Buddha\" are derived, means \"to wake up\" or \"to recover consciousness\". Cohen notes that \"bodhi\" is not the result of an \"illumination\", but of a path of realization, or coming to understanding. The term \"enlightenment\" is event-oriented, whereas the term \"awakening\" is process-oriented. The western use of the term \"enlighten\" has Christian roots, as in Calvin's \"It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths\".\n\nEarly 19th century \"bodhi\" was translated as \"intelligence\". The term \"enlighten\" was first being used in 1835, in an English translation of a French article, while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment' is credited (by the Oxford English Dictionary) to the \"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal\" (February, 1836). In 1857 \"The Times\" used the term \"the Enlightened\" for the Buddha in a short article, which was reprinted the following year by Max Müller. Thereafter, the use of the term subsided, but reappeared with the publication of Max Müller's \"Chips from a german Workshop\", which included a reprint from the \"Times\"-article. The book was translated in 1969 into German, using the term \"der Erleuchtete\". Max Müller was an essentialist, who believed in a natural religion, and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings. \"Enlightenment\" was a means to capture natural religious truths, as distinguished from mere mythology.\n\nBy the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha \"enlightened\", and by the end of the 1880s the terms \"enlightened\" and \"enlightenment\" dominated the English literature.\n\n\"Bodhi\" (Sanskrit, Pāli), from the verbal root \"budd\", \"to awaken\", \"to understand\", means literally \"to have woken up and understood\". According to Johannes Bronkhorst, Tillman Vetter, and K.R. Norman, \"bodhi\" was at first not specified. K.R. Norman:\nAccording to Norman, \"bodhi\" may basically have meant the knowledge that \"nibbana\" was attained, due to the practice of \"dhyana\". Originally only \"prajna\" may have been mentioned, and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating, with the stilling of pleasure of pain in the fourth jhana, not the gaining of some perfect wisdom or insight. Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, \"bodhi\" refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant. In Theravada Buddhism, \"bodhi\" is equal to supreme insight, and the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance. According to Nyanatiloka,\nThis equation of \"bodhi\" with the four noble truths is a later development, in response to developments within Indian religious thought, where \"liberating insight\" was deemed essential for liberation. The four noble truths as the liberating insight of the Buddha eventually were superseded by Pratītyasamutpāda, the twelvefold chain of causation, and still later by anatta, the emptiness of the self.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, \"bodhi\" is equal to \"prajna\", insight into the Buddha-nature, sunyata and tathatā. This is equal to the realisation of the non-duality of absolute and relative.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism \"pannā\" (Pali) means \"understanding\", \"wisdom\", \"insight\". \"Insight\" is equivalent to \"vipassana\"', insight into the three marks of existence, namely \"anicca\", \"dukkha\" and \"anatta\". Insight leads to the four stages of enlightenment and Nirvana.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism Prajna (Sanskrit) means \"insight\" or \"wisdom\", and entails insight into \"sunyata\". The attainment of this insight is often seen as the attainment of \"enlightenment\".\n\n\"Kensho\" and \"Satori\" are Japanese terms used in Zen traditions. \"Kensho\" means \"seeing into one's true nature.\" \"Ken\" means \"seeing\", \"sho\" means \"nature\", \"essence\", c.q Buddha-nature. \"Satori\" (Japanese) is often used interchangeably with kensho, but refers to the \"experience\" of kensho. The Rinzai tradition sees \"kensho\" as essential to the attainment of Buddhahood, but considers further practice essential to attain Buddhahood.\n\nEast-Asian (Chinese) Buddhism emphasizes insight into Buddha-nature. This term is derived from Indian tathagata-garbha thought, \"the womb of the thus-gone\" (the Buddha), the inherent potential of every sentient being to become a Buddha. This idea was integrated with the Yogacara-idea of the \"ālaya vijñāna\", and further developed in Chinese Buddhism, which integrated Indian Buddhism with native Chinese thought. Buddha-nature came to mean both the potential of awakening \"and\" the whole of reality, a dynamic interpenetration of absolute and relative. In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not distinct entities, but mutually co-dependent.\n\nThe term \"vidhya\" is being used in contrast to \"avidhya\", ignorance or the lack of knowledge, which binds us to samsara. The \"Mahasaccaka Sutta\" describes the three knowledges which the Buddha attained:\n\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the first two knowledges are later additions, while insight into the four truths represents a later development, in response to concurring religious traditions, in which \"liberating insight\" came to be stressed over the practice of \"dhyana\".\n\nVimutti, also called moksha, means \"freedom\", \"release\", \"deliverance\". Sometimes a distinction is being made between \"ceto-vimutti\", \"liberation of the mind\", and \"panna-vimutti\", \"liberation by understanding\". The Buddhist tradition recognises two kinds of \"ceto-vimutti\", one temporarily and one permanent, the last being equivalent to \"panna-vimutti\".\n\nYogacara uses the term \"āśraya parāvŗtti\", \"revolution of the basis\", \nNirvana is the \"blowing out\" of disturbing emotions, which is the same as liberation. The usage of the term \"enlightenment\" to translate \"nirvana\" was popularized in the 19th century, due, in part, to the efforts of Max Muller, who used the term consistently in his translations.\n\nThree types of buddha are recognized: \n\nSiddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, is said to have achieved full awakening, known as \"samyaksaṃbodhi\" (Sanskrit; Pāli: \"sammāsaṃbodhi\"), \"perfect Buddhahood\", or \"anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi\", \"highest perfect awakening\".\n\nThe term buddha has acquired somewhat different meanings in the various Buddhist traditions. An equivalent term for Buddha is Tathāgata, \"the thus-gone\". The way to Buddhahood is somewhat differently understood in the various buddhist traditions.\n\nIn the suttapitaka, the Buddhist canon as preserved in the Theravada tradition, a couple of texts can be found in which the Buddha's attainment of liberation forms part of the narrative.\n\nThe \"Ariyapariyesana Sutta\" (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes how the Buddha was dissatisfied with the teachings of Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, wandered further through Magadhan country, and then found \"an agreeable piece of ground\" which served for striving. The sutra then only says that he attained Nibbana.\n\nIn the \"Vanapattha Sutta\" (Majjhima Nikaya 17) the Buddha describes life in the jungle, and the attainment of awakening. The \"Mahasaccaka Sutta\" (Majjhima Nikaya 36) describes his ascetic practices, which he abandoned. There-after he remembered a spontaneous state of jhana, and set out for jhana-practice. Both suttras narrate how, after destroying the disturbances of the mind, and attaining concentration of the mind, he attained three knowledges (vidhya):\n\nInsight into the Four Noble Truths is here called awakening. The monk (\"bhikkhu\") has \n\nAwakening is also described as synonymous with Nirvana, the extinction of the passions whereby suffering is ended and no more rebirths take place. The insight arises that this liberation is certain:\nSchmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36. Bronkhorst notices that \nIt calls in question the reliability of these accounts, and the relation between \"dhyana\" and insight, which is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism. Originally the term \"prajna\" may have been used, which came to be replaced by the four truths in those texts where \"liberating insight\" was preceded by the four jhanas. Bronkhorst also notices that the conception of what exactly this \"liberating insight\" was developed throughout time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the four truths served as such, to be superseded by \"pratityasamutpada\", and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person. And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this \"liberating insight\" exist in the Buddhist canon: \nAn example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.\n\nThe term bodhi acquired a variety of meanings and connotations during the development of Buddhist thoughts in the various schools.\n\nIn early Buddhism, \"bodhi\" carried a meaning synonymous to \"nirvana\", using only some different metaphors to describe the insight, which implied the extinction of \"lobha\" (greed), \"dosa\" (hate) and \"moha\" (delusion). \n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion. In Theravada Buddhism, \"bodhi\" refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant. In Theravada Buddhism, \"bodhi\" is equal to supreme insight, the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance. Reaching full awakening is equivalent in meaning to reaching Nirvāṇa. Attaining Nirvāṇa is the ultimate goal of Theravada and other śrāvaka traditions. It involves the abandonment of the ten fetters and the cessation of dukkha or suffering. Full awakening is reached in four stages. According to Nyanatiloka,\nSince the 1980s, western Theravada-oriented teachers have started to question the primacy of insight. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \"jhana\" and \"vipassana\" (insight) form an integrated practice. Polak and Arbel, following scholars like Vetter and Bronkhorst, argue that right effort, c.q. the four right efforts (sense restraint, preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and the generation of wholesome states), mindfulness, and \"dhyana\" form an integrated practice, in which \"dhyana\" is the actualisation of insight, leading to an awakened awareness which is \"non-reactive and lucid.\"\n\nIn Mahayana-thought, bodhi is the realisation of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, and the unity of subject and object. It is similar to prajna, to realizing the Buddha-nature, realizing sunyata and realizing suchness. In time, the Buddha's awakening came to be understood as an immediate full awakening and liberation, instead of the insight into and certainty about the way to follow to reach enlightenment. However, in some Zen traditions this perfection came to be relativized again; according to one contemporary Zen master, \"Shakyamuni buddha and Bodhidharma are still practicing.\"\n\nMahayana discerns three forms of awakened beings:\n\nWithin the various Mahayana-schools exist various further explanations and interpretations. In Mahāyāna Buddhism the Bodhisattva is the ideal. The ultimate goal is not only of one's own liberation in Buddhahood, but the liberation of all living beings. But Mahayana Buddhism also developed a cosmology with a wide range of buddhas and bodhisattvas, who assist humans on their way to liberation.\n\nNichiren Buddhism regards Buddhahood as a state of perfect freedom, in which one is awakened to the eternal and ultimate truth that is the reality of all things. This supreme state of life is characterized by boundless wisdom and infinite compassion. The Lotus Sutra reveals that Buddhahood is a potential in the lives of all beings. \n\nIn the Tathagatagarbha and Buddha-nature doctrines bodhi becomes equivalent to the universal, natural and pure state of the mind:\nAccording to these doctrines bodhi is always there within one's mind, but requires the defilements to be removed. This vision is expounded in texts such as the Shurangama Sutra and the Uttaratantra.\n\nIn Shingon Buddhism, the state of Bodhi is also seen as naturally inherent in the mind. It is the mind's natural and pure state, where no distinction is being made between a perceiving subject and perceived objects. This is also the understanding of Bodhi found in Yogacara Buddhism.\n\nTo achieve this vision of non-duality, it is necessary to recognise one's own mind:\nDuring the development of Mahayana Buddhism the various strands of thought on Bodhi were continuously being elaborated. Attempts were made to harmonize the various terms. The Buddhist commentator Buddhaguhya treats various terms as synonyms:\nIn the western world the concept of \"enlightenment\" has taken on a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self, being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.\n\nThe use of the western word \"enlightenment\" is based on the supposed resemblance of \"bodhi\" with \"Aufklärung\", the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. In fact there are more resemblances with Romanticism than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.\n\nThe equivalent term \"awakening\" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the Great Awakenings, several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these \"Great Awakenings\" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.\n\nThe romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki. Further popularization was due to the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber.\n\nIn the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable. According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:...most of them labour under the old cliché that the goal of Buddhist psychological analysis is to reveal the hidden mysteries in the human mind and thereby facilitate the development of a transcendental state of consciousness beyond the reach of linguistic expression.\n\nA common reference in western culture is the notion of \"enlightenment \"experience\"\". This notion can be traced back to William James, who used the term \"religious experience\" in his book, \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\". Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. Schleiermacher used the notion of \"religious experience\" to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.\n\nIt was popularised by the Transcendentalists, and exported to Asia via missionaries. Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th Century rationalism, John Locke's philosophy of Sensualism, and the predestinationism of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, various religions, and German idealism.\n\nIt was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.\n\nThe notion of \"experience\" has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.\n\nThe notion of \"experience\" introduces a false notion of duality between \"experiencer\" and \"experienced\", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \"non-duality\" of observer and observed. \"Pure experience\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \"experience\" someone has, which means that this \"experience\" is not the \"proof\" of the teaching, but a \"result\" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \"cleaning the doors of perception\" as per romantic poet William Blake, would, according to Mohr, be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.\n\nSakyamuni's Buddhahood is celebrated on Bodhi Day. In Sri Lanka and Japan different days are used for this celebration.\n\nAccording to the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka, Sakyamuni reached Buddhahood at the full moon in May. This is celebrated at Wesak Poya, the full moon in May, as Sambuddhatva jayanthi (also known as Sambuddha jayanthi).\n\nAccording to the Zen tradition, the Buddha reached his decisive insight on 8 December. This is celebrated in Zen monasteries with a very intensive eight-day session of \"Rōhatsu\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57388109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57388109", "title": "Further facts", "text": "Further facts\n\nIn philosophy, the phrase further facts refers to facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts of the world. Reductionists who argue that at bottom there is nothing more than the physical facts thus argue against the existence of further facts. The concept of further facts plays a key role in some of the major works in analytic philosophy of the late 20th century, including in Derek Parfit's \"Reasons and Persons\", and David Chalmers's \"The Conscious Mind\".\n\nOne context in which the existence of further facts is debated is that of personal identity across time: in what sense is Alice today really the \"same\" person as Alice yesterday, given that across the two days the state of her brain is different and the atoms that constitute her are different? One may believe that at bottom, there is nothing more than the atoms and their arrangement at different points in time; while we may for practical purposes come up with some notion of sameness of a person, this notion does not reflect anything deeper about reality. Under this view there would be no further facts. Alternatively, one may believe that there is a deeper sense in which Alice yesterday and Alice today really are the same person. For example, if one believes in Cartesian souls, one may believe that Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person if and only if they correspond to the same soul. Or one may not believe in Cartesian souls, but yet believe that whether Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person is a question about something other than facts about which atoms constitute them and how they are arranged. These would both be further-fact views.\nThe debate about further facts about personal identity over time is most closely associated with Derek Parfit. In his \"Reasons and Persons\", he describes the non-reductionist's view that \"personal identity is a deep further fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity\". Parfit takes a reductionist stance and argues against this further-fact view. As a result it is not clear whether a person has any reason to be worried about her future self in a special way that does not also apply to worrying about others, with Parfit arguing that it is plausible that \"only the deep further fact gives me a reason to be specially concerned about my future\" (his so-called \"Extreme Claim\"). Sydney Shoemaker objects that it is not clear how a further fact would give a reason for such special concerns, either. Harold Langsam has attempted to give a positive account of how a further fact would give such a reason.\nDavid Chalmers lists a number of other types of candidates for further facts. One is facts about conscious experience. For example, it is difficult to see how it follows from the physical facts what it is like to experience seeing red; indeed, inverted spectrum scenarios, where we imagine that experiences of colors are swapped without anything else changing, might suggest that things could have been different without the physical facts changing. Another candidate for a further fact is the fact that there is any conscious experience at all, rather than everyone being a philosophical zombie. Christopher Hill and Brian Mclaughlin have argued against the idea that facts about consciousness are further facts, disputing the logical possibility of a world physically identical to ours in which the facts about consciousness are different.\n\nChalmers also considers facts about indexicality. He cites the fact that \"\"I\" am David Chalmers\", noting that its significance seems to go beyond the tautology that David Chalmers is David Chalmers. (See also Caspar Hare's egocentric presentism and Benj Hellie's vertiginous question.) Similarly, in the philosophy of time, what date and time it is \"now\" might be considered a candidate for a further fact, in the sense that a being that knows everything about the full four-dimensional block of spacetime would still not know what time it is \"now\". (See also the A-theory and the B-theory of time.)\n\nA final type of fact that Chalmers considers is that of \"negative\" facts. For example, consider the following statement: there do not exist nonphysical angels. If in fact true, it does not seem that this logically follows from any of the physical facts by themselves; but, he argues, it would follow if one added a \"That is all\" statement at the end of the list of all the physical facts.\n\nVincent Conitzer has used the following computer simulation scenarios to illuminate further facts about qualia (what it is \"like\" to have specific experiences), indexicality, and personal identity. Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it. The person observing knows that besides the code responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be \"additional\" code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her experience by themselves. But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has \"forgotten\" that it is a simulation that she is watching. Could she not still reach the same conclusion? And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?\n\n\n"}

In some cases, subpopulations living in ecologically distinct peripheral environments can exhibit genetic divergence from the remainder of a population, especially where the range of a population is very large (see parapatric speciation). The genetic differences among divergent populations can involve silent mutations (that have no effect on the phenotype) or give rise to significant morphological and/or physiological changes. Genetic divergence will always accompany reproductive isolation, either due to novel adaptations via selection and/or due to genetic drift, and is the principal mechanism underlying speciation.\n\nOn a molecular genetics level, genetic divergence is due to changes in a small number of genes in a species, resulting in speciation. However, researchers argue that it is unlikely that divergence is a result of a significant, single, dominant mutation in a genetic locus because if that were so, the individual with that mutation would have zero fitness. Consequently, they could not reproduce and pass the mutation on to further generations. Hence, it is more likely that divergence, and subsequently reproductive isolation, are the outcomes of multiple small mutations over evolutionary time.\n"}

{"id": "1866981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866981", "title": "Giorgi Japaridze", "text": "Giorgi Japaridze\n\nGiorgi Japaridze (also spelled Giorgie Dzhaparidze) is a Georgian-American researcher in logic and theoretical computer science. He currently holds the title of Full Professor at the Computing Sciences Department of Villanova University. Japaridze is best known for his invention of computability logic, cirquent calculus, and Japaridze's polymodal logic.\n\nDuring 1985-1988 Japaridze elaborated the system GLP, known as Japaridze's polymodal logic. This is a system of modal logic with the \"necessity\" operators [0],[1],[2],…, understood as a natural series of incrementally weak provability predicates for Peano arithmetic. In \"The polymodal logic of provability\" Japaridze proved the arithmetical completeness of this system, as well as its inherent incompleteness with respect to Kripke frames. GLP has been extensively studied by various authors during the subsequent three decades, especially after Lev Beklemishev, in 2004, pointed out its usefulness in understanding the proof theory of arithmetic (provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals).\n\nJaparidze has also studied the first-order (predicate) versions of provability logic. He came up with an axiomatization of the single-variable fragment of that logic, and proved its arithmetical completeness and decidability. In the same paper he showed that, on the condition of the 1-completeness of the underlying arithmetical theory, predicate provability logic with non-iterated modalities is recursively enumerable. In he did the same for the predicate provability logic with non-modalized quantifiers.\n\nIn 1992-1993, Japaridze came up with the concepts of cointerpretability, tolerance and cotolerance, naturally arising in interpretability logic. He proved that cointerpretability is equivalent to 1-conservativity and tolerance is equivalent to 1-consistency. The former was an answer to the long-standing open problem regarding the metamathematical meaning of 1-conservativity. Within the same line of research, Japaridze constructed the modal logics of tolerance (1993) and the arithmetical hierarchy (1994), and proved their arithmetical completeness.\nIn 2002 Japaridze introduced \"the Logic of Tasks\", which later became a part of his Abstract Resource Semantics on one hand, and a fragment of Computability Logic (see below) on the other hand.\n\nJaparidze is best known for founding Computability Logic in 2003 and making subsequent contributions to its evolution. This is a long-term research program and a semantical platform for \"redeveloping logic as a formal theory of (interactive) computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that it has more traditionally been\".\nIn 2006 Japaridze conceived cirquent calculus as a proof-theoretic approach that manipulates graph-style constructs, termed cirquents, instead of the more traditional and less general tree-like constructs such as formulas or sequents. This novel proof-theoretic approach was later successfully used to \"tame\" various fragments of computability logic, which had otherwise stubbornly resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof theory such as sequent calculus or Hilbert-style systems. It was also used to (define and) axiomatize the purely propositional fragment of Independent-Friendly Logic.\nThe birth of cirquent calculus was accompanied with offering the associated \"abstract resource semantics\". Cirquent calculus with that semantics can be seen as a logic of resources which, unlike Linear Logic, makes it possible to account for resource-sharing. As such, it has been presented as a viable alternative to linear logic by Japaridze, who repeatedly has criticized the latter for being neither sufficiently expressive nor complete as a resource logic. This challenge, however, has remained largely unnoticed by the linear logic community, which never responded to it.\n\nJaparidze has cast a similar (and also never answered) challenge to intuitionistic logic, criticizing it for lacking a convincing semantical justification the associated constructivistic claims, and for being incomplete as a result of \"throwing out the baby with the bath water\". Heyting's intuitionistic logic, in its full generality, has been shown to be sound but incomplete with respect to the semantics of computability logic. The positive (negation-free) propositional fragment of intuitionistic logic, however, has been proven to be complete with respect to the computability-logic semantics.\nIn \"On the system CL12 of computability logic\", on the platform of computability logic, Japaridze generalized the traditional concepts of time and space complexities to interactive computations, and introduced a third sort of a complexity measure for such computations, termed \"amplitude complexity\".\nAmong Japaridze's contributions is the elaboration of a series of systems of (Peano) arithmetic based on computability logic, named \"clarithmetics\". These include complexity-oriented systems (in the style of bounded arithmetic) for various combinations of time, space and amplitude complexity classes.\n\nGiorgi Japaridze was born in 1961 in Tbilisi, Georgia (then in the Soviet Union).\nHe graduated from Tbilisi State University in 1983, received a PhD degree (in philosophy) from Moscow State University in 1987, and then a second PhD degree (in computer science) from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. During 1987-1992 Japaridze worked as a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. During 1992-1993 he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Amsterdam (Mathematics and Computer Science department). During 1993-1994 he held the position of a Visiting Associate Professor at the University of Notre Dame (Philosophy Department). He has joined the faculty of Villanova University (Computing Sciences Department). Japaridze has also worked as a Visiting Professor at Xiamen University (2007) and Shandong University (2010-2013) in China.\n\nIn 1982, for his work \"Determinism and Freedom of Will\", Japaridze received a Medal from the Georgian Academy of Sciences for the best student research paper, granted to one student in the nation each year. In 2015, he received an Outstanding Faculty Research Award from Villanova University, granted to one faculty member each year. Japaridze has been a recipient of various grants and scholarships, including research grants from the US National Science Foundation, Villanova University and Shandong University, Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Dutch government, Smullyan Fellowship from Indiana University (never utilized), and Dean's Fellowship from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Causal events are related as the subsequent event(s) are understood to be a consequence of the prior event(s).\nMeaning represents the purpose or significance of something.\n\nFour categories are causality, coincidence, serendipity, and synchronicity.\n\nCausality represents causal events grouped without meaning. These are common events.\n\nCoincidence represents acausal events grouped without meaning. These are less common events.\n\nSerendipity represents causal events grouped by meaning. These are rare events.\n\nSynchronicity represents acausal events grouped by meaning. These events are unlikely to occur by chance and may represent an outlier effect.\n\nA causality example is to strike a cue ball with a pool stick to make it move. The result is expected and has no meaning.\n\nA coincidence example is two friends from the same town finding each other at the same time in the town's library without any planning. The result is unexpected, yet has no meaning (significance).\n\nA serendipity example is finding something useful while looking for something else, such as finding the cue ball while looking for the pool stick. The find was caused by the search, and because the find was useful, the event has meaning.\n\nA sychronicity example is two friends who rarely visit libraries, without any planning, finding each other in a library on one day; and again without any planning, finding each other in a distant library on a later date. Not only is the result unexpected, the friends find the event to have meaning (significance), because of the remote chance of the event.\n\nDeterminism theory argues against acausal events. However, the idea of causal determinism can neither be argued for nor against based on the scientific knoweldge at this point in time .\n\nCausality appears to us to be reasonably objective to determine on the macroscopic scale. (But not on the quantum scale, where random chance prevails.) However, even large-scale physical causality is a somewhat mysterious notion; there is no general theory of causality in physics, and most events in physics are theoretically reversible in time . However, the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which states that entropy always increases with time, in any closed system) can be regarded as providing a direction for the \"arrow of time\" and thus entropy may be related to the physically mysterious notion of causality. (See Causality (physics).)\n\nUnlike causality, the concept of meaning is purely subjective except in symbol systems such as language/grammar and mathematics - both systems which depend on prior agreement on the arbitrary assignment of specific meanings to specific symbols or symbol groups .\n\nThe outlier effect can be used to explain events that are unlikely to occur by chance. Littlewood's Law states that individuals can statistically expect a significant event to happen for them at a frequency of about once per month. Littlewood assumes a significant event frequency at one in a million with a duration of one second, and that an individual is alert to significant events for eight hours per day.\n\nThe 1993 book, The Celestine Prophecy, by James Redfield encouraged its readers to seek meaning from grouped events. From the book's First Insight: \"In each of our lives occurs mysterious coincidences - sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny'. The book was a 1996 best seller, spent 165 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller list, and has now sold over 20 million copies.\n\n\n\n"}

He was twice a Guggenheim fellow (1956–57 and 1963–64) and also was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1980. He is well known for his 1960 Doomsday equation formula published in \"Science\" predicting future population growth.\n\nAs a polymath, he wrote nearly two hundred professional papers, gaining renown in fields from computer science and artificial intelligence to epistemology, and researched high-speed electronics and electro-optics switching devices as a physicist, and in biophysics, the study of memory and knowledge. He worked on cognition based on neurophysiology, mathematics, and philosophy and was called \"one of the most consequential thinkers in the history of cybernetics\". He came to the United States, and stayed after meeting with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, where he received funding from The Pentagon to established the Biological Computer Laboratory, which built the first parallel computer, the \"Numa-Rete\". Working with William Ross Ashby, one of the original Ratio Club members, and together with Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann and Lawrence J. Fogel, Heinz von Foerster was an architect of cybernetics and one of the members of the Macy conferences, eventually becoming editor of its early proceedings alongside Hans-Lukas Teuber and Margaret Mead.\n\nVon Foerster was born in 1911 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, as Heinz von Förster. He was the grandson of Austrian architect . He studied physics at the Technical University of Vienna and at the University of Breslau, where in 1944 he received a Ph.D. in physics. His relatives included Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Ludwig Förster was his great-grandfather. His Jewish roots didn't cause him much troubles while he worked in radar laboratories during the Nazi era, as \"he hid his ancestry with the help of an employer who chose not to press him for documents on his family.\"\n\nHe moved to the USA in 1949, and worked at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he was a professor of electrical engineering from 1951–1975. He also was professor of biophysics (1962–1975) and Director of the Biological Computer Laboratory (1958–1975). Additionally, in 1956–57 and 1963–64 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and also President of the Wenner-Gren-Foundation for anthropological research from 1963–1965.\n\nHe knew well and was in conversation with John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Gordon Pask, Gregory Bateson, Lawrence J. Fogel and Margaret Mead, among many others. He influenced generations of students as a teacher and inclusive, enthusiastic collaborator.\n\nVon Foerster was influenced by the Vienna Circle and Ludwig Wittgenstein. He worked in the field of cybernetics and is known as the inventor of second-order cybernetics. He made important contributions to constructivism. He is also known for his interest in computer music and magic.\n\nIn 1949 von Foerster started work at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign at the electron tube laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department, where he succeeded Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner. With his students he developed many innovative devices, including ultra-high-frequency electronics\n\nHe also worked on mathematical models of population dynamics and developed a general model now called the \"von Foerster equation\"\n\nThe mathematical formula can be derived from first principles and reads:\n\nwhere: \"n\" = \"n\"(\"t\",\"a\"), \"t\" stands for time and \"a\" for age. \"m\"(\"a\") is the death in function of the population age; \"n\"(\"t\",\"a\") is the population density in function of age.\n\nWhen \"m\"(\"a\") = 0, we have:\n\nIt relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density; the negative sign shows that time flows in just one direction, that there is no birth and the population is going to die out.\n\nIt is therefore a transport equation; it can be solved using a characteristics method. Another way is by similarity solution; and a third is a numerical approach such as finite differences.\n\nTo get the solution, the following boundary conditions should be added:\n\nwhich states that the initial births should be conserved (see Sharpe–Lotka–McKendrick’s equation for otherwise), and that\n\nwhich states that the initial population must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation.\n\nIn 1958 he formed the \"Biological Computer Lab\", studying similarities in cybernetic systems in biology and electronics.\n\nHe was the youngest member of the core group of the Macy conferences on Cybernetics and editor of the five volumes of \"Cybernetics\" (1949–1953), a series of conference transcripts that represent important foundational conversations in the field. It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener's coinage \"Cybernetics\" be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called \"Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems\".\n\nA 1960 issue of \"Science\" magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula.\nThe formula gave 2.7 billion as the 1960 world population and predicted that population growth would become infinite by Friday, November 13, 2026 – von Foerster's 115th birthday anniversary – a prediction that earned it the name \"the Doomsday Equation.\"\n\nBased on population data obtained from various sources, von Foerster and his students concluded that world population growth over the centuries was faster than an exponential. In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster's tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling-time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date.\n\nResponders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time. Those who knew von Foerster could see in his rejoinders an evident sense of humor.\n\nThe hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s has recently been correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows:\n\n\nVon Foerster authored more than 100 publications.

The front-end browser code is written in both JavaScript and HTML, while the server code is written in the python programming language. The Ballot Preparation System (BPS) guides voters through the ballot and records their choices. The process to create the ballot and process the votes is based on Benaloh's Simple Verifiable Voting Protocol.\n\nHelios is a web-based platform that is available to the general public. Users can vote in elections and users can create elections. Anyone can cast a ballot; however, for the final vote to be counted, the voter's identification must be verified. Helios uses ballot secrecy and homomorphic encryption to protect the identity of the voter.\n\nA user must have a Helios account in order to create an election. A Helios account requires a user to provide an email address, name, and a password. The registered user can then create an election by specifying a name and time period. The user who created the election is known as the administrator of the election. Once an election is created, Helios provides a public key to the administrator. The administrator prepares the ballot and creates a voter roll—these can be edited at any time before voting starts. The administrator freezes the election when the election is ready for voters to cast ballots. When the election is frozen, no changes can be made to the ballot, voter roll, or election time frame\n\nA voter, from the voting roll created by the administrator, receives an email with the voter's username, a random password for that specific election, a URL to the voting booth, and an SHA-1 hash of the election parameters. The voter follows the link in the email and begins the voting process. Once the voter finishes and has reviewed the ballot, the voter seals the ballot which triggers Helios to encrypt it and display a ciphertext.\n\nAt this point the voter can either audit or cast the ballot. Auditing the ballot allows the voter to verify that the ciphertext is correct. Once the audit is complete, the ballot must be sealed again. When the voter is ready to cast their ballot, they must verify their login information. Helios authenticates the voter's identity and the ballot is cast. All votes are posted to a public online bulletin board which displays either a voter name or a voter ID number with the encrypted vote. \n\nAfter an election ends, the Helios system shuffles the ballots, encrypts all the votes, and makes the shuffle publicly accessible for interested parties to audit. Auditing allows anyone to verify that the shuffle is correct. Once a reasonable amount of time for auditing has passed, Helios decrypts the ballots and tallies the votes. Anyone can download the election data to verify that the shuffle, decryptions, and tally are correct.\n\nThe Helios platform is intended to be utilized in low-coercive, small scale environments such as university student governments.\n\nThe platform was utilized for student government elections at Princeton University and Universite Catholique de Louvain. The Universite Catholique de Louvain used the Helios voting system in March 2009 to elect its university president. The election was open to 25,000 eligible voters of which 5,000 registered and 4,000 voted. Helios was used to elect new board of directors at the International Association for Cryptographic Research in 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\n\nTo mitigate a security breach, Helios records all of the votes once they are submitted and leaves a trace of verified votes. The integrity of the ballots are ensured by trustees and the Helios server. Auditors can and are encouraged to verify votes. In the event of corrupted ballots (where a vote for one candidate is cast for another), Helios attempts to mitigate the risk by the Ballot Encryption Verification program. The Ballot Encryption Verification program allows voters (or anyone interested) to audit other votes before they cast their own.\n"}

Blavatsky formally defined the higher self as \"Atma the inseparable ray of the Universe and one self. It is the God above, more than within, us\". Each and every individual has a Higher self.\n\nThe Higher Self is generally regarded as a form of being only to be recognized in a union with a divine source. In recent years the New Age faith has encouraged the idea of the Higher Self in contemporary culture, though the notion of the Higher Self has been interpreted throughout numerous historical spiritual faiths. Some denominations believe that the higher self is a part of an individual's metaphysical identity, while others teach that the higher self is essentially our tie to the heavens. Similar to the notion of the soul, the higher self can be defined by many different sects, while also being a topic of interest in the scientific and philosophical fields.\n\nChristianity: In the Christian interpretation, all beings contain a fragment of the Holy Spirit, which ties them to their Higher Self. The concept of the Holy Spirit is widely taught by various Christian sects, but the idea of the individual higher consciousness is discussed less frequently. Christian theology adheres that the Higher Self is what connects one to God, and thus one must honor and keep one's Higher Self pure by following the ethical guidelines outlined in the scriptures. Jesus said, \"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\" (Matthew 26:41); a central tenet of Christianity is that the body is still under the bondage of sin and is therefore imperfect, unlike the Higher Self, which remains untainted.\n\nBuddhism: In Buddhism, the Nirvana Sutra describes the notion of Higher self.\n\nIslam: In Sufism and some esoteric Shia sects (Batiniyya), the Higher Self has an important role, which is connected with notion of al-Insān al-Kāmil, the six organs, Al-Nafsul Mud’ma’inah and Fana'.\nHinduism: In Hinduism, the higher self is one and the same with the Jiva or individual self. With this perspective, the Hindu faith generally teaches that the higher self, or Atman is not an object possessed by an individual, rather the self is the subject which perceives. In his book, \"The Higher Self\", Deepak Chopra utilizes the views of the Hindi denomination to support his claims concerning the divine force that is acquired with the awareness of the self. Hinduism teaches that through the examination of self-knowledge, or “atma jnana,” one can attain salvation by comprehending the true self.\n\nNew Age: Most New Age literature defines the Higher self as an extension of the self to a godlike state. This Higher Self is essentially an extension of the worldly self. With this perspective, New Age text teaches that in exercising your relationship with the higher self, you will gain the ability to manifest your desired future before you. In other words, the self creates its own reality when in union with the Higher Self.\n\nIn numerous reports concerning the Higher Self, the practice of meditation or channeling to contact the Higher Self is highly encouraged. Most of this ideology agrees with the concept that with mindful awareness of the higher self, peace, salvation, or enlightenment may be procured. This is due to the idea that the Higher Self contains an advanced amount of insight into man’s most taxing questions, such as the purpose of existence or death, etc. \nEvidence of this insight is found within the book, \"Open to Channel: How To Connect With Your Guide\", where dual authors Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer report a collective and educational account of the practice and benefits of existing in alignment with the Higher Self. This piece cites views from numerous practitioners of meditation and channeling who claim a consistent result of newly acquired peace and intuition. Essentially, the idea behind this practice is that through spiritual exposure, a person can make a conscious connection with their higher self or other higher beings. In this state, the meditator is free to tap into this higher intelligence in order to develop a more enlightened perspective on world matters.\n\n"}

Schools of thought include cosmopolitanism and anti-cosmopolitanism.\nRealism, Liberalism, and Marxism are ethical traditions that conceptually address moral issues in international relations.\n\nRealism’s position is that ethics are secondary, or inapplicable to the affairs of international politics and believes in the primacy of self-interest over moral principle. The pursuit of self-interest by states is viewed as a \"right\", or \"duty\", making it a principle for Realists to uphold. From their standpoint, the international environment is perpetually anarchic and competitive over resources. There is no overarching authority over states. Without a superior power to enforce order, ethics do not sustain in international affairs. Out of \"necessity\", “international conditions compel states to defend their interests by frequently immoral means, and this compulsion of self-defense dissolves moral duties.” It would be considered unethical by the principle of pursuing self-interest, for a state to compromise its goal for power and security.\n"}
{"id": "53775760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53775760", "title": "Ivan Đaja", "text": "Ivan Đaja\n\nIvan Đaja (, ; 21 July 1884 – 1 October 1957) was a Serbian biologist, physiologist, author and philosopher.\n\nHe was founder of the Chair for physiology at the Serbian Institute for Physiology, rector of the University of Belgrade, and member of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts. Đaja was a popularizer of biology, performed research in the role of the adrenal glands in thermoregulation, as well as pioneering work in hypothermia.\n\nĐaja was born on 21 July 1884 in Le Havre, a major port in Normandy, France. His mother, Delphine Depois-Auger (1861-1902), was French. She was a daughter of the local ship-owner. His father Božidar “Boža” Đaja (1850-1914) was a ship master, originally working as a sea captain, later switching to river transportation. Ivan was their eldest child. While they were still living in France, the couple had another son, Aleksandar, who died in 1969. When Ivan was six, the family moved to Belgrade in 1890, where his father took over as the captain of a steamboat, \"\", which was an official diplomatic ship of Serbian rulers. He helmed it until his retirement in 1907. In Belgrade, the couple had a daughter, Olga, their third child (1892-1974). \n\nBožidar was also an author. He wrote stories about the life of Dalmatian sailors who worked on the sailing ships and published them in the series of books jointly titled \"Our Seamen\": \"Apprentice\" in 1903, \"Young Man\" in 1904 and \"Helmsman\" in 1909, all three published by the Ilija M. Kolarac Endowment. When he died in Vienna, he left three more manuscripts from the same series, ready for print: \"Nostromo\", \"Captain\" and \"Old Age\".\n\nĐaja finished elementary and high school in Belgrade. After graduating at First Belgrade Gymnasium in 1902, he moved back to France, spending one year as a student at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille at Rouen. He studied philosophy under Émile Chartier. In 1903 he enrolled at the Sorbonne, where one of his fellow students and best friends was Émile Herzog, later famous French author under the name Andre Maurois. He studied natural sciences (botany, physiology and biochemistry) under Albert Dastre, great scientific experimenter, himself a student of Claude Bernard. Đaja gave his final exam in 1905 and, mentored by Dastre, received a PhD on 23 July 1909 with the thesis in physiology \"Study on ferments of glycosides and carbohydrates in mollusks and crustaceans\".\nDuring his studying, he also had several jobs. In 1904, he became the youngest foreign correspondent of Serbian daily Politika. Only 20 years old, he became recently established newspaper’s reporter from Paris and first foreign correspondent in general. He also worked for a while at National Museum of Natural History with , before spending five years at Marine station in Roscoff, Brittany. Starting in 1906, he worked there with Yves Delage and Albert Dastre, beginning his career as a researcher.\n\nHe was invited by the biologist to return to Belgrade from France, where he became a docent at the Faculty of Philosophy. There, that same year, he founded the first Chair for physiology in this part of the world, within the Institute for Physiology which he also founded and chaired for 40 years. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was in Vienna, and was kept in confinement, under the Austro-Hungarian police watch, until December 1918.\n\nUpon his return to Srbija, Đaja restored the Institute and became associate professor at the University’s Faculty of Philosophy in 1919 obtaining the full professorship in 1921. In 1947, when Faculty for mathematics and natural sciences (PMF) split from the Faculty of Philosophy, Đaja became PMF’s professor. In 1934 he was elected to the one-year tenure as the rector of the University of Belgrade. He founded and co-founded numerous scientific institutes both in Yugoslavia and abroad, including People’s University in Belgrade. He was vice-president of the Red Cross of Yugoslavia in the Interbellum.\n\nWorld War II interrupted his work again, as Đaja staunchly opposed the German-appointed puppet regime in Serbia. He asked to be retired in 1942 and was even confined for a while by the quisling authorities at the Banjica concentration camp. He was reactivated in 1945, both as the professor and head of the Institute for Physiology, before finally retiring in 1955.\n\nHe became associate member of the Serbian Royal Academy on 18 February 1922, and was elected to the full membership on 16 February 1931. Within the Academy, he was member of Academy of natural sciences and its secretary from 7 March 1937 to 7 March 1939. He gave his inaugural academic address on 6 March 1932, titled \"Some features of the fight against cold\". After reorganization of the Academy in 1947, Đaja was elected a member of Department for mathematics and natural sciences and Department for medical sciences on 22 March 1948. He became secretary of the former from that date to 10 June 1952, while he was entrusted with developing the latter and creating a new Department for arts and music (he himself played a flute. He became member of that department, too, on 20 April 1949. In the process of reorganization, Serbian Royal Academy was renamed Serbian Academy of Science in 1947. Đaja later proposed for the name to be expanded by adding arts in the title, which was accepted after his death, in 1960, when thed academy was officially renamed to Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nSoon after becoming an associated member of the Serbian academy, he was elected to the same position in Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb. He helmed the process of collaboration between the two academies in an effort to realize his idea of creating a biology station for students located on the Adriatic Sea. As a result, Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries was founded in 1930 in Split, on the Dalmatian coast (today in Croatia).\n\nĐaja was also a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He was unanimously elected as a corresponding member in 1955, being inaugurated on 28 May 1956 in the Section for medicine and surgery. He was elected for his “seminal work on the behaviour of deep cooled warm blooded animals” and took over the academy seat which was left vacant after the death of Alexander Fleming.\n\nAfter he founded the Institute, Đaja began his experimental work, adopting the motto \"Nulla dies sine experimentum\" (\"Not one day without the experiment\"). His entire scientific work can be divided into three phases. In the first phase, which started in his student days and lasted up to World War I, he concentrated on the research of the endogenic enzymes or ferments, which are produced by the glands of digestive organs. He created a more rational nomenclature of the enzymes than the ones previously used.\n\nWhen he returned to Serbia in 1919, his second phase was centered on metabolism. In this period, he published a physiology textbook in 1923, \"Fundamentals of physiology\". In preface, he wrote that “he arranged the subject matter based on one leading idea: that circulation of matter and energy is the basic phenomenon of life, and that all physiological functions are subordinated to it.” He also researched bioenergetics and an effect of the temperature and asphyxia induced numbness on living organisms. His major work from this phase is the two-volume \"Homeothermy and thermoregulation\" from 1938.\n\nĐaja began to research hypothermia in 1935 and from 1940 it became the focal point of his scientific work. He was especially interested in the ways it can be achieved. With his treatise \"State similar to the winter sleep of the hibernators achieved in rat by the means of barometric depression\", published on 15 January 1940, he began researching the physiology of the deeply cooled homeothermous organisms. He was interested in thermogenesis, gas circulation in organisms, adaptation to cold, defense role of hypothermia and metabolism in deep hypothermia. His results from this period have found a wide application in medical physiology.\n\nApart from pure chemical processes in the human body, he was interested in philosophical decoding of the complex functional plexus in the natural world in general. Considering physiology as the branch of biology which synthesizes the entire knowledge of the science of life, Đaja aimed to present the philosophical interpretation of the nature of science, its foundations and future development. He published his philosophical views in \"Following the footsteps of life and science\" in 1931 and \"Man and the inventive life\" in 1955. He presented thesis on the origin of the biological inventive power, purposefulness of certain phenomena in the living world and discussed the concept of usefulness in biology. He tried to comprehend the mechanics of life, chemistry and physical chemistry of the living organisms and to give a unifying scientific philosophical theory which would encompass physiology, evolution and genetics.\n\nHe was also known as the major popularizer of biology, but also of science and arts in general and was remembered as an excellent lecturer and teacher.\n\nĐaja married three times. His first wife was French and she died young. He married for the second time to a village teacher from Bavanište, Pančevo. They had a daughter, Ivanka Đaja-Milanković (1934-2002). Ivanka worked as a journalist in Sremska Mitrovica, where she died, though she spent a long time living in Canada. Already at an advanced age, he married for the third time, to Leposava Marković (1910-91). She was his former student and collaborator and worked as an assistant and professor at the University of Belgrade. They lived in Belgrade’s neighborhood of Profesorska Kolonija. Đaja was a good friend with Milutin Milanković.\n\nHis paternal uncle was Jovan Đaja (1846-1928), a journalist and politician, member of Nikola Pašić’s People's Radical Party. He was president of Serbian association of journalists 1897-99 and Minister of internal affairs of Serbia 1890-91 and 1891-92.\n\nIn 1957, as president of the Symposium on hypothermia, Đaja was among the principal organizers of the XV congress of the Committee of International Congresses of Military Medicine and Pharmacy which was held in Belgrade. During the congress, on his way to the venue, Đaja died on 1 October 1957. Among many others, the scientific journal Nature marked his passing by publishing an In memoriam.\n\nAlone, or with his co-workers, Đaja authored over 250 works, out of which over 200 were scientific. Rest of it includes popular, philosophical and children books, translations from French and an autobiography.\n\nHe co-authored his first scientific paper in 1906, titled \"Amylolytic inactivity of dialyzed pancreatic juice\". His other initial studies were also centred on enzymology and published in magazines of the Parisian Biology society and French Academy of Sciences. Later, his works were mostly published by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts and Croatian Natural Society. Since 1913 he was correspondent for the \"Glasnik\", magazine of the Serbian academy, and later for the \"Medical overview\", \"\" from 1905, \"Foreign review\" from 1933 and \"Science and technics\" from 1941. In 1927-28 he was an editor of the University’s magazine \"University life\".\n\nAfter publishing his PhD thesis \"Study on ferments of glycosides and carbohydrates in mollusks and crustaceans\" in 1909, his first monograph was \"Ferments and physiology\" in 1912 and other important works in the next decade include \"Notes on a scientific work\" (1914), \"Biology papers\" (1918), \"Fundamental biological energy and energetics of kvass\" (1919), \"Does living yeast cause fermentation of sugar only by its zymase?\" (1919), \"Use of ferments in cell physiology studies\" (1919), \"Fundamental biological energy\" (1920), \"About electric thermostate\" (1920) and \"Experimental search for the common energetic foundation in living beings\" (1921), while in 1923 he published the first textbook on human and animal physiology in the region, \"Fundamentals of physiology\". Other scientific works include \"Mutual replacement of food ingredients in peak metabolism\" (1926), \"Basal metabolism and homeothermy\" (1929), \"Peak metabolism\" (1929), \"Problem of evolution\" (1931), \"Homeothermy and thermoregulation I-II\" (1938) and \"Hypothermia, hyberniation and poikilotherms\" (1953). Monograph \"Man and the inventive life\", published in 1955, is considered to be his opus magnum. \n\nPopular and philosophical works include \"Travels of “Obilić” through South Serbia in 1923\" (1929), \"Following the footsteps of life and science\" (1931), \"From life to civilization\" (1933), \"How do we feed?\" (1935), \"Louis Pasteur\" (1937), \"Downstream\" (1938), \"Twosome conversations\" (1938) and \"The look into life\" (1955), while writings aimed at the children include \"Tales of little Zdravko: book for children on nature, hygiene and health\" (1923) and \"What European youth thinks \" (1929).\n\nIn the last year of his life, 1957, he published five papers, while his last article, entitled \"For the scientific youth\", was published in \"Politika\" on the eve of his death. When he died, he left several writings in manuscripts: \"Conversations in Dubrovnik\", \"Short stories\", \"Memories\", \"Physiology and hypothermia\" and his autobiography \"Discovery of the world\".\n\nIvan Đaja is one of the greatest Serbian physiologists and biologists who had the invaluable role in founding the experimentally based scientific physiology in Serbia. Gifted scientist, teacher, philosopher, writer and musician, he was a true modern polymath. As such, he was the founder of biochemistry in Serbia and Southeast Europe. His work brought him a worldwide reputation.\n\nHe was among the first scientists who pointed out the role of the adrenal glands in the body’s thermoregulation and is considered one of the pioneers in the research of hypothermia. He founded the new scientific branch, high altitude hypothermia (or physiology of the cooled organisms) which has a growing application in modern medicine, much more than it had in Đaja’s time.\n\nA diagram he created in 1938 is today known as the \"Đaja’s diagram (of thermoregulation)\" or \"Đaja’s curve\", and the way he brought organisms to hypothermia (reducing the body temperature by asphyxia and cold environment and then complete recovery by warming up the organism) is named \"Đaja’s method of induced hypothermia\" (“hypercapnian hypothermia”). Đaja also invented an apparatus for gas exchange measurement (\"Đaja’s apparatus\"). He coined the terms \"peak (or maximal) metabolism\" and \"metabolic quotient\" which entered the textbooks on the subject.\n\nIn the Institute for Physiology of Serbia, which he founded in 1910 and made a world class scientific facility, he was succeeded by his student Radoslav Anđus (1926-2003) who continued his work and the resulting scientific approach became known as the “Belgrade’s School of physiology“.\n\nCommemoration named \"100 years of Ivan Đaja's Belgrade school of physiology\" was organized from 10 to 14 September 2010 by the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Biology. The event was held in the premises of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Artsm with participation of scientists from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Slovakia, etc. A bust of Ivan Đaja was dedicated during the event, which was later moved to the hall of the Faculty of Biology.\n\nAlready for his first monograph from 1912, “Ferments and Physiology”, Đaja received an award from the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\nFor his studies on hypothermia and thermoregulation, French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Pourat prize in 1940 and the Montyon Prize in 1946.\n\nIn 1954 he was awarded the doctor honoris causa at the Sorbonne, and was also awarded the French Legion of Honour. He was the third Serbian scientist who was awarded Sorbonne’s honorary degree, after Nikola Tesla and Jovan Cvijić. He was also an associate member of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.\n\nIn Belgrade’s municipality of Vračar, a street was named in Đaja’s honor in 2004. Celebrating 100 years of the Institute for Physiology, a commemorative plaque was placed in the street on 10 September 2010.\n\nHe was the recipient of the Serbian Order of the White Eagle, 4th class and Yugoslav Order of Labour, I rank.\n\nHe is remembered as a proper gentleman, always suitably dressed and groomed, and cultural and kind in communication with others. Đaja was also known as propagating humanistic approach, always helping his co-workers and students. With his students, he organized and participated in transfer of the Josif Pančić remains from Belgrade to the Kopaonik mountain. He was known for joking, saying to his friends: \"Come by too see my daughter, she is the best in the field of physiology I have done\".\n\nDuring his tenure at the helm of the University of Belgrade in 1934-35, a major anti-government student protest was organized and to quench it, the police stormed the University. Đaja then supported the students, staunchly protesting the police action. After the war, when the Communists took over the government, he was introduced to the new authoritarian ruler Josip Broz Tito as the \"students mother and red rector\". Đaja replied: \"I protected them so that they can study, their political fervor I considered a youthful frivolity\". When Tito was nominated as the honorable member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Đaja was the only one who voted against him. As a result, the secret service labeled him as \"reactionary and misfit\". When he was inaugurated to the French Academy of sciences in 1956, Yugoslavia refused to send an ambassador. Đaja stated: \"He was free to come, I criticize my country only when I'm in it\".\n\n\n"}

In Kaundinyasana, the strong twist initiated by the legs stimulates the digestive organs and rejuvenates the spine. The asana improves balance and focus as it engages the muscles of the body and helps the mind remain stable.\n\nThe name comes from \"Kaundinya\" (), an Indian sage, and \"asana\" () meaning \"posture\" or \"seat\". The variation for one and two legs include the Sanskrit words for one (ek) or two (dvi), and \"pada\" () meaning \"foot\".\n\nKaundinyasana is traditionally entered from tripod headstand, but one can also get into the asana from Parsva Bakasana. Get the knee far enough up the triceps of the opposite arm before bending the elbows so that the core is fully engaged and the leg is less likely to slide down, making more work for the arms.\n\nThe pressure of the legs on the abdomen in this asana massages the abdominal organs. The spinal twist strengthens and rejuvenates the spine; the pose also strengthens the arms and neck.\n\n"}

The letter was written before Jerome started his translation work (382–405).\n\nJerome agreed that Old-Latin translation should be revised and corrected, acknowledging the numerous differences between every Latin manuscript such that each one looked like its own version. To remedy the problem, Jerome agreed that they should be corrected on the basis of the Greek manuscripts. Jerome explained why the Old-Latin order of the Gospels (Matthew, John, Luke, Mark) should be changed into the order Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, because it is relevant for the Greek manuscripts.

It is a variant of intuitionistic logic that rejects not only the classical law of excluded middle (as intuitionistic logic does), but also the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\nLike intuitionistic logic, minimal logic can be formulated in a language using → (implication), ∧ (conjunction), ∨ (disjunction), and ⊥ (falsum) as the basic connectives, treating ¬A (negation) as an abbreviation for A → ⊥. In this language, it is axiomatized by the positive fragment (i.e., formulas using only →, ∧, and ∨) of intuitionistic logic, with no additional axioms or rules about ⊥. Thus minimal logic is a subsystem of intuitionistic logic, and it is strictly weaker as it does not derive the \"ex falso quodlibet\" principle formula_1 (however, it derives its special case formula_2).\n\nAdding the ex falso axiom formula_3 to minimal logic results in intuitionistic logic, and adding the double negation law formula_4 to minimal logic results in classical logic (Troelstra and Schwichtenburg 2000:37)\n\n\n"}

Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy. By re-formulating supposed problems in a way that makes the misguided reasoning from which they arise apparent, the quietist hopes to put an end to humanity's confusion, and help return to a state of intellectual quietude.\n\nBy its very nature, quietism is not a philosophical school as understood in the traditional sense of a body of doctrines, but still it can be identified both by its methodology, which focuses on language and the use of words, and by its objective, which is to show that most philosophical problems are only pseudo-problems.\n\nPyrrhonism represents perhaps the earliest example of an identifiably quietist position in the West. Sextus Empiricus regarded Pyrrhonism not as a nihilistic attack but rather as a form of philosophical therapy:\n\nContemporary discussion of quietism can be traced back to Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose work greatly influenced the Ordinary Language philosophers. One of the early 'ordinary language' works, Gilbert Ryle's \"The Concept of Mind\", attempted to demonstrate that dualism arises from a failure to appreciate that mental vocabulary and physical vocabulary are simply different ways of describing one and the same thing, namely human behaviour. J. L. Austin's \"Sense and Sensibilia\" took a similar approach to the problems of skepticism and the reliability of sense perception, arguing that they arise only by misconstruing ordinary language, not because there is anything genuinely wrong with empirical evidence. Norman Malcolm, a friend of Wittgenstein's, took a quietist approach to skeptical problems in the philosophy of mind. More recently, the philosophers John McDowell and Richard Rorty have taken explicitly quietist positions.\n\n\n"}

He is researcher for the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Rome. He is Professor Emeritus in Psychoanalysis at the International Institute of Depth Psychology in Kiev. He founded and edited the European Journal of Psychoanalysis (since 2012 also published in Russian).\n\nHe studied at the University of Paris 7 between 1967 and 1973, where he obtained a Maîtrise (master's degree) in Psychology. In the same period he followed seminars by Roland Barthes (at the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes) and Jacques Lacan. \nHe obtained his second degree in Sociology (in 1976) at the University of Urbino (Italy) and trained in psychoanalysis with analysts Elvio Fachinelli and Diego Napolitani in Milan, where he lived and worked between 1974 and 1979. He was Visiting Researcher at the Philosophy Department of the New School for Social Research (1989-1991). Since moving from Milan to Rome he has divided his work activities between research in Social Psychology with CNR, his private practice as analyst and his writing, both as author of papers and as journalist publishing in newspapers and magazines. \nIn 1984, he co-founded the cultural magazine Lettre Internationale (which comes out with editions in German, Italian, Spanish and several other languages). He also contributes to American Imago and to various international magazines (such as the French L’Evolution psychiatrique and Cliniques Méditerranéennes, the German Texte, the Russian Psykoanalyz). In 1995 he founded in New York the semestral Journal of European Psychoanalysis, later EJPsy - European Journal of Psychoanalysis, which he edited until 2012 (www.journal-psychoanalysis.eu). Since 2011 he teaches Psychoanalysis at Kiev’s Institute of Depth Psychology.\n\nBenvenuto has addressed fields apparently very different from one another – social psychology, philosophy of language, political philosophy, psychoanalysis, political theory – in the nineties he began to structure a predominant project that touches upon all these fields: to replace the primacy of reflection on Truth (typical of Western culture) with a reflection that aims at the Real. In this way he seeks a third way between the two predominant and opposing Western cultures: positivist epistemology (concerned with the truth conditions of propositions) on the one hand, and hermeneutics (concerned with disclosing a Truth that unravels throughout human history) on the other. He adopts the concept of Real from Jacques Lacan, but broadens its meaning, including in it everything that remains external (origin and remainder) to every structure of sense, whether scientific, aesthetic, ethical and political. The Real is the background upon which every scientific theory, every artistic production, the psychoanalysis of each subject, every ethic arrangement, revolves and it is always in excess of all these “discourses”. Thus, the Real of every scientific theory is the Chaos that sets itself as the limit and background of every causative process. The Real in psychoanalysis is the background to the drives, the bodily, irreducibly individual background before which all interpretation stops. \nIn particular (for example in La strategia freudiana [The Freudian Strategy] and in Perversionen [Perversions]) he has engaged in an original reinterpretation of Freudian theory and of psychoanalysis in general, as founded on a precise metaphysics of “the signifying flesh”. Freud’s interpretative and explicative tissue, however, also refers to something uninterpretable and inexplicable: the drive as an opaque non-signifying source of subjectivity.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first donation happened when someone left ten 30,000-yen backpacks at a child guidance center in Gunma Prefecture on Christmas Day in 2010. A note attached to the bags was signed \"Naoto Date\", the real name of the titular character of \"Tiger Mask\", a popular 1960s and 70s manga about a wrestler who fought for orphans, being raised in an orphanage himself. Since the initial donation, copycat donations have appeared around Japan at various facilities for children, ranging from more backpacks to toys, food, and monetary gifts.\n\nMany of the donations have been made under the name of Naoto Date, a character in the manga and anime \"Tiger Mask\". In the manga and anime, Tiger Mask (whose real name was Naoto Date) was a feared heel wrestler in America who was extremely vicious in the ring. However, he became a face after returning to Japan when a young boy said that he wanted to be a villain like Tiger Mask when he grew up. The boy lived in an orphanage, the same one that Tiger Mask grew up in during his childhood. Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler and fights for the children in the orphanage.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, in Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture, a child guidance center was visited by someone leaving ten 30,000-yen (about US$360) backpacks: five black backpacks wrapped with blue ribbons, and five red backpacks wrapped with pink ribbons. A card attached to the bags simply said:\nPlease use these backpacks for the children.\n\n\"(signed)\" Naoto Date \n\nThe backpacks were to be distributed between six orphans from six different orphanages in Gunma.\n\nA second donation was found by a security guard at the Odawara Child Guidance Center in Kanagawa Prefecture on 1 January 2011. Six backpacks, three black and three red, were left. A note left behind stated:\nA New Year's gift — Naoto Date\n<br>\nThe donation of backpacks in Gunma last year moved me deeply. My heart skipped a beat when I heard the news. Thinking I might do something as well, I offer these gifts. May the Tiger Mask movement live on.\nAs with the ten original backpacks in Gunma, they were left with a note signed by Naoto Date. The backpacks were to be distributed to new arrivals at the local orphanages and other children that Odawara Child Guidance center serves.\n\nJapan has around 580 children's centers that house around 30,000 children.\n\nAs of January 11, 2011, over 100 donations inspired by Tiger Mask have been reported across Japan. After the two initial donations, many other orphanages and children's facilities began to receive copycat donations of backpacks. Some have also received toys, food, and money to help pay for new backpacks. In addition, parallels to other anime and manga concerning orphaned children have also crept into the donation phenomenon.\n\nSometime during the night of March 17 - morning of March 18, three cars parked at an evacuation center in Yamadamachi, Iwate had their tanks filled up and two 20-liter containers of heating oil were left outside the center by an unknown person. An evacuee discovered the donation upon starting his car and noticing his fuel gauge go from nearly empty to full. The evacuee noted: \"We had hardly any fuel left. We were in a real pinch. I'm so grateful for the donation. I reckon it was Tiger Mask.\" The evacuation center noted that they would use the heating oil during the night to conserve fuel due to the ongoing crisis. Other child welfare offices and agencies have reported increased, anonymous donations in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nBecause tax benefits for charitable donations are limited in Japan, a culture of charity donations has never really taken root. For example, the ratio of charitable donations by individuals in Japan is 52.5%, compared with 82.7% for the US. Also, Japanese culture emphasizes modesty, which means that Japanese people are generally reluctant to do good deeds in public view. Therefore, the Tiger Mask movement assuages both cultural inhibitions towards charitable deeds; it gives people in Japan a reason to donate while allowing them to do so anonymously.\n\nSeveral donators left notes purportedly from other fictional characters from franchises outside the Tiger Mask series. Notable characters who \"donated\" include Rei and Kaji from \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", Haruhi Suzumiya, and Stitch.\n"}

The papyrus is the most extensive list available of kings compiled by the ancient Egyptians, and is the basis for most chronology before the reign of Ramesses II.\n\nThe papyrus is believed to date from the reign of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty. The beginning and ending of the list are now lost; there is no introduction, and the list does not continue after the 19th Dynasty. The composition may thus have occurred at any subsequent time, from the reign of Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty.\nThe papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of reigns in years, with months and days for some kings. In some cases they are grouped together by family, which corresponds approximately to the dynasties of Manetho’s book. The list includes the names of ephemeral rulers or those ruling small territories that may be unmentioned in other sources.\n\nThe list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (enclosing borders which indicate the name of a king), and a hieroglyphic sign is added to indicate that they were foreigners, although typically on King Lists foreign rulers are not listed.\n\nThe papyrus was originally a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt – including mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. That the back of an older papyrus was used may indicate that the list was not of great formal importance to the writer, although the primary function of the list is thought to have been as an administrative aid. As such, the papyrus is less likely to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt known to its writers up to the 19th or 20th Dynasty.\n\nThe papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 at Luxor (Thebes), Egypt and was acquired in 1824 by the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy and was designated Papyrus Number 1874. When the box in which it had been transported to Italy was unpacked, the list had disintegrated into small fragments. Jean-Francois Champollion, examining it, could recognize only some of the larger fragments containing royal names, and produced a drawing of what he could decipher. A reconstruction of the list was created to better understand it and to aid in research.\n\nThe Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth (1796–1885) re-examined the fragments, some only one square centimeter in size, and made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not yet determine the meaning of the hieratic characters. Subsequent work on the fragments was done by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, which largely confirmed the Seyffarth reconstruction.\n\nIn 1997, prominent Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new and better interpretation of the list in his book, \"The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1800–1550 B.C.\" After another study of the papyrus, an updated version from Ryholt is expected. Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that although many of the list's names correspond to monuments and other documents, there are some discrepancies and not all of the names correspond, questioning the absolute reliability of the document for pre-Ramesses II chronology.\n\nDespite attempts at reconstruction, approximately 50% of the papyrus remains missing. This papyrus as presently constituted is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 fragments. In 2009, previously unpublished fragments were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition. A new edition of the papyrus is expected.\n\nThe name Hudjefa, found twice in the papyrus, is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of the Ramesside era during the 19th dynasty of ancient Egypt when the scribes compiled king lists such as the royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin and the name of a deceased pharaoh was unreadable, damaged, or completely erased.\n\nThe papyrus is divided into eleven columns, distributed as follows. The names and positions of several kings are still being disputed, since the list is so badly damaged.\n\n\nThese are the actual names written on the papyrus, omitting the years, summations and headings:\n\n\n\n\n"}
