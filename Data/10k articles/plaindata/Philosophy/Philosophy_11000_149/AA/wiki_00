Addresses posted on webpages, Usenet or chat rooms are particularly vulnerable to this. Private e-mail sent between individuals is highly unlikely to be collected, but e-mail sent to a mailing list that is archived and made available via the web, or passed onto a Usenet news server and made public, may eventually be scanned and collected.\n\nDisguising addresses makes it more difficult for people to send e-mail to each other. Many see it as an attempt to fix a symptom rather than solving the real problem of e-mail spam, at the expense of causing problems for innocent users. In addition, there are e-mail address harvesters who have found ways to read the munged email addresses.\n\nThe use of address munging on Usenet is contrary to the recommendations of RFC 1036 governing the format of Usenet posts, which requires a valid e-mail address be supplied in the From: field of the post. In practice, few people follow this recommendation strictly.\n\nDisguising e-mail addresses in a systematic manner (for example, user[at]domain[dot]com) offers little protection. For example, such addresses can be revealed through a simple Google Search.\n\nAny impediment reduces the user's willingness to take the extra trouble to email the user. In contrast, well-maintained e-mail filtering on the user's end does not drive away potential correspondents. No spam filter is 100 percent immune to false positives, however, and the same potential correspondent that would have been deterred by address munging may instead end up wasting time on long letters that will merely disappear into junk mail folders.\n\nFor commercial entities, maintaining contact forms on web pages rather than publicizing e-mail addresses may be one way to ensure that incoming messages are relatively spam-free yet do not get lost. In conjunction with CAPTCHA fields, spam on such comment fields can be reduced to effectively zero, except that non-accessibility of CAPTCHAs bring exactly the same deterrent problems as address munging itself.\n\nAs an alternative to address munging, there are several \"transparent\" techniques that allow people to post a valid e-mail address, but still make it difficult for automated recognition and collection of the address:\n\n\nAn example of munging \"<nowiki>user@example.com</nowiki>\" via client-side scripting would be:\n\nThe use of images and scripts for address obfuscation can cause problems for people using screen readers and users with disabilities,\nand ignores users of text browsers like lynx and w3m, although being transparent means they don't disadvantage non-English speakers that cannot understand the plain text bound to a single language that is part of non-transparent munged addresses or instructions that accompany them.\n\nAccording to a 2003 study by the Center for Democracy and Technology, even the simplest \"transparent name mangling\" of e-mail addresses can be effective.\n\nCommon methods of disguising addresses include:\n\nThe reserved top-level domain .invalid is appended to ensure that a real e-mail address is not inadvertently generated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1573", "title": "Albertus Magnus", "text": "Albertus Magnus\n\nAlbertus Magnus, O.P. (c. 1193 – November 15, 1280), also known as Saint Albert the Great and Albert of Cologne, was a German Catholic Dominican friar and bishop. Later canonised as a Catholic saint, he was known during his lifetime as \"Doctor universalis\" and \"Doctor expertus\" and, late in his life, the sobriquet \"Magnus\" was appended to his name. Scholars such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. Söder have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the Middle Ages. The Catholic Church distinguishes him as one of the 36 Doctors of the Church.\n\nIt seems likely that Albert was born sometime before 1200, given well-attested evidence that he was aged over 80 on his death in 1280. More than one source says that Albert was 87 on his death, which has led 1193 to be commonly given as the date of Albert's birth. Albert was probably born in Lauingen (now in Bavaria), since he called himself 'Albert of Lauingen', but this might simply be a family name. Most probably his family was of \"ministerial\" class; his familiar connection with (being son of the count) Bollstädt noble family was a 15th-century misinterpretation that is now completely disproved.\n\nAlbert was probably educated principally at the University of Padua, where he received instruction in Aristotle's writings. A late account by Rudolph de Novamagia refers to Albertus' encounter with the Blessed Virgin Mary, who convinced him to enter Holy Orders. In 1223 (or 1229) he became a member of the Dominican Order, and studied theology at Bologna and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, as well as in Regensburg, Freiburg, Strasbourg, and Hildesheim. During his first tenure as lecturer at Cologne, Albert wrote his \"Summa de bono\" after discussion with Philip the Chancellor concerning the transcendental properties of being. In 1245, Albert became master of theology under Gueric of Saint-Quentin, the first German Dominican to achieve this distinction. Following this turn of events, Albert was able to teach theology at the University of Paris as a full-time professor, holding the seat of the Chair of Theology at the College of St. James. During this time Thomas Aquinas began to study under Albertus.\n\nAlbert was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of Aristotle, thus making them accessible to wider academic debate. The study of Aristotle brought him to study and comment on the teachings of Muslim academics, notably Avicenna and Averroes, and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate.\n\nIn 1254 Albert was made provincial of the Dominican Order, and fulfilled the duties of the office with great care and efficiency. During his tenure he publicly defended the Dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the University of Paris, commented on John the Evangelist, and answered what he perceived as errors of the Islamic philosopher Averroes.\n\nIn 1259 Albert took part in the General Chapter of the Dominicans at Valenciennes together with Thomas Aquinas, masters Bonushomo Britto, Florentius, and Peter (later Pope Innocent V) establishing a \"ratio studiorum\" or program of studies for the Dominicans that featured the study of philosophy as an innovation for those not sufficiently trained to study theology. This innovation initiated the tradition of Dominican scholastic philosophy put into practice, for example, in 1265 at the Order's \"studium provinciale\" at the convent of Santa Sabina in Rome, out of which would develop the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, the \"Angelicum\".\n\nIn 1260 Pope Alexander IV made him bishop of Regensburg, an office from which he resigned after three years. During the exercise of his duties he enhanced his reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse, in accord with the dictates of the Order, instead traversing his huge diocese on foot. This earned him the affectionate sobriquet \"boots the bishop\" from his parishioners. In 1263 Pope Urban IV relieved him of the duties of bishop and asked him to preach the eighth Crusade in German-speaking countries. After this, he was especially known for acting as a mediator between conflicting parties. In Cologne he is not only known for being the founder of Germany's oldest university there, but also for \"the big verdict\" (der Große Schied) of 1258, which brought an end to the conflict between the citizens of Cologne and the archbishop. Among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, Thomas Aquinas, whose death in 1274 grieved Albert (the story that he travelled to Paris in person to defend the teachings of Aquinas can not be confirmed).\n\nAlbert was a scientist, philosopher, astrologer, theologian, spiritual writer, ecumenist, and diplomat. Under the auspices of Humbert of Romans, Albert molded the curriculum of studies for all Dominican students, introduced Aristotle to the classroom and probed the work of Neoplatonists, such as Plotinus. Indeed, it was the thirty years of work done by Aquinas and himself that allowed for the inclusion of Aristotelian study in the curriculum of Dominican schools.\n\nAfter suffering a collapse of health in 1278, he died on November 15, 1280, in the Dominican convent in Cologne, Germany. Since November 15, 1954, his relics are in a Roman sarcophagus in the crypt of the Dominican St. Andreas Church in Cologne. Although his body was discovered to be incorrupt at the first exhumation three years after his death, at the exhumation in 1483 only a skeleton remained.\n\nAlbert was beatified in 1622. He was canonized and proclaimed a Doctor of the Church on December 16, 1931, by Pope Pius XI and the patron saint of natural scientists in 1941. St. Albert's feast day is November 15.\n\nAlbert's writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as logic, theology, botany, geography, astronomy, astrology, mineralogy, alchemy, zoology, physiology, phrenology, justice, law, friendship, and love. He digested, interpreted, and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albert.\n\nHis principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of Peter Lombard (\"Magister Sententiarum\"), and the \"Summa Theologiae\" in two volumes. The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.\n\nAlbert's activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see Scholasticism). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes, are generally divided according to the Aristotelian scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master. Albert believed that Aristotle's approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a Christian philosophical view of the natural order.\n\nAlbert's knowledge of natural science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great: not only did he produce commentaries and paraphrases of the entire Aristotelian corpus, including his scientific works, but Albert also added to and improved upon them. His books on topics like botany, zoology, and minerals included information from ancient sources, but also results of his own empirical investigations. These investigations pushed several of the special sciences forward, beyond the reliance on classical texts. In the case of embryology, for example, it has been claimed that little of value was written between Aristotle and Albert, who managed to identify organs within eggs. Furthermore, Albert also effectively invented entire special sciences, where Aristotle has not covered a topic. For example, prior to Albert, there was no systematic study of minerals. For the breadth of these achievements, he was bestowed the name \"Doctor Universalis.\"\n\nMuch of Albert's empirical contributions to the natural sciences have been superseded, but his general approach to science may be surprisingly modern. For example, in \"De Mineralibus\" (Book II, Tractate ii, Ch. 1) Albert claims, \"For it is [the task] of natural science not simply to accept what we are told but to inquire into the causes of natural things.\"\n\nIn the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albert as an alchemist and magician. \"Much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works, particularly the alchemical work known as the \"Secreta Alberti\" or the \"Experimenta Alberti\", were falsely attributed to Albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through association.\" On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, \"De mineralibus\", he refers to the power of stones, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be. A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include \"Metals and Materials\"; the \"Secrets of Chemistry\"; the \"Origin of Metals\"; the \"Origins of Compounds\", and a \"Concordance \"which is a collection of \"Observations on the philosopher's stone\"; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of \"Theatrum Chemicum\". He is credited with the discovery of the element arsenic and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including silver nitrate. He did believe that stones had occult properties, as he related in his work \"De mineralibus\". However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments.\n\nAccording to legend, Albert is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone and passed it on to his pupil Thomas Aquinas, shortly before his death. Albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by \"transmutation.\" Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albert's death, this legend as stated is unlikely.\n\nAlbert was deeply interested in astrology, as has been articulated by scholars such as Paola Zambelli and Scott Hendrix. Throughout the Middle Ages –and well into the early modern period– astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm (the latter being the cosmos itself). It was believed that correspondence therefore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth. With this worldview, it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being. Albert argued that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with Christian precepts. The most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260, now known as the \"Speculum astronomiae\". However, details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote, from his early \"De natura boni\" to his last work, the \"Summa theologiae\".\n\nAlbert believed that all natural things were compositions of matter and form, he referred to it as \"quod est\" and \"quo est\". Albert also believed that God alone is the absolute ruling entity. Albert's version of hylomorphism is very similar to the Aristotelian doctrine.\n\nAlbert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's \"Poetics\". He rejected the idea of \"music of the spheres\" as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which plainchant could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.\n\nBoth of his early treatises, \"De natura boni\" and \"De bono\", start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good. Albert refers to the physical good as \"bonum naturae\". Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of Pseudo-Dionysius. Albert's view was highly valued by the Catholic Church and his peers.\n\nAlbert devoted the last tractatus of \"De Bono\" to a theory of justice and natural law. Albert places God as the pinnacle of justice and natural law. God legislates and divine authority is supreme. Up until his time, it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosopher.\n\nAlbert mentions friendship in his work, \"De bono\", as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of \"Tractatus II\". Later in his life he published \"Super Ethica\". With his development of friendship throughout his work it is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on. Albert comments on Aristotle's view of friendship with a quote from Cicero, who writes, \"friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human, with goodwill and love\". Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement. Albert calls this harmony, \"consensio\", itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful (\"utile\"), the pleasurable (\"delectabile\") and the authentic or unqualified good (\"honestum\"). Then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels, namely friendship based on usefulness (\"amicitia utilis\"), friendship based on pleasure (\"amicitia delectabilis\"), and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness (\"amicitia honesti\"; \"amicitia quae fundatur super honestum\").\n\nThe iconography of the tympanum and archivolts of the late 13th-century portal of Strasbourg Cathedral was inspired by Albert's writings. Albert is frequently mentioned by Dante, who made his doctrine of free will the basis of his ethical system. In his \"Divine Comedy\", Dante places Albertus with his pupil Thomas Aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom (\"Spiriti Sapienti\") in the Heaven of the Sun. Albert is also mentioned, along with Agrippa and Paracelsus, in Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", in which his writings influence a young Victor Frankenstein.\n\nIn \"The Concept of Anxiety\", Søren Kierkegaard wrote that Albert, \"arrogantly boasted of his speculation before the deity and suddenly became stupid.\" Kierkegaard cites Gotthard Oswald Marbach whom he quotes as saying \"Albertus repente ex asino factus philosophus et ex philosopho asinus\" [Albert was suddenly transformed from an ass into a philosopher and from a philosopher into an ass].\n\nJohann Eduard Erdmann considers Albert greater and more original than his pupil Aquinas.\n\nA number of schools have been named after Albert, including Albertus Magnus High School in Bardonia, New York; Albertus Magnus Lyceum in River Forest, Illinois; and Albertus Magnus College in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nAlbertus Magnus Science Hall at Thomas Aquinas College, in Santa Paula, California, is named in honor of Albert. The main science buildings at Providence College and Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, are also named after him.\n\nThe central square at the campus of the University of Cologne features a statue of Albert and is named after him.\n\nThe Academy for Science and Design in New Hampshire honored Albert by naming one of its four houses Magnus House.\n\nAs a tribute to the scholar's contributions to the law, the University of Houston Law Center displays a statue of Albert. It is located on the campus of the University of Houston.\n\nThe Albertus-Magnus-Gymnasien is found in Rottweil, Germany.\n\nIn Managua, Nicaragua, the Albertus Magnus International Institute, a business and economic development research center, was founded in 2004.\n\nIn The Philippines, the Albertus Magnus Building at the University of Santo Tomas that houses the Conservatory of Music, College of Tourism and Hospitality Management, College of Education, and UST Education High School is named in his honor. The Saint Albert the Great Science Academy in San Carlos City, Pangasinan, which offers preschool, elementary and high school education, takes pride in having St. Albert as their patron saint. Its main building was named Albertus Magnus Hall in 2008. San Alberto Magno Academy in Tubao, La Union is also dedicated in his honor. This century-old Catholic high school continues to live on its vision-mission up to this day, offering Senior High school courses.\nDue to his contributions to natural philosophy, the plant species \"Alberta magna\" and the asteroid 20006 Albertus Magnus were named after him.\n\nNumerous Catholic elementary and secondary schools are named for him, including schools in Toronto; Calgary; Cologne; and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe Albertus typeface is named after him.\nAt the University of Notre Dame du Lac in South Bend, Indiana, USA, the Zahm House Chapel is dedicated to St. Albert the Great. Fr. John Zahm, C.S.C., after whom the men's residence hall is named, looked to St. Albert's example of using religion to illumine scientific discovery. Fr. Zahm's work with the Bible and evolution is sometimes seen as a continuation of St. Albert's legacy.\n\nLocated in Groningen, The second largest student's fraternity of the Netherlands is named , in honour of the Saint.\n\nThe Colegio Cientifico y Artistico de San Alberto, Hopelawn, New Jersey, USA with a sister school in Nueva Ecija, Philippines was founded in 1986 in honor of him who thought and taught that religion, the sciences and the arts may be advocated as subjects which should not contradict each other but should support one another to achieve wisdom and reason.\n\nThe Vosloorus catholic parish (located in Vosloorus Extension One, Ekurhuleni, Gauteng, South Africa) is named after the Saint.\n\nThe catholic parish in Leopoldshafen, near Karlsruhe in Germany is also named after him also considering the huge research center of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology nearby, as he is the patron saint of scientists.\n\nSince the death of King Albert I, the King's Feast is celebrated in Belgium on Albert's feast day.\n\n\n\n\n"}

(December 27, 1894 – November 16, 1956) was a major Maltese philosopher. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were chiefly epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nPirotta was born at Naxxar, Malta. Even if his family lived hand to mouth, he was the first of thirteen children, three of whom died in infancy.\n\nPirotta was first privately schooled by Canon Fortunato De Bono. Later, he eventually enrolled on a regular course at the government-owned high school for boys (the Lyceum) at Valletta. He completed the course at the Lyceum up till the age of sixteen. Thereafter, he joined the Dominicans almost immediately, on April 30, 1911.\n\nAt Rabat, together with his companions, Pirotta began his novitiate, and then, a year later, made his simple (three-year) profession on May 12, 1912. Thereafter, he began his institutional studies; three years of philosophy (1912–15), and four of theology (1915–19), of course all according to the [Thomist] tradition. He made his religious profession on May 11, 1915.\n\nAfter completing his second year of theology (1916/17), Pirotta was chosen to continue his theological studies at Pontifical International Angelicum College in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\". In the meantime, he was ordained a priest by on September 22, 1917, at the St. John’s Co-Cathedral, Valletta, Malta.\n\nIn Rome Pirotta resided at the Angelicum College itself. After his two years of theology (1917–19), on July 1, 1919, he successfully set for his Lectorate exams with a dissertation entitled De Reali Distinctione inter Essentiam et Esse in Creatis (The Real Distinction between Essence and Existence in Created Being). Thereafter, he proceeded with his post-graduate studies in philosophy (1919–21). Meanwhile, he also prepared his doctorate thesis, entitled De Supposto et Persona, which he successfully defended on, July 1, 1921.\n\nPirotta’s first academic assignment was at Viterbo. Here he spent five academic years (1921–26), teaching history of philosophy, natural science (also called ‘physics’), and theodicy (\"theologia fundamentalis\"; now called natural theology). Here he was frequently invited to address the \"Circulus Philosophicus\" (Philosophical Discussion Group), and was also asked to contribute to prestigious Thomistic periodicals, read sermons, and give speeches. At Viterbo, Pirotta also prepared his first major publication, and frankly his most successful composition to date: an exposition of Aquinas’ commentary on Aristotle’s De Anima (On the Soul).\n\nAfter Viterbo, Pirotta returned to Rome to assume a teaching post at the Angelicum College. Here Pirotta remained for just two years (1926-28), teaching philosophy, theodicy, logic, and ontology.\n\nIn terms of literary production, Pirotta’s Roman years correspond to a very prolific and industrious period. He wrote reviews, scientific articles, and even prepared and published his second major work: another exposition on Aquinas’ commentaries on Aristotle’s De Sensu et Sensato (On Sense and Sensibility) and De Memoria et Reminiscientia (On Memory and Remembrance).\n\nIn 1928 Pirotta had to retire momentarily to his homeland since his family was in dire straits. One of his brothers became seriously ill, and his mother was ill and dying. She succumbed on July 5, 1929.\n\nIn Malta Pirotta spent two academic years (1928–30), residing and lecturing at Rabat, Malta. More or less as usual, Pirotta read philosophy, the history of philosophy, and apologetics. He also continued to publish steadily, especially scientific reviews and articles.\n\nBack in Italy, Pirotta was sent to College of Fiesole, near Florence, Italy. The college here was not a public one, but the academic institution that prepared Dominican students for the priesthood. Pirotta stayed here for just one academic year (1930/31), reading the history of philosophy, and the treatise on divine revelation.\n\nHere he also worked upon the first of his six-volumed \"Summa Philosophæ\" (The Sum of Philosophy), which he published in 1931. He also prepared for his Masters. The final exam was successfully held on May 7, 1931, in Rome at the Angelicum College, which by that time had been upgraded to the status of an international university. As was the usual practice, the title was conferred four years later. The official investiture was held at the Dominican Priory at Rabat, Malta on November 24, 1935.\n\nAfter Tuscany came Naples. Here, at the Aquinas College of the Dominicans, Pirotta did not go simply as a lecturer, but as a Rector (\"‘Lectorem Primarium’\"). He stayed here for three consecutive academic years (1931–34).\n\nAt Naples, Pirotta may be considered to have been at the peak of his academic career. At the beginning of his experience there he published the first of his planned six-volumed \"Summa Philosophæ\": a study about Aristotelico-Thomistic logic, called the Philosophia Rationalis (Rational Philosophy). Later, he proceeded to publish his third exposition: this time of Aquinas’ commentary on Aristotle’s Ethicorum ad Nichomachum (Nichomachean Ethics).\n\nIn 1934, Pirotta was recalled to Malta, at Rabat, Malta. During the first academic year (1934/35) he was just a lecturer of philosophy. In the following year, however, he was chosen to be the Rector of the college. He retained this office for nine years, up till 1944, which included the worst of the World War II years in Malta.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1935/36 academic year, Pirotta was officially conferred with his Masters. A few months later, he issued his second volume of the \"Summa Philosophiæ\", the one dealing with natural philosophy, and called Philosophia Naturalis.\n\nIn 1938 Pirotta applied for the Deanship of philosophy at the Royal University of Malta. Though unmatched or much less unsurpassed by any other contender, he lost the competition nonetheless. Though he took the rebuff most gracefully, Pirotta decided to make some drastic changes to his life. Thus, from 1939 onwards, right up to his death, he lived the larger part of his days at Naxxar, staying at his convent at Rabat, Malta only as little as possible.\n\nAt Rabat, Malta Pirotta was still the Rector, and still read philosophy at the college there. Also from 1939 onwards, he acted as supplementary examiner at the Royal University of Malta. He further continued to deliver sermons here and there, and even to hear confessions on a regular basis.\n\nBefore the war was over, at the end of the academic year of 1943/44, Pirotta – now almost fifty years of age – was relieved of the post of Rector at Rabat, Malta. During these years he assiduously worked on his next publication, which eventually had to be his last. This was his fourth exposition, the one on Aquinas’ eight books of commentaries on Aristotle’s De Physico Auditu (Physics). It was published in 1953.\n\nOne fatal day in the latter part of 1955, Pirotta became victim of acute cerebral vascular insufficiency due to diabetes and chronic smoking. As a result, his memory had become seriously impaired, and so was his reasoning powers. He died at his parents’ home at Naxxar on November 16, 1956, a month short of his sixty-second birthday, and buried in the Dominican church of Our Lady of the Grotto at Rabat, Malta.\n\n\nThe commentaries would represent the main output for a Thomistic intellectual with which he really shows his mettle. Apart of Pirotta’s two published volumes that were part of his \"Summa Philosophiæ Aristotelico-Thomisticæ\", published in 1931 and 1936 respectively, these commentaries―especially the first on the \"De Anima\"―were in fact the intellectual productions that effectively brought Pirotta most renown.\n\n\nUnlike the commentaries, these articles take up some point or aspect of a particular theme on which Pirotta expands upon. With the exception of the very early ones, published by Pirotta when still at the beginning of his career, the rest are master works that would have been minutely scrutinized by the editorial boards concerned before publication, and furthermore exposed Pirotta’s intellect to a wide readership within international Thomistic academic circles. After publication, almost all of these articles had been subsequently distributed as separate extracts.\n\n\nThe following reviews, though interesting in themselves, contain little philosophical value. What they do attest to is the standing Pirotta enjoyed with the various editors of the respective scientific journals who had valued Pirotta’s proficiency enough so as to consider him an academic and intellectual worthy of passing authoritative judgement on the writings of other reputed Thomists. Pirotta does not disappoint. He showers praise when earned, but certainly does not shy away from lashing out when warranted.\n\n\nPirotta’s manuscripts are invaluable documents, as they attest to his background operational activities, and moreover to the keenness and responsibility with which he undertook any commitment, especially those of a philosophical nature. Most of the following texts are incomplete, as Pirotta had not as yet given them their final finishing. To some he surely intended to add on other material. Nonetheless, even as they stand, these documents can be taken as reliable attestations to Pirotta’s proficiency of labour, and intensity of thought.\n\n\nThe following list of notes are working annotations prepared by Pirotta for various publications, academic talks, or lectures, over an extended period of time. All of them are undated. Some of them had been grouped by Pirotta under the title \"‘Studia Philosophica’\" (Philosophical Studies). Their philosophical interest is not to be undervalued. While some of the documents hereunder are full written drafts, others are just elaborate schemes of branches of Aristotelico-Thomistic philosophy.\n\n\nThe following written texts are full transcripts of talks read by Pirotta on various occasions at the several academic institutes, both in Malta and in Italy, that he was part of. None of them have ever been published.\n\n\nThe following texts are the extant sermons that Pirotta read during his pastoral work. All of them have been probably delivered in Malta, even the Italian ones. Roughly speaking, the Italian orations would have been read to diocesan priests or members of religious orders, and the Maltese ones to the general faithful. Though most of them do not contain any philosophical interest, some of them do bear witness to Pirotta’s philosophical type of mind, even when treating spiritual or religious matters.\n\nPirotta’s extant sermons in Italian are all collected at the Dominican archives at Rabat, Malta. Most of the titles are Pirotta’s own.\n\n\nPirotta’s extant sermons in Maltese are collected in separate groups of manuscripts (as indicated). They are all kept at the Dominican archives at Rabat, Malta. The titles are generally Pirotta’s own.\n\nPirotta was the last of major philosophers within the school of Scholasticism. With him, an era of Scholastics, extending back to the latter part of the 16th century, starting with John Matthew Rispoli, came to an end. Today, as philosophy took new shapes and adopted different language-forms, Pirotta might appear almost incomprehensible in his world-view and philosophical method. This is further intensified his consistent use of Latin, a language very few still remember how to use or read.\n\nThough a great speculative thinker, it is somewhat difficult to gauge Pirotta’s originality. Surely his lack of concrete commitment with things social and political, as any old-time, first division scholastic would be, today makes him suspect of a certain lack of concern for world affairs as for the fate of humans. However, the scholastics had another way of understanding what philosophical service to humankind should be. Arguably, they sought to enlighten the highest (or most profound) aspects of reason, there where the quality of life might be improved and perfected.\n\nMuch work is still needed to continue discovering the wealth which philosophers of the calibre of Pirotta possessed.\n\n\n"}

It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them.\n\n\"Audi alteram partem\" is considered to be a principle of fundamental justice or equity or the principle of natural justice in most legal systems. This principle includes the rights of a party or his lawyers to confront the witnesses against him, to have a fair opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the other party, to summon one's own witnesses and to present evidence, and to have counsel, if necessary at public expense, in order to make one's case properly.\n\nThe phrase has come to be used as the motto for various political and judicial organisations, and is also the origin of the name of the German carmaker Audi.\n\nAs a general principle of rationality in reaching conclusions in disputed matters, \"Hear both sides\" was treated as part of common wisdom by the ancient Greek dramatists. A similar principle can also be found in Islamic law, based on a hadith indicating that in litigation, both parties must be heard. The principle was referred to by the International Court of Justice in the \"Nuclear Tests\" case, referring to France's non-appearance at judgment. Modern legal systems differ on whether individuals can be convicted \"in absentia\". The principle is used in labour law matters in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Political Interest Society of the University of Melbourne uses the phrase as its motto. The All-Campus Judicial Council of the University of Rochester has used the phrase as its motto since 2001.\n\nThe phrase is also the origin of the name of German carmaker Audi. Founder August Horch had left his previous company, Motorwagenwerke, after a dispute with partners and founded a new company on 16 July 1909, initially named the \"August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH\". His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, and the German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) ruled that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. Horch therefore called a meeting with close business friends Paul and Franz Fikentscher, to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, \"Father – \"audiatur et altera pars\"... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it \"audi\" instead of \"horch\"?\" \"Horch!\" in German means \"Hark!\" or \"hear\", which is \"Audi\" in the singular imperative form of \"audire\" – \"to listen\" – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting, and the company was registered as \"Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau\" in 1910.\n\n"}

{"id": "4394717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4394717", "title": "Body plan", "text": "Body plan\n\nA body plan, Bauplan (German plural Baupläne), or ground plan is a set of morphological features common to many members of a phylum of animals. The vertebrate body plan is one of many: invertebrates consist of many phyla.\n\nThis term, usually applied to animals, envisages a \"blueprint\" encompassing aspects such as symmetry, segmentation and limb disposition. Evolutionary developmental biology seeks to explain the origins of diverse body plans.\n\nBody plans have historically been considered to have evolved in a flash in the Cambrian explosion, but a more nuanced understanding of animal evolution suggests gradual development of body plans throughout the early Palaeozoic.\n\nThe history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on the vertebrates, to seeing the vertebrates (or chordates) as one phylum's body plan among many. Among the pioneering zoologists, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve. For comparison, the number of phyla recognised by modern zoologists has risen to 36.\n\nIn his 1735 book, \"Systema Naturæ\", the Swedish botanist Linnaeus grouped the animals into quadrupeds, birds, \"amphibians\" (including tortoises, lizards and snakes), fish, \"insects\" (Insecta, in which he included arachnids, crustaceans and centipedes) and \"worms\" (Vermes). Linnaeus's Vermes included effectively all other groups of animals, not only tapeworms, earthworms and leeches but molluscs, sea urchins and starfish, jellyfish, squid and cuttlefish.\n\nIn his 1817 work, \"Le Règne Animal\", the French zoologist Georges Cuvier combined evidence from comparative anatomy and palaeontology to divide the animal kingdom into four body plans. Taking the central nervous system as the main organ system which controlled all the others, such as the circulatory and digestive systems, Cuvier distinguished four body plans or \"embranchements\":\n\n\nGrouping animals with these body plans resulted in four branches: vertebrates, molluscs, articulata (including insects and annelids) and zoophytes or radiata.\n\nErnst Haeckel, in his 1866 \"Generelle Morphologie der Organismen\", asserted that all living things were monophyletic (had a single evolutionary origin), being divided into plants, protista, and animals. His protista were divided into moneres, protoplasts, flagellates, diatoms, myxomycetes, myxocystodes, rhizopods, and sponges. His animals were divided into groups with distinct body plans: he named these phyla. Haeckel's animal phyla were coelenterates, echinoderms, and (following Cuvier) articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates.\n\nStephen J. Gould explored the idea that the different phyla could be perceived in terms of a Bauplan, illustrating their fixity. However, he later abandoned this idea in favor of punctuated equilibrium.\n\n20 out of the 36 body plans originated in the Cambrian period, in the \"Cambrian explosion\", However, complete body plans of many phyla emerged much later, in the Palaeozoic or beyond.\n\nThe current range of body plans is far from exhaustive of the possible patterns for life: the Precambrian Ediacaran biota includes body plans that differ from any found in currently living organisms, even though the overall arrangement of unrelated modern taxa is quite similar. Thus the Cambrian explosion appears to have more or less completely replaced the earlier range of body plans.\n\nGenes, embryos and development together determine the form of an adult organism's body, through the complex switching processes involved in morphogenesis.\n\nDevelopmental biologists seek to understand how genes control the development of structural features through a cascade of processes in which key genes produce morphogens, chemicals that diffuse through the body to produce a gradient that acts as a position indicator for cells, turning on other genes, some of which in turn produce other morphogens. A key discovery was the existence of groups of homeobox genes, which function as switches responsible for laying down the basic body plan in animals. The homeobox genes are remarkably conserved between species as diverse as the fruit fly and humans, the basic segmented pattern of the worm or fruit fly being the origin of the segmented spine in humans. The field of animal evolutionary developmental biology ('Evo Devo'), which studies the genetics of morphology in detail, is rapidly expanding with many of the developmental genetic cascades, particularly in the fruit fly \"Drosophila\", catalogued in considerable detail.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "569846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=569846", "title": "Co-sleeping", "text": "Co-sleeping\n\nCo-sleeping is a practice in which babies and young children sleep close to one or both parents, as opposed to in a separate room. Co-sleeping individuals sleep in sensory proximity to one another, where the individual senses the presence of others. This sensory proximity can either be triggered by touch, smell, taste, or noise. Therefore, the individuals can be a few centimeters away or on the other side of the room and still have an effect on the other. It is standard practice in many parts of the world, and is practiced by a significant minority in countries where cribs are also used.\n\nBed-sharing, a practice in which babies and young children sleep in the same bed with one or both parents, is a subset of co-sleeping. Co-bedding refers to infants (typically twins or higher-order multiples) sharing the same bed. There are conflicting views on bed-sharing safety and health compared to using a separate infant bed.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics does encourage room-sharing (sleeping in the same room but on separate surfaces) in its policy statement regarding SIDS prevention, but it recommends against bed-sharing with infants.\n\nRecent legal rulings suggest that bed-sharing has been attributed as a factor of unintentional infant suffocation. For instance, parents under the influence of drugs or alcohol and whose children died while bed-sharing have been charged and, at times, prosecuted with manslaughter in several US states (including Minnesota, Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin and Utah.\n\nBed-sharing is standard practice in many parts of the world outside of North America, Europe and Australia, and even in the latter areas a significant minority of children have shared a bed with their parents at some point in childhood. One 2006 study of children age 3–10 in India reported 93% of children bed-sharing while a 2006 study of children in Kentucky in the United States reported 15% of infants and toddlers 2 weeks to 2 years engage in bed-sharing.\n\nBed-sharing was widely practiced in all areas up to the 19th century, until the advent of giving the child his or her own room and the crib. In many parts of the world, bed-sharing simply has the practical benefit of keeping the child warm at night. Bed-sharing has been relatively recently re-introduced into Western culture by practitioners of attachment parenting. Proponents hold that bed-sharing saves babies' lives (especially in conjunction with nursing),\n\nBecause children become accustomed to behaviors learned in early experiences, bed-sharing in infancy will also increase the likelihood of these children to crawl into their parent's bed in ages past infancy.\n\nHealth care professionals disagree about bed-sharing techniques, effectiveness and ethics. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly discourage bed-sharing because of the risk of suffocation or strangulation, but some pediatricians and breast-feeding advocates have opposed this position.\n\nOne study reported mothers getting more sleep and breast-feeding by co-sleeping than other arrangements. Parents also experience less exhaustion with such ease in feeding and comforting their child by simply reaching over to the child. As a result, co-sleeping also increases the responsiveness of parents to their child's needs.\n\nIt has been argued that co-sleeping evolved over five million years, that it alters the infant's sleep experience and the number of maternal inspections of the infant, and that it provides a beginning point for considering possibly unconventional ways of helping reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nStress hormones are lower in mothers and babies who co-sleep, specifically the balance of the stress hormone cortisol, the control of which is essential for a baby's healthy growth. In studies with animals, infants who stayed close to their mothers had higher levels of growth hormones and enzymes necessary for brain and heart growth. Also, the physiology of co-sleeping babies is more stable, including more stable temperatures, more regular heart rhythms, and fewer long pauses in breathing than babies who sleep alone.\n\nBesides physical developmental advantages, co-sleeping may also promote long-term emotional health. In long-term follow-up studies of infants who slept with their parents and those who slept alone, the children who co-slept were happier, less anxious, had higher self-esteem, were less likely to be afraid of sleep, had fewer behavioral problems, tended to be more comfortable with intimacy, and were generally more independent as adults.\n\nSome parents pose threats to infants due to their behaviors and conditions, such as smoking or drinking heavily, taking drugs, a history of skin infections, obesity, or any other specific risk-increasing traits. In addition, there are certain dangerous behaviors that increase SIDS and should be avoided whether placing a baby in a crib or co-sleeping: infants should always sleep on their backs on a firm surface (not waterbeds, pillows, recliners, or couches), mattresses should intersect the bedframe tightly, there should be no stuffed animals or soft toys near the baby, blankets should be light, a baby's head should never be covered, and other SIDS risk factors should be avoided.\n\nCo-sleeping deaths in Texas reached at least 182 in the 2013-2014 fiscal year, which ends on August 31, compared to 169 in the 2012-2013 period. Nearly all of the infants who died were under the age of one year. John Lennan, a spokesman for Webb County child protective services in Laredo, said that each family's situation is examined individually to offer recommendations for a safe environment for the children. The key to such sleeping arrangements is to make sure that the infant has room to breathe while sleeping, he added.\n\nCo-sleeping also increases the risks of suffocation and strangulation. The soft quality of the mattresses, comforters, and pillows may suffocate the infants. Some experts, then, recommend that the bed should be firm, and should not be a waterbed or couch; and that heavy quilts, comforters, and pillows should not be used. Another common advice given to prevent suffocation is to keep a baby on its back, not its stomach. Parents who roll over during their sleep could inadvertently crush and/or suffocate their child, especially if they are heavy sleepers, over-tired or over-exhausted and/or obese. There is also the risk of the baby falling to a hard floor, or getting wedged between the bed and the wall or headboard. A proposed solution to these problems is the bedside bassinet, in which, rather than bed-sharing, the baby's bed is placed next to the parent's bed.\n\nThe presence of the child in the parent's bedroom also raises the concern of a lack of privacy between the parents and the child. The lack of privacy may result in increased tension and reduced intimacy between a couple.\n\nAnother precaution recommended by experts is that young children should never sleep next to babies under nine months of age.\n\nA 2008 report explored the relationship between ad hoc parental behaviors similar to traditional co-sleeping methodology, though the study's subjects typically utilized cribs and other paraphernalia counter to co-sleeping models. While babies who had been exposed to behaviors reminiscent of co-sleeping had significant problems with sleep later in life, the study concluded that the parental behaviors were a reaction to already-present sleep difficulties. Most relationships between parental behavior and sleeping trouble were not statistically significant when controlled for those preexisting conditions. Further, typical co-sleeping parental behavior, like maternal presence at onset of sleep, were found to be protective factors against sleep problems.\n\nCo-sleeping can often be regarded as an unnecessary practice that can be associated with issues such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, research shows that opinions vary in the association between SIDS and co-sleeping. The most controversial issue regarding SIDS is whether bed sharing is a main cause, and whether it should be avoided or encouraged.\n\nResearch indicates that co-sleeping, particularly bed sharing should be avoided as it increases the risk of SIDS. Controversially, research shows that if co-sleeping practices are done in an appropriate and safe manner it can be very beneficial and reduce risk of SIDS occurring. The Pacific Islands Families study, conducted in New Zealand, showed that the adoption of safe bed-sharing and room-sharing practices were saving infant lives and that there was no infant that died from SIDS.\n\nThere are several products that can be used to facilitate safe co-sleeping with an infant:\n\nA study of a small population in Northeast England showed a variety of nighttime parenting strategies and that 65% of the sample had bed-shared, 95% of them having done so with both parents. The study reported that some of the parents found bedsharing effective, yet were covert in their practices, fearing disapproval of health professionals and relatives. A National Center for Health Statistics survey from 1991 to 1999 found that 25% of American families always, or almost always, slept with their baby in bed, 42% slept with their baby sometimes, and 32% never bed-shared with their baby.\n\nInitial assumptions on co-sleeping may place it in a context of income and socioeconomic status. Generally, families of low socioeconomic status will be unable to afford a separate room for a child while those of high socioeconomic status can more easily afford a home with a sufficient number of rooms. However, statistical data shows the prevalence of co-sleeping in wealthy Japanese families and the ability of poor Western families to still find a separate space for their child, suggests that the acceptance of co-sleeping is a result of culture.\n\nSeveral studies show that the prevalence of co-sleeping is a result of cultural preference. In a study of 19 nations, a trend emerged, depicting a widely accepted practice of co-sleeping in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, while European and North American countries rarely practiced it. This trend resulted mostly from the respective fears of parents: Asian, African, and Latin American parents worried about the separation between the parents and the child, while European and North American parents feared a lack of privacy for both the parents and the child.\n\n\n"}

The book was co-authored by Richard H. Shultz, professor of international politics at Tufts University, and Roy Godson, professor emeritus of government at Georgetown University.\n\nShultz and Godson discuss Soviet disinformation tactics including injection of Communist propaganda through covert groups within the U.S.S.R. tasked with disrupting activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U.S. The book explains disinformation methods including forgery as covert operation, agents of influence, and using social influence to turn targets into useful idiots. They focus on disinformation activities of Soviet intelligence from 1960 to 1980. Shultz and Godson discuss case studies as examples of Soviet disinformation, including a French journalist covertly financed by Russian agents in order to publish biased material against Western interests, and the front organization activities of the World Peace Council. They back up their analyses with two Soviet intelligence defectors.\n\n\"Foreign Affairs\" called the book a \"useful survey\" of how Soviet intelligence used disinformation \"to further its strategic aims such as discrediting America and weakening NATO\". \"The Journal of Conflict Studies\" described it as \"a useful introduction to a field of knowledge\" of importance to security experts, the United States Intelligence Community, and diplomats. \"Society\" called \"Dezinformatsia\", \"a highly readable and insightful book\". \"Political Science Quarterly\" gave the work a negative review, criticizing the book's writing style and methodological rigor.\n\nRichard H. Shultz received his PhD in political science from Miami University in 1976, and during the period 1977–1978 did post-doctoral work at the University of Michigan. Shultz became part of The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University as international politics professor in 1983, and rose to become director of the International Security Studies Program (ISSP). Shultz was the only non-government member of the Special Operations Policy Advisory Group for the United States Department of Defense. After the publication of \"Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy\", Shultz authored another book on Soviet war tactics: \"The Soviet Union and Revolutionary Warfare\".\n\nRoy Godson graduated with a PhD from Colombia University, with a focus on international politics and national security. Godson is a Georgetown University emeritus professor of government. Godson testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 2017, to give background on the Senate investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. He has served as president of the National Strategy Information Center, Washington, D.C. Godson went on to author and edit multiple other books on covert operations and intelligence, including: \"Dirty Tricks or Trump Cards\", and \"Comparing Foreign Intelligence\".\n\n\"Dezinformatsia\" describes disinformation tactics used by the intelligence services of the Soviet Union including the KGB, against foreign enemies including the United States. The authors define disinformation as: \"false, incomplete, or misleading information that is passed, fed, or confirmed to a targeted individual, group, or country.\"\n\nThe book explains the covert groups within the Soviet Union tasked with disrupting government activities of the countries belonging to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the U.S., through injection of Communist propaganda. The authors place the Soviet policy of active measures within a broader strategy of Russian military deception in favor of domestic national security. They focus their discussion on disinformation conducted by the Soviet intelligence between the period of 1960–1980.\n\nShultz and Godson note that manipulated groups involve both official departments of the Soviet state, as well as non-governmental organizations which lack independence from the state control itself. Specific goals exported by covert Soviet government channels and groups in the Western world were financed by Soviet intelligence operations. These covert operations were coordinated so as to have maximum impact related to major international incidents.\nAs a case study of disinformation, the authors describe journalist , whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence. Its contents were biased against the Western world in favor of the Soviet agenda, and had considerable impact on public opinion. In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council, which operated as a front organization for Soviet intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U.S. Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had defected from their posts in Soviet intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.\n\nThe authors detail commonly used disinformation tactics by the Soviet intelligence agencies, including forgery as covert operation in order to fool target dupes into believing such fabricated documents were real. Additionally, the writers explain how Soviet covert spies were able to bring agents of influence into their fold and do their bidding, whether knowingly or through social influence as a useful idiot.\n\nShultz and Godson note that after the Soviet term \"dezinformatsia\" became widely known in the 1980s in the English language as \"disinformation\", native speakers of English broadened the term as \"any government communication (either overt or covert) containing intentionally false and misleading material, often combined selectively with true information, which seeks to mislead and manipulate either elites or a mass audience.\"\n\n\"Dezinformatsia\" was released in a paperback edition in 1984. It was issued again in paperback in 1986 under the same title, and also with the different title — \"Dezinformatsia: The Strategy of Soviet Disinformation\".\n\nJohn C. Campbell reviewed the book for the journal \"Foreign Affairs\", and wrote: \"The Shultz/Godson book is a useful survey of how the Soviet Union uses 'disinformation,' propaganda, agents, covert political techniques and front organizations to influence events in foreign countries and to further its strategic aims such as discrediting America and weakening NATO.\" Campbell criticized the dry nature of some of the facts revealed in the book, \"Parts of the presentation are novel, but the revelations are not particularly sensational.\" Campbell concluded stories in the book should not be taken at face value, \"The author's KGB experience and background doubtless give him a special vantage point, but most of this story can be taken with several grains of salt.\"\n\nWriting in \"Conflict Quarterly\" for \"The Journal of Conflict Studies\", David Charters questioned why the book did not present more of an analysis on the aggregate impact of all of the disinformation campaigns, before noting such a task would be difficult to assess. The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including, \"Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target, and on U.S. relations with the country concerned, or were they merely of nuisance value?\" \"Conflict Quarterly\" criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency, writing, \"Without answers to questions such as these, it is difficult to accept, at face value, the authors' conclusions.\" Charters concluded the book was \"a useful introduction to a field of knowledge which ... is likely to continue to expand in importance for diplomats, the intelligence community, and scholars of international security affairs.\n\nStephen Sloan reviewed the book for the journal \"Society\", writing: \"Richard H. Shultz and Roy Godson are to be credited for writing a highly readable and insightful book that can enable policy-makers, academics, and concerned members of the public to understand a form of political warfare that until recently was only rarely recognized in the West.\" He called the work \"ground breaking research\". Sloan concluded, \"Shultz and Godson have provided an awareness of a threat that should be acted upon.\"\n\n\"Political Science Quarterly\" gave a more critical assessment of the book, with reviewer Ellen Mickiewicz commenting, \"In the second chapter, the discussion of the organization of Soviet foreign propaganda activities is so fuzzy as to be confusing.\" She criticized the rigor of the book's research methodology. Mickiewicz concluded, \"This book is not the successor to Frederic Barghoorn's \"Soviet Foreign Propaganda\" (1964); the topic is timely and interesting, but it requires a more considered and informed analysis.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Price\n\nHenry Habberley Price, FBA (17 May 1899 – 26 November 1984), usually cited as H. H. Price, was a Welsh philosopher, known for his work on the philosophy of perception. He also wrote on parapsychology.\n\nBorn in Neath, Glamorganshire, Wales, Price was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. He obtained first-class honours in Literae Humaniores in 1921. He was a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, 1922–4, Assistant Lecturer in philosophy at the university of Liverpool (1922–23), Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College Oxford (1924–35), Lecturer in philosophy at Oxford (1932–35) and Wykeham Professor of Logic and Fellow of New College (1935–59). Price was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1943 to 1944. He was elected to the British Academy in 1943.\n\nPrice is perhaps best known for his work on the philosophy of perception. He argues for a sophisticated sense-datum account, although he rejects phenomenalism. In his book \"Thinking and Experience\", he moves from perception to thought and argues for a dispositionalist account of conceptual cognition. Concepts are held to be a kind of intellectual capacity, manifested in perceptual contexts as recognitional capacities. For Price, concepts are not some kind of mental entity or representation. The ultimate appeal is to a species of memory distinct from event recollection.\n\nHe died in Oxford.\n\nPrice had written various publications on parapsychology, often advocating new concepts and theories. He was President of the Society for Psychical Research (1939–40, 1960–1)\n\nPrice had speculated on the nature of the afterlife and developed his own hypothesis about what the afterlife may be like. According to Price after death the self will find itself in a dream world of memories and mental images from their life. Price wrote that the hypothetical \"next world would be realms of real mental images.\" Price however believed that the self may be able to draw upon its memories of previous physical existence to create an environment of totally new images. According to Price, the dream world will not follow the laws of physics just as ordinary dreams do not. In addition, he wrote that each person will experience a world of their own, though he also wrote that the dream world doesn't necessarily have to be solipsistic as different selves may be able to communicate with each other by dream telepathy.\n\nPrice had invented the concept of \"place memories\" (see Stone Tape). He proposed that hauntings could be explained by memories becoming lost from an individual's mind and then somehow attaching itself to the environment which could be picked up by others as hallucinations. He also believed that \"place memories\" could explain psychometry.\n\nLinking his afterlife hypothesis with the concept of place memories Price proposed another hypothesis called the \"psychic ether\" hypothesis. He wrote that this hypothesis would explain where the memories would be stored for hauntings as well as for clairvoyance, ghosts and other paranormal phenomena. Price proposed that a universal psychic ether coexisting dimension exists as an intermediary between the mental and ordinary matter. According to Price the psychic ether consists of images and ideas. Price wrote that apparitions are actually memories from people and that under the right conditions they can be seen as hallucinations. Price believed that the dreamlike world of the afterlife exists in the psychic ether. According to (Ellwood, 2001) the psychic ether of Price is \"a posited level of reality consisting of persisting, dynamic images created by the mind and capable of being perceived by certain persons.\"\n\nSome researchers have attempted to update the afterlife hypothesis of Price. Michael Grosso (1979) in an extension of Price's theory suggested that the \"ego may become fragmented in the afterlife state and when ones wish's and desires are played out may experience a transpersonal state akin to those experienced by the mystics\". The psychical researcher Ralph Noyes (1998) published an article discussing the theories of Price and attempted to update them with recent finds in parapsychology. Noyes proposed that the mental world of Price is a \"psychosphere\" which he defined as a \"vast and complex cauldron of ideas, memories, volitions, desires and all the other furniture of conscious experience and unconscious mental functioning\".\n\nThe most common criticism of HH Price's afterlife hypothesis has come from the religious community as his suggestions are not consistent with traditional Christian teaching, nor the teachings of any other monotheistic religion.\n\n\"When I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt. I can doubt whether it is a tomato that I am seeing, and not a cleverly painted piece of wax. I can doubt whether there is any material thing there at all. Perhaps what I took for a tomato was really a reflection; perhaps I am even the victim of some hallucination. One thing however I cannot doubt: that there exists a red patch of a round and somewhat bulgy shape, standing out from a background of other colour-patches, and having a certain visual depth, and that this whole field of colour is directly present to my consciousness.\" \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "495152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=495152", "title": "Hard determinism", "text": "Hard determinism\n\nHard determinism (or metaphysical determinism) is a view on free will which holds that determinism is true, and that it is incompatible with free will, and, therefore, that free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to nomological determinism, it can also be a position taken with respect to other forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety. Hard determinism is contrasted with soft determinism, which is a compatibilist form of determinism, holding that free will may exist despite determinism. It is also contrasted with metaphysical libertarianism, the other major form of incompatibilism which holds that free will exists and determinism is false.\n\nIn ancient Greece, Socrates initiated the rationalistic teaching that any agent is obliged to pursue the chief good conceived by his or her mind. The peripatetic naturalist Strato of Lampsacus speculated that an unconscious divine power acts in the world and causes the origin, growth and breakdown of things. Diodorus Cronus asserted the identity of the possible and the necessary and inferred that future events are as determined as the past ones. Chrysippus refuted the \"idle argument\" invented to discredit determinism as if human efforts were futile in a preordained world; he explained that fated events occur with the engagement of conscious agents. In the 17th century, both Locke and Spinoza argued for strict causality of volitional acts. In the age of enlightenment, Baron d’Holbach promulgated the naturalistic interpretation of mental events. Schopenhauer observed that everyone regards himself free \"a priori\"; however, \"a posteriori\" he must discover that he had been obliged to make the decisions he actually made. Nietzsche noticed that free decisions are graded as \"causa sui\", emerging from non-existence. Recently Daniel Wegner stressed the limitations of free will on grounds of experimental evidence for unconscious choice and action. To prove determinism, the following putative experiment was proposed: all principal differences between the features of an artificial zygote and that developing naturally can be avoided.\n\nMeeting a challenge, agents make decisions in conformity to the inherited character, life history and current stimuli. The field of acute attention is limited, and motives partly remain unconscious. From the first person's perspective we have an intuitive commitment that many options are available. However, if the total of the mental content is considered from the third person's perspective, only a single decision deemed by the agent as the most favorable at the moment turns out real. The validity of causation for any mental event becomes apparent taking into account their neurophysiological correlates. Different causal descriptions correspond to the mental and physical domain. Laws of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics govern the latter. Admitting downright mental causation of physiological impulses would mean surplus determination. The surmise that under identical conditions, alternative decisions and actions are possible is disproved by naturalists as an illusion.\nHard determinism is not taken to refer merely to a determinism on earth, but in all of reality (e.g. involving the effects of light from other galaxies, etc.); not just during a certain deterministic period of time, but for all time. This also means that the relation of necessity will be bi-directional. Just as the initial conditions of the universe presumably determine all future states, so too does the present necessitate the past. In other words, one could not change any one fact without affecting the entire timeline. Because hard determinists often support this eternalist view of time, they do not believe that there are genuine chances or possibilities, only the idea that events are 100% likely.\n\nUnlike \"law fundamentalists\", some philosophers are \"law pluralists\": they question what it means to have a law of physics. One example is the \"Best Standards Analysis\", which says that the laws are only useful ways to summarize all past events, rather than there being metaphysically \"pushy\" entities (this route still brings one into conflict with the idea of free will). Some law pluralists further believe there are simply no laws of physics. The mathematical universe hypothesis suggests that there are other universes in which the laws of physics and fundamental constants are different. Andreas Albrecht of Imperial College in London called it a \"provocative\" solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he \"wouldn't dare\" go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that \"it's actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is\".\n\nThe feasibility of testing determinism is always challenged by what we know, or think we can know, about the idea of a final, all encompassing, theory of everything. Some physicists challenge the likelihood of determinism on the grounds that certain interpretations of quantum mechanics stipulate that the universe is fundamentally indeterministic, such as the Copenhagen interpretation; whereas other interpretations are deterministic, for example, the De Broglie-Bohm Theory and the many-worlds interpretation.\nChaos theory describes how a deterministic system can exhibit perplexing behavior that is difficult to predict: as in the butterfly effect, minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences. Yet chaos theory is a wholly deterministic thesis; it merely demonstrates the potential for vastly different consequences from very similar initial conditions. Properly understood, then, it enlightens and reinforces the deterministic claim.\n\nHard determinists reject free will. Critics often suggest that, in so doing, the hard determinist also rejects ethics. The key to this argument rests on the idea that holding a person morally responsible requires for them to make a choice between two, or more, truly possible alternatives. If choice is indeed impossible, then it would be incorrect to hold anyone morally responsible for his or her actions. If this argument holds, hard determinists are restricted to moral nihilism.\nThis feature, however, is tenable only as far as hard determinists discard responsibility. In a necessitarian world, recourse to merit and blameworthiness is toned down but adherence to ethical and legal values is not ruined. Persons may be appreciated as carriers, executers and defenders of morality. Alternative choice being absent, regret for past misdeeds becomes unreasonable. Nevertheless, one can admonish oneself for one's lapses and resolve to avoid similar behavior in the future.\nThose hard determinists who defend ethical realism would object to the premise that contra-causal free will is necessary for ethics. Those who are also ethically naturalistic may also point out that there are good reasons to punish criminals: it is a chance to modify their behaviour, or their punishment can act as a deterrent for others who would otherwise act in the same manner. The hard determinist could even argue that this understanding of the true and various causes of a psychopath's behaviour, for instance, allow them to respond even more reasonably or compassionately.\n\nHard determinists acknowledge that humans do, in some sense, \"choose\", or deliberate – although in a way that obeys natural laws. For example, a hard determinist might see humans as a sort of thinking machines, but believe it is inaccurate to say they \"came to a decision\" or \"chose\".\nGeneralization of event causation should circumvent overstatement of external impulses. Autotelic personalities show a high rate of activities all by themselves. The capacity to resist psychological assault is an impressive evidence of autarkic resources. Determinists even admit that with corresponding knowledge, changes in the genetic depository and consequently behavior are possible.\n\nUp to now, the concepts and terminology of legal affairs follow the pre-reflexive belief in alternative possibilities. As scientific insight advances, the juridical attitude becomes increasingly \"external\": there should be fewer emotions about offender's will and more concern about the effects of offenses on society. The retributive function of punishment should be rejected as irrational and unjustified. \"Lex talionis\" is discarded already because of deficient correlation between crime and penalty. If the inveterate notion of \"mens rea\" is used at all, then only to distinguish intentional actions from inadvertent ones and not to designate an autonomous undertaking of the lawbreaker. At the same time, it is justified to require the perpetrator to critically reconsider his intentions and character, to demand apology and compensation in victims' favor. The rehabilitation service should be used to train the risky circle for keeping the norms of social life.\n\nSome behavioral anomalies have been observed in persons cultivating the habit of causal awareness. Increased aggressiveness, excessive compliance and reduced helpfulness are reported. Critical assessment of one's own former conduct appeared abated.\n\nWilliam James was an American pragmatist philosopher who coined the terms \"soft determinist\" and \"hard determinist\" in an influential essay titled \"The Dilemma of Determinism\". He argued against determinism, holding that the important issue is not personal responsibility, but hope. He believed that thorough-going determinism leads either to a bleak pessimism or to a degenerate subjectivism in moral judgment. He proposed the way to escape the dilemma is to allow a role for chance. James was careful to explain that he would rather \"debate about objects than words\", however. He did not insist in saying that replacing determinism with a model including chance had to mean we had \"free will\".\n\nThe determinist would counter-argue that there is still reason for hope. Whether or not the universe is determined does not change the fact that the future is unknown, and might very well always be. From a naturalist point of view, a person's actions still play a role in the shape of that future. Thomas W. Clark, founder and director of the Center for Naturalism, explains that humans are not merely the playthings of patterned, natural forces in the universe - but rather we are ourselves examples of those forces.\nThe deterministic view aligns our representations with the faculties and possibilities we actually possess but it should avoid misleading introspection. Admitting agents’ dependence on a drastic background can enhance insight, moderate severity and spare unproductive suffering. In so far as the mind comprehends universal necessity, the power of emotions is diminished.\n\n"}

From 1904 to 1911 he attended the evening classes at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Dresden, where he became friends with Kurt Fiedler. Among their lectures were Oskar Seyffert and Carl Rade, who later was a renowned professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and remained a friend of Glöckner for many years. Glöckner was mainly interested in drawings, but also in projections and geometry. From 1914 to 1918 he served in infantry divisions in France, Russia, and Poland.\n\nAfter World War I Glöckner earned some money with the copying of paintings for the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister. At the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts he studied with Otto Gussmann from 1923 to 1924. Hans Grundig was among his fellow students. His experimental style, however, did not find everyone's appreciation and Glöckner left the academy again. As a freelancer he turned to constructivism ever deeper during the following years. In 1932 he became a member of the re-founded \"Dresdner Sezession\". The Nazis refused him any opportunities to exhibit and sell his paintings and graphics. So he turned to sgraffito to earn his living.\n\nGlöckner lost his home during Bombing of Dresden in World War II and moved to Loschwitz. Because of his formalist style, the officials of the GDR refused him the appreciation he deserved for a long time. His rehabilitation began with an exhibition of his graphical work in the \"Kupferstichkabinett\", Dresden in 1969. In 1979 he received a permanent visa for the Federal Republic of Germany. Finally, in 1984, he was awarded with the National Prize of the GDR and the DEFA dedicated a film to him. Centrally in the area of the Technische Universität Dresden he was allowed to erect a sculpture, which had been banned just a few years before. Another sculpture was erected one year later in the park of the Hotel Bellevue, Dresden's first address that time.\n\nIn his later years Glöckner regularly visited West Berlin, where his cohabitee lived and where he died in 1987. Glöckner's urn was entombed in Loschwitz.

Hezbollah was largely formed with the aid of the Ayatollah Khomeini's followers in the early 1980s in order to spread Islamic revolution and follows a distinct version of Islamic Shi'a ideology or Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists) developed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the \"Islamic Revolution\" in Iran.\n\nHezbollah declared its existence on 16 February 1985 in \"The Hizballah Program\". This document was read by spokesman Sheikh Ibrahim al-Amin at the al-Ouzai Mosque in west Beirut and simultaneously published in al-Safir as \"The Hizballah Program, an open letter to all the Oppressed in Lebanon and the World\", and a separate pamphlet that was first published in full in English in 1987.\n\nAccording to \"The Hizballah Program\" the principles of its ideology are:\n\n\nIt listed the Ayatollah Khomeini as the leader whose \"orders we obey\"; called on Christians to \"open your hearts to our call\" and \"embrace Islam\" and noted that \"Allah has ... made it intolerable for Muslims to participate in ... a regime which is not predicated upon ... the Sharia\"; explained that Israel is \"the vanguard of the United States in our Islamic world\".\n\nMore broadly, current leader Sheikh Nasserallah has described Hizb'Allah's ideology as having \"two main axis: firstly, a belief in the rule by the just jurisconsult and adherence to Khomeini's leadership; and secondly, the continued need to struggle against the Israeli enemy\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, Hezbollah underwent what a number of observers have called a process of \"Lebanonization\", which is reflected in acceptance of a multi-confessional Lebanon, rapprochement with a variety of non-Islamist forces, participation in electoral politics, and an emphasis on providing for the social welfare of its Shi'a Lebanese constituency. This tendency was expressed in religious as well as strategic terms:\n\nSince then, Hizbullah published a new manifesto on 1 December 2009, which shifts its direction to better stay coherent with the current situation in their community. This new manifesto contains language that downplays the Islamic rhetoric and focuses more on integration into their community. Furthermore, the new manifesto calls for the elimination of the sectarian system in place right now in Lebanon and calls for replacement of this system by a secular modern system. However, the new manifesto states that the US and Israel are still Hizb'Allah's prime enemies. Moreover, it eliminates the possibility of open discussion on its right to bear arms. It pursues this agenda with the assistance of various like-minded Allies in the region.\n\nHezbollah's original 1985 manifesto reads:\n\nHezbollah was largely formed with the aid of the Ayatollah Khomeini's followers in the early eighties in order to spread Islamic revolution and follows a distinct version of Islamic Shi'a ideology (\"Willayat Al-Faqih\") developed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Although Hezbollah believes in one-person-one-vote system and disagree with the multi-confessional quotas under the Ta'if Accord, it does not intend to force a one-person-one-vote system onto the country's Christians.\n\nHezbollah views its conflict with Israel and the Jewish people as religiously motivated. The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict to them is a repeat of the negative interactions between the Jews of medieval Arabia and Muhammad and the early \"umma\" described in the Koran and other classical Islamic texts. God, according to Hezbollah theology, cursed all Jews as blasphemers damned for all time and throughout history. Hezbollah (as well as the political/religious leaders of Iran) believe that the destruction of Israel will bring about the \"reappearance of the Imam (the Shiite Islamic Messiah)\". These issues exist independently of Israeli treatment of Palestinians or even the existence of the State of Israel, although Hezbollah has strong objections to these more earthly matters as well. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has said in an interview that \"Israel is an illegitimate entity and it is a threat to the region. It is a constant threat to the whole region. We cannot coexist with this threat. That is why the ultimate goal of the [Arab and Islamic] nation is to end Israel's existence irrespective of the problems, sensitivities and everything that has happened and could happen between Palestinians and non-Palestinians, Shia and Sunni, Muslims and Christians.\"\n\nFrom the inception of Hezbollah to the present the elimination of the state of Israel has been a primary goal for Hezbollah. Hezbollah not only opposes the government and policies of the State of Israel, but also each and every Jewish civilian who lives in Israel. Its 1985 manifesto reportedly states \"our struggle will end only when this entity [Israel] is obliterated. We recognize no treaty with it, no ceasefire, and no peace agreements.\" Secretary-General Nasrallah has stated, \"Israel is an illegal usurper entity, which is based on falsehood, massacres, and illusions,\" and considers that the elimination of Israel will bring peace in the Middle East: \"There is no solution to the conflict in this region except with the disappearance of Israel.\" In an interview with \"The Washington Post\", Nasrallah said, \"I am against any reconciliation with Israel. I do not even recognize the presence of a state that is called 'Israel.' I consider its presence both unjust and unlawful. That is why if Lebanon concludes a peace agreement with Israel and brings that accord to the Parliament our deputies will reject it; Hezbollah refuses any conciliation with Israel in principle... When a peace agreement is concluded between the Lebanese government and Israel, we would surely disagree with the Lebanese government about that, but we would not make any turmoil out of it.\" In 1993, during the Oslo peace process, Nasrallah and several other top Hezbollah generals came out staunchly opposed to any final peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians to the point that they accused Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat of blasphemy and treachery to the Muslim people. Their strong objections to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is held to this day. Jerusalem and the Dome of the Rock is used as a rallying point in Hezbollah literature, media, and music for the destruction of Israel and support for Palestine.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Nasrallah outlined the group's three \"minimal demand[s]: an [Israeli] withdrawal from South Lebanon and the Western Bqa' Valley, a withdrawal from the Golan, and the return of the Palestinian refugees\". An additional objective is the freeing of prisoners held in Israeli jails, some of whom have been imprisoned for eighteen years.\n\nIsrael's occupation of the Shebaa Farms, along with the presence of Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails, is often used as a pretext and stated as justification for the Hezbollah's continued hostilities against Israel even after Israel's verified withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. Hezbollah's spokesperson Hassan Ezzedin, however, said that\n\nOn 26 May 2000, after the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon Hassan Nassrallah said: \"I tell you: this \"Israel\" that owns nuclear weapons and the strongest air force in this region is more fragile than a spiderweb.\" Arie W. Kruglanski, Moshe Ya'alon, Bruce Hoffman, Efraim Inbar, and YNET interpret the \"spider web\" theory as the notion, articulated by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, that Israel's reverence for human life, the hedonistic nature of the Israeli society, and its self-indulgent Western values make it weak, soft, and vulnerable. Such a society, though technologically advanced, will crumble under continued war and bloodshed.\n\nIn 2002, according to the BBC, Hezbollah, \"said publicly that it is ready to open a second front against Israel in support of the intifada.\" In a 2003 interview, Nasrallah has answered questions concerning the establishment of a Palestinian state established alongside an Israeli state stating \"that he would not sabotage what is finally a 'Palestinian matter.' But until such a settlement is reached, he will, he said, continue to encourage Palestinian suicide bombers.\" In the same interview, Nasrallah stated that \"at the end of the road no one can go to war on behalf of the Palestinians, even if that one is not in agreement with what the Palestinians agreed on,\" adding, \"Of course, it would bother us that Jerusalem goes to Israel ... [but] let it happen. I would not say O.K. I would say nothing.\" Similarly, in 2004, when asked whether he was prepared to live with a two-state settlement between Israel and Palestine, Nasrallah said he would not sabotage what is a Palestinian matter. He also said that outside of Lebanon, Hezbollah will act only in a defensive manner towards Israeli forces, and that Hezbollah's missiles were acquired to deter attacks on Lebanon.\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Nasrallah answered questions concerning the renewed peace talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis, stating that he would not interfere in what he regarded as \"... primarily a Palestinian matter.\" However, in his speeches to his followers, he provides rationalizations for suicide bombings. Similarly, in 2004, when asked whether he was prepared to live with a two-state settlement between Israel and Palestine, Nasrallah said again that he would not sabotage what is finally a \"... Palestinian matter.\" He also said that outside of Lebanon, Hezbollah would act only in a defensive manner towards Israeli forces, and that Hezbollah's missiles were acquired to deter attacks on Lebanon.\n\nIn 2004 the Hezbollah-owned television station Al-Manar was banned in France on the grounds that it was inciting racial hatred. The court cited a 23 November 2004 broadcast in which a speaker accused Israel of deliberately disseminating AIDS in Arab nations.\n\nHezbollah's desire for Israeli prisoners to be that could be exchanged with Israel led to Hezbollah's abduction of Israeli soldiers, which triggered the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict.\n\nIn March 2009, in a speech marking the birthday of Muhammad, Nasrallah said, \"As long as Hezbollah exists, it will never recognize Israel.\" rejecting a US precondition for dialogue. A prominent Hezbollah poster at a May 2009 rally had an image of a mushroom cloud along with the message, \"O Zionists, if you want this type of war then so be it!\"\n\nDuring the years prior to its official founding, Hezbollah was held responsible or partially responsible for several attacks on Western (mostly American) targets and it has been blamed for killing many Americans. Hezbollah has denied involvement in the attacks, but its manifesto does claim that \"the whole world knows that whoever wishes to oppose the US, that arrogant superpower, cannot indulge in marginal acts which may make deviate from its major objective. We combat abomination and we shall tear out its very roots, its primary roots, which are the US.\" Hezbollah supporters chant \"Death to America\" in demonstrations every year. This attitude mirrors the attitude of the Iranian government.\n\nHezbollah leader Fadlallah has told an interviewer,\n\nWe believe there is no difference between the United States and Israel; the latter is a mere extension of the former. The United States is ready to fight the whole world to defend Israel's existence and security. The two countries are working in complete harmony, and the United States is certainly not inclined to exert pressure on Israel.\n\nOn its Al-Manar Television network, which is viewed by \"an estimated 10–15 million people a day across the world\", the United States is portrayed by an animated image of \"the Statue of Liberty as a ghoul, her gown dripping blood, a knife instead of a torch in her raised hand. In Arabic the video ... concludes with the words: 'America owes blood to all of humanity.'\"\n\nHezbollah has declared that it distinguishes between Zionism and Judaism and that it opposes Zionism.\n\n\n\nHowever, the group has been accused of using antisemitism.\n\n\ncontempt normally reserved for weak and cowardly enemies. Like the Hamas propaganda for holy war, that of Hezbollah has relied on the endless vilification of Jews as 'enemies of mankind,' 'conspiratorial, obstinate, and conceited' adversaries full of 'satanic plans' to enslave the Arabs. It fuses traditional Islamic anti-Judaism with Western conspiracy myths, Third Worldist anti-Zionism, and Iranian Shiite contempt for Jews as 'ritually impure' and corrupt infidels.\n\n\n\nAnti-Semitic statements have also been attributed to prominent figures in Hezbollah and to Hassan Nasrallah.\n\n\n\nThe Jews invented the legend of the Nazi atrocities... Anyone who reads the Koran and the holy writings of the monotheistic religions sees what they did to the prophets, and what acts of madness and slaughter the Jews carried out throughout history... Anyone who reads these texts cannot think of co-existence with them, of peace with them, or about accepting their presence, not only in Palestine of 1948 but even in a small village in Palestine, because they are a cancer which is liable to spread again at any moment.\n\n\nHezbollah's 1985 founding Manifesto reads:\n\nwhatever touches or strikes the Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines and elsewhere reverberates throughout the whole Muslim umma of which we are an integral part... No one can imagine the importance of our military potential as our military apparatus is not separate from our overall social fabric. Each of us is a fighting soldier. And when it becomes necessary to carry out the Holy War, each of us takes up his assignment in the fight in accordance with the injunctions of the Law, and that in the framework of the mission carried out under the tutelage of the Commanding Jurist.\"\n\nHezbollah regards any act of violence committed against any Israeli as \"legitimate resistance.\"\n\nIn keeping with Lebanon's generally secular and egalitarian culture, Hezbollah recognizes and promotes women's rights somewhat more strongly than do other groups associated with Islamic jihad, as per Hezbollah's self-proclaimed \"model and example.\"\n\nOne member of the Hezbollah Political Council, speaking to an \"Online Journal\" correspondent in July 2006, claimed that \"Hezbollah differs from many Islamic groups in our treatment of women. We believe women have the ability like men to participate in all parts of life.\" The \"Online Journal\" correspondent writes:\nFrom its founding in the 1980s, Hezbollah women have headed education, medical and social service organizations. Most recently Hezbollah nominated several women to run in the Lebanese elections. It named Wafa Hoteit as a chief of Al Noor Radio ... and promoted 37-year-old Rima Fakhry to its highest ruling body, the Hezbollah Political Council. Part of Fakhry's duties include interpreting Islamic feminism in Sharia law for the Committee for Political Analysis.\"\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has many times spoken against sectarianism and said that he will be the first \"to join a true Sunni government.\" Hezbollah has slammed ISIS for seeking to ignite sectarian strife in Lebanon. Sectarianism, power-hungry politicians and a sham democracy are among the main factors that have prevented the establishment of a strong Lebanese state, Hezbollah MP Hasan Fadlallah has said. While Hezbollah strongly opposes sectarianism, its involvement in support of Bashar al-Assad against a mostly Sunni Muslim opposition in the Syrian Civil War has contributed to sectarian tensions with Lebanese Sunnis. Hezbollah officials have stated their aim is to defend Lebanon and Syria from \"takfiris\", a term they use to denote Sunni Islamist forces, but which many Sunnis interpret as a slur against them as a whole, Islamist or non-Islamist.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7611373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7611373", "title": "Joseph Agassi", "text": "Joseph Agassi\n\nJoseph Agassi (; ; born in Jerusalem on May 7, 1927) is an Israeli academic with contributions in logic, scientific method, and philosophy. He studied under Karl Popper and taught at the London School of Economics. He later taught at the University of Hong Kong, the University of Illinois, Boston University, and York University in Canada. He had dual appointments in the last positions with Tel Aviv University.\n\nHe has been married to Judith Buber Agassi – Martin Buber's granddaughter – since 1949. Together they had two children, Aaron, and Tirzah, who died of cancer in March 2008. They currently live in Herzliya, Israel. Tirzah´s name, when she was a child, was often used by Popper in his dictum \"Write it for Tirzah!\" to explain his view that everyone has the duty to write in a clearly and easily understandable language.\n\nAgassi’s prime interest is in science, metaphysics, and politics. He takes it that philosophy is nothing if not rationalist. For over fifty years he studied the rationality of science, metaphysics, and democratic politics.\n\nAn advocate of Popper’s philosophy with variations, Agassi ignores many of the problems that concern some philosophers of science, chiefly that of theory choice. The problems of the philosophy of technology engage him, including the problem of choosing scientific theories and ideas worthy of application and implementation.\n\nAgassi suggests, in line with Popper’s political philosophy, that all schools of thought have thus far neglected the one major practical problem of ethics, namely moral brakes: when should one apply them? We know this much: the more decent people are, the sooner they are ready to put their brakes on. For example, Agassi observes that the German nation lost its moral brakes as soon as its Nazi rulers showed their hand.\n\nAccording to Agassi, democracy is so outstanding that, no matter what the agenda is, it is still best. He developed further the methodology of critical rationalism which he adopted from Popper. According to him, critical rationalism gives the possibility to rationalists to account for checks and balances and democracy within their rationalism. \"Bootstrapping\" is the expression he coined for the approach to problems with the methodology of critical rationalism: Solutions are offered and then improved upon according to the results obtained as a never ending process. He acknowledges that even democracy is not immune to errors, and that it may even lead to its own destruction as it happened in 1933 in Germany. Nevertheless, says Agassi, democracy has a fair chance for success; in particular, in global politics due to its quick recovery procedure for confronting mistakes that find their way into the agenda of democratic institutions.\n\nAgassi has expressed criticism against the settler movement and has advocated for Israel to \"separate\" from the world-wide Jewish community:\n\nAgassi has written widely on global politics and on the methodology to implement global politics. His methodology is consistently procedural, without having requests for systematic procedures. His demands from those that design global politics are minimalist: small methodological changes may lead to large scale achievements. \nAgassi also proposes to bring global problems to public agendas for discussions in different forums, in particular in workshops where discussions are held with an agreed upon agenda: the agenda, says Agassi should be discussed and set by the participants prior to the discussion.\n\n\n1.

{"id": "4024033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4024033", "title": "Julian Savulescu", "text": "Julian Savulescu\n\nJulian Savulescu (born 22 December 1963) is an Australian philosopher and bioethicist. He is Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, Fellow of St Cross College, Oxford, Director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, Sir Louis Matheson Distinguished Visiting Professor at Monash University, and Head of the Melbourne–Oxford Stem Cell Collaboration, which is devoted to examining the ethical implications of cloning and embryonic stem cell research. He is a former editor and current boarder member of the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\" (2001-2004 and 2011-2018), which is ranked as the No.1 journal in bioethics worldwide by Google Scholar Metrics as of 2013. In addition to his background in applied ethics and philosophy, he also has a background in medicine and completed his MBBS (Hons) at Monash University.\n\nHe completed his PhD at Monash University, under the supervision of bioethicist Peter Singer.\n\nJulian Savulescu coined the phrase \"procreative beneficence\". It is the controversial putative moral obligation of parents in a position to select their children, for instance through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), to favor those expected to have the best life. An argument in favor of this principle is that traits (such as empathy, memory, etc.) are \"all-purpose means\" in the sense of being instrumental in realizing whatever life plans the child may come to have.\n\nIn some of his publications he has argued for the following: (1) that parents have a responsibility to select the best children they could have, given all of the relevant genetic information available to them, a principle that he extends to the use of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnoses (PGD) in order to determine the intelligence of embryos and possible children; and (2) that stem cell research is justifiable even if one accepts the view of the embryo as a person.\n\nJulian Savulescu also justifies the destruction of embryos and fetuses as a source of organs and tissue for transplantation to adults. In his abstract he argues, \n\"The most publicly justifiable application of human cloning, if there is one at all, is to provide self-compatible cells or tissues for medical use, especially transplantation. Some have argued that this raises no new ethical issues above those raised by any form of embryo experimentation. I argue that this research is less morally problematic than other embryo research. Indeed, it is not merely morally permissible but morally required that we employ cloning to produce embryos or fetuses for the sake of providing cells, tissues or even organs for therapy, followed by abortion of the embryo or fetus.\" He argues that if it is permissible to destroy fetuses, for social reasons, or no reasons at all, it must be justifiable to destroy them to save lives.\n\nFurther, as editor of the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\", he published, in 2012, an article by two Italian academics which stated that a new-born baby is effectively no different from a foetus, is not a \"person\" and, morally, could be killed at the decision of the parents etc.\n\nAlong with neuro-ethicist Guy Kahane, Savulescu's article \"Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness\" appears to be the first mainstream publication to argue that increased evidence of consciousness in patients diagnosed with being in persistent vegetative state actually \"supports\" withdrawing or withholding care.\n\nIn 2009, Professor Savulescu presented a paper at the ’Festival of Dangerous Ideas,’ held at the Sydney Opera House in October 2009, entitled \"Unfit for Life: Genetically Enhance Humanity or Face Extinction,\" which can be seen on Vimeo. Savulescu argues that humanity is on the brink of disappearing in a metaphorical ‘Bermuda Triangle’ unless humans are willing to undergo 'moral enhancement'.\n\nRobert Sparrow wrote, in the Journal of Medical Ethics, that Savulescu's justification for the principle of procreative beneficence can and should be extended further. If parents have a moral obligation to create children likely to have the best possible life, they should prefer to have children that have been genetically engineered for an optimal chance at such a life, even if those children bear little or no genetic relation to them.\n\nRebecca Bennett, however, criticizes Savulescu's argument. Bennett argues that \"the chances of any particular individual being born is spectacularly unlikely, given the infinite number of variables that had to be in place for this to happen. In order for any particular individual to exist, that individual's parents have to have been created in the first place, they have to meet at the right time and conceive us at a particular time to enable that particular sperm to fuse with that particular egg. Thus, it is clear that all sorts of things, any change in society, will effect who is born.\". According to Bennett, this means that no-one is actually harmed if one does not select the best offspring, as the individuals born could not have had any other, worse life as they would otherwise never have been born - \"choosing worthwhile but impaired lives harms no-one and is thus not less preferable\", as Bennett puts it. Bennett argues that while advocates of procreative beneficence could appeal to impersonal harm, which is where one should aim to ensure the maximum possible potential quality of life and thus embryos without or with the least impairments should be selected (as the impersonal total quality of life will be improved), this argument is flawed on two counts. Firstly on an intuitive level, Bennett questions if benefit or harm that doesn't affect anyone (i.e it is impersonal) should be worthy of consideration as no actual people will gain or lose anything. Secondly and on a theoretical level, Bennett argues that attempting to increase the sum total impersonal happiness (or decrease impersonal harm) can lead to repugnant conclusions, such as being obliged to produce as many offspring as possible to bring more people into the world to raise the level of impersonal happiness, even if the quality of life of individuals suffers for it due to scarcity and overcrowding. Bennett argues that this conclusion is repugnant because \"it cares little about what we normally regard as morally important: the welfare of individual people\".\n\nIn 2009 Professor Savulescu was awarded a Distinguished Alumni Award by Monash University.\n\nIn 2009 he was also announced as the winner in the Thinking category of \"The Australian\" newspaper's Emerging Leaders Awards.\n\nHe has co-authored two books: \"Medical Ethics and Law: The Core Curriculum\" with Tony Hope and Judith Hendrick and \"Unfit for the Future: The Need for Moral Enhancement\" (published by Oxford University Press) with Ingmar Persson.\n\nProfessor Savulescu is a member of the Board of Directors Executive Committee of the International Neuroethics Society.\n\nHe has also edited the books \"Der neue Mensch?

Adepts say they are able to project first to the emotional/astral plane (or directly from it after death) and then onward to the mental plane by completely calming their emotional processes and withdrawing their emotional senses. Like astral projection, mental projection is performed during sleep, between lives, during meditation-contemplation, or through 'psychic' (soulful) separation of the mental body from the emotional/astral body via the silver cord. Planes beyond the mental are accessible through use of the 'gold cord'. According to many esoteric philosophers, when projecting in these higher planes one has no humanoid shape and is just a lotus- or egg-shaped 'auric body' of consciousness.\n\nCertain philosophers consider the mental plane optimal for projection as it is divine enough to avoid black magic and 'lower psychism' yet also grounded enough to preserve a rational quality of experience (rational but not emotionally detached; mental encloses emotional). Others think it is better to proceed beyond humanoid form to the causal and mental auras, as these reflections of yet higher formless consciousness also transcend deeper flaws of humanity (like 'egotistic self-identification') that cause the lower psychism. These philosophers recommend striving to project into divine consciousness, not necessarily leaving one's lower consciousness, but becoming aware of spirit and divine will.\n"}

In the 1930s, he strongly influenced Marxist views on aesthetics while being a close associate of György Lukács. He also published important compilations of early Marxist literature on the role of art. In 1975, he was elected as a full member of the USSR Academy of Arts.\n\nBorn on July 23, 1905 in Melitopol, a Crimean city then part of Imperial Russia, Lifshitz began higher education as an art student at the Vkhutemas (\"Higher Art and Technical Studios\") in Moscow in the early 1920s, which was then the hotbed of Modernism.\n\nHe ended his studies there in 1925 because he disagreed with his modernist oriented instructors. Instead, he was offered a teaching position there; his job was to teach Marxist philosophy to artists.\n\nHe pursued an analysis of aesthetics from a fundamentally Marxist perspective. His ideas became controversial at Vkhutemas, so he had to leave in 1930. He was offered a job instead at the Moscow's Marx-Engels Institute, where he developed a working relationship with the great Marxist philosopher György Lukács. Lukacs, himself, admitted that he was influenced by Lifshitz' views on Marxist aesthetics.\n\nStarting in 1933, he edited an influential Moscow magazine \"The Literary Critic\" (\"Literaturny Kritik\"), that was also followed by Marxist art theoreticians around the world through various translations published by Soviet government.\n\nAmong the important contributors was writer Andrei Platonov, one of the most intriguing writers of fiction of the Soviet period, who is often referred to as the Soviet Kafka, as well as György Lukács.\n\nBy 1937, Lifshitz' productivity had decreased significantly; he produced almost no published work in the repressive climate of the most intense years of Stalinism. Yet his magazine \"The Literary Critic\" continued publication until late 1940, when it was finally closed.\n\nFollowing the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union Lifshitz entered the Second World War as a Red Army volunteer.\n\nEarly on, he saw some serious combat. His unit was surrounded by the German army, and he had to escape back through the front lines. Later on, he worked as a journalist in military publications. He received awards for his service.\n\nHis post-war career as a critic was marked by considerable controversy. In the last years of Stalin, as a Jew, he was attacked as part of the \"campaign against Cosmopolitanism\".\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, Lifshitz was in trouble again. A pamphlet he published in 1954, criticizing the writer Marietta Shaginyan, now displeased the old Stalinists, and provoked the ire of the established figures of Soviet intellectual life. He was severely criticized in the press and denied employment.\n\nAccording to some sources, at that stage, he was expelled from the Communist Party. Yet he perhaps was merely severely sanctioned as a member, coming very close to expulsion.\n\nHis life improved after the official de-Stalinization started in 1956, and the sanctions against him were gradually lifted. Many of his works were published again.\n\nThe same time-frame was also a period of Lifshitz's collaboration with the Soviet philosopher Evald Ilyenkov.\n\nIlyenkov's philosophy\n\n...resembled that of Lifschitz in one important (and now almost forgotten) realm: the relationship between philosophy, culture (art, literature, music and so on) and the 'communist ideal' of a new human being, formed as a result of the political-economic changes to come...\nLifshitz's main object of criticism in the 1960s was the modernist movement in the arts. From a political vantage point, Lifshitz, despite his criticism of the Soviet system, remained a strong proponent of Marxist-Leninist socialism.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Lifshitz gave considerable support to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, then a beginning writer.\n\nWhen in 1961 Alexander Solzhenitsyn approached Alexander Tvardovsky about the publication of his now-famous \"One Day in Life of Ivan Denisovich\" ... Tvardovsky forwarded Solzhenitsyn's manuscript to one of his oldest and most trusted friends, Mikhail Lifschitz. Lifschitz's report was unequivocal: 'It would be a crime not to publish this work'.\nYet later Solzhenitsyn was not kind in his remarks about him.\n\nEarly on, Lifshitz was attacked in the mainstream Soviet press because of his criticisms of Modernist art; towards the end of his career he was honoured by the mainstream, and yet strongly disliked by the Soviet non-conformist artists.\n\nLifshitz died in Moscow on September 28, 1983, eight years after his election as a full member of the USSR Academy of Arts, the most prestigious academic artistic organization within the Soviet Union.\n\nThe vast majority of his work remains untranslated. One book on aesthetics, \"The Philosophy of Art of Karl Marx\", was published in the English translation in 1938, and republished in 1980.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Lifshitz acquired new popularity among the Nationalist circles in Russia, who appreciate his critique of \"Western Modernist art\", and his defence of traditional art. His works are being republished again.\n\nLifschitz's collection of Marx and Engels's views on aesthetics – \"Marx and Engels on Art\" was published in 1933 (also an extended edition of 1938) as the first anthology of its kind. It was also published in German in 1948.\n\nIn 1938, he published a similar anthology of Lenin's view on aesthetics called \"Lenin on Culture and Art\".\n\nIn 1926-1940, Lifschitz also published a very large number of works dedicated to such diverse authorities as Giambattista Vico, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Francesco Guicciardini, Balzac, Hegel, and Pushkin.\n\n\n\n"}

His 2007 book \"The Black Swan\" has been described by \"The Sunday Times\" as one of the twelve most influential books since World War II.\n\nTaleb is an author and has been a professor at several universities, serving as a Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering since September 2008. He has been co-editor-in-chief of the academic journal \"Risk and Decision Analysis\" since September 2014. He has also been a practitioner of mathematical finance, a hedge fund manager, and a derivatives trader, and is currently listed as a scientific adviser at Universa Investments.\n\nHe criticized the risk management methods used by the finance industry and warned about financial crises, subsequently profiting from the late-2000s financial crisis. He advocates what he calls a \"black swan robust\" society, meaning a society that can withstand difficult-to-predict events. He proposes antifragility in systems, that is, an ability to benefit and grow from a certain class of random events, errors, and volatility as well as \"convex tinkering\" as a method of scientific discovery, by which he means that decentralized experimentation outperforms directed research.\n\nTaleb was born in Amioun, Lebanon, to Minerva Ghosn and Nagib Taleb, a physician/oncologist and a researcher in anthropology. His parents were Greek Orthodox Lebanese of Antiochian Greek origin, holding French citizenship. His grandfather, Fouad Nicolas Ghosn, and his great-grandfather, Nicolas Ghosn, were both deputy prime ministers in the 1940s through the 1970s. His paternal grandfather Nassim Taleb was a supreme court judge and his great-great-great-great grandfather, Ibrahim Taleb (Nabbout), was a governor of Mount Lebanon in 1866. Taleb attended a French school there, the Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais in Beirut. His family saw its political prominence and wealth reduced by the Lebanese Civil War, which began in 1975.\n\nTaleb received his bachelor and master of science degrees from the University of Paris. He holds an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (1983), and a PhD in Management Science from the University of Paris (Dauphine) (1998), under the direction of Hélyette Geman. His dissertation focused on the mathematics of derivatives pricing.\n\nTaleb has been a practitioner of mathematical finance, a hedge fund manager, and a derivatives trader. He is a scientific adviser at Universa Investments.\n\nTaleb considers himself less a businessman than an epistemologist of randomness, and says that he used trading to attain independence and freedom from authority. He was a pioneer of tail risk hedging (now sometimes called \"black swan protection\"), which is intended to mitigate investors' exposure to extreme market moves. His business model has been to safeguard investors against crises while reaping rewards from rare events, and thus his investment management career has included several jackpots followed by lengthy dry spells.\n\nHe has also held the following positions: managing director and proprietary trader at Credit Suisse UBS, worldwide chief proprietary arbitrage derivatives trader for currencies, commodities and non-dollar fixed income at First Boston, chief currency derivatives trader for Banque Indosuez, managing director and worldwide head of financial option arbitrage at CIBC Wood Gundy, derivatives arbitrage trader at Bankers Trust (now Deutsche Bank), proprietary trader at BNP Paribas, independent option market maker on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and founder of Empirica Capital.\n\nTaleb reportedly became financially independent after the crash of 1987 and was successful during the Nasdaq dive in 2000 as well as the financial crisis that began in 2007, a development which he attributed to the mismatch between reality and statistical distributions used in finance. Following this crisis, Taleb became an activist for what he called a \"black swan robust society\". Since 2007 he has been a Principal/Senior Scientific Adviser at Universa Investments in Santa Monica, California, a fund which is based on the \"black swan\" idea, owned and managed by former Empirica partner Mark Spitznagel. Some of its separate funds made returns of 65% to 115% in October 2008. In a 2007 \"Wall Street Journal\" article, Taleb claimed he retired from trading in 2004, and became a full-time author. However, he describes the nature of his involvement as \"totally passive\" from 2010 on.\n\nTaleb changed careers and became a mathematical researcher, scholar and philosophical essayist in 2006, and has held positions at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, at University of Massachusetts Amherst, at London Business School, and at Oxford University. He has been Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at New York University Tandon School of Engineering, since 2008. He was Distinguished Research Scholar at the Said Business School BT Center, University of Oxford (2009-2013).\n\nHe is co-Editor in Chief of the academic journal, \"Risk and Decision Analysis\" (since September 2014), jointly teaches regular courses with Paul Wilmott in London (19th time, March 2015), and occasionally participates in teaching courses toward the Certificate in Quantitative Finance. He is also co-faculty at the New England Complex Systems Institute.\n\nIn late 2015 Nassim, along with Robert J. Frey and Raphael Douady, formed the Real World Risk Institute \"to build the principles and methodology for what we call real-world rigor, in decision making and codify a clear-cut way to approach… to provide executive education courses and issue two certificates.\" \n\nTaleb's five volume philosophical essay on uncertainty, titled the \"Incerto\", covers the following books: \"Fooled by Randomness\" (2001), \"The Black Swan\" (2007–2010), \"The Bed of Procrustes\" (2010), \"Antifragile\" (2012), and \"Skin in the Game\" (2018). It was originally published in November 2016 including only the first four books. The fifth book has not been included in a separate release of the series.\n\nHis first non-technical book, \"Fooled by Randomness\", about the underestimation of the role of randomness in life, published in 2001, was selected by \"Fortune\" as one of the smartest 75 books known.\n\nHis second non-technical book, \"\", about unpredictable events, was published in 2007, selling close to 3 million copies (as of February 2011). It spent 36 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list, 17 as hardcover and 19 weeks as paperback, and was translated into 31 languages. The book has been credited with predicting the banking and economic crisis of 2008.\n\nA book of aphorisms, \"The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms\", was released in December 2010.\n\nThe fourth book of his \"Incerto\" series—\"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder\"—was published in November 2012.\n\nThe fifth book of his \"Incerto\" series—\"Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life\"—was published in February 2018. It has not yet been included in an updated release of \"Incerto\".\n\nTaleb's non-technical writing style has been described as mixing a narrative, often semi-autobiographical style with short philosophical tales and historical and scientific commentary. The sales of Taleb's first two books garnered an advance of $4 million, for a follow-up book on anti-fragility.\n\nTaleb's book \"\" summarizes the central problem: \"we humans, facing limits of knowledge, and things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas\". Taleb disagrees with Platonic (i.e., theoretical) approaches to reality to the extent that they lead people to have the wrong map of reality, rather than no map at all. He opposes most economic and grand social science theorizing, which in his view, suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Plato's \"Theory of Forms\". Based on these and other constructions, he advocates for what he calls a \"black swan robust\" society, meaning a society that can withstand difficult-to-predict events.\n\nHe has also proposed that biological, economic, and other systems exhibit an ability to benefit and grow from volatility—including particular types of random errors and events—a characteristic of these systems that he terms \"antifragility.\" Relatedly, he also believes that universities are better at public relations and claiming credit than generating knowledge. He argues that knowledge and technology are usually generated by what he calls \"stochastic tinkering\" rather than by top-down directed research, and has proposed option-like experimentation as a way to outperform directed research as a method of scientific discovery, an approach he terms \"convex tinkering.\"\n\nTaleb has called for cancellation of the Nobel Prize in Economics, saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating. He opposes top-down knowledge as an academic illusion. Together with Espen Gaarder Haug, Taleb asserts that option pricing is determined in a \"heuristic way\" by operators, not by a model, and that models are \"lecturing birds on how to fly\". Teacher and author Pablo Triana has explored this topic with reference to Haug and Taleb, and says that perhaps Taleb is correct to urge that banks be treated as utilities forbidden to take potentially lethal risks, while hedge funds and other unregulated entities should be able to do what they want.\n\nTaleb's writings discuss the error of comparing real-world randomness with the \"structured randomness\" in quantum physics where probabilities are remarkably computable and games of chance like casinos where probabilities are artificially built. Taleb calls this the \"ludic fallacy\". His argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on Plato's \"Theory of Forms\", gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take some key ideas into account, such as: the impossibility of possessing all relevant information, that small unknown variations in the data can have a huge impact, and flawed theories/models that are based on empirical data and that fail to consider events that have not taken place, but could have taken place. Discussing the ludic fallacy in \"The Black Swan\", he writes, \"The dark side of the moon is harder to see; beaming light on it costs energy. In the same way, beaming light on the unseen is costly, in both computational and mental effort.\"\n\nIn the second edition of \"The Black Swan\", he posited that the foundations of quantitative economics are faulty and highly self-referential. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field, as it cannot predict the risk of rare events, a problem that is acute in proportion to the rarity of these events. With the mathematician Raphael Douady, he called the problem \"statistical undecidability\" (Douady and Taleb, 2010).\n\nTaleb sees his main challenge as mapping his ideas of \"robustification\" and \"antifragility\", that is, how to live and act in a world we do not understand and build robustness to black swan events. Taleb introduced the idea of the \"fourth quadrant\" in the exposure domain. One of its applications is in his definition of the most effective (that is, least fragile) risk management approach: what he calls the 'barbell' strategy which is based on avoiding the middle in favor of linear combination of extremes, across all domains from politics to economics to one's personal life. These are deemed by Taleb to be more robust to estimation errors. For instance, he suggests that investing money in 'medium risk' investments is pointless, because risk is difficult, if not impossible to compute. His preferred strategy is to be both hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive at the same time. For example, an investor might put 80 to 90% of their money in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remainder going into highly risky and diversified speculative bets. An alternative suggestion is to engage in highly speculative bets with a limited downside.\n\nTaleb asserts that by adopting these strategies a portfolio can be \"robust\", that is, gain a positive exposure to black swan events while limiting losses suffered by such random events. Together with Donald Geman and Hélyette Geman, he modeled the \"maximum entropy barbell\" which consists in \"to constrain only what can be constrained (in a robust manner) and to maximize entropy elsewhere\", based on an insight by E.T. Jaynes that economic life increases in entropy under regulatory and other constraints. Taleb also applies a similar barbell-style approach to health and exercise. Instead of doing steady and moderate exercise daily, he suggests that it is better to do a low-effort exercise such as walking slowly most of the time, while occasionally expending extreme effort. He claims that the human body evolved to live in a random environment, with various unexpected but intense efforts and much rest.\n\nBesides his work on finance and probability, Taleb touches upon many current issues such as employment, the state of academia, and the Syrian War.\n\nHe appeared as a special guest on \"The Ron Paul Liberty Report\" on May 19, 2017 and stated his support for a non-interventionist foreign policy. Taleb subsequently appeared with Ron Paul and Ralph Nader on their respective shows in support of \"Skin in the Game\", which was dedicated to both men.\n\nTaleb wrote in Antifragile and in scientific papers that if the statistical structure of habits in modern society differ too greatly from the ancestral environment of humanity, the analysis of consumption should focus less on composition and more than the frequency. In other words, studies that ignore the random nature of supply of nutrients are invalid.\n\nIn a 2008 article in \"The Times\", the journalist Bryan Appleyard described Taleb as \"now the hottest thinker in the world\". The Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman proposed the inclusion of Taleb's name among the world's top intellectuals, saying \"Taleb has changed the way many people think about uncertainty, particularly in the financial markets. His book, \"The Black Swan\", is an original and audacious analysis of the ways in which humans try to make sense of unexpected events.\" Taleb was treated as a \"rock star\" at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos in 2009; at that event he had harsh words for bankers, suggesting that \"it is time for some punishment\".\n\nTaleb contends that statisticians can be pseudoscientists when it comes to risks of rare events and risks of blowups, and mask their incompetence with complicated equations. This stance has attracted criticism: the American Statistical Association devoted the August 2007 issue of \"The American Statistician\" to \"The Black Swan\". The magazine offered a mixture of praise and criticism for Taleb's main points, with a focus on Taleb's writing style and his representation of the statistical literature. Robert Lund, a mathematics professor at Clemson University, writes that in \"Black Swan\", Taleb is \"reckless at times and subject to grandiose overstatements; the professional statistician will find the book ubiquitously naive.\"\n\nAaron Brown, an author, quantitative analyst, and finance professor at Yeshiva and Fordham Universities, said that \"the book reads as if Taleb has never heard of nonparametric methods, data analysis, visualization tools or robust estimation.\" Nonetheless, he calls the book \"essential reading\" and urges statisticians to overlook the insults to get the \"important philosophic and mathematical truths.\" Taleb replied in the second edition of \"The Black Swan\" that \"One of the most common (but useless) comments I hear is that some solutions can come from 'robust statistics.' I wonder how using these techniques can create information where there is none\". While praising the book, Westfall and Hilbe in 2007 complained that Taleb's criticism is \"often unfounded and sometimes outrageous.\" Taleb, writes John Kay, \"describes writers and professionals as knaves or fools, mostly fools. His writing is full of irrelevances, asides and colloquialisms, reading like the conversation of a raconteur rather than a tightly argued thesis. But it is hugely enjoyable – compelling but easy to dip into. Yet beneath his rage and mockery are serious issues. The risk management models in use today exclude the very events against which they claim to protect the businesses that employ them. These models import a veneer of technical sophistication... Quantitative analysts have lulled corporate executives and regulators into an illusory sense of security.\" Berkeley statistician David Freedman said that efforts by statisticians to refute Taleb's stance have been unconvincing.\n\nTaleb and Nobel laureate Myron Scholes have traded personal attacks, particularly after Taleb's paper with Espen Haug on why nobody used the Black–Scholes–Merton formula. Taleb said that Scholes was responsible for the financial crises of 2008, and suggested that \"this guy should be in a retirement home doing Sudoku. His funds have blown up twice.

This idea originates from the works of William James in The Varieties of Religious Experience and refers to the conceptual framework that individuals have.

Trine's contention that \"The great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and through all.\" James acknowledges that his own over-beliefs are so minimal that to some religious believers they may seem like \"under-beliefs\".\n\n"}

In 1908 Henry Louis Mencken wrote on Friedrich Nietzsche's criticism of philosopher David Strauss that:\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Frederick L. Will used the term \"pseudo-skepticism\" in 1942. Alasdair MacIntyre writes:\nNotre Dame Professor of English, John E. Sitter used the term in 1977 in a discussion of Alexander Pope: \"Pope's intent, I believe, is to chasten the reader's skepticism — the pseudo-skepticism of the overly confident 'you' ... \"\n\nIn 1987, Marcello Truzzi revived the term specifically for arguments which use scientific-sounding language to disparage or refute given beliefs, theories, or claims, but which in fact fail to follow the precepts of conventional scientific skepticism. He argued that scientific skepticism is agnostic to new ideas, making no claims about them but waiting for them to satisfy a burden of proof before granting them validity. Pseudoskepticism, by contrast, involves \"negative hypotheses\"—theoretical assertions that some belief, theory, or claim is factually wrong—without satisfying the burden of proof that such negative theoretical assertions would require.\n\nIn 1987, while working as a professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University, Truzzi gave the following description of pseudoskeptics in the journal \"Zetetic Scholar\" (which he founded):\nTruzzi attributed the following characteristics to pseudoskeptics:\n\nHe characterized true skepticism as:\n\nPsychiatrist Richard Kluft noted that pseudoskepticism can inhibit research progress:\nSusan Blackmore, who lost her initial belief in parapsychology and in 1991 became a CSICOP fellow, later described what she termed the \"worst kind of pseudoskepticism\":\nHugo Anthony Meynell from the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary, labels the \"extreme position that all significant evidence supporting paranormal phenomena is a result of deception or lies\" as pseudoskepticism.\n\nWhile Truzzi's characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views who he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as \"skeptics\" despite cherry picking evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of AIDS denial are indulging in \"bogus scepticism\" when they argue in this way. Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it \"centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position\".\n\n"}

Ramsey and David Lewis. By using this method, a set of theoretical terms appearing in a theory can be defined implicitly by the assertions of the theory itself.\n\nA scientific theory which attempts to describe \"electrons\" is inherently abstract, as no one has ever observed an electron directly. Thus, the origin and content of the concept of \"electron\" is questionable. What does the word exactly signify? Ramsey and Lewis proposed that the meaning of the term \"electron\" is implicitly generated by the scientific theory that describes it, via all its assertions about electrons. Electrons are those things about which all the statements of the theory are true.\n\nHowever, some of those statements in a theory refer to other unobserved entities and properties such as \"charge\" or \"spin\". For instance, \"Electrons attract protons\" and \"Electrons have negative charge\" employ the terms \"protons\" and \"negative charge\" (with the latter also implicitly using the concept of \"charge\"). These properties are formalized, statements (such as conditionals) are formed using them, and those statements taken together are the definition of the term.\n\nConsider a sentence such as \"There's an electron in the sink.\" This means something along the lines of: \"There exist some properties \"P\", \"P\", ..., \"P\" ( one for every theoretical property involved in the scientific theory, with 'electronhood' (which roughly corresponds to the essence of an electron included as \"P\") such that... (a statement in the scientific theory, but with \"P\", ..., \"P\" substituted for the specific terms such as 'charge', 'is an electron', etc. employed by the theory), and there is something in the sink that has \"P\".\"\n\nThe process of converting the narrative form of a scientific theory into second-order logic is commonly called \"Ramsification\" (sometimes also spelled \"Ramseyfication\").\n\nExample: Suppose there are only three principles in our scientific theory about electrons (those principles can be seen to be statements involving the properties):\n\nA1. Electrons (things that have P1) have charge (P2).\n\nA2. Things with charge (P2) tickle you.\n\nA3. Electrons (things that have P1) cause lightning.\n\nFurthermore, we include the property of \"electronhood\", as outlined above, to be designated by \"P\", and the property of \"charge\" to be designated by \"P\".\n\nThen the meaning of a sentence such as \"I have an electron in my pocket\" is Ramsified into:\n\n\"There are properties \"P\" and \"P\" such that (things with \"P\" also have \"P\", and things with \"P\" tickle you, and things with \"P\" cause lightning, and there is a thing with \"P\" in my pocket).\" (, who cites .)\n\n\n• An outline of the Ramsey–Lewis method\n"}

He chose the name , meaning \"three minds\", in reference to Eihei Dogen's teaching from the \"Tenzo Kyōkun\" of the three minds a Zen student should cultivate: magnanimous mind, parental mind, and joyful mind. However, the following year the Sōtō-shumucho, the administrative body of Sōtō Zen in Japan, asked Okumura to head the Soto Zen Education Center in San Francisco, to which he agreed, delaying his plans to found his own temple. While still serving in that position, his friend and Buddhist Studies scholar John McRae, recommended locating his temple in Bloomington, Indiana. By 2002 land had been purchased and a local architect employed to design a combined zendo and living space for the Okumura family. \n\nThe sangha follows a modified monastic schedule with a retreat each month.

{"id": "19922857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19922857", "title": "Scalar implicature", "text": "Scalar implicature\n\nIn pragmatics, scalar implicature, or quantity implicature, is an implicature that attributes an \"implicit\" meaning beyond the explicit or \"literal\" meaning of an utterance, and which suggests that the utterer had a reason for not using a more informative or \"stronger\" term on the same scale. The choice of the weaker characterization suggests that, as far as the speaker knows, none of the stronger characterizations in the scale holds. This is commonly seen in the use of 'some' to suggest the meaning 'not all', even though 'some' is logically consistent with 'all'. If Bill says 'I have some of my money in cash', this utterance suggests to a hearer (though the sentence uttered does not logically imply it) that Bill does not have all his money in cash.\n\nScalar implicatures typically arise where the speaker qualifies or scales their statement with language that conveys to the listener an inference or implicature that indicates that the speaker had reasons not to use a stronger, more informative, term. For example, where a speaker uses the term \"some\" in the statement, \"Some students can afford a new car.\", the use of \"some\" gives rise to an inference or implicature that \"Not all students can afford a new car.\"\n\nAs with pragmatic inference generally, such inferences are defeasible or cancellable - the inferred meaning may not be true, even though the literal meaning is true. This distinguishes such inferences from entailment. They are also non-detachable. A conversational implicature is said to be \"non-detachable\" when, after the replacement of what is said with another expression with the same literal meaning, the same conversational implicature remains. This distinguishes them from conventional implicatures.\n\nIn a 2006 experiment with Greek-speaking five-year-olds' interpretation of aspectual expressions, the results revealed that children have limited success in deriving scalar implicatures from the use of aspectual verbs such as \"start\" (which implicates non-completion). However, the tested children succeed in deriving scalar implicatures with discrete degree modifiers such as \"half\" as in half finished. Their ability to spontaneously compute scalar implicatures was greater than their ability to judge the pragmatic appropriateness of scalar statements. In addition, the tested children were able to suspend scalar implicatures in environments where they were not supported. \n\nGriceans attempt to explain these implicatures in terms of the maxim of quantity, according to which one is to be just as informative as required. The idea is that if the speaker were in a position to make the stronger statement, they would have. Since (s)he did not, (s)he must believe that the stronger statement is not true.\n\nSome examples of scalar implicature are:\n\nUttering the sentence (a) in most cases will communicate the assumption in (b). This seems to be because the speaker did not use stronger terms such as 'there will be \"more\" than five people for dinner tonight' or 'she \"can't possibly\" get the job'. For example, if Bill really did have all of Chomsky's papers, the speaker would have said so. However, according to the maxim of quantity, a speaker will only be informative as is required, and will therefore not use any stronger terms unless required. The hearer, knowing this, will assume that the stronger term does not apply.\n\n\n"}

The scientific culture of second scholasticism surpassed its medieval source (Scholasticism) in the number of its proponents, the breadth of its scope, the analytical complexity, sense of historical and literary criticism, and the volume of editorial production, most of which remains hitherto little explored.\n\nUnlike the \"First\", i.e. medieval scholasticism, a typical feature of second scholasticism was the development of schools of thought, developing the intellectual heritage of their \"teacher\". Two schools survived from earlier phases of scholasticism, Scotism and Thomism. The Scotists, mostly belonging to the various branches of the Franciscan order, include the Italians Antonius Trombetta, Bartolomeo Mastri, Bonaventura Belluto; the Frenchman Claude Frassen, the Irish emigrants Luke Wadding, John Punch, and Hugh Caughwell; and the Germans Bernhard Sannig and Crescentius Krisper. The Thomists were usually but not exclusively represented by the Iberians in the Dominican and the Carmelite orders. They include Thomas Cajetan ( or Caietanus), Domingo de Soto, Domingo Báñez, Franciscus Ferrariensis, the Complutenses, João Poinsot and others.\n\nThe intellectual influence of second scholasticism was augmented by the establishment of the Society of Jesus (1540), by Ignatius Loyola, per approval of Pope Paul III. The \"Jesuits\" are considered a third \"school\" of second scholasticism, although this refers more to the common style of academic work rather than to some common doctrine. The important figures include Pedro da Fonseca, Antonio Rubio, the Conimbricenses, Robert Bellarmine, Francisco Suárez, Luis de Molina, Gabriel Vásquez, Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza, Rodrigo Arriaga, and many others.\n\nThere were also many \"independent\" thinkers like Sebastian Izquierdo, Juan Caramuel y Lobkowicz, Kenelm Digby, Raffael Aversa etc.\n\nThe golden age of Second Scholasticism was the first decades of the 17th century, at which time it was still largely in control of university curricula in philosophy. But second scholasticism started to decline under the attacks of philosophers writing in vernacular languages, such as Descartes, Pascal and Locke, and from the competition from more experimental and mathematical ways of doing science promoted by the Scientific Revolution. It was largely dormant from the onset of Enlightenment in the end of the 17th century, although scholastics such as Suarez remained influential for a long period. In some Iberian universities the scholastic culture remained vivid well into the 19th century, providing background for the birth of Neo-Scholasticism.\n\nInterest in the thought of the late scholastics has been recently revived by the journal Studia Neoaristotelica.\n\n\n\n"}

His surviving \"On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato\" is an introductory survey of Greek mathematics.\n\nLittle is known about the life of Theon of Smyrna. A bust created at his death, and dedicated by his son, was discovered at Smyrna, and art historians date it to around 135 CE. Ptolemy refers several times in his \"Almagest\" to a Theon who made observations at Alexandria, but it is uncertain whether he is referring to Theon of Smyrna. The lunar impact crater Theon Senior is named for him.\n\nTheon wrote several commentaries on the works of mathematicians and philosophers of the time, including works on the philosophy of Plato. Most of these works are lost. The one major survivor is his \"On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato\". A second work concerning the order in which to study Plato's works has recently been discovered in an Arabic translation.\n\nHis \"On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato\" is not a commentary on Plato's writings but rather a general handbook for a student of mathematics. It is not so much a groundbreaking work as a reference work of ideas already known at the time. Its status as a compilation of already-established knowledge and its thorough citation of earlier sources is part of what makes it valuable.\n\nThe first part of this work is divided into two parts, the first covering the subjects of numbers and the second dealing with music and harmony. The first section, on mathematics, is most focused on what today is most commonly known as number theory: odd numbers, even numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, abundant numbers, and other such properties. It contains an account of 'side and diameter numbers', the Pythagorean method for a sequence of best rational approximations to the square root of 2, the denominators of which are Pell numbers. It is also one of the sources of our knowledge of the origins of the classical problem of Doubling the cube.\n\nThe second section, on music, is split into three parts: music of numbers (\"hē en arithmois mousikē\"), instrumental music (\"hē en organois mousikē\"), and \"music of the spheres\" (\"hē en kosmō harmonia kai hē en toutō harmonia\"). The \"music of numbers\" is a treatment of temperament and harmony using ratios, proportions, and means; the sections on instrumental music concerns itself not with melody but rather with intervals and consonances in the manner of Pythagoras' work. Theon considers intervals by their degree of consonance: that is, by how simple their ratios are. (For example, the octave is first, with the simple 2:1 ratio of the octave to the fundamental.) He also considers them by their distance from one another.\n\nThe third section, on the music of the cosmos, he considered most important, and ordered it so as to come after the necessary background given in the earlier parts. Theon quotes a poem by Alexander of Ephesus assigning specific pitches in the chromatic scale to each planet, an idea that would retain its popularity for a millennium thereafter.\n\nThe second book is on astronomy. Here Theon affirms the spherical shape and large size of the Earth; he also describes the occultations, transits, conjunctions, and eclipses. However, the quality of the work led Otto Neugebauer to criticize him for not fully understanding the material he attempted to present.\n\n\n"}

He is famous for the most penetrating analysis of the Czech common law that he has put forward on some 460 pages under the title “On the Laws of the Czech Land Nine Books” („O právích země české knihy devatery“). He has also translated some Latin texts.\n\nViktorin Kornelius was born in the burgher Utraquist (moderate reformed Hussite Church) environment of the East-Bohemian town of Chrudim in 1460. Having graduated from the Faculty of Arts of the then Utraquist University of Prague, Všehrd gained a wider outlook and capacities of generalization - preconditions for asking, reflecting on as well as answering a number of questions the previous authors of law books from the ranks of nobility had not arrived at.\n\nAfter 1487 Všehrd held the Office of the Land Boards on the Prague Castle and from 1493 to 1497, during the vacant post of the slibe, he held the post of Vice-scribe at the Land Court in the Prague Castle. The Land Boards with rulings of the Land Court, which were to be burnt during the later great fire of Prague Castle in 1541, had decayed into a flimsy and bad state even before Všehrd's activities. Lawyers in the land routinely used the mere digests of rulings in the form of subject- or alphabetically ordered registers. These attitudes and Všehrd's recording of legal documents led to his dismissal from the Land Court in 1497. Nevertheless, in the course of his appointment he had managed to collect enough material to write his scholarly treatise. Having finished the treatise in 1501, he offered it to the public to be copied freely. He explicitly granted the results of his work for the defense of good and just people “so that they would be able to protect themselves against evil and wilful people.” Having lost his position, Všehrd successfully carried on his legal and financial practice.\n\nHe died of plague on 21 September 1520 and is buried in historical Lesser Town of Prague, in the Romanesque-Gothic, church of John the Baptist (now Czechoslovak Hussite “”, Malá Strana.)\n\nIf, today, legal systems of European origin are usually divided into civil law originated in the framework of late Roman positive law with codified written principles and the English common law, giving precedential authority to prior court decisions, the latter practices were in older times not quite exclusive for England. Such systems dominated in the historic lands of the Czech Kingdom as late as the beginnings of the Modern Age, and even longer in the then Polish and Hungarian lands. Czech common law was abolished by Hapsburg emperor Ferdinand II only after the loss of national sovereignty in 1627 – some years after the fateful defeat in the Battle of White Mountain (1620).\nIn a spirit similar to some English lawyers Všehrd extolled irretrievability of legal customs in which the experiences of past ages had been condensed, as Všehrd put it, “from ancestors and old Czechs arduously and dilligently found.” Všehrd realized that the stability and force of customs and traditions in this way served as a guarantee of liberty and a mighty barrier against intentional misuse of the law by the powerful. He warned against the most “baneful” enemies – those who would abuse the laws, who would like to change, modify and turn over the very laws “by which the land has been standing from the time immemorial.” The changes would mean “downfall of the good and in particular poor people, widows and orphans.” “If the laws of the land work in their steadiness and unvariability, the goings on for all people in general as well as for any person in particular are good. If the laws of the land change, the goings on are on the contrary bad for all as for any single individual.” \nThrough his comparison of the Czech Land Boards with the Roman Twelve Tables the open-minded and freedom-loving as well as conservative Všehrd implied that Czech law is of no lower value than Roman law. His moderate legal relativism does not exclude possibility of a partial inspiration from abroad. To adopt principles from foreign legal systems is admittedly possible, but usually not suitable: what works well in one legal system often does not prove its worth in another. It is more rewarding simply to learn from foreign experiences and their comparisons. The canon law of the Catholic Church had after the Hussite Wars almost disappeared from awareness of the Czech people, but some elements of the Roman law had found a way into native practice. Všehrd complained that the lawyers who had been educated at foreign universities were trying to practice at the Land Court the rules that had not been accepted by the native law. Moreover, he was not satisfied with protracted and therefore costly lawsuits held according to the Roman law.\n\nVšehrd tried to set himself free from his own interests, to defend general interests and to adopt the outlook of an impartial observer. From this perspective he could make an opinion on the damages the short-term and selfish aims of certain individuals or social classes had brought about to the whole society. On the other hand, if it seemed obvious to him, Všehrd reminded individuals or groups that they were harming their own interests and themselves in a long-time span. He called on those who were advancing unjustifiably to make agreement and reconciliation with their adversary. An incessant effort is needed to keep the justice. “The useful does not differ from the fair, but “one is indissolubly tied up with the other” and “all the evils begin with, yield, grow and carry out from their separation.” And Všehrd opposed the dictate of high nobility and its functional codification of the law. \nWhile the first three books of the work “On the Laws of the Czech Land Nine Books” deal roughly with what is nowadays called procedural law, the next three discuss substantive law to which a short supplement on execution is added. In the seventh book we find further and more detailed regulations on execution law. The eighth book deals with some publicly relevant legal documents and with administrative fees. Finally, the ninth book deals with confusions and inconsistencies in the application of law as well as with some reforms of legal order.\n\nWith patent satisfaction, Všehrd understood the relationship between king and society in the Czech state as a social contract. The land itself elects the king, it is not purchased by him by any money and is subject to him only voluntarily: The king must make an oath to the land and is obliged to administer it “not as he would like to, but only along the age-old liberties and rights of the land.” The civil servants should remember “that they are not masters, but only servants of all community and all the people; for they take from the people their money and fees for their profession which is, as they often hear, their plough.” Even the Land Boards, let alone each office in general, is construed as service for the sake of all. Therefore, it is desirable that all “whose profession makes them to come to the Boards should be serving all people without shouting and discords about their needs, talking meekly as servants, not shouting as lords.”\n\nWhile John Locke tried to limit the executive power by the power legislative (and federative), Všehrd in his effort to maintain the balance of power did not count with any legislative assembly that would have legislative powers. The legal order of the land, in his understanding, had so far been and also should have been formed primarily and just by old customs and precedents. Only in special cases – as was the case of the then notorious who in 1496 had taken over the serfs and property of another squire – the judgment depended upon discretionary powers of judges. In addition to the king, equipped with some executive powers, the second Všehrd's column of power is so formed by the whole of old traditions, “liberties and rights” of the land itself. I.e. by assemblies (the Assembly or the Diet (Sněmovna) of the Land had until the 1620s the explicit power to choose and/or elect the king, to give consent to taxation and recruitment quotas), the above-mentioned legal order given primarily by the old customs and precedents, which should be transparent and familiar to the wider public, and finally by people's customs and habits in a wider sense. \nThe contract between the land and the sovereign is in Všehrd obviously more equal than later in Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan; position of the land is stronger and the sovereign is weaker. Všehrd’s sovereign is even not able, due to a lack of political power, to appoint his successors. Všehrd also appreciates peace, preferring negotiations to war, but unlike Hobbes, he almost does not use religious arguments. However, the Czech lands had by then already established religious toleration; in principle every single individual could choose their own religion by then. Even political groupings or proto-parties in the estates assemblies (after the 1485 Peace of Kutná Hora) used to be formed by different religious groups (and individual people could choose their confession in the Lands of the Czech Crown then).\n\nVšehrd tried to make especially lower and middle classes familiar with the law in order not to be neglected in their proceedings and needs. As many people as possible were to have a look into the law and operations of judiciary. Všehrd stressed equal inheritance rights for women, arguing by age-old foundation of native law. And in addition to that, he maintained, it is useful and entertaining to consider the laws of the land as it “is sharpening reason and hardening memory of those who often think about them.” That is why Všehrd approved of the substitution of Latin by the “natural” Czech language at the Land Boards and elsewhere in the land's judiciary in 1495. And he refused the steps common in that period towards making law more opaque and its application more difficult (e.g. the use of paper instead of the previous use of more durable parchment for recordings of judicial rulings; new crossings that made the previous text illegible; the hindering of free access to the Land Boards that had been accessible before to every single individual; or entries into the Land Boards without the respective parties being present, or even notified). So with his own overheads, Všehrd was in his leisure time and to his own disadvangage, helping people by enabling them to take care of themselves.\n\nThanks to the Hussite reform movement Czech language was introduced to the official and legal agenda (and the Czech example strengthened the position of some other national languages in surrounding countries, especially Hungarian and rather indirectly also Romanian). Všehrd turned to his native language and was among initiators of the tradition of Czech national and reformational humanism. Later, he parted company with his friend, the noble and Catholic poet Bohuslav Hasištejnský z Lobkovic (of Lobkovice), who wrote in Latin.\n\nVšehrd's work has survived Baroque period called by many a ´period of darkness´ (that at least in political and intellectual sense in the Czech lands) in handwritten copies. During the period of the National Revival in the 19th century the work served a role in the process of re-creation of the Czech legal terminology. The first book edition in 1841 was considerably curtailed by the Austrian Metternichian censorship, that was not satisfied even with those compromises Všehrd had had to make some 340 years earlier. The second and the till-date last edition, that was published in 1874, is nowadays almost out of reach.\n\nVšehrd's name was in 1868 taken over by Czech law students. Their organization, “Všehrd Association of Czech Lawyers”, renewed after “1989 Velvet Revolution“ in Czechoslovakia, has been working up to now.\n\n"}
{"id": "11941950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11941950", "title": "Wani (scholar)", "text": "Wani (scholar)\n\nWani (Japanese: ) is a semi-legendary scholar who is said to have been sent to Japan by Baekje of southwestern Korea during the reign of Emperor Ōjin. He used to be associated with the introduction of the Chinese writing system to Japan.\n\nWani is mentioned only in Japanese history books; he is not recorded in Chinese or Korean sources. The main sources of Wani's biography are the \"Nihon Shoki\" (720) and the \"Kojiki\" (712).\n\nThese stories have long been questioned by scholars. Ten volumes are too much for the \"Analects\", and more importantly, his alleged arrival predates the composition of the \"Thousand Character Classic\" (the early 6th century). Arai Hakuseki (1657–1725) considered that Wani had brought a certain book of Elementary Learning which the \"Kojiki\" had confused with the \"Thousand Character Classic\". Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) claimed that it was pointless to care about details because the \"Thousand Character Classic\" was mentioned just as a typical book of Elementary Learning. Some assume a different version of the \"Thousand Character Classic\" was brought but this theory has no clear basis. In short, it is not unnatural for people like Wani to have come to Japan around that time, but there is no strong evidence determining whether Wani really existed.\n\nDating the alleged arrival of Wani is rather difficult since there are long-lasting disputes over the accuracy of these sources on early events. According to the traditional dating, it would be 285 though is considered too early by historians. Based on the reign of King Akue (阿花王; identified as King Asin 阿莘王) of Baekje, who, according to the \"Nihon Shoki\", died in the 16th year of Emperor Ōjin's reign, it would be 405. However, this theory contradicts the description of the \"Kojiki\", which says that Wani's arrival was during the reign of King Shōko (照古王; usually identified as King Geunchogo 近肖古王, r. 346-375) of Baekje. The \"Kojiki\" suggests that Wani arrived sometime after 372.\n\nHis name is not straightforward either. The \"Kojiki\" calls him \"Wani Kishi\". The \"Nihon Shoki\" and most of the subsequent documents read 王仁. Although the reading \"Wani\" is irregular (the standard reading is \"Ō Jin\" or \"Ō Nin\"), these characters look like a Chinese name (the surname Wang and the personal name Ren). This leads some scholars to consider that Wani was of Chinese descent. In fact his descendants claimed so. A supporting fact is that the Wang clan was powerful in China's former Lelang Commandery in northwestern Korea. After the downfall of the commandery around 313, some members of the Wang clan might have fled to Baekje, and then to Japan. A more skeptical view is that the legend of Wani was influenced by much later events: the surname Wang was selected as the most appropriate name for the ideal man of letters because in the late 6th century, several scholars surnamed Wang came to Japan from southern China via Baekje.\n\nThe descendants of Wani, or more precisely, those who claimed Wani to be their ancestor, were collectively called Kawachi no Fumi clan. They lived in Kisaichi of Kawachi Province together with their branch families. The head family had the \"uji\" \"Fumi\" [literature] after their duty as scribes, and similarly their branch families were given the \"kabane\" \"Fuhito\" [scribe].\n\nDespite Wani's fame as a scholar, the Kawachi no Fumi clan was not so active as secretaries for administration. A rare exception was Fumi no Nemaro (文禰麻呂; ?-707). Instead of being active in civil administration, he rose to a rank unusually high for a mid-level bureaucrat for his performances in the Jinshin War (672). Some historians consider that this was the reason why the legend of Wani was recorded in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihon Shoki\". It is known that scribes of foreign origin had similar and mutually conflicting legends about their founders. Features common in their stories include the arrival during the reign of Emperor Ōjin, the introduction of Chinese literature and/or Confucianism, and the surname Wang. The legend of Wani was chosen with the rest of them ignored because the Kawachi no Fumi clan was relatively powerful at the time of the compilation of the history books.\n\nIn 791 Wani's descendants including Fumi no Mooto (文最弟) and Takefu no Makata (武生真象) made a successful attempt to elevate their \"kabane\" or family rank. According to the \"Shoku Nihongi\" (797), their appeal was as follows:\nA similar story can be found in the description of the Fumi no Sukune (文宿禰) clan by the \"Shinsen Shōjiroku\" (815).\n\nThe article of the \"Nihon Shoki\" was traditionally interpreted as the introduction of Confucianism and/or Chinese literature although not clearly stated in the history book.\n\nAccording to the preface to the \"Kokin Wakashū\" (905), a famous Waka poem starting with \"Naniwa-zu\" was traditionally attributed to Wani. At that time, the imperial throne was vacant for three years because the future Emperor Nintoku (successor to Emperor Ōjin) and his brother Crown Prince Uji no Waki Iratsuko renounced succession to the throne to crown the other. Historians and philologists are skeptical about the attribution to Wani because it cannot be found in earlier sources. Anyway, from the early 10th century on, this poem was regarded as a chorus that praises Emperor Nintoku. As a result, Wani was portrayed as a sage submitting to the emperor's virtue.\n\nFrom the Heian period onward, references to Wani mostly involved the \"Naniwa-zu\" poem. Oddly some commentaries to Waka poems describe Wani as a man from Silla in southeastern Korea. Although this error was corrected by Fujiwara no Norikane's \"Waka dōmōshō\" (1145–53) and Kenshō's \"Kokinshū jo chū\" (1183) with the reference to the \"Nihon Shoki\", it survived for a long time. To solve the contradiction, Reizei Tamesuke even claimed in 1297 that Wani had been transferred from Baekje to Silla and then from Silla to Japan. A possible reason for this error is that Wani's arrival at Japan was interpreted as a result of Empress Jingū's conquest of Silla, which was recorded in the \"Nihon Shoki\".\n\nThe so-called tomb of Wani is located in Hirakata, Osaka Prefecture. It is, however, most likely that the alleged tomb identified in the 18th century has nothing to do with Wani.\n\nThe \"tomb\" was located in Fujisaka Village, Kawachi Province (part of the modern-day Hirakata city). It was originally a pair of stones known to local people as \"Oni Tomb\" (於爾墓). In other words, they were not associated with Wani. The situation changed in 1731 when the Confucian scholar Namikawa Seisho (並河誠所) visited there as part of the compilation of a geography monograph named Gokinaishi (五畿内志). He claimed that he discovered an old document at Wada Temple of Kin'ya Village (also part of the modern Hirakata) that read the name \"Oni Tomb\" was the corrupt form of \"Wani Tomb\". At his recommendation, a stonetomb was built behind the stones. It is generally considered that the \"tomb\" in Hirakata is Namikawa's fabrication. There is no ancient record that refers to Wani's burial site. Archaeologically speaking, there was no such custom of setting a tombstone on a mound before the introduction of Buddhism.\n\nThe new myth spread as the Kokugaku movement became active. Wani was praised as a talented and faithful servant to the ancient emperors. In 1827, a monument in honor of Wani was erected near the tomb, on which his name was engraved by Prince Arisugawa. After the Meiji Restoration, a ceremony was held at the tomb in 1899 to commemorate the 1500-year anniversary of the death of Emperor Nintoku.\n\nAfter the annexation of Korea, another symbolic role was given to Wani in relation to modern Korea/Koreans. As part of an effort to integrate Korea into the empire, conciliatory approaches were adopted. Wani was utilized as a historical precedent for serving the emperor loyally in spite of non-Japanese root. In 1927 a society was set up in Tokyo to build a shrine for Wani. Its member included Uchida Ryōhei from the Black Dragon Society. The project for building a shrine in the site of the Wani tomb began in 1930. In 1932 the society celebrated the 1650-year anniversary of Wani's arrival there. The construction of Wani shrine started in 1940 but was never completed. In addition to Wani Shrine, a pair of monuments was built in honor of Wani in Tokyo's Ueno Park in 1939.\n\nWith the disintegration of the Japanese Empire, the political role of Wani ceased to exist. Instead, Wani was targeted by Korean political exploitation. Koreans, in turn, use Wani as a symbol of ancient Korea's \"cultural superiority\" over Japan. Since the 1980s Korean nationals in Japan have led various events visualizing Wani's alleged arrival at Japan. President Kim Dae-jung sent a personal letter to a ceremony at the tomb in 1998, and Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil visited there in 1999.\n\nEven though Korea has no historical records on Wani, \"Doctor Wang In's Historical Sites\" (Wang In is the Korean form of Wani, 왕인) are located in Gurim Village, Yeongam County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea today. It is based on a new myth that can date back only to the early 20th century.\n\nEarlier geography books including the \"Taekriji\" (1751) never link Wani to Yeongam. The first known record that associates Wani with Yeongam is the \"Joseon Hwanyeo Seungnam\" (朝鮮寰輿勝覧; 1922–37) by Yi Byeong-yeon (이병연, 李秉延). It claims without providing any evidence that Wani was born in Yeongnam. It is known that around the same time, a Japanese monk named Aoki Keishō claimed on the basis of \"oral tradition\" that Yeongam was Wani's homeland. In 1932 he made a failed appeal to erect a bronze statue of Wani in Yeongam.\n\nA new myth about Wangin was publicized in South Korea in the 1970s. In 1972 the social activist Kim Changsu reported a series of essays titled \"Korean spirit embodied in Japan,\" which appealed to South Koreans who felt starved for Korean superiority to Japan. In the framework of Korean national history, Wani was regarded as a Korean. Upon being informed by a reader from Yeongam, Kim issued a statement identifying Yeongam as the birthplace of Wani in the next year. In spite of the weakness of the evidence, Wani's \"relic site\" was designated as Cultural Asset No. 20 of South Jeolla Province in 1976.\n\nThe development of Wani's \"historical sites\" was led by the governments of South Jeolla Province and Yeongam County. The governor of South Jeolla Province was from Yeongam County. The construction was carried out from 1985 to 1987, \"restoring\" the \"birthplace\", schools where Wani allegedly studied, and others. Yeongam County started to fully exploit the old-looking new theme park as a tourist attraction because the introduction of local autonomy of 1990 forced the local government to look for its own source of revenue. For example, Youngam County began to host the annual \"Wangin Culture Festival\" in 1997 that was previously organized by local people under the name of \"Cherry blossom festival\". The exploitation was not done without opposition. In fact, it is criticized by a faction who attempts to use Buddhist monk Doseon (827–898) as the main tourism resource of Yeongam.\n\n\n"}
