{"id": "604372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=604372", "title": "A Course in Miracles", "text": "A Course in Miracles\n\nA Course in Miracles (also referred to as ACIM or the Course) is a 1976 book containing a curriculum which claims to assist its readers in achieving spiritual transformation. The underlying premise of the work is the teaching that the greatest \"miracle\" that one may achieve in one's life is the act of simply gaining a full \"awareness of love's presence\" in one's own life. The book was written, or \"scribed,\" by Helen Schucman, who claimed that it had been dictated to her word for word via \"inner dictation\" which came from Jesus. The Course contains a curriculum to bring about what it calls a \"spiritual transformation,\" consisting of three sections entitled the \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students,\" and \"Manual for Teachers\". Written, or transcribed, from 1965 to 1972, some distribution occurred via photocopies before a hardcover edition was published in 1976 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. The copyright and trademarks, which had been held by two foundations, were revoked in 2004 after lengthy litigation because the earliest versions had been circulated without a copyright notice.\n\nThroughout the 1980s annual sales of the book steadily increased each year; however the largest growth in sales occurred in 1992 after Marianne Williamson discussed the book on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", with more than two million volumes sold. The book has been called everything from \"New Age psychobabble\" to \"a Satanic seduction\" to \"The New Age Bible\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was written as a collaborative venture between Schucman and William ('Bill') Thetford. In 1958 Schucman began her professional career at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City as Thetford's research associate. In the spring of 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that \"[t]here must be another way\". Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an \"inner voice\" which she identified as Jesus. She said that on October 21, 1965, an \"inner voice\" told her: \"This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes.\" Schucman said that the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop. The next day, she explained the events of her \"note taking\" to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The transcription the next day repeated itself regularly for many years to come. In 1972, the dictation of the three main sections of the Course was completed, with some additional minor dictation coming after that point. \n\nFr. Benedict Groeschel, a Roman Catholic priest who had studied under Thetford and worked with Schucman, arranged an introduction of Kenneth Wapnick to Schucman and Thetford in November 1972. Groeschel was given a copy of the \"ACIM\" manuscript in 1973 and testified that he was instructed by Schucman not to distribute the manuscript; however, with Schucman's permission, he made it available to Wapnick. Wapnick then reviewed the draft and discussed, with Schucman and Thetford, further revisions that he felt were needed in order to place the book in its final copyrighted and published form. Thetford then made a few further editorial decisions and stipulations about the \"Principles of Miracles\" section, and soon afterwards opted to withdraw from being directly involved with any further major edits to the material. Wapnick and Schucman continued to edit the manuscript by deleting personal material apparently directed only to Schucman and Thetford, creating chapter and section headings, and correcting various inconsistencies in paragraph structure, punctuation, and capitalization. This editing process was completed by approximately February 1975. Wapnick subsequently became a teacher of \"ACIM,\" a co-founder and president of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), and a director and executive committee member of the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP).\n\nThe content of \"A Course in Miracles\" is presented in the three sections: \"Textbook\", \"Workbook\", and \"Manual for Teachers\":\n\nA limited edition release of 300 copies of the first three sections of the book was published by The Foundation for Inner Peace, a publishing company that had been created solely to publish A Course in Miracles. In June 1976, FIP published the first three sections of \"ACIM\" in a set of three hardcover volumes in a 5,000 copy run, along with the publication of the supplemental booklet \"Psychology: Purpose, Process, Practice.\" In 1985, FIP began publishing a single volume containing all three of the first books in single soft-cover volume. In 1992, FIP published its second edition, a hardcover edition. This revision incorporated some minor changes within the first three sections including some editorial content additions and the addition of a verse-numbering system, as well as addition of the \"Clarification of Terms\" section. At this time, FIP also released the publication of the supplemental \"Song of Prayer\" booklet.\n\nIn October 2004, a long-standing copyright battle over A Course In Miracles was decided with a ruling that put the work into the public domain.\n\nIn August 2017, the Circle of Atonement published \"A Course in Miracles: Complete and Annotated Edition\", which contains the original material that Helen Schucman wrote up to 1972, and prior to it being edited by Schucman, Thetford, and Wapnick into the Foundation for Inner Peace edition.\n\nSince it first went on sale in 1976, the text has been translated into 22 languages. The book is distributed globally, forming the basis of a range of organized groups.\n\nWapnick said that \"if the Bible were considered literally true, then (from a Biblical literalist's viewpoint) the Course would have to be viewed as demonically inspired\". Though a friend of Schucman, Thetford, and Wapnick, Catholic priest Benedict Groeschel has criticized ACIM and the related organizations. Finding some elements of \"ACIM\" to be what he called \"severe and potentially dangerous distortions of Christian theology\", he wrote that it is \"a good example of a false revelation\" and that it has \"become a spiritual menace to many”. The evangelical editor Elliot Miller says that Christian terminology employed in \"ACIM\" is \"thoroughly redefined\" to resemble New Age teachings. Other Christian critics say that \"ACIM\" is \"intensely anti-Biblical\" and incompatible with Christianity, blurring the distinction between creator and created and forcefully supporting the occult and New Age worldview.\n\nThe skeptic Robert T. Carroll criticized \"ACIM\" as \"a minor industry\" that is overly commercialized and characterizes it as \"Christianity improved\". Carroll said the teachings are not original and suggested they are culled from \"various sources, east and west\".\n\nTwo associated works have been noted as extensions of A Course in Miracles. Author Gary Renard's \"The Disappearance of the Universe\", first published in 2003, and Marianne Williamson's \"A Return to Love\", published in 1992. \"The Disappearance of the Universe\", first published in 2003 by Fearless Books, was later republished by Hay House in 2004. \"Publishers Weekly\" noted how Renard's significant examination of \"A Course in Miracles\" influenced his book.\n\n\n\n"}

As a result of acquiescence, the person whose rights are infringed may lose the ability to make a legal claim against the infringer, or may be unable to obtain an injunction against continued infringement. The doctrine infers a form of \"permission\" that results from silence or passiveness over an extended period of time.\n\nAlthough not typically not found in statutory law, the doctrine of acquiescence is well-supported by case law. One common context in which acquiescence is raised is when there is a dispute or disagreement over the location of a property line, followed by an extended period of time during which the parties respect a property line. Even if it is later discovered that the actual property line was in a different location, the long-term acquiescence to the incorrectly placed line may result in its becoming enforceable as the legal property line.\n\nAn example of the law of acquiescence occurred in a dispute between the State of Georgia and the State of South Carolina, in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that Georgia could no longer make any claim to an island in the Savannah River, despite the 1787 Treaty of Beaufort's assignment to the contrary. The court said that Georgia had knowingly allowed South Carolina to join the island as a peninsula to its own coast by dumping sand from dredging, and to then levy property taxes on it for decades. Georgia thereby lost the island-turned-peninsula by its own acquiescence, even though the treaty had given it all of the islands in the river.\n\nDoctrines similar to acquiescence include:\n\n\n"}

He is familiarly known as Latu Maharaj among the followers of Ramakrishna. Adbhutananda was the first monastic disciple to come to Ramakrishna. While most of Ramakrishna's direct disciples came from the Bengali intelligentsia, Adbhutananda's lack of formal education made him unique amongst them. He was a servant boy of a devotee of Ramakrishna, and he later became his monastic disciple. Though unlettered, Adbhutananda was considered as a monk with great spiritual insight by Ramakrishna's followers, and Vivekananda regarded him as \"the greatest miracle of Ramakrishna\".\n\nAdbhutananda was born in North-Eastern India in the Chhapra district of Bihar, around the middle of the nineteenth century. He was given the name Rakhturam, meaning \"child who is protected by Lord Rama\". His parents were poor, humble villagers. Both his father and mother died before Rakhturam was five years old and he was left in the care of an uncle who was affectionate towards him.\n\nGrowing up in the village, Rakhturam led a carefree life, tending cows and sheep in the fields. In later years he said, \"I used to wander freely with the cowherd boys. How simple and guileless they were! You can't have real joy unless you are like that.\" Poverty forced Rakhturam and his uncle to travel to Calcutta in search of a livelihood. Rakhturam came in contact with Ramachandra Datta, a householder devotee of Ramakrishna, and he joined as his servant. As a servant, Rakhturam was considered energetic and faithful. Rakhturam became known as \"Latu\" in his new Calcutta surroundings, and he was called by that name thereafter.\n\nRamakrishna lived at the Dakshineswar Kāli Temple, a few miles north of Calcutta on the eastern bank of the Ganges. Ram Chandra Datta, Latu's employer, was one of the first householder disciples to visit Ramakrishna. Datta loved to speak about Ramakrishna and his sayings and Latu heard about Ramakrishna from him and was attracted by Ramakrishna's teachings, It is reported that inspired by the teachings of Ramakrishna, he was often found lying covered with his blanket, quietly wiping tears from his eyes thinking of God. Latu waited eagerly for an opportunity to meet Ramakrishna, and he met Ramakrishna on a Sunday in 1879 or 1880.\n\nWhen Ramakrishna saw Latu, he reportedly said to Ramchandra that Latu had \"holy signs in him.\" and it is reported that when Ramakrishna touched him, Latu entered an ecstatic state, \"tears trickled from his eyes and his lips began to quiver with emotion\" and he gradually returned to normal state of consciousness. Latu began to visit Ramakrishna regularly, and he lost the enthusiasm with which he worked before at Datta's house. In June 1881, he joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar as his personal attendant and helper. He also used to help Sarada Devi in her chores.\n\nAt Dakshineswar Latu began a life of rigorous spiritual discipline under Ramakrishna's guidance, and also continued his service as his servant to him. His day began first seeing Ramakrishna and saluting him. As Latu had received no formal schooling, Ramakrishna hoped that he might acquire at least a rudimentary education, so he tried to teach him the Bengali alphabets himself. However, Latu's Bihari accent was different from that of a Bengali and he could not read even the first vowel correctly. Ramakrishna corrected him repeatedly with much amusement, and the experiment was later discontinued. According to Saradananda, Ramakrishna's monastic disciple Latu was seen \"praying and meditating the whole night and sleeping during the day. His life was a literal example of the teaching of the \"Gita\":'In that which is night to all beings, the man of self-control is awake; and where all beings are awake, there is night for the sage who sees (2.69).\"\n\nIn the middle of 1885 Ramakrishna's throat became sore, which later developed into throat cancer. To conveniently treat him, the devotees moved Ramakrishna from Dakshineswar to Shyampukur, in North Calcutta. Latu, being his personal attendant went with him. He later moved on with Ramakrishna to Cossipore on 11 December 1885. He took care of nursing Ramakrishna during his final days, reminiscing about which Latu said, \"Serving the Master was our worship. We didn't need any other spiritual disciplines.\" Latu received an ochre cloth and rosary from Ramakrishna. After Ramakrishna's death on 16 August 1886, Latu went on a pilgrimage visiting Vrindaban, Varanasi, Ayodhya with Sarada Devi, and other lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna.\n\nAfter Ramakrishna's passing away, Narendra (Vivekananda) and some of the other disciples established the first Ramakrishna monastery at Baranagore in an old dilapidated house. Here some of the disciples including Naren took their monastic vows and were engaged in the study of the scriptures, practicing meditation and austerity. Latu joined them later in 1887 and accepted the monastic vows. Vivekananda]gave him the monastic name Adbhutananda, meaning, \"He who finds bliss in the wonderful nature of the Atman.\" According to his brother monks, Adbhutananda lead a very austere life at the monastery practicing meditation and \"japa\". He led the life of a wandering monk around Calcutta area, unattached to people and places. Sometimes he stayed at the home of other householder devotees, but most often was found living simply on the bank of the Ganges. Sometimes he stayed at Alambazar Math and Belur Math.\nHe also went on several pilgrimages to North India with his brother disciples including Vivekananda. In 1903 he moved to the house of Balaram Bose, a householder devotee of Ramakrishna and stayed there till 1912. Here he was visited by people from different walks of life—judges, doctors, teachers, learned monks, and householders for spiritual instructions.\n\nIn October 1912 Adbhutananda left Balaram's hose for Varnasi, never to return again. Here he first stayed at Ramakrishna Advaita Ashrama and later at different locations. As was characteristic of him, he was so often absorbed in meditation that he rarely had fixed time for meals. In Varanasi he continued to teach and people visited him for spiritual instructions.\n\nDuring his last days, according to his devotees Adbhutananda seemed to be gradually withdrawing from the world. He spoke occasionally with people, and when he spoke it was generally of spiritual matters. As reported by this disciples, his body, which had once been remarkably strong, had been gradually weakened by age and years of intense spiritual disciplines and his indifference towards the physical world. During the last few years he suffered from diabetes and minor physical ailments. During the last year of his life he developed a blister on this leg, which developed into gangrene. He was visited by his brother disciples—Turiyananda and Saradananda. Eventually the gangrene worsened and the doctors operated several times on successive days, but were unsuccessful. Adbhutananda died in the holy city of Varnasi at 12:10 p.m on Saturday, 24 April 1920. Regarding his death, Turiyananda wrote in a letter to Josephine MacLeod, an American devotee of Vivekananda, \"He showed no signs of pain during his illness. But the wonder of all wonders was that after this death when his body was placed in a sitting position to conform with some of the funeral rites, we found him looking so beautiful, so serene, so full of peace and bliss. His face beamed with light and an intelligence unspeakable, as if he were taking leave from his friends for the last time with an exhortation of affectionate benediction.\"\n\nAdbhutananda, being illiterate, did not write any books; his teachings and sayings have been recorded by this disciples and devotees. Adbhutananda taught that \"the true being in man is ever free, ever pure, and remains ever untouched by good or evil. Good and evil have no absolute reality. They exist only so long as man identifies himself with the ego, the false self. When the ego is completely annihilated, man is freed from the false knowledge of duality or relativity--of good and evil.\" \nHis other teachings were,\n\n\n\n \n"}

For affirmations to be effective, it is said that they need to be present tense, positive, personal and specific.\n\nThe New Thought movement is not part of New Age but does share certain practices. This concept has grown popular due to Rhonda Byrne's \"The Secret\" (also a 2006 film) These books and teachers express similar ideas to Napoleon Hill's book \"Think and Grow Rich\". Byrne was inspired in particular by Wallace D. Wattles' 1910 book \"The Science of Getting Rich\". Affirmations are also referred to in Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), Neuro Associative Conditioning \"NAC\" as popularized by Anthony Robbins, and hypnosis.\n\nA related belief is that a certain critical mass of people with a highly spiritual consciousness will bring about a sudden change in the whole population. And that humans have a responsibility to take part in positive creative activity and to work to heal ourselves, each other and the Earth.\n\nIn 1984 Louise Hay a Religious Science Practitioner published \"You Can Heal Your Life\", a guide to changing thoughts and beliefs. Hay's affirmations are designed to help the user re-program their thought patterns, the intention being that harmful underlying beliefs which Hay believes psychologically support illness will be replaced with healing beliefs, and thus remove a barrier to healing.\n\nEsther Hicks, author of the \"Law of Attraction\" series, advocates using affirmations when one is already in a state of happiness and peace.\n\nNew-Age affirmations come in different forms:\n\n\nProponents of New-Age affirmations say that with our thoughts, desires and emotions, we create our world.\n\nAccording to Brendan Baker, founder of The Start of Happiness, affirmations work best when they encompass three elements:\n\n\nAccording to Rhonda Britten, affirmations work best when combined with acknowledgements because the acknowledgements build up a backlog of results in one's mind to prove that one can do what one is affirming. For example, the acknowledgement \"I bought a good pair of sneakers and some gym clothes\" could complement the affirmation \"I can reach my goal of losing 20 pounds.\" The goal is to focus on steps one has taken toward accomplishing one's goals rather than criticizing oneself for what one has not yet accomplished, or could theoretically have accomplished but did not.\n\nA 2009 study found that positive affirmation had a small, positive effect on people with high self-esteem, but a detrimental effect on those with low self esteem. Individuals with low self-esteem who made positive affirmations felt worse than individuals who made positive statements but were allowed to consider ways in which the statements were false.\n\nSome studies have found that self-affirmations, which involve writing about one's core values rather than repeating a positive self-statement, can improve performance under stress.\n\n"}

One of the other members of this circle was\nMarcel Minnaert, with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship.\n\nMac Leod studied mathematics and physics at Ghent University, where he obtained his doctorate in July 1914 by submitting a thesis on a problem in fluid mechanics (which appeared later as Mac Leod 1923). Immediately afterwards he travelled for holidays to Lapland in Sweden. There he learnt that the German army had invaded Belgium on 4 August 1914. He decided to stay in Sweden. He got a job in the large mathematical library of Gösta Mittag-Leffler in Djursholm near Stockholm. He also attended the seminars of the philosopher Adolph Phalén at Uppsala University. He was deeply impressed by Phalén's work.\n\nIn 1921 Mac Leod returned to Belgium, where he became a high school teacher in mathematics and physics, first in Diest and later in Ghent. In 1922 he married with Gunhild Sahlén, whom he had met during his stay in Sweden. In that year also his first book appeared, an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry (Mac Leod 1922).

There was no one there to meet the challenge so they stopped beating the wood-block.\n\nHowever, in the north there was an elder bhikṣu named Pārśva at the time, who saw that if he could convert this ascetic, it would be a great asset to the propagation of the Dharma, so he travelled from northern India and had the wood-block sounded.\n\nThe ascetic came to ask why it had been sounded. Though thinking the old monk would be unable to debate with him, he accepted the challenge. After seven days, the debate was held in front of the King, his Ministers, and many ascetics and brahmans. The loser agreed to become the disciple of the other.\n\nThey agreed that the elder Pārśva should speak first, and he said: \"The world should be made peaceable, with a long-lived king, plentiful harvests, and joy throughout the land, with none of the myriad calamities\", to which the ascetic had no response and so was bound to become Pārśva's disciple, and he was given full ordination as a bhikṣu.\n\nAlthough he had to consent to this, he still was not convinced of the elder's virtues until he showed him he had mastered the Bases of Spiritual Power (r̥ddhipādāḥ), at which point he gained faith. Pārśva then taught him the 5 Faculties, the 5 Powers, the 7 Factors and the 8-fold Noble Path, and he eventually mastered the teaching.\n\nLater, the central kingdom was besieged by the Kuṣāna King's army, who demanded 300,000 gold pieces in tribute. The King could not pay so much, as he had only 100,000. The Kuṣāna King therefore asked for the Buddha's begging bowl, the converted monk, and the 100,000 gold pieces for his tribute.\n\nAlthough the King of the central kingdom was unhappy, the monk persuaded him it would be for the good of the propagation of the Dharma which would spread across the four continents if he went with the Kuṣāna King. He was therefore taken away.\n\nThe Kuṣāna's King's Ministers, however, were unhappy, not thinking that the bhikṣu was priced correctly at 100,000 gold pieces. The King, who knew the worth of bhiksu, ordered that seven horses be starved for six days. The King then made an assembly and had the bhikṣu preach the Dharma.\n\nEven the horses, whose favourite food was placed in front of them, were entranced by the Teaching of the monk, and listened intently. Everybody was thereby convinced of his worth. He was then granted the name Aśvaghoṣa, Horse-Cry.\n\nHe travelled throughout northern India proclaiming the Dharma and guiding all through his wisdom and understanding, and he was held in great regard by the four-fold assembly, who knew him as The Sun of Merit and Virtue.\n\nHe was previously believed to have been the author of the influential Buddhist text \"Awakening of Mahayana Faith\", but modern scholars agree that the text was composed in China. And it is now believed he was not from the Mahayanist period, and seems to have been ordained into a subsect of the Mahasanghikas. Some recent research into his kavya poems have revealed that he may have used the Yogacarabhumi as a textual reference, particularly for the Saundarananda, which opens up the possibility he was affiliated with either the Yogacara or the Sautrantika school.\n\nHe wrote an epic life of the Buddha called \"Buddhacharita\" (Acts of the Buddha) in Sanskrit. The monk I-tsing (Yijing) mentioned that in his time \"Buddhacarita\" was \"...extensively read in all the five parts of India and in the countries of the South Sea (Sumātra, Jāva and the neighbouring islands). He clothed manifold notions and ideas in a few words which so delighted the heart of his reader that he never wearied of perusing the poem. Moreover it was regarded as a virtue to read it in as much as it contained the noble doctrine in a neat compact form.\"\n\nIt described in 28 chapters the whole Life of the Buddha from his birth until his entry into Parinirvāna. During the Muslim invasions of the 10th – 12th centuries, half of the original Sanskrit text was lost. Today, the second half only exists in Chinese and Tibetan translations.\n\nHe also wrote \"Sundarananda\", a kāvya poem with the theme of conversion of Nanda, Buddha's half-brother, so that he might reach salvation. The first half of the work describes Nanda's life, and the second half of the work describes Buddhist doctrines and ascetic practices.\n\nHe is also thought to be the author of the \"Sutralankara.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4251", "title": "Bahá'í Faith", "text": "Bahá'í Faith\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith (; \"\") is a religion teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity and equality of all people. Established by Bahá'u'lláh in 1863, it initially grew in Iran and parts of the Middle East, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. Currently it has between 5 and 7 million adherents, known as Bahá'ís, spread out into most of the world's countries and territories.\n\nIt grew from the mid-19th-century Bábí religion, whose founder taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Akka in Ottoman Palestine. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son `Abdu'l-Bahá (1844–1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897–1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in Haifa, Israel, near the Shrine of the Báb.\n\nBahá'í teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths: God is considered single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings is the goal of a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.\n\nLetters written by Bahá'u'lláh to various individuals, including some heads of state, have been collected and assembled into a canon of Bahá'í scripture that includes works by his son `Abdu'l-Bahá, and also the Báb, who is regarded as Bahá'u'lláh's forerunner. Prominent among Bahá'í literature are the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\", \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\", \"Some Answered Questions\", and \"The Dawn-Breakers\".\n\nIn English-language use, the word \"Bahá'í \" is used either as an adjective to refer to the Bahá'í Faith or as a term for a follower of Bahá'u'lláh. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole. It is derived from the Arabic (), meaning \"glory\" or \"splendor\", although the word \"Bahá'í\" is actually Persian from the Arabic root (the suffix is Persian). The term \"Bahaism\" (or \"Baha'ism\") is still used, mainly in a pejorative sense.\n\nThree core principles establish a basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the unity of God, the unity of religion, and the unity of humanity. From these concepts stem the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.\n\nThe Bahá'í writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe. The existence of God and the universe is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.\n\nBahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.\n\nBahá'í notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each \"manifestation\" brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.\n\nBahá'í beliefs are sometimes described as syncretic combinations of earlier religious beliefs. Bahá'ís, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own scriptures, teachings, laws, and history. While the religion was initially seen as a sect of Islam, most religious specialists now see it as an independent religion, with its religious background in Shi'a Islam being seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established. Muslim institutions and clergy, both Sunni and Shia, consider Bahá'ís to be deserters or apostates from Islam, which has led to Bahá'ís being persecuted. Bahá'ís describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to the modern context. Bahá'u'lláh is believed to have fulfilled the messianic expectations of these precursor faiths.\n\nThe Bahá'í writings state that human beings have a \"rational soul\", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's status and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through his messengers, and to conform to their teachings. Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.\n\nThe Bahá'í writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.\n\nShoghi Effendi, the head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" constitute the bedrock of the Bahá'í Faith:\n\nThe following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Bahá'í teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by `Abdu'l-Bahá during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912. The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.\n\nWith specific regard to the pursuit of world peace, Bahá'u'lláh prescribed a world-embracing collective security arrangement for the establishment of a temporary era of peace referred to in the Baha'i teachings as the Lesser Peace. For the establishment of a lasting peace (The Most Great Peace) and the purging of the \"overwhelming Corruptions\" it is necessary that all the people of the world universally unite under a universal Faith.\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings speak of a \"Greater Covenant\", being universal and endless, and a \"Lesser Covenant\", being unique to each religious dispensation. The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bahá'í writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward. The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humanity, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.\nWith unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an administration they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any Bahá'í divisions have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following. The followers of such divisions are regarded as Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially excommunicated.\n\nThe \"canonical texts\" are the writings of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the \"Most Holy Book\", which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the \"Book of Certitude\", which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.\n\nAlthough the Bahá'í teachings have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical. \"The Seven Valleys\" is considered Bahá'u'lláh's \"greatest mystical composition.\" It was written to a follower of Sufism, in the style of `Attar, the Persian Muslim poet, and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bahá'u'lláh to the West. \"The Hidden Words\" is another book written by Bahá'u'lláh during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Bahá'u'lláh claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith formed from the Persian religion of the Báb, a merchant who began preaching a new interpretation of Shia Islam in 1844. The Báb's claim to divine revelation was rejected by the generality of Islamic clergy in Iran, ending in his public execution by authorities in 1850. The Báb taught that God would soon send a new messenger, and Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh to be that person. Although they are distinct movements, the Báb is so interwoven into Bahá'í theology and history that Bahá'ís celebrate his birth, death, and declaration as holy days, consider him one of their three central figures (along with Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá), and a historical account of the Bábí movement (\"The Dawn-Breakers\") is considered one of three books that every Bahá'í should \"master\" and read \"over and over again\".\n\nThe Bahá'í community was mostly confined to the Persian and Ottoman empires until after the death of Bahá'u'lláh in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa. Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense persecution. After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.\n\nOn the evening of 22 May 1844, Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad of Shiraz gained his first convert and took on the title of \"the Báb\" ( \"the Gate\"), referring to his later claim to the status of Mahdi of Shi`a Islam. His followers were therefore known as Bábís. As the Báb's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, his followers came under increased persecution and torture. The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the Shah's army. The Báb himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.\n\nBahá'ís see the Báb as the forerunner of the Bahá'í Faith, because the Báb's writings introduced the concept of \"He whom God shall make manifest\", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá'ís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be in 1863. The Báb's tomb, located in Haifa, Israel, is an important place of pilgrimage for Bahá'ís. The remains of the Báb were brought secretly from Iran to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them in a spot specifically designated by Bahá'u'lláh. The main written works translated into English of the Báb's are collected in Selections from the Writings of the Báb out of the estimated 135 works.\n\nMírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí was one of the early followers of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852–53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the Shah. Although they acted alone, the government responded with collective punishment, killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the Maid of Heaven.\n\nShortly thereafter he was expelled from Tehran to Baghdad, in the Ottoman Empire; then to Constantinople (now Istanbul); and then to Adrianople (now Edirne). In 1863, at the time of his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and Subh-i-Azal, the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bahá'u'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Bahá'ís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, and Queen Victoria.\n\nHe produced over 18,000 works in his lifetime, in both Arabic and Persian, of which only 8% have been translated into English.\n\nBahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan Abdülâziz a final time in 1868 to the Ottoman penal colony of `Akká, in present-day Israel. Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city. He died there in 1892. Bahá'ís regard his resting place at Bahjí as the Qiblih to which they turn in prayer each day.\n\n`Abbás Effendi was Bahá'u'lláh's eldest son, known by the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá). His father left a Will that appointed `Abdu'l-Bahá as the leader of the Bahá'í community, and designated him as the \"Centre of the Covenant\", \"Head of the Faith\", and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings. `Abdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until `Abdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. Following his release he led a life of travelling, speaking, teaching, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nThere are over 27,000 extant documents by `Abdu'l-Bahá, mostly letters, of which only a fraction have been translated into English. Among the more well known are \"The Secret of Divine Civilization\", the \"Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel\", and \"Some Answered Questions\". Additionally notes taken of a number of his talks were published in various volumes like \"Paris Talks\" during his journeys to the West.\n\nBahá'u'lláh's \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" and \"The Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá\" are foundational documents of the Bahá'í administrative order. Bahá'u'lláh established the elected Universal House of Justice, and `Abdu'l-Bahá established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions. In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bahá appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, serving as head of the religion until his death, for 36 years.\n\nShoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated Bahá'í texts; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bahá'í community; developed the Bahá'í World Centre; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice. He died in 1957 under conditions that did not allow for a successor to be appointed.\n\nAt local, regional, and national levels, Bahá'ís elect members to nine-person Spiritual Assemblies, which run the affairs of the religion. There are also appointed individuals working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do not serve as clergy, which the Bahá'í Faith does not have. The Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, remains the successor and supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies. Any male Bahá'í, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bahá'ís.\n\nIn 1937, Shoghi Effendi launched a seven-year plan for the Bahá'ís of North America, followed by another in 1946. In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the Ten Year World Crusade. This plan included extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of Bahá'í texts into several new languages, and the sending of Bahá'í pioneers into previously unreached nations. He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.\n\nAnnually, on 21 April, the Universal House of Justice sends a ‘Ridván’ message to the worldwide Bahá’í community, which generally gives an update on the progress made concerning the current plan, and provides further guidance for the year to come. The Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through children's classes, youth groups, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion known as study circles. Further focuses are involvement in social action and participation in the prevalent discourses of society. The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá.\n\nA Bahá'í published document reported 4.74 million Bahá'ís in 1986 growing at a rate of 4.4%. Bahá'í sources since 1991 usually estimate the worldwide Bahá'í population to be above 5 million. The \"World Christian Encyclopedia\" estimated 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries, and 7.3 million in 2010 with the same source. They further state: \"The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha’i was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region.\" This source's only systematic flaw was to consistently have a higher estimate of Christians than other cross-national data sets.\n\nFrom its origins in the Persian and Ottoman Empires, by the early 20th century there were a number of converts in South and South East Asia, Europe, and North America. During the 1950s and 1960s, vast travel teaching efforts brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world. By the 1990s, Bahá'ís were developing programs for systematic consolidation on a large scale, and the early 21st century saw large influxes of new adherents around the world.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith is currently the largest religious minority in Iran, Panama, Belize, and South Carolina; the second largest international religion in Bolivia, Zambia, and Papua New Guinea; and the third largest international religion in Chad and Kenya..\n\nAccording to \"The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004\":\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith is a medium-sized religion and was listed in \"The Britannica Book of the Year\" (1992–present) as the second most widespread of the world's independent religions in terms of the number of countries represented. According to \"Britannica\", the Bahá'í Faith (as of 2010) is established in 221 countries and territories and has an estimated seven million adherents worldwide. Additionally, Bahá'ís have self-organized in most of the nations of the world.\n\nThe Bahá'í religion was ranked by the Foreign Policy magazine as the world's second fastest growing religion by percentage (1.7%) in 2007.\n\nThe following are a few examples from Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are required or encouraged of his followers.\n\nThe following are a few examples from Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are prohibited or discouraged.\n\nWhile some of the laws from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are applicable at the present time, others are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society, such as the punishments for arson or murder. The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Bahá'í, and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.\n\nThe purpose of marriage in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity between a man and a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a \"fortress for well-being and salvation\" and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.\n\nBahá'ís intending to marry are asked to obtain a thorough understanding of the other's character before deciding to marry. Although parents should not choose partners for their children, once two individuals decide to marry, they must receive the consent of all living biological parents, whether they are Bahá'í or not. The Bahá'í marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by Bahá'u'lláh which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses. The vows are \"We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.\"\n\nBahá'u'lláh prohibited a mendicant and ascetic lifestyle. Monasticism is forbidden, and Bahá'ís are taught to practice spirituality while engaging in useful work. The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.\n\nMost Bahá'í meetings occur in individuals' homes, local Bahá'í centers, or rented facilities. Worldwide, there are currently ten Bahá'í Houses of Worship, eight Mother Temples and two local Houses of Worship and a further three planned as of April 2012. Bahá'í writings refer to an institution called a \"Mashriqu'l-Adhkár\" (Dawning-place of the Mention of God), which is to form the center of a complex of institutions including a hospital, university, and so on. The first ever Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in `Ishqábád, Turkmenistan, has been the most complete House of Worship.\n\nThe Bahá'í calendar is based upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five intercalary days, to make a full solar year. The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called Naw Rúz, and occurs on the vernal equinox, near 21 March, at the end of the month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.\n\nEach of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty). The Bahá'í week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God. Bahá'ís observe 11 Holy Days throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.\n\nThe symbols of the religion are derived from the Arabic word Bahá’ ( \"splendor\" or \"glory\"), with a numerical value of 9, which is why the most common symbol is the nine-pointed star. The ringstone symbol and calligraphy of the Greatest Name are also often encountered. The former consists of two five-pointed stars interspersed with a stylized Bahá’ whose shape is meant to recall the three onenesses, while the latter is a calligraphic rendering of the phrase Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá ( \"O Glory of the Most Glorious!\").The five-pointed star is the official symbol of the Bahá'í Faith, known as the \"Haykal\" (\"temple\"). It was initiated and established by the Báb and various works were written in calligraphy shaped into a five-pointed star.\n\nSince its inception the Bahá'í Faith has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.\n\nThe religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.\n\nCurrent initiatives of social action include activities in areas like health, sanitation, education, gender equality, arts and media, agriculture, and the environment. Educational projects include schools, which range from village tutorial schools to large secondary schools, and some universities. By 2017 there were an estimated 40,000 small scale projects, 1,400 sustained projects, and 135 Bahá'í inspired organizations.\n\nBahá'u'lláh wrote of the need for world government in this age of humanity's collective life. Because of this emphasis the international Bahá'í community has chosen to support efforts of improving international relations through organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations, with some reservations about the present structure and constitution of the UN. The Bahá'í International Community is an agency under the direction of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, and has consultative status with the following organizations:\n\nThe Bahá'í International Community has offices at the United Nations in New York and Geneva and representations to United Nations regional commissions and other offices in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Nairobi, Rome, Santiago, and Vienna. In recent years an Office of the Environment and an Office for the Advancement of Women were established as part of its United Nations Office. The Bahá'í Faith has also undertaken joint development programs with various other United Nations agencies. In the 2000 Millennium Forum of the United Nations a Bahá'í was invited as the only non-governmental speaker during the summit.\n\nBahá'ís continue to be persecuted in Islamic countries, as Islamic leaders do not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as an independent religion, but rather as apostasy from Islam. The most severe persecutions have occurred in Iran, where more than 200 Bahá'ís were executed between 1978 and 1998, and in Egypt. The rights of Bahá'ís have been restricted to greater or lesser extents in numerous other countries, including Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Morocco, Yemen, and several countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe marginalization of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions. Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed. Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.\n\nDuring the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to divert attention from economic difficulties in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís was instituted. An approved and coordinated anti-Bahá'í campaign (to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers. In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.\n\nSince the Islamic Revolution of 1979 Iranian Bahá'ís have regularly had their homes ransacked or have been banned from attending university or from holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs, most recently for participating in study circles. Bahá'í cemeteries have been desecrated and property has been seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of Mírzá Buzurg, Bahá'u'lláh's father. The House of the Báb in Shiraz, one of three sites to which Bahá'ís perform pilgrimage, has been destroyed twice.\nIn May 2018, the Iranian authorities expelled a young woman student from university of Isfahan because she was Bahá'í. In March 2018, two more Bahá'í students were expelled from universities in the cities of Zanjan and Gilan because of their religion. \n\nAccording to a US panel, attacks on Bahá'ís in Iran increased under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights revealed an October 2005 confidential letter from Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran ordering its members to identify Bahá'ís and to monitor their activities. Due to these actions, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on 20 March 2006, that she \"also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bahá'í faith, in violation of international standards. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.\n\nOn 14 May 2008, members of an informal body known as the \"Friends\" that oversaw the needs of the Bahá'í community in Iran were arrested and taken to Evin prison. The Friends court case has been postponed several times, but was finally underway on 12 January 2010. Other observers were not allowed in the court. Even the defence lawyers, who for two years have had minimal access to the defendants, had difficulty entering the courtroom. The chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said that it seems that the government has already predetermined the outcome of the case and is violating international human rights law. Further sessions were held on 7 February 2010, 12 April 2010 and 12 June 2010. On 11 August 2010 it became known that the court sentence was 20 years imprisonment for each of the seven prisoners which was later reduced to ten years. After the sentence, they were transferred to Gohardasht prison. In March 2011 the sentences were reinstated to the original 20 years. On 3 January 2010, Iranian authorities detained ten more members of the Baha'i minority, reportedly including Leva Khanjani, granddaughter of Jamaloddin Khanjani, one of seven Baha'i leaders jailed since 2008 and in February, they arrested his son, Niki Khanjani.\n\nThe Iranian government claims that the Bahá'í Faith is not a religion, but is instead a political organization, and hence refuses to recognize it as a minority religion. However, the government has never produced convincing evidence supporting its characterization of the Bahá'í community. Also, the government's statements that Bahá'ís who recanted their religion would have their rights restored, attest to the fact that Bahá'ís are persecuted solely for their religious affiliation. The Iranian government also accuses the Bahá'í Faith of being associated with Zionism because the Bahá'í World Centre is located in Haifa, Israel. These accusations against the Bahá'ís have no basis in historical fact, and the accusations are used by the Iranian government to use the Bahá'ís as \"scapegoats\". In fact it was the Iranian leader Naser al-Din Shah Qajar who banished Bahá'u'lláh from Persia to the Ottoman Empire and Bahá'u'lláh was later exiled by the Ottoman Sultan, at the behest of the Persian Shah, to territories further away from Iran and finally to Acre in Syria, which only a century later was incorporated into the state of Israel.\n\nBahá'í institutions and community activities have been illegal under Egyptian law since 1960. All Bahá'í community properties, including Bahá'í centers, libraries, and cemeteries, have been confiscated by the government and fatwas have been issued charging Bahá'ís with apostasy.\n\nThe Egyptian identification card controversy began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of identity documents, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions. The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1847412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847412", "title": "Christian meditation", "text": "Christian meditation\n\nChristian meditation is a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to become aware of and reflect upon the revelations of God. The word meditation comes from the Latin word \"meditārī\", which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study and to practice. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God. \n\nChristian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. Both in Eastern and Western Christianity meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.\n\nChristian meditation involves looking back on Jesus' life, thanksgiving and adoration of God for his action in sending Jesus for human salvation. In her book \"The Interior Castle\" (Mansions 6, Chapter 7) Saint Teresa of Avila defined Christian meditation as follows:\nBy meditation I mean prolonged reasoning with the understanding, in this way. We begin by thinking of the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son; and we do not stop there but proceed to consider the mysteries of His whole glorious life.\n\nQuoting the Gospel of Matthew: \"No one knows the Father but only the Son and anyone whom the Son wants to reveal him\" and I Corinthians: \"But we have received the Spirit who is from God so that we may realize what God has freely given us\", theologian Hans von Balthasar explained the context of Christian meditation as follows:\nThe dimensions of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking out of his own, and speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing the depths of man... And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, so we may join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.\nBuilding on that theme, E. P. Clowney explained that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice. The first is that Christian meditation is grounded in the Bible. Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use mantras. The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the \"love of\" God, as in I John : \"We love, for he first loved us\". The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation. The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible and the love of God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in \"praise\".\n\nThomas Merton characterized the goal of Christian meditation as follows: \"The true end of Christian meditation is practically the same as the end of liturgical prayer and the reception of the sacraments: a deeper union by grace and charity with the Incarnate Word, who is the only Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ.\" While Protestants view salvation in terms of \"faith and grace alone\" (i.e. sola fide and sola gratia) both Western and Eastern Christians see a role for meditation on the path to salvation and redemption. Apostle Paul stated in Epistle to the Romans that salvation only comes from \"God that hath mercy\". The path to salvation in Christian meditation is not one of give and take, and the aim of meditation is to bring joy to the heart of God. The Word of God directs meditations to show the two aspects of love that please God: obedience and adoration. The initiative in Christian salvation is with God, and one does not meditate or love God to gain his favor.\n\nIn Western Christian teachings, meditation is usually believed to involve the inherent action of the Holy Spirit to help the meditating Christian understand the deeper meanings of the Word of God. In the 12th century, decades before Guigo II's the \"Ladder of the Monk\", one of his predecessors, Guigo I, emphasized this belief by stating that when earnest meditation begins, the Holy Spirit enters the soul of the meditator, \"turns water into wine\" and shows the path towards contemplation and a better understanding of God.\n\nIn the 19th century, Charles Spurgeon affirmed this belief within the Protestant tradition and wrote: \"The Spirit has taught us in meditation to ponder its message, to put aside, if we will, the responsibility of preparing the message we've got to give. Just trust God for that.\" In the 20th century, Hans Urs von Balthasar paraphrased this teaching as follows:\nThe vistas of God's Word unfold to the meditating Christian solely through the gift of the Divine Spirit. How could we understand what is within God and is disclosed to us except through the Spirit of God who is communicated to us? \nAs a biblical basis for this teaching, von Balthasar referred to : \"these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God\".:\n\nChristian meditation is different from the style of meditations performed in Eastern religions (such as Buddhism) or in the context of the New Age. While other types of meditation may suggest approaches to disengage the mind, Christian meditation aims to fill the mind with thoughts related to Biblical passages or Christian devotions. Although some mystics in both the Western and Eastern churches have associated feelings of ecstasy with meditation, (e.g. St. Teresa of Avila's legendary meditative ecstasy), St. Gregory of Sinai, one of the originators of Hesychasm, stated that the goal of Christian meditation is \"seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, beyond the minor phenomenon of ecstasy\".\n\nModern Christian teachings on meditation at times include specific criticism of the transcendental styles of meditation, e.g. John Bertram Phillips stated that Christian meditation involves the action of the Holy Spirit on Biblical passages and warned of approaches that \"disengage the mind\" from scripture. According to Edmund P. Clowney, Christian meditation contrasts with cosmic styles of oriental meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with discussions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings. Unlike eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations are intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. According to Clowney it is the search for wisdom, not ecstasy, that marks the path of Christian meditation, a wisdom sought in the \"Christ of Scripture and the Scripture of Christ\".\n\nA 1989 document generally known as \"Aspects of Christian meditation\" set forth the position of the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a \"flight from the self\", can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.\n\nIn the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: \"hāgâ\" (), which means \"to sigh\" or \"murmur\", but also \"to meditate\", and \"sîḥâ\" (), which means \"to muse\", or \"rehearse in one's mind\". When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, \"hāgâ\" became the Greek \"melete\" which emphasized meditation's movement in the depth of the human heart. \"Melete\" was a reminder that one should never let meditation be a formality. The Latin Bible then translated \"hāgâ\"/\"melete\" into \"meditatio\".\n\nThe Bible mentions \"meditate\" or \"meditation\" 23 times, 19 times in the Book of Psalms alone . When the Bible mentions meditation, it often mentions obedience in the next breath. An example is the Book of Joshua: \"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success..\"\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the monastic traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.\nThe progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk who died late in the 12th century. Guigo II's book \"The Ladder of Monks\" is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition. \n\nIn Eastern Christianity, the monastic traditions of \"constant prayer\" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and Evagrius Pontikos established the practice of hesychasm and influenced John Climacus' book \"The Ladder of Divine Ascent\" by the 7th century. These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century.\n\nThe methods of \"methodical prayer\" as taught by the \"Devotio Moderna\" group in northern Europe had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century. The book \"The Imitation of Christ\" which was known in Spain as \"Contemptus mundi\" became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied. Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, John of the Cross continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the 4 stages of Lectio Divina. By the 19th century the importance of Biblical meditation had also been firmly established in the Protestant spiritual tradition.\n\nDuring the 18th and early 19th centuries, some components of meditation had started to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity. However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.\n\nIn 1965, one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution \"Dei verbum\" (Latin for \"Word of God\"), emphasized the use of Lectio divina and on the 40th anniversary of \"Dei verbum\" in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.\n\nA number of saints and historical figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings have emphasized the use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The \"Spiritual Exercises\" of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, with the goal of knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues to be used in the Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.\n\nThe \"Spiritual Exercises\" of St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556), the founder of the Jesuits, contain numerous meditative exercises. To this day, the Spiritual Exercises remain an integral part of the Novitiate training period of the Roman Catholic religious order of Jesuits.\n\nThe exercises are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through an experience of Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with a consideration of the purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.\n\nThe exercises often involve imagery in which one enters a biblical scene. For example, the practitioner is encouraged to visualize and meditate upon scenes from the life of Christ, at times asking questions from Christ on the cross, during crucifixion.\n\nSt. Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582) a Doctor of the Church, practiced contemplative prayer for periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa believed that no one who was faithful to the practice of meditation could possibly lose his soul. Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.\n\nSt. Teresa taught her nuns to meditate on specific prayers. Her prayers described in\n\"The Way of Perfection\" involve meditation on a mystery in the life of Jesus and are based on the faith that \"God is within\", a truth that Teresa said she learned from St. Augustine.\n\nIn her \"Life\", she wrote that she taught herself from the instructions given in the book, \"The Third Spiritual Alphabet\" - by Francisco de Osuna - which relates to Franciscan mysticism. Her starting point was the practice of \"recollection\", i.e. keeping the senses and the intellect in check and not allowing them to stray. In her meditations, one generally restricts attention to a single subject, principally the love of God. In \"The Way of Perfection\" she wrote: \"It is called recollection because the soul collects together all the faculties and enters within itself to be with God\". She would use devices such as short readings, a scene of natural beauty or a religious statue or picture to remind her to keep her focus. She wrote that in due course, the mind naturally learns to maintain focus on God almost effortlessly.\n\nSt. Theresa viewed Christian meditation as the first of four steps in achieving \"union with God\", and used the analogy of watering the garden. She compared basic meditation to watering a garden with a bucket, \"Recollection\" to the water wheel, \"Quiet\" (contemplation) to a spring of water and \"Union\" to drenching rain.\n\nSaint Francis de Sales (1576–1622) used a four-part approach to Christian meditation based on \"\"preparation\", \"consideration\", \"affections and resolutions\" and \"conclusions\"\":\n\nSaint Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) said that meditation is necessary for devotion, and the Second Vatican Council called for \"faithful meditation on God's word\" as part of the spiritual formation of seminarians.\n\nSaint John of the Cross (1542–1591), a close friend of St. Teresa of Avila, viewed Christian meditation as a necessary step toward union with God, and wrote that even the most spiritually advanced persons always needed to regularly return to meditation.\n\nSaint Padre Pio (1887–1968), who was devoted to rosary meditations, said:\n\"The person who meditates and turns his mind to God, who is the mirror of his soul, seeks to know his faults, tries to correct them, moderates his impulses, and puts his conscience in order.\"\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church encourages meditation as a form of prayer: \"Meditation is above all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking\" (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707). Emphasizing \"union with God\", it states: \"Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him\" (#2708). Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724).\n\nChristian meditation performed along with Eucharistic adoration outside of Mass has been associated with a large amount of Catholic writings and inspirations specially since the 18th century. The \"Eucharistic meditations\" of the two Saints Pierre Julien Eymard and Jean Vianney (both promoters of the Eucharist) were published as books.\n\nSaint Thérèse of Lisieux was devoted to Eucharistic meditation and on February 26, 1895 shortly before she died wrote from memory and without a rough draft her poetic masterpiece \"To Live by Love\" which had composed during Eucharistic meditation.\n\nSignificant portions of the writings of the Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida were reported as having been based on her adorations of the Blessed Sacrament. Similarly, in her book \"Eucharist: true jewel of eucharistic spirituality\" Maria Candida of the Eucharist (who was beatified by Pope John Paul II) wrote about her own personal experiences and reflections on eucharistic meditation.\n\nMeditation is an integral part of the rosary. This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book \"Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine\" (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.\n\nSaint Teresa of Avila's meditative approach of focusing on \"the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son\" can be viewed as the basis of most scriptural rosary meditations. In his 2002 encyclical \"Rosarium Virginis Mariae\", Pope John Paul II placed the rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality. Emphasizing that the final goal of Christian life is to be transformed, or \"transfigured\", into Christ he stated that the rosary helps believers come closer to Christ by contemplating Christ. He stated that the rosary unites us with Mary's own prayer, who, in the presence of God, prays with us and for us. and stated that: \"To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ.\"\n\nDuring the Byzantine Empire, between the 10th and 14th centuries, a tradition of prayer called hesychasm developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and continues to the present. St. Gregory of Sinai is considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer. This tradition uses a special posture and breathing rituals, accompanied by the repetition of a short prayer (traditionally the 'Jesus Prayer') giving rise to suggestions that it may have been influenced by Indian approaches. \"While some might compare it [\"hesychastic prayer\"] with a mantra, to use the Jesus Prayer in such a fashion is to violate its purpose. One is never to treat it as a string of syllables for which the 'surface' meaning is secondary. Likewise, hollow repetition is considered to be worthless (or even spiritually damaging) in the hesychast tradition.\" Rather, it is to be in the spirit of a true mantra. This style of prayer was at first opposed as heretical by Barlam in Calabria, but was defended by Saint Gregory Palamas. Coming from \"hesychia\" (\"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\"), hesychasm continues to be practiced in the Eastern Orthodox Church and some other Eastern Churches of the Byzantine Rite. Hesychasm has not gained significance in the Western churches.\n\nIn hesychasm, the Jesus prayer, consisting of the phrase: \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me\" is repeated either for a set period of time or a set number of times. Hesychasm is contrasted with the more mental or imaginative forms of Christian meditation in which a person is encouraged to imagine or think of events from the life of Jesus or sayings from the Gospel. Sometimes hesychasm has been compared to the meditative techniques of oriental religions and it is possible that there were interactions between Hesychasts and Sufis, but this has not been proven.\n\nJohn Main OSB (1926–1982) was a Benedictine monk and priest who presented a way of Christian meditation which used a prayer-phrase or mantra. This approach was then used by groups which then become the World Community for Christian Meditation.\n\n\n"}

Although nothing (outside a formal system) can be completely defined, the clarity test allows the decision participants to determine whether such elements as variables, events, outcomes, and alternatives are sufficiently well defined to make the decision at hand. In general, a model element is well defined if a knowledgeable individual can answer questions about the model element without asking further clarifying questions.\n\nMore precisely, Howard defines the clarity test by saying that a quantity or event is clearly defined—it passes the clarity test—if a \"clairvoyant would be able to say whether or not the event in question occurred or, in the case of a variable, the value of the variable.\" Howard defines the clairvoyant as \"a person who knew the future, who had access to all future newspapers, readings of physical devices, or any other determinable quantity.\" In later teaching Howard more broadly defined the clairvoyant as a person with perfect knowledge of all events and measurable quantities, past present and future, but no judgment.\n\nThe concept of the clairvoyant is useful in decision analysis for ensuring clarity of thought, particularly when assessing uncertainty.\n\nThe wizard is another mythical character who can change the future, usually for a fee, provided he or she is given a well-defined request.

{"id": "2214599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214599", "title": "Direct reference theory", "text": "Direct reference theory\n\nA direct reference theory (also called referentialism or referential realism) is a theory of language that claims that the meaning of a word or expression lies in what it points out in the world. The object denoted by a word is called its referent. Criticisms of this position are often associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nIn the 19th century, mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege argued against it, and contrasted it with mediated reference theory. In 1953, with his \"Philosophical Investigations\", Wittgenstein argued against referentialism, famously saying that \"the meaning of a word is its use.\" Direct reference theory is a position typically associated with logical positivism and analytical philosophy. Logical positivist philosophers in particular have significantly devoted their efforts in countering positions of the like of Wittgenstein's, and they aim at creating a \"perfectly descriptive language\" purified from ambiguities and confusions.\n\nThe philosopher John Stuart Mill was one of the earliest modern advocates of a direct reference theory beginning in 1843. In his \"A System of Logic\" Mill introduced a distinction between what he called \"connotation\" and \"denotation.\" Connotation is a relation between a name (singular or general) and one or more attributes. For example, ‘widow’ denotes widows and connotes the attributes of being female, and of having been married to someone now dead. If a name is connotative, it denotes what it denotes in virtue of object or objects having the attributes the name connotes. Connotation thus determines denotation. The same object can, on the other hand, be denoted with several names with different connotations. A name can have connotation but no denotation. Connotation of a name, if it has one, can be taken to be its meaning in Mill.\n\nAccording to Mill, most individual concrete names are connotative, but some, namely proper names, are not. In other words, proper names do not have meaning. All general terms, on the other hand, are according to Mill connotative. In sum, Mill’s overall picture resembles very much the description theory of reference, though his take on proper names is an exception.\n\nSaul Kripke, a proponent of direct reference theory, in his \"Naming and Necessity\" dubbed mediated reference theory the \"Frege–Russell view\" and criticized it (see below). Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that Bertrand Russell's views on reference theory were the same as Gottlob Frege's, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.\n\nSaul Kripke defended direct reference theory when applied to proper names. Kripke claims that proper names do not have any \"senses\" at all, because senses only offer contingent facts about things. Ruth Barcan Marcus advanced a theory of direct reference for proper names at a symposium in which Quine and Kripke were participants: published in \"Synthese\", 1961 with Discussion in \"Synthese\" 1962. She called directly referring proper names \"tags\" (see tag theory of names). Kripke urged such a theory in 1971 and thereafter. He called such directly referring proper names \"rigid designators\".\n\nKripke articulated this view using the formal apparatus of possible worlds. The possible worlds thought-experiment first takes the subject, and then tries to imagine the subject in other possible worlds. Taking George W. Bush, for example. First (1) the thought-experiment must state that the name \"George W. Bush\" is the name used to describe the particular individual man that is typically meant. Then (2), the experimenter must imagine the possible states of affairs that reality could have been - where Bush was not president, or went into a different career, was never born at all, etc. When this is done, it becomes obvious that the phrase \"President of the United States in 2004\" does not necessarily describe George W. Bush, because it is not necessarily true in all possible worlds; it only contingently describes him. By contrast, for instance, the word \"apple\" will always describe the same things across all possible worlds, because of premise (1). So use of the word \"apple\" to describe apples is true in all possible worlds.\n\nTerms that are true across all possible worlds in this way are called \"rigid designators\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3817992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3817992", "title": "Giving circle", "text": "Giving circle\n\nA giving circle is a form of participatory philanthropy where groups of individuals donate their own money or time to a pooled fund, decide together where to give these away to charity or community projects and, in doing so, seek to increase their awareness of and engagement in the issues covered by the charity or community project. Many circles, in addition to donating their money, also contribute their time and skills to support local causes.\n\nThe current manifestation of giving circles is a relatively new trend, but it is built on traditions dating back hundreds of years to mutual aid societies and other forms of giving for the community. In the United States, giving circles were initially composed of women; they are now more diverse in race, age and gender, although women continue to make up the majority of members.\n\nThe structure of the circles can be informal or formal. On the informal side, circles may vote and choose an organization to support and each member writes an individual check. Formal circles may have their money housed at a local community foundation and have staff that support the work of the circle. Giving circles can range in size from a handful of members to several hundred.\n\nIndividual donors who join or form a giving circle typically seek to build community within their circle through social events, in addition to the economic impacts of the groups.\n\nIn a 2007 study, the Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers' New Ventures in Philanthropy initiative identified approximately 400 giving circles in the United States, more than double the number from two years earlier.\n\nA survey of 160 circles, published in 2008, found they had leveraged nearly $100 million, $13 million of this in 2006 alone. Nearly 12,000 people took part in the 160 giving circles surveyed. Nearly half of circles have male participants, and the popularity of giving circles is also growing among racial, ethnic and tribal communities as well as in the gay and lesbian community.\n\nAnother study conducted in 2005 by Angela M. Eikenberry, an associate professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, found that giving circles generally bring both long-time and new philanthropists to organized philanthropy. For both groups, participation seems to increase levels of giving while bringing “new money” to the nonprofit sector; especially to small and locally based organizations. Members also seem to learn about and give to organizations and individuals, and in areas of interest, they most likely would not have given to otherwise. In addition, members are more thoughtful, focused and strategic in their personal giving because of educational experiences in the giving circle. These findings are based on 30 interviews with giving circle participants, staff, and philanthropic professionals working with giving circles, document analysis, and secondary data.\n\nResearch by Eikenberry and Jessica Bearman, published in 2009, and largely based on a survey of giving circle members compared to a control group, found that giving circles influence members to give more and to give more strategically. Their members give to a wide array of organizations and are highly engaged in the community. Giving circles increase members’ knowledge about philanthropy, nonprofits, and the community but have a mixed influence on members’ attitudes about philanthropy, nonprofit and government roles, and political/social abilities and values. Level of engagement, length of engagement, and size of the giving circle seem to matter most, when it comes to understanding giving circles’ effects on members.\n\nExamples of giving circles include the Zawadi giving circle in New Orleans, where 12 African American members collectively donated $24,000 over a two-year period. Their money has provided intensive math tutoring for students at a local school, along with other projects.\n\nThe Queer Youth Fund, established in 2002 and based in Los Angeles, California, has invested more than $3 million in grants to small youth-led organizations in the United States and Canada that promote equality and justice for lesbian, gay, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQQ) youth.\n\nFounded in 2004, The African American Giving Circle of the Washington Area Women's Foundation has awarded over $120,000 in grants to community-based organizations in Washington, D.C. serving African American women and girls.\n\nDining for Women (DFW) is a giving circle headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina with chapters in other parts of the United States, which raises monthly for international charities that support women and girls facing extreme challenges in developing countries.\n\nIn 2006, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy (AAPIP) established a giving circle movement that has resulted in the distribution of over $2.2 million to Asian American communities across the United States. Included in this growing network of giving circles are the Lunar Giving Circle in San Francisco, Asian Giving Circle in Chicago, Cherry Blossom Giving Circle in Washington, D.C., and GVNGTogether in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2016, the Asian Women Giving Circle (AWGC) was studied by a Capstone team from NYU's Wagner School of public service. The team members were Carlos Rodriguez, Janice Lam, David Portalatin, Nicole Moriarty, and Paulina Toro.\n\nAmplifier Giving (www.AmplifierGiving.org) is the first concerted effort to network Jewish giving circles, catalyze the creation of new giving circles, educate circle members on best practices in philanthropy, and create a platform to connect NGOs and Jewish giving circles to each other efficiently and effectively. The Amplifier network includes 50 giving circles and 369 organizations. The Amplifier website has a circle and organization directory, online common grant application system, and a resource library with information about how to start and sustain a giving circle.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported in 2013 that a giving circle, Women for Social Innovation, is providing seed money for social innovators helping women, girls and families in Greater Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2014, the Latino Community Foundation launched the first Latino Giving Circle Network in the United States. As of August 2016, there are over 220 members in this network, which focuses on investing in Latino-led organization in California.\n\nThe Kew Giving Circle in Kew, south west London, started meeting in January 1999 and is still active. It is the first recorded giving circle in the United Kingdom. Its members contribute to a pooled Charities Aid Foundation account and meet to agree payments from the account to their selected charities.\n\nThe Funding Network is the largest known and first open giving circle in the UK. It is a charity that runs \"Dragons' Den\"-style events to bring together potential donors and charities to fund positive social change. It has raised over £5 million for over 700 projects across the globe.\n\nThe number of giving circles in Asia is growing. The first study to describe and document Asian giving circles was published in 2013 by Dr Rob John at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.\n\n\n\n"}

Uribe, is particularly known for creating the term \"autopoiesis\" about the self-generating, self-maintaining structure in living systems, and concepts such as structural determinism and structure coupling. His work has been influential in many fields, mainly the field of systems thinking and cybernetics. Overall, his work is concerned with the biology of cognition.\n\nAfter completing secondary school at the Liceo Manuel de Salas in 1947, Maturana enrolled at the University of Chile, studying first medicine then biology. In 1954, he obtained a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation to study anatomy and neurophysiology at University College London. He obtained a PhD in biology from Harvard University in 1958.\n\nHe works in neuroscience at the University of Chile, in the research center \"Biología del Conocer\" (Biology of Knowing).

Maturana's work extends to philosophy and cognitive science and even to family therapy. He was early inspired by the work of the biologist Jakob von Uexküll.\n\nHis inspiration for his work in cognition came while he was a medical student and became seriously ill with tuberculosis. Confined in a sanatorium with very little to read, he spent time reflecting on his condition and the nature of life. What he came to realize was \"that what was peculiar to living systems was that they were discrete autonomous entities such that all the processes that they lived, they lived in reference to themselves ... whether a dog bites me or doesn't bite me, it is doing something that has to do with itself.\" This paradigm of autonomy formed the basis of his studies and work.\n\nMaturana and his student Francisco Varela were the first to define and employ the concept of autopoiesis. Aside from making important contributions to the field of evolution, Maturana is associated with an epistemology built upon empirical findings of neurobiology. Maturana and Varela wrote in their Santiago Theory of Cognition: \"\"Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition\". This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.\"\n\nMaturana influenced - and appears in coded form as a character in - the novel \"Replay\" by German author .\n\nThe initial ground-breaking paper which stands as a prelude to all that followed:\n\nBooks, a selection: \n\n\n\n"}

His first name is sometimes reported as \"Giacomo\".\n\nGiacopo (Jacopo) Mazzoni was born in Cesena, Italy in 1548. Educated in Bologna in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, rhetoric, and poetics, Mazzoni later attended the University of Padua in 1563 where he studied philosophy and jurisprudence.\n\nOne of the most eminent savants of the period, Mazzoni was reported to have an excellent memory, which made him adept at recalling passages from Dante, Lucretius, Virgil, and others in his regular debates with prominent public figures. It also allowed him to excel at memory contests, which he routinely won. He had the distinction, it is said, of thrice vanquishing the Admirable Crichton in dialectic.\n\nLater in life, Mazzoni would teach at universities in Rome, Paris, and Cesena, and was partly responsible for the establishment of the Della Crusca Academy.\n\nHe was an authority on ancient languages and philology, and gave a great impetus to the scientific study of the Italian language. Mazzoni died in Ferrara, Italy, in 1598.\n\nThough Mazzoni considered himself primarily a philosopher (Adams, 178), his major work of philosophy – an attempt to reconcile the theories of Plato and Aristotle called \"De Triplici Hominum Vita, Activa Nempe, Contemplativa, et Religiosa Methodi Tres\" (\"On the Three Ways of Man’s Life: the Active, the Contemplative, and the Religious\", published in 1576) – is not widely read. Mazzoni is most known for his work on literary criticism, particularly his defenses of Dante’s Divine Comedy, \"Discorso in Difesa Della Commedia Della Divino Poeta Dante\" (\"The Discourse in Defense of the Comedy of the Divine Poet Dante\"), published in 1572 and a second effort, \"Della Difesa Della Comedia Di Dante\" (\"On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante\"), which was not published until 1688.\n\nMazzoni was originally asked to write the defense by a noble friend who was distressed at criticism being leveled at the Divine Comedy by Castravilla. Mazzoni’s initial volume on the subject (In Defense of the Comedy of the Divine Poet Dante), which he claims was written in only 20 days, attracted criticism for its sometimes vague reasoning and its tendency, at times, to simply contradict, rather than refute, Dante’s detractors.\n\nIn response to criticisms that contemporaries such as Belisario Bulgarini leveled against his first effort, Mazzoni wrote the more extensive and more sophisticated On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante. In this work, before directly addressing Dante’s work, Mazzoni develops his theory of poetics, in which, drawing heavily from Plato and Aristotle, he discusses mimesis, the role of poetry, and the definition of poetry versus poetics (see Theory section, below). Though no complete English translation of Mazzoni’s text exists, excerpts from the Introduction and Summary have appeared in some anthologies, as well as in a partial translation by Robert L. Montgomery.\n\nOne of Mazzoni’s more interesting contributions to criticism is his discussion of mimesis in poetry. Mazzoni departs from his predecessors in that he conceives poetic imitation as not the recreation of an actual object, but of the recreation of an ideal. This idea, which has been compared to Baudrillard’s simulacrum, Mazzoni calls the “idol” – a concept constructed by human artifice to which poetic imitations are compared in order to determine their believability. Mazzoni discusses believability or credibility, rather than truth – he defines poetry as a sophistic activity, the purpose of which is not to recreate truth, but rather to mimic that which will have the proper effect on the audience. As Mazzoni says, “if it should happen that two things should appear before the poet, one of them false but credible and the other true but incredible or at least not very credible, then the poet must leave the true and follow the credible.”\n\nMazzoni resurrects the ancient tradition of linking poetry to rhetoric, which also has the credible, rather than the true, as its object. He also gives great importance to poetry’s effect on the audience as a determinant of quality – though he admits that much of the exercise of poetry involves attempting faithful imitation (albeit of human constructs or “categories”, not ones that are necessarily “true”), success in poetry is ultimately determined by persuasion, not truth and objectivity. For him, successful poetry is something that occurs in and of the audience, not outside and independent of it. For Mazzoni, even “poetry” is a meaningless category – it is our classifications that constitute criticism, not our ability to form a relationship with some reified thing called “The Poem”.\n\nLike Plato, Mazzoni was very concerned with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight in the perception of the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, this has to do with the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.\n\nMazzoni’s work is characterized by his methodical attempts to draw distinctions between similar phenomena. In proceeding along this course, he makes some compelling definitions and distinctions, such as that between poetry and poetics, the former being concerned with the formation of poetry (considerations for rhyme or meter for example) and the latter with a poem’s relationship to the “civil faculty.”\n\nThe distinction between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from Plato, is also important in Mazzoni’s work. Icastic imitation refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of a real person or the creation of a character based on a real person is icastic imitation. Phantastic imitation is the imitation of something completely the artist’s imagination. This distinction would play an important role in Mazzoni’s \"On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante\", in which he would argue that the work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic mimesis because it imitates something “real.” This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed \"Dante\"’s work as lacking in verisimilitude and even claimed that the comedy was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision. Under Mazzoni’s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially mimesis made “persuasive” by the use of craft or art.\n\nSome of Mazzoni’s influences are obvious, such as Plato and Aristotle. Mazzoni regularly makes direct reference to their works and draws some of his ideas directly from theories that they established (the distinction between icastic and phantastic imitation, for example, is drawn from Plato). The influence of other thinkers has also been identified in Mazzoni’s work, including neo-platonists such as Proclus and Greek sophists such as Dionysius of Helicarnassus and Aulus Gellius (the latter two particularly in Mazzoni's discussion on the impact of the character of the poet on the nature of the poem;).\n\nMazzoni influenced many theorists ranging from the romantics right up to the present day. In “emphasizing poetry’s relationship to images and games,” for example, Mazzoni informs romantic writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Friedrich von Schiller (Leitch, 301). His influence can also be seen in modern efforts to define the difference between poetic language and other types.\nDespite his influence, however, Mazzoni has been subject to some criticism. Some see, for example, a contradiction in trying to assign both pleasure and social utility to poetry at the same time, while others question his use of the distinction between icastic and phantastic mimesis (Leitch, 301).\n\n\n"}

Barton (born New York City, NY), is an American chemist. She worked as a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College (1980–82), and at Columbia University (1983–89) before joining the California Institute of Technology (1989-to the present). In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and in 2009, the Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor and Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.\n\nBarton studies the chemical and physical properties of DNA and their roles in biological activities. The primary focus of her research is transverse electron transport along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for materials sciences applications such as targeted chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 National Medal of Science and the 2015 Priestley Medal.\n\nJacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys' school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher. During her last year at Barnard she married Don Barton, receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.\n\nShe then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard. While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy. She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing \"The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex : the interaction of antitumor latinum drugs and matallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids\".\n\nAfter earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post-doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells. Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980–82, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group. While at Hunter she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers.\n\nIn the 1980s she moved to Columbia University, where she taught from 1983 to 1989. She became a full professor in 1986 and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia. Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With Nicholas Turro and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences. Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and \"turn off\" the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.\n\nIn 1989, Barton moved to Caltech, where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired. In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.\n\nThe research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy. Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.\n\nUnderstanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics. Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.\n\nBarton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women. Recognized as a \"superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists\", Barton advises others that \"the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science\". She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997. She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009.\n\nBarton has been a Member of the Board of Dow Chemical since 1993. She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989-2008) and recently became a member of Gilead's Board of Directors\n\nIn 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech, who is also a National Medal of Science winner. She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stepson Andrew.\n\nBarton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.\n\nBarton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, \"For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer.\" Other awards include:\n"}

With this background, he was able to attain his Bachelor of Arts at only 17 years of age, and at this time, translated the \"Handbook\" of Epictetus. At 19, he published his 1300-page \"Mémoire\" that, a year later in 1874, won a prize from the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences and helped to earn him a philosophy lectureship at the Lycée Condorcet. However, this was short-lived, as he soon began to suffer from pulmonary disease. Following the first attacks of his disease, he went to southern France where he wrote philosophical works and poetry. He remained there until his early death at 33 years of age.\n\nHis mother, (who married Fouillée after Guyau's birth), published \"Le Tour de France par deux enfants\" in 1877 under the pseudonym G. Bruno.\n\nGuyau's wife published short novels for young people under the pseudonym of Pierre Ulric.\n\nGuyau's works primarily analyze and respond to modern philosophy, especially moral philosophy. Largely seen as an Epicurean, he viewed English utilitarianism as a modern version of Epicureanism. Although an enthusiastic admirer of the works of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, he did not spare them a careful scrutiny of their approach to morality.\n\nIn his \"Esquisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction\", probably his most important work on moral theory, he begins from Fouillée, maintaining that utilitarian and positivist schools, despite admitting the presence of an unknowable in moral theory, wrongly expel individual hypotheses directed towards this unknowable. He states that any valid theory of ethics must consider the moral sphere as consisting not merely of moral facts (the utilitarian approach) but also, and more importantly, of moral ideas. On the other hand, in contrast to Fouillée, he does not see this unknowable itself as able to contribute a \"principle practically limiting and restricting conduct,\" i.e. of \"mere justice\" which, he states, comes too close to Kantian notions of duty; for this, in turn, would bring us back to a theory of moral obligation, which, as the title suggests, he wishes to free moral theory from. Much of his treatise is dedicated to arguing what moral theory can be based upon that relieves moral theorists from relying on e.g. duty, sanctions, and obligations. For example,\n\n\nGuyau also took interest in aesthetic theory, particularly its role in society and social evolution. Primarily, Guyau's theories of aesthetics refute Immanuel Kant's idea that aesthetic judgment is disinterested, and accordingly, partitioned off from the faculties of mind responsible for moral judgement. In \"Les Problèmes de l'esthétique contemporaine\", Guyau argues that beauty in fact activates all dimensions of the mind—the sensual, the intellectual, and the moral. Aesthetic sensations are fully integrated with life and morality. They are also the mark of man's self-actualization. Contrary to Herbert Spencer's theory that the development of the arts is an indicator of the decline of society at large, Guyau maintains that as society continues to evolve, life will become increasingly aesthetic. In \"L'Art au point de vue sociologique\", Guyau argues the purpose of art is not to merely produce pleasure, but to create sympathy among members of a society. By extension, he contends that art has the power to reform societies as well as to form them anew.\n\nThough Guyau is now a relatively obscure philosopher, his approach to philosophy earned him much praise from those who knew of him and his philosophy.\n\nHe is the original source of the notion of anomie, which found much use in the philosophy of Guyau's contemporary Émile Durkheim, who stumbled upon it in a review of \"Irréligion de l'avenir\". Petr Kropotkin devotes an entire chapter to Guyau in his \"\", describing Guyau's moral teaching as \"so carefully conceived, and expounded in so perfect a form, that it is a simple matter to convey its essence in a few words\", while the American philosopher Josiah Royce considered him as \"one of the most prominent of recent French philosophical critics.\"\n\n\n"}

Her research focuses on epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metacognition. She has also written on 17th century (Western) philosophy, including on John Locke and René Descartes.\n\nAfter a B.A. in Philosophy at the University of Toronto, Nagel earned her M.A. (1994) and Ph.D. (2000) in Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. Her dissertation, \"The Role of Necessity in Empirical Knowledge\", was written under the supervision of John McDowell.\n\nFrom July 2013 through June 2016, Nagel was associate chair of the University of Toronto's Department of Philosophy.\n\nIn September 2015, Nagel founded a group called Room for More, a Toronto-based group sponsoring Syrian Refugees coming to Canada, in partnership with Humanity First.\n\nMuch of Nagel's research draws on empirical developments from the cognitive sciences and experimental philosophy in order to address longstanding questions in epistemology and philosophy of mind. For example, Nagel is well-known for defending the value of intuitions in philosophical methodology. While the emergence of experimental philosophy in the 21st century has often cast doubt on the reliability of intuitions, Nagel argues that intuitions about particular cases and thought experiments are a legitimate source of knowledge and justification. Nagel also argues, building on suggestions made by Timothy Williamson, that knowledge is a mental state. Whereas knowledge is traditionally thought to be reducible to a form of belief, i.e., a justified and true belief, Nagel argues that knowledge should itself be counted among the fundamental types of mental state, on a par with beliefs, desires, intentions, and so on.\n\nNagel is the author of \"Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction\", which has been praised as an \"admirably clear and engaging\" introduction to epistemology. Nagel considers classic questions, including about skepticism, rationalism, and empiricism, as well as more contemporary concerns, such as whether Wikipedia, \"where most articles have multiple and anonymous authors\", can be a reliable source of knowledge.\n\n"}
{"id": "46038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46038", "title": "Jeremy Bentham", "text": "Jeremy Bentham\n\nJeremy Bentham (; 15 February 1748 [O.S. 4 February 1747] – 6 June 1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.\n\nBentham defined as the \"fundamental axiom\" of his philosophy the principle that \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\". He became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law, and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of welfarism. He advocated for individual and economic freedoms, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. He called for the abolition of slavery, of the death penalty, and of physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known as an early advocate of animal rights. Though strongly in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, he opposed the idea of natural law and natural rights (both of which are considered \"divine\" or \"God-given\" in origin), calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\". Bentham was also a sharp critic of legal fictions.\n\nBentham's students included his secretary and collaborator James Mill, the latter's son, John Stuart Mill, the legal philosopher John Austin, as well as Robert Owen, one of the founders of utopian socialism. He \"had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself.\"\n\nOn his death in 1832, Bentham left instructions for his body to be first dissected, and then to be permanently preserved as an \"auto-icon\" (or self-image), which would be his memorial. This was done, and the auto-icon is now on public display at University College London (UCL). Because of his arguments in favour of the general availability of education, he has been described as the \"spiritual founder\" of UCL. However, he played only a limited direct part in its foundation.\n\nBentham was born in Houndsditch, London, to a wealthy family that supported the Tory party. He was reportedly a child prodigy: he was found as a toddler sitting at his father's desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and he began to study Latin at the age of three. He learnt to play the violin and at the age of seven, Bentham would perform sonatas by Handel during dinner parties. He had one surviving sibling, Samuel Bentham, with whom he was close.\n\nHe attended Westminster School and, in 1760, at age 12, was sent by his father to The Queen's College, Oxford, where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1763 and his master's degree in 1766. He trained as a lawyer and, though he never practised, was called to the bar in 1769. He became deeply frustrated with the complexity of the English legal code, which he termed the \"Demon of Chicane\".\n\nWhen the American colonies published their Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the British government did not issue any official response but instead secretly commissioned London lawyer and pamphleteer John Lind to publish a rebuttal. His 130-page tract was distributed in the colonies and contained an essay titled \"Short Review of the Declaration\" written by Bentham, a friend of Lind, which attacked and mocked the Americans' political philosophy.\n\nAmong his many proposals for legal and social reform was a design for a prison building he called the Panopticon. He spent some sixteen years of his life developing and refining his ideas for the building and hoped that the government would adopt the plan for a National Penitentiary appointing him as contractor-governor. Although the prison was never built, the concept had an important influence on later generations of thinkers. Twentieth-century French philosopher Michel Foucault argued that the Panopticon was paradigmatic of several 19th-century \"disciplinary\" institutions.\n\nBentham became convinced that his plans for the Panopticon had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite acting in their own interests. It was largely because of his brooding sense of injustice that he developed his ideas of \"sinister interest\" – that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest – which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.\n\nMore successful was his cooperation with Patrick Colquhoun in tackling the corruption in the Pool of London. This resulted in the Thames Police Bill of 1798, which was passed in 1800. The bill created the Thames River Police, which was the first preventive police force in the country and was a precedent for Robert Peel's reforms 30 years later.\n\nBentham was in correspondence with many influential people. In the 1780s, for example, Bentham maintained a correspondence with the aging Adam Smith, in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Smith that interest rates should be allowed to freely float. As a result of his correspondence with Mirabeau and other leaders of the French Revolution, Bentham was declared an honorary citizen of France. He was an outspoken critic of the revolutionary discourse of natural rights and of the violence that arose after the Jacobins took power (1792). Between 1808 and 1810, he held a personal friendship with Latin American Independence Precursor Francisco de Miranda and paid visits to Miranda's Grafton Way house in London.\n\nIn 1823, he co-founded the \"Westminster Review\" with James Mill as a journal for the \"Philosophical Radicals\"a group of younger disciples through whom Bentham exerted considerable influence in British public life. One was John Bowring, to whom Bentham became devoted, describing their relationship as \"son and father\": he appointed Bowring political editor of the \"Westminster Review\" and eventually his literary executor. Another was Edwin Chadwick, who wrote on hygiene, sanitation and policing and was a major contributor to the Poor Law Amendment Act: Bentham employed Chadwick as a secretary and bequeathed him a large legacy.\n\nAn insight into his character is given in Michael St. John Packe's \"The Life of John Stuart Mill\":\nA psychobiographical study by Philip Lucas and Anne Sheeran argues that he may have had Asperger's syndrome.\n\nBentham was an atheist. writes, \"In sum, with Hume's agnosticism and Bentham's atheism, the fundamental voluntarist thesis about the gulf between the divine and the human mind reaches new depths, and this serves to reinforce and radicalize the rejection, begun by Pufendorf, of Grotian rights-theory as the appropriate means of formulating the conventionalist theory of the moral life.\" And notes, \"Making allowance for Adams's cautious phrasing, this is a concise statement of Bentham's secular positivism, but it is also important to note the conviction with which Bentham held his atheism.\"\n\nBentham died on 6 June 1832 aged 84 at his residence in Queen Square Place in Westminster, London, England. He had continued to write up to a month before his death, and had made careful preparations for the dissection of his body after death and its preservation as an auto-icon. As early as 1769, when Bentham was 21 years old, he made a will leaving his body for dissection to a family friend, the physician and chemist George Fordyce, whose daughter, Maria Sophia (1765–1858), married Jeremy's brother Samuel Bentham. A paper written in 1830, instructing Thomas Southwood Smith to create the auto-icon, was attached to his last will, dated 30 May 1832.\n\nOn 8 June 1832, two days after his death, invitations were distributed to a select group of friends, and on the following day at 3 p.m., Southwood Smith delivered a lengthy oration over Bentham's remains in the Webb Street School of Anatomy & Medicine in Southwark, London. The printed oration contains a frontispiece with an engraving of Bentham's body partly covered by a sheet.\n\nAfterward, the skeleton and head were preserved and stored in a wooden cabinet called the \"Auto-icon\", with the skeleton padded out with hay and dressed in Bentham's clothes. Originally kept by his disciple Thomas Southwood Smith, it was acquired by University College London in 1850. It is normally kept on public display at the end of the South Cloisters in the main building of the college; however, for the 100th and 150th anniversaries of the college, and in 2013, it was brought to the meeting of the College Council, where it was listed as \"present but not voting\".\n\nBentham had intended the Auto-icon to incorporate his actual head, mummified to resemble its appearance in life. Southwood Smith's experimental efforts at mummification, based on practices of the indigenous people of New Zealand and involving placing the head under an air pump over sulfuric acid and drawing off the fluids, although technically successful, left the head looking distastefully macabre, with dried and darkened skin stretched tautly over the skull. The auto-icon was therefore given a wax head, fitted with some of Bentham's own hair. The real head was displayed in the same case as the auto-icon for many years, but became the target of repeated student pranks. It is now locked away securely.\n\nIn 2017, plans were announced to re-exhibit the head and at the same time obtain a DNA sample for sequencing with the goal of identifying genetic evidence of autism.\n\nIn 2018, Jeremy Bentham's auto-icon was on display in New York City at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Breuer location.\n\nBentham's ambition in life was to create a \"Pannomion\", a complete utilitarian code of law. He not only proposed many legal and social reforms, but also expounded an underlying moral principle on which they should be based. This philosophy of utilitarianism took for its \"fundamental axiom\", \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\"\". Bentham claimed to have borrowed this concept from the writings of Joseph Priestley, although the closest that Priestley in fact came to expressing it was in the form \"the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be determined\".\n\nThe \"greatest happiness principle\", or the principle of utility, forms the cornerstone of all Bentham's thought. By \"happiness\", he understood a predominance of \"pleasure\" over \"pain\". He wrote in \"The Principles of Morals and Legislation\":\n\nBentham was a rare major figure in the history of philosophy to endorse psychological egoism.\n\nBentham was a determined opponent of religion. Crimmins observes: \"Between 1809 and 1823 Jeremy Bentham carried out an exhaustive examination of religion with the declared aim of extirpating religious beliefs, even the idea of religion itself, from the minds of men.\"\n\nBentham suggested a procedure for estimating the moral status of any action, which he called the Hedonistic or felicific calculus. Utilitarianism was revised and expanded by Bentham's student John Stuart Mill. In Mill's hands, \"Benthamism\" became a major element in the liberal conception of state policy objectives.\n\nBentham's critics have claimed that he undermined the foundation of a free society by rejecting natural rights.\n\nIn his exposition of the felicific calculus, Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, by which we might test the \"happiness factor\" of any action. Nonetheless, it should not be overlooked that Bentham's \"hedonistic\" theory (a term from J.J.C. Smart), unlike Mill's, is often criticized for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of justice. In \"Bentham and the Common Law Tradition\", Gerald J. Postema states: \"No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion...\" Thus, some critics object, it would be acceptable to torture one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in \"Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law\", Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences. According to Kelly, for Bentham the law \"provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being\". It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows \"expectation utilities\" to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many. Law professor Alan Dershowitz has quoted Bentham to argue that torture should sometimes be permitted.\n\nBentham's \"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation\" focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices. His principle of utility regards \"good\" as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain and \"evil\" as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure. This concept of pleasure and pain is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual. Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society. He lays down a set of criteria for measuring the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create.\n\nThe criteria are divided into the categories of intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, productiveness, purity, and extent. Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society. He calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence. Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number. He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared \"right\", because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintain the maximum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest number of people.\n\nBentham's opinions about monetary economics were completely different from those of David Ricardo; however, they had some similarities to those of Henry Thornton. He focused on monetary expansion as a means of helping to create full employment. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, propensity to consume, the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern welfare economics.\n\nBentham stated that pleasures and pains can be ranked according to their value or \"dimension\" such as intensity, duration, certainty of a pleasure or a pain. He was concerned with maxima and minima of pleasures and pains; and they set a precedent for the future employment of the maximisation principle in the economics of the consumer, the firm and the search for an optimum in welfare economics.\n\nBentham was the first person to aggressively advocate for the codification of \"all\" of the common law into a coherent set of statutes; he was actually the person who coined the verb \"to codify\" to refer to the process of drafting a legal code. He lobbied hard for the formation of codification commissions in both England and the United States, and went so far as to write to President James Madison in 1811 to volunteer to write a complete legal code for the young country. After he learned more about American law and realized that most of it was state-based, he promptly wrote to the governors of every single state with the same offer.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Bentham's codification efforts were completely unsuccessful. Even today, they have been completely rejected by almost every common law jurisdiction, including England. However, his writings on the subject laid the foundation for the moderately successful codification work of David Dudley Field II in the United States a generation later.\n\nBentham is widely regarded as one of the earliest proponents of animal rights. He argued and believed that the ability to suffer, not the ability to reason, should be the benchmark, or what he called the \"insuperable line\". If reason alone were the criterion by which we judge who ought to have rights, human infants and adults with certain forms of disability might fall short, too. In 1789, alluding to the limited degree of legal protection afforded to slaves in the French West Indies by the Code Noir, he wrote:\n\nEarlier in that paragraph, Bentham makes clear that he accepted that animals could be killed for food, or in defence of human life, provided that the animal was not made to suffer unnecessarily. Bentham did not object to medical experiments on animals, providing that the experiments had in mind a particular goal of benefit to humanity, and had a reasonable chance of achieving that goal. He wrote that otherwise he had a \"decided and insuperable objection\" to causing pain to animals, in part because of the harmful effects such practices might have on human beings. In a letter to the editor of the \"Morning Chronicle\" in March 1825, he wrote:\n\nBentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist. Bentham spoke for a complete equality between sexes.\nBentham nevertheless thought women inferior to men regarding such qualities as \"strength of intellectual powers\" and \"firmness of mind\".\n\nThe essay \"Offences Against One's Self,\" argued for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting homosexual sex. The essay remained unpublished during his lifetime for fear of offending public morality. It was published for the first time in 1931. Bentham does not believe homosexual acts to be unnatural, describing them merely as \"irregularities of the venereal appetite\". The essay chastises the society of the time for making a disproportionate response to what Bentham appears to consider a largely private offence – public displays or forced acts being dealt with rightly by other laws. When the essay was published in the \"Journal of Homosexuality\" in 1978, the \"Abstract\" stated that Bentham's essay was the \"first known argument for homosexual law reform in England\".\n\nFor Bentham, transparency had moral value. For example, journalism puts power-holders under moral scrutiny. However, Bentham wanted such transparency to apply to everyone. This he describes by picturing the world as a gymnasium in which each \"gesture, every turn of limb or feature, in those whose motions have a visible impact on the general happiness, will be noticed and marked down\". He considered both surveillance and transparency to be useful ways of generating understanding and improvements for people's lives.\n\nBentham distinguished among fictional entities what he called \"fabulous entities\" like Prince Hamlet or a centaur, from what he termed \"fictitious entities\", or necessary objects of discourse, similar to Kant's categories, such as nature, custom, or the social contract.\n\nBentham is widely associated with the foundation in 1826 of London University (the institution that, in 1836, became University College London), though he was 78 years old when the University opened and played only an indirect role in its establishment. His direct involvement was limited to his buying a single £100 share in the new University, making him just one of over a thousand shareholders.\nBentham and his ideas can nonetheless be seen as having inspired several of the actual founders of the University. He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly to those who were not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham's time, membership of the Church of England and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of race, creed or political belief, it was largely consistent with Bentham's vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a \"more than passive part\" in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that \"his interest was greater than his influence\". He failed in his efforts to see his disciple John Bowring appointed professor of English or History, but he did oversee the appointment of another pupil, John Austin, as the first professor of Jurisprudence in 1829.\n\nThe more direct associations between Bentham and UCLthe College's custody of his Auto-icon (see above) and of the majority of his surviving paperspostdate his death by some years: the papers were donated in 1849, and the Auto-icon in 1850. A large painting by Henry Tonks hanging in UCL's Flaxman Gallery depicts Bentham approving the plans of the new university, but it was executed in 1922 and the scene is entirely imaginary. Since 1959 (when the Bentham Committee was first established) UCL has hosted the Bentham Project, which is progressively publishing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings.\n\nUCL now endeavours to acknowledge Bentham's influence on its foundation, while avoiding any suggestion of direct involvement, by describing him as its \"spiritual founder\".\n\nBentham was an obsessive writer and reviser, but was constitutionally incapable, except on rare occasions, of bringing his work to completion and publication. Most of what appeared in print in his lifetime (see list of published works online) was prepared for publication by others. Several of his works first appeared in French translation, prepared for the press by Étienne Dumont, for example, Theory of Legislation, Volume 2 (Principles of the Penal Code) 1840, Weeks, Jordan, & Company. Boston. Some made their first appearance in English in the 1820s as a result of back-translation from Dumont's 1802 collection (and redaction) of Bentham's writing on civil and penal legislation.\n\n\nOn his death, Bentham left manuscripts amounting to an estimated 30 million words, which are now largely held by UCL's Special Collections (c. 60,000 manuscript folios), and the British Library (c.15,000 folios).\n\nJohn Bowring, the young radical writer who had been Bentham's intimate friend and disciple, was appointed his literary executor and charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works. This appeared in 11 volumes in 1838–1843. Bowring based much of his edition on previously published texts (including those of Dumont) rather than Bentham's own manuscripts, and elected not to publish Bentham's works on religion at all. The edition was described by the \"Edinburgh Review\" on first publication as \"incomplete, incorrect and ill-arranged\", and has since been repeatedly criticised both for its omissions and for errors of detail; while Bowring's memoir of Bentham's life included in volumes 10 and 11 was described by Sir Leslie Stephen as \"one of the worst biographies in the language\". Nevertheless, Bowring's remained the standard edition of most of Bentham's writings for over a century, and is still only partially superseded: it includes such interesting writings on international relations as Bentham's A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace written 1786–89, which forms part IV of the Principles of International Law.\n\nIn 1952–1954, Werner Stark published a three-volume set, \"Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings\", in which he attempted to bring together all of Bentham's writings on economic matters, including both published and unpublished material. Although a significant achievement, the work is considered by scholars to be flawed in many points of detail, and a new edition of the economic writings is currently in preparation by the Bentham Project.\n\nIn 1959, the Bentham Committee was established under the auspices of University College London with the aim of producing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings. It set up the Bentham Project to undertake the task, and the first volume in \"The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham\" was published in 1968. The \"Collected Works\" are providing many unpublished works, as well as much-improved texts of works already published. To date, 31 volumes have appeared; the complete edition is projected to run to around seventy. The volume \"Of Laws in General\" (1970) was found to contain many errors and has been replaced by \"Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence\" (2010) In June 2017, Volumes 1–5 were re-published in open access by UCL Press.\n\nTo assist in this task, the Bentham papers at UCL are being digitised by crowdsourcing their transcription. Transcribe Bentham is an award-winning crowdsourced manuscript transcription project, run by University College London's Bentham Project, in partnership with UCL's UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, UCL Library Services, UCL Learning and Media Services, the University of London Computer Centre, and the online community. The project was launched in September 2010 and is making freely available, via a specially designed transcription interface, digital images of UCL's vast Bentham Papers collection – which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios – to engage the public and recruit volunteers to help transcribe the material. Volunteer-produced transcripts will contribute to the Bentham Project's production of the new edition of \"The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham\", and will be uploaded to UCL's digital Bentham Papers repository, widening access to the collection for all and ensuring its long-term preservation. Manuscripts can be viewed and transcribed by signing-up for a transcriber account at the Transcription Desk, via the Transcribe Bentham website.\n\nThe Faculty of Laws at University College London occupies Bentham House, next to the main UCL campus.\n\nBentham's name was adopted by the Australian litigation funder IMF Limited to become Bentham IMF Limited on 28 November 2013, in recognition of Bentham being \"among the first to support the utility of litigation funding\".\n\nIvan Vazov, national poet and man of letters of Bulgaria (then recently liberated from Ottoman rule, but divided by the Treaty of Berlin) refers to Bentham in his 1881 poem (in English: \"People with Diplomas\").\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "213143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213143", "title": "Joseph de Maistre", "text": "Joseph de Maistre\n\nJoseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre (; 1 April 1753 – 26 February 1821) was a French-speaking Savoyard philosopher, writer, lawyer, and diplomat, who advocated social hierarchy and monarchy in the period immediately following the French Revolution. Despite his close personal and intellectual ties with France, Maistre was throughout his life a subject of the King of Piedmont-Sardinia, whom he served as member of the Savoy Senate (1787–1792), ambassador to Russia (1803–1817), and minister of state to the court in Turin (1817–1821).\n\nA key figure of the \"Counter-Enlightenment\", Maistre regarded monarchy as both a divinely sanctioned institution and as the only stable form of government. He called for the restoration of the House of Bourbon to the throne of France and for the ultimate authority of the Pope in temporal matters. Maistre argued that the rationalist rejection of Christianity was directly responsible for the disorder and bloodshed which followed the French Revolution of 1789.\n\nMaistre was born in 1753 at Chambéry, in the Duchy of Savoy, which at that time was part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, ruled by the House of Savoy. His family was of French and Italian origin. His grandfather André (Andrea) Maistre, whose parents Francesco and Margarita Maistre (née Dalmassi) originated in the County of Nice, had been a draper and councilman in Nice (then under the rule of the House of Savoy), and his father François-Xavier, who moved to Chambéry in 1740, became a magistrate and senator, eventually receiving the title of count from the King of Piedmont-Sardinia. His mother's family, whose surname was Desmotz, were from Rumilly. Joseph's younger brother, Xavier, who became an army officer, was a popular writer of fiction.\n\nJoseph was probably educated by the Jesuits. After the Revolution, he became an ardent defender of their Order, increasingly associating the spirit of the Revolution with the Jesuits' traditional enemies, the Jansenists. After completing his training in the law at the University of Turin in 1774, he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a Senator in 1787.\n\nA member of the progressive Scottish Rite Masonic lodge at Chambéry from 1774 to 1790, Maistre originally favoured political reform in France, supporting the efforts of the magistrates in the Parlements to force King Louis XVI to convene the Estates General. As a landowner in France, Maistre was eligible to join that body, and there is some evidence that he contemplated that possibility. He was alarmed, however, by the decision of the States-General to combine clergy, aristocracy, and commoners into a single legislative body, which became the National Constituent Assembly. After the passing of the August Decrees on 4 August 1789 he decisively turned against the course of political events in France.\n\nMaistre fled Chambéry when it was taken by a French revolutionary army in 1792, but unable to find a position in the royal court in Turin, he returned the following year. Deciding that he could not support the French-controlled regime, he departed again, this time for Lausanne, in Switzerland. There he discussed politics and theology at the salon of Madame de Staël, and began his career as a counter-revolutionary writer, with works such as \"Lettres d'un Royaliste Savoisien\" (\"Letters from a Savoyard Royalist\", 1793), \"Discours à Mme. la Marquise Costa de Beauregard, sur la Vie et la Mort de son Fils\" (\"Discourse to the Marchioness Costa de Beauregard, on the Life and Death of her Son\", 1794) and \"Cinq paradoxes à la Marquise de Nav...\" (\"Five Paradoxes for the Marchioness of Nav...\", 1795).\n\nFrom Lausanne, Maistre went to Venice, and then to Cagliari, where the King of Piedmont-Sardinia held the court and the government of the kingdom after French armies took Turin in 1798. Maistre's relations with the court at Cagliari were not always easy and in 1802 he was sent to Saint Petersburg in Russia, as ambassador to Tsar Alexander I. His diplomatic responsibilities were few, and he became a well-loved fixture in aristocratic circles, converting some of his friends to Roman Catholicism, and writing his most influential works on political philosophy.\n\nMaistre's observations on Russian life, contained in his diplomatic memoirs and in his personal correspondence, were among Tolstoy's sources for his novel \"War and Peace\". After the defeat of Napoleon and the restoration of the House of Savoy's dominion over Piedmont and Savoy (under the terms of the Congress of Vienna), Maistre returned in 1817 to Turin, and served there as magistrate and minister of state until his death. He died on 26 February 1821 and is buried in the Jesuit Church of the Holy Martyrs (\"Chiesa dei Santi Martiri\").\n\nIn \"Considérations sur la France\" (\"Considerations on France,\" 1797), Maistre claimed that France has a divine mission as the principal instrument of good and evil on Earth. He interpreted the Revolution of 1789 as a Providential event: the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the \"Ancien Régime\" in general, instead of directing the influence of French civilization to the benefit of mankind, had promoted the atheistic doctrines of the eighteenth-century philosophers. He claimed that the crimes of the Reign of Terror were the logical consequence of Enlightened thought, as well as its divinely-decreed punishment.\n\nIn his short book \"Essai sur le Principe Générateur des Constitutions Politiques et des Autres Institutions Humaines\" (\"Essay on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions and other Human Institutions,\" 1809), Maistre argued that constitutions are not the product of human reason, but come from God, who slowly brings them to maturity. After the appearance in 1816 of his French translation of Plutarch's treatise \"On the Delay of Divine Justice in the Punishment of the Guilty\", in 1819 Maistre published \"Du Pape\" (\"On the Pope\"), the most complete exposition of his authoritarian conception of politics.\n\nAccording to Maistre, any attempt to justify government on rational grounds will only lead to unresolvable arguments about the legitimacy and expediency of any existing government, and that this, in turn, will lead to violence and chaos. Maistre therefore argued that the legitimacy of government must be based on compelling but non-rational grounds, which its subjects must not be allowed to question. Maistre went on to argue that authority in politics should therefore derive from religion, and that in Europe this religious authority must ultimately lie with the Pope.\n\nWhat was novel in Maistre's writings was not his enthusiastic defense of monarchical and religious authority \"per se\", but rather his arguments concerning the practical need for ultimate authority to lie with an individual capable of decisive action, as well as his analysis of the social foundations of that authority's legitimacy. In his own words, which he addressed to a group of aristocratic French émigrés, \"you ought to know how to be royalists. Before, this was an instinct, but today it is a science. You must love the sovereign as you love order, with all the forces of intelligence.\" Maistre's analysis of the problem of authority and its legitimacy foreshadows some of the concerns of early sociologists such as Comte and Saint-Simon.\n\nIn addition to his voluminous correspondence, Maistre left two books that were published posthumously. \"Soirées de St. Pétersbourg\" (\"The Saint Petersburg Dialogues\", 1821) is a theodicy in the form of a Platonic dialogue, in which Maistre argues that evil exists because of its place in the divine plan, according to which the blood sacrifice of innocents returns men to God, via the expiation of the sins of the guilty; Maistre sees this as a law of human history, as indubitable as it is mysterious. \"Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon\", (\"An Examination of the Philosophy of Bacon,\" 1836), is a critique of the thought of Francis Bacon, whom Maistre considers to be the fountainhead of the destructive Enlightened thought.\n\nMaistre, together with the Anglo-Irish statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke, is commonly regarded as one of the founders of European conservatism, but since the 19th century, Maistre's authoritarian, \"throne-and-altar\" conception of conservatism has declined in influence in comparison with the more liberal conservatism of Burke. Maistre's skills as a writer and polemicist however ensure that he continues to be read. Matthew Arnold, an influential 19th-century critic, while comparing Maistre's style with his Irish counterpart, wrote that\nJoseph de Maistre is another of those men whose word, like that of Burke, has vitality. In imaginative power he is altogether inferior to Burke. On the other hand his thought moves in closer order than Burke's, more rapidly, more directly; he has fewer superfluities. Burke is a great writer, but Joseph de Maistre's use of the French language is more powerful, more thoroughly satisfactory, than Burke's use of the English. It is masterly; it shows us to perfection of what that admirable instrument, the French language, is capable.\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" of 1910 describes his writing style as \"strong, lively, picturesque,\" and that his \"animation and good humour temper his dogmatic tone. He possesses a wonderful facility in exposition, precision of doctrine, breadth of learning, and dialectical power.\" Alphonse de Lamartine, though a political opponent, admired the splendour of his prose:\n\nÉmile Faguet described Maistre as \"a fierce absolutist, a furious theocrat, an intransigent legitimist, apostle of a monstrous trinity composed of pope, king and hangman, always and everywhere the champion of the hardest, narrowest and most inflexible dogmatism, a dark figure out of the Middle Ages, part learned doctor, part inquisitor, part executioner.\"\n\nAmongst those who admired him was the poet Charles Baudelaire, who described himself a disciple of the Savoyard counter-revolutionary, claiming that he had taught him how to think. George Saintsbury called him \"unquestionably one of the greatest thinkers and writers of the eighteenth century.\" Maistre also exerted a powerful influence on the Spanish political thinker Juan Donoso Cortés and, later, on the French anti-Semitic monarchist Charles Maurras and his counter-revolutionary political movement \"Action Française\".\n\nAccording to Carolina Armenteros, Maistre's writings influenced not only conservative political thinkers, but also the Utopian socialists. Early sociologists such as Saint-Simon and Comte explicitly acknowledged the influence of Maistre on their own thinking about the sources of social cohesion and political authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied philosophy under Nishida Kitarō and Tanabe Hajime at the Kyoto Imperial university. Later he went to Germany, to study the work of Martin Heidegger, Karl Löwith, Blaise Pascal, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Upon his return to Japan, his outspokenness and outgoing lifestyle, coupled with a controversial affair with an older woman, led to his being denied an academic position at Kyoto. Further trouble engulfed him when he lent money to a friend who used it, unbeknown to Miki, to contribute to the Japanese Communist Party. Miki was then implicated in this development (the far-left movements were being cracked down upon, and such donations were illegal) and after brief imprisonment lost any chance of regaining decent academic standing. While he remained in touch with his mentor, Nishida, and other members of the Kyoto School, he worked outside of academia proper, producing popular writings aimed at a wide audience.\n\nMiki believed that philosophy should be pragmatic and utilized in addressing concrete social and political problems. He wrote articles for the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, providing commentary on issues of the day. His firm belief that philosophy should lead politics encouraged the political activism of intellectuals, and when he was offered in 1937 the opportunity to head up the cultural section of the \"Showa Kenkyu Kai\" (Showa Research Association), a think tank concerned with building an intellectual basis for Prince Konoe Fumimaro's \"Shintaisei\" (New Order Movement), he eagerly accepted. While he formulated the concept of the \"Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere,\" he was infuriated when the Imperial Japanese Army employed it in justifying its aggressive expansion in China and Southeast Asia. Following the collapse of the Showa Kenkyu Kai, and in an environment of the militarization of society and intensifying warfare abroad, Miki became depressed and isolated. After helping a friend on the run from the authorities, he was imprisoned and died in Toyotama Prison 40 days after the war ended, on September 26 1945 due to an illness resulting from poor prison conditions. His death, at a time when the US Occupation of Japan was already underway, deeply upset Japanese intellectuals. As a result, the American Occupation pressed to release political prisoners. Miki's complete works are available from Iwanami Shoten.\n\nIn Shoji Muramoto's psychological article \"Historical Reflections for the International Development of Japanese Humanistic Psychology.\", Kiyoshi is credited as a \"central figure in the Japanese humanistic movement\" because of his authoring of \"the first book explicitly related to the existentialist tradition written by a Japanese thinker\": \"Studies of Human Being in Pascal\" (1926).\n\nMiki developed a reading of Heidegger's early philosophy as essentially being in the tradition of Christian individualism, reaching back to Saint Augustine and being fundamentally anti-Greek in character. As such, his reading of Heidegger falls with the broad class as Jean-Paul Sartre, in that it ignores the priority Heidegger gives to the ontological question of Being, in favor of seeing Heidegger's philosophy as an analysis of human existence.\n\nHe became a Marxist in 1925, and preceded Sartre in suggesting a synthesis of Marxism and existentialism.\n\nThe German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was influential in his intellectual development.\n\nJapanese resistance to the Empire of Japan in World War II\n\n"}

He is a professor of philosophy and is currently serving as rector of Usman Institute of Technology (UIT) in Karachi, Sindh Province. He has international prestige for publishing articles, books, and leading edge research on the field of Philosophy of science, particularly the philosophy of space and time.\n\nManzoor Ahmed was born into an Urdu-speaking family, in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh on 11 March 1934. His parents home schooled him, and he was later enrolled in a local middle school. He was a child prodigy, and enrolled in High School at the age of seven, where he excelled. Ahmad graduated from high school, and stood first in the matriculation examination for the state. He attended Raza Inter-College (RIC) where he studied science and philosophy, and stood first in the college examination for university transfer. Ahmad was persuaded by his family to study medicines; he therefore applied for three medical schools— King George Medical University in Lucknow, King Edward Medical College in Lahore, and Dow Medical College in Karachi. However, Ahmad decided to pursue his inclination for philosophy and did not join any of these institutions. He moved to Karachi, Sindh Province and joined S.M. Arts College.\n\nIn 1947, Ahmad acquired the Pakistani citizenship, joining Karachi University in 1951. There he studied physics, mathematics and philosophy, and obtained a minor in Mathematics, and a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics and a BA in Philosophy in 1953. In 1955, Ahmad obtained a MA in philosophy from the same university. With a HEC scholarship, Ahmad went to London, United Kingdom to attend the school of his choice. Ahmad enrolled in a doctoral programme at London University. Continuing his interest in physics, Ahmad was awarded a doctorate in philosophy of science, with a focus on the mathematical and philosophical notion of space and time continuum.\n\nSince his return to his country, Ahmad has worked for the Government of Pakistan, as head of various national and international organizations. He is also an active member of the Council of Islamic Ideology in Pakistan. After returning to Pakistan, Ahmad became associated to the Karachi University and has directed their Department of Philosophy; he was later appointed as the Dean of their faculty of Fine Arts. Ahmad was the President of the Pakistan Philosophical Congress (PPC), which works for the improvement of Philosophical studies in the country. He was a Fulbright scholar, and has lectured on philosophy of science at the University of Chicago, Columbia University, and the University of California. He was also awarded fellowships by the Brown Foundation and the British Council.\n\nAhmad held the vice-chancellorship of Hamdard University twice and holds the Chairmanship of the Usman Institute of Technology (UIT). He is the Rector of the Islamic International University, Islamabad and Chairman of the Board of Governors for the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture (IVS).\n\nAhmad has written important books about the relation between consciousness, science and philosophy. In his article, \"The Notion of Existence\", Ahmad argued that the impact of scientific development has created the problem of the subjectivity of sense qualities and a separation between knowledge and existence. Ahmad further noted that, \"the picture of the world given by immediate perception is totally different from what the world actually is, leading to an opposition between existence and true knowledge. Galileo's solution is that this difference between knowledge and existence disappears to a certain extent in the clearest knowledge we possess, i.e. mathematical knowledge.\" However, Ahmad believes in the theory of general relativity and cited that \"without the existence of the Spacetime continuum, the universe would not exist and we would not exist\".\n\n\n"}

They both furthered the work of Goi Ranju and consolidating previous thought around the Kaitokudo school, bringing a level of prestige to the academy. \n\nLike his brother Chikuzan, Riken wholeheartedly denounced Ogyū Sorai and contended that all people have potential, to the extent that \"even\" commoners could become scholars, while he also denounced religion and superstition. However, Riken’s particular strain of the dismissal of \"dreams\", and the unverifiable led him to dabble in astronomy, most notably with Asada Goryu.\n\nRiken’s scholarship was far broader and is often perceived to transcend the specific question of reconciling the virtue of merchants with contemporary perceptions of merchants.\n\nNakai Riken wrote extensive commentaries on the three of the four books Analects, Doctrine of the mean and Mencius. He rejected other works as unreliable \"dreams\", largely due to their unverifiability. In these works, he dismissed the book of changes, the book on Songs and the book of history as unreliable, and further the book of rites and the spring and autumn annals as unreliable or of authorship different from the received interpretation. \n\nHowever, his lasting legacy was in reaching a point of contradiction between the demand for verifiability in the Kaitokudo school and the reliance on the reading of text as history.\n\nThe influence of Nakai Riken, as well as Nakai Chikuzan and other contemporary moral philosophers outside the mainstream of Neo-confucianism, shingaku and Buddhism can be seen most immediately and concisely in the work of Yamagata Banto.

{"id": "305024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305024", "title": "Pratītyasamutpāda", "text": "Pratītyasamutpāda\n\nPratītyasamutpāda (; \"paṭiccasamuppāda\"), commonly translated as dependent origination, or dependent arising, is a key principle in Buddhist teachings, which states that all \"dharmas\" (\"phenomena\") arise in dependence upon other \"dharmas\": \"if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist\".\n\nThe principle is expressed in the links of dependent origination (Pali: \"dvādasanidānāni,\" Sanskrit: \"dvādaśanidānāni\") in Buddhism, a linear list of twelve elements from the Buddhist teachings which arise depending on the preceding link. Traditionally the list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in \"saṃsāra\", and the resultant \"duḥkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). An alternate Theravada interpretation regards the list as describing the arising of mental formations and the resultant notion of \"I\" and \"mine,\" which are the source of suffering. Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth. \n\nScholars have noted inconsistencies in the list, and regard it to be a later synthesis of several older lists. The first four links may be a mockery of the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogeny, as described in the \"Hymn of Creation\" of Veda X, 129 and the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. These were integrated with a branched list which describe the conditioning of mental processes, akin to the five skandhas. Eventually, this branched list developed into the standard twelvefold chain as a linear list. While this list may be interpreted as describing the processes which give rise to rebirth, in essence it describes the arising of \"dukkha\" as a psychological process, without the involvement of an atman.\n\n\"Pratityasamutpada\" (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) consists of two terms:\n\nThe term has been translated into English variously as \"dependent origination\", \"dependent arising\", \"interdependent co-arising\", \"conditioned arising\", and \"conditioned genesis\".\n\nThe term may also refer to the twelve nidānas, Pali: \"dvādasanidānāni,\" Sanskrit: \"dvādaśanidānāni,\" from \"dvāvaśa\" (\"twelve\") + \"nidānāni\" (plural of \"nidāna\", \"cause, motivation, link\"). Generally speaking, in the Mahayana tradition, \"pratityasamutpada\" (Sanskrit) is used to refer to the general principle of interdependent causation, whereas in the Theravada tradition, \"paticcasamuppāda\" (Pali) is used to refer to the twelve nidānas.\n\nThe \"Pratityasamutpada\" teachings asserts neither direct Newtonian-like causality nor a single causality. Rather, it asserts an indirect conditioned causality and a plural causality. The \"causal link\" propositions in Buddhism is very different from the idea of causality that developed in Europe. Instead, the concept of causality in Buddhism is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate phenomena within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of realms of existence for another lifetime. The \"Pratītyasamutpāda\" principle asserts that the dependent origination is necessary and sufficient condition in both directions. This is expressed in Majjhima Nikaya as \"When this is, that is; This arising, that arises; When this is not, that is not; This ceasing, that ceases.\"\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, \"Pratityasamutpada\" is an ontological principle; that is, a theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana. All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease. The 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus \"Pratityasamutpada\" is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'.\n\nThe Pratītyasamutpāda ontological principle in Buddhism is applied not only to explain the nature and existence of matter and empirically observed phenomenon, but also to the nature and existence of life. In abstract form, according to Peter Harvey, \"the doctrine states: 'That being, this comes to be; from the arising of that, this arises; that being absent, this is not; from the cessation of that, this ceases'.\" There is no 'first cause' from which all beings arose.\n\nAgainst Harvey's ontological interpretation, Eviatar Shulman argues that \nShulman grants that there are some ontological implications that may be gleaned from dependent origination, but that at its core it is concerned with \"identifying the different processes of mental conditioning and describing their relations\".\n\nNoa Ronkin states that while Buddha suspends all views regarding certain metaphysical questions, he is not an anti-metaphysician: nothing in the texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless, instead Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.\n\nAccording to Stephen Laumakis, pratītyasamutpāda is also an epistemological principle; that is, a theory about how we gain correct and incorrect knowledge about being, becoming, existence and reality. The 'dependent origination' doctrine, states Peter Harvey, \"highlights the Buddhist notion that all apparently substantial entities within the world are in fact wrongly perceived. We live under the illusion that terms such as 'I', self, mountain, tree, etc. denote permanent and stable things. The doctrine teaches this is not so.\" There is nothing permanent (anicca), nothing substantial, no unique individual self in the nature of becoming and existence (anatta), because everything is a result of \"dependent origination\". There are no independent objects and independent subjects, according to the Pratītyasamutpāda doctrine, there is fundamental emptiness in all phenomena and experiences.\n\nThe twelve nidānas (Pali: \"dvādasanidānāni,\" Sanskrit: \"dvādaśanidānāni\") is a linear list of twelve elements from the Buddhist teachings which are \"pratītyasamutpāda\", arising depending on the previous link. According to Shulman, \"the 12 links \"are paticcasamuppada\"\"; in the suttas, dependent origination refers to nothing else but the process of mental conditioning as described by the twelve \"nidanas\".\n\nTraditionally the standard-list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in \"saṃsāra\", and the resultant \"duḥkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). An alternate interpretation regards the list as describing the causal arising of mental formations and the resultant \"duḥkha\". Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth. Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the list, and regard it to be a later synthesis of several older lists.\n\nThere are various Nidana lists throughout the Early Buddhist Texts and collections such as the Pali Nikayas, the most common of which is a list of Twelve Nidānas which appears in both Pali texts and Mahayana sutras such as the Salistamba Sutra. The 'dependent origination' doctrine is presented in Vinaya Pitaka 1.1–2, in abbreviated form in Samyutta Nikaya 2.1, 2.19 and 2.76.\n\nDīgha Nikāya Sutta 1, the Brahmajala Sutta, verse 3.71 describes six Nidānas:\nDīgha Nikāya, Sutta 14 describes ten links, and in Sutta 15 nine links are described, but without the six sensebases:\nDescriptions of the full sequence of twelve links can be found elsewhere in the Pali canon, for instance in section 12 of the Samyutta Nikaya:\n\"Nidanas\" are co-dependent events or phenomena, which act as links on a chain, conditioning and depending on each other. When certain conditions are present, they give rise to subsequent conditions, which in turn give rise to other conditions. Phenomena are sustained only so long as their sustaining factors remain. This causal relationship is expressed in its most general form as follows: \nThis natural law of \"this/that causality\" is independent of being discovered, just like the laws of physics. In particular, the Buddha applied this law of causality to determine the cause of \"dukkha\". Understanding the relationships between the phenomena that sustain dukkha is said to lead to nibbana, complete freedom from samsara \n\nTraditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth: \"From the remainderless fading and cessation of \"ignorance\" comes the cessation of \"(volitional) fabrications\"\" et cetera.\n\nThe Upanisa Sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya describes the reversed order, in which the causes for enlightenment are given. This application of the principle of dependent arising is referred to in Theravada exegetical literature as \"transcendental dependent arising\". The chain in this case is:\n\nWithin the Theravada Buddhist tradition, the twelve nidanas are considered to be the most significant application of the principle of dependent origination. \n\nThe nikayas themselves do not give a systematic explanation of the nidana series. As an expository device, the commentarial tradition presented the factors as a linear sequence spanning over three lives, thus shifting the theme from a single conception (and birth) to a sequence of \"incarnations\" (roughly speaking). The twelve nidanas were interpreted by Buddhaghosa (c. fifth century CE) of the Sri Lankan Mahavihara tradition as encompassing three successive lives, as outlined in his influential Visuddhimagga. According to Buddhaghosa, the first two nidanas, namely ignorance (nescience) and motivation, relate to the previous life and forecast the destiny of the person. The third to the tenth nidanas relate to the present life, beginning with the descent of \"vijnana\" (consciousness, perception) into the womb. The last two nidanas (birth and death) represent the future lives conditioned by the present causes. Because of Buddhaghosa's vast influence in the development of Theravada scholasticism, this model has been very influential in the Theravada school.\n\nYet, the twelve nidanas have also been interpreted within the Theravada tradition as explaining the arising of psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment. There is scriptural support for this as an explanation in the Abhidharmakosa of Vasubandhu, insofar as Vasubandu states that on occasion \"the twelve parts are realized in one and the same moment\". Prayudh Payutto notes that in Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the principle of Dependent Origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment. According to Prayudh Payutto there is material in the Vibhanga which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model and the phenomenological mind moment model. This thesis is also defended by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's \"Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination.\" In this interpretation, Birth and Death refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the \"emergence of the ego\". According to Buddhadhasa,\nAccording to Akira Hirakawa and Paul Groner, the three-lives model, with its \"embryological\" interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the Sarvastivadin school (a north Indian branch of the Sthavira nikāya) as evidenced by the Abhidharmakosa of Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century CE).\n\nThe Abhidharmakosa also outlines three other models of the twelve nidanas, that were used by the Sarvastivada schools together with the three lifetimes model:\n\nAsanga (4th century CE) groups the twelve nidanas into four groups: 1-3 cause of dharmas; 4-7 dharmas; 8-10 cause of suffering; 11-12 suffering.\n\nThe \"bhavachakra\" (Sanskrit; Pāli: \"bhavachakra\"; Tibetan: \"srid pa'i 'khor lo\") is a symbolic representation of saṃsāra (or cyclic existence). It is found on the outside walls of Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help ordinary people understand Buddhist teachings. The Three Fires sit at the very center of the schemata in the Bhavacakra and drive the whole edifice. In Himalayan iconographic representations of the Bhavacakra such as within Tibetan Buddhism, the Three Fires are known as the Three Poisons which are often represented as the Gankyil. The Gankyil is also often represented as the hub of the Dharmacakra.\n\nTsongkhapa, following Asanga, explains how the twelve nidanas can be applied to one life of a single person, two lives of a single person, and three lives of a single person. \n\nDiscussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that the Theravada/Sarvāstivāda interpretation is different from the Vajrayana view, because the Vajrayana view places a \"bardo\" or an intermediate state between death and rebirth, which is denied by the Theravadins and Sarvastivadins. This denial necessitated placing the first two nidanas of the \"dependent origination\" chain into the past life. The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.\n\nAccording to Frauwallner, the twelvefold chain is a combination of two lists. Originally, the Buddha explained the appearance of \"dukkha\" from \"tanha\", \"thirst,\" craving. This is explained and described in the second part, from \"tanha\" on fowards. Later on, under influence of concurring systems, the Buddha incorporated \"avijja\", \"ignorance,\" as a cause of suffering into his system. This is described in the first part, which describes the entry of \"vijnana\" into the womb, where the embryo develops. Frauwallner notes that \"the purely mechanical mixing of both the two parts of the causal chainis remarkable and enigmatical.\" Noting that \"contradictory thoughts stand directly near one another in the oldest Buddhistic ideas\" many times, Frauwallner explains this as a \"deficiency in systematization, the inability to mix different views and principles into a great unity.\"\n\nAccording to Schumann, the twelvefold chain is a later composition by monks, consisting of three shorter lists. These lists may have encompassed \"nidana\" 1-4, 5-8, and 8-12. The progress of this composition can be traced in various steps in the canon.\n\nLambert Schmitthausen argues that the twelve-fold list is a synthesis from three previous lists, arguing that the three lifetimes-interpretation is an unintended consequence of this synthesis.\n\nRoderick S. Bucknell analysed four versions of the twelve nidanas, to explain the existence of various versions of the \"pratitya-samutpada\" sequence. The twevefold version is the \"standard version,\" in which \"vijnana\" refers to sensual consciousness. According to Bucknell, the \"standard version\" of the twelve nidanas developed out of an ancestor version, which in turn was derived from two different versions, in which \"vijnana\" is differently explained. \n\nIn the socalled \"branched version\", which is not strictly linear, but connects a couple of branches, \"vijnana\" is derived from the coming together of the sense organs and the sense objects, a description which can also be found in other sutras. The three of them constitute \"phassa\" (\"contact\"). From there on, the list is linear. In the Sutta-nipata version, which is altogether linear, \"vijnana\" is derived from \"avijja\" (\"ignorance\") and \"Saṅkhāra\" (\"activities\" (RSB); also translated as \"volitional formations\"). \n\nThe \"Mahanidana-sutta\" describes a \"looped version,\" which is also further linear, in which \"vijnana\" and \"nama-rupa\" condition each other. According to Bucknell, this \"looped version\" is derived from the \"branched version.\" According to Bucknell, \"some accounts of the looped version state explicitly that the chain of causation goes no further back than the loop. The Mahanidana further explains \"vijnana\" as \"consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at the moment of conception.\" Waldron notes that \"vijnana\" here has two aspects, namely \"samsaric \"vijnana\"\" and \"cognitive consciousness.\" \"Samsaric \"vijnana\"\" is \"consciousness per se, the basic sentience necessary for all animate life,\" which descends into the womb at the time of conception. Cognitive consciousness is related to the senses and the sense objects. It is \"samsaric \"vijnana\"\" which forms, in Buddhist thought, the connection between two lifes. While these two aspects were largely undifferentiated in early Buddhist thought, these two aspects and their relation was explicated in later Buddhist thought, giving rise to the concept of \"alaya-vijñana\".\n\nWhile the \"branched version\" refers directly to the six sense objects, the \"looped version\" and the standard version instead name it \"nama-rupa\", which eventually was misinterpreted as \"name-and-form\" in the traditional sense. This created \"new causal series,\" which made it possible to interpret the beginning of the chain as referring to rebirth, just like the end of the chain. In line with this reinterpretation, \"vijnana\" \"became the consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at conception, while \"nama-rupa\" became the mind-body complex that [...] experiences contact (\"phassa\") and so on.\" \n\nBucknell further notes that the \"branched version,\" in which \"nama-rupa\" refers to the six classes of sense-objects, corresponds with Buddhadasas psychological interpretation of the twelve nidanas. The \"looped version,\" in which \"vijanana\" corresponds with \"rebirth consciousness,\" corresponds with defenders of the traditional interpretation, such as Nyanatiloka. According to Bucknell, the linear list, with its distortions and changed meaning for \"nama-rupa\" and \"vinaya\", may have developed when the list came to be recited in reverse order.\n\nAlex Wayman has argued that the idea of \"dependent origination\" may precede the birth of the Buddha, noting that the first four causal links starting with Avidya in the Twelve Nidānas are found in the cosmic development theory of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" and other older Vedic texts. Jeffrey Hopkins notes that terms synonymous to \"Pratītyasamutpāda\" are \"Apekṣhasamutpāda\" and \"Prāpyasamutpāda\". According to Kalupahana, the concept of causality and causal efficacy where \"cause produces an effect because a property or \"svadha\" (energy) is inherent in something\", appears extensively in the Indian thought in the Vedic literature of the 2nd millennium BCE, such as the 10th mandala of the \"Rigveda\" and the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas. \n \nA similar resemblance has been noted by Jurewicz, who argues that the first four \"nidanas\" resemble the \"Hymn of Creation\" of RigVeda X, 129, in which \"avijja\" (ignorance) leads to \"kamma\" (\"desire\"), which is the seed of \"vijnana\" (\"consciousness\"). This consciousness is a \"singular consciousness,\" (Jurewicz) \"non-dual consciousness,\" (Gombrich) \"reflexive, cognizing itself\" (Gombrich). When the created world, \"name and form\", evolves, pure consciousness manifests itself in the world. It mistakenly identifies itself with \"name and form\", losing sight of its real identity. The Buddha mimicked this creation story, making clear how the entanglement with the world \"drive a human being into deeper and deeper ignorance about himself.\" According to Jurewicz, the Buddha may have picked the term \"nama-rupa\", because \"the division of consciousness into name and form has only the negative value of an act which hinders cognition.\" \n\nAccording to Gombrich, the Buddhist tradition soon lost sight of this connection with the Vedic worldview. It was aware that at this point there is the appearance of an individual person, which the Buddha referred to as the five skandhas, denying a self (\"atman\") separate from these skandhas. The Buddhist tradition equated \"rupa\" with the first \"skandha\", and \"nama\" with the other four. Yet, as Gombrich notes, \"samkhara\", \"vijnana\", and \"vedana\" also appear as separate links in the twelvefold list, so this eqaution can't be correct for this \"nidana\". According to Jurewizc, all twelve nidanas show similarities with the Vedic cosmogeny. They may have been invoked for educated listeners, to make the point that suffering arises in dependence on psychological processes without an atman, thereby rejecting the Vedic outlook.\n\nAccording to Gombrich, following Frauwallner, the twelve-fold list is a combination of two previous lists, the second list beginning with \"tanha\", \"thirst,\" the cause of suffering as described in the second Noble Truth\". The first list consists of the first four \"nidanas\", which parody the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogony, as described by Jurewicz. According to Gombrich, the two lists were combined, resulting in contradictions in it's negative version. Gombrich further notes that\n\nAccording to Mathieu Boisvert, nidana 3-10 correlate with the five skandhas. Boisvert notes that \"sanna\", \"perception,\" is not part of the twelvefold chain, but does play a role in the prevention of the arising of the \"samkharas\". Likewise, Waldron notes that the \"anusaya\", \"underlying tendencies, are the link between the cognitive provcesses of \"phassa\" (\"contact\") and \"vedana\" (feeling), and the afflictive responses of \"tanha\" (\"craving\") and \"upadana\" (\"grasping\").\nAccording to Schumann, the Nidanas are a later synthesis of Buddhist teachings, meant to make them more comprehensible. Comparison with the five skhandhas shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration. This way it is explainable that nama-rupa en consciousness in the 9-fold are the beginning or start, while in the 12-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when nama-rupa en consciousness are present.\nSchumann also proposes that the 12-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrate the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa and Vasubandhu maintain a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas aside the twelve nidanas.\n\nThe second and third truths in the Four Noble Truths are related to the principle of dependent origination, with dependent arising elaborating the arising of suffering. The second truth applies dependent origination in a direct order, while the third truth applies it in inverse order.\n\nAltogether the various lists combine as follows:\n\nAccording to Eisel Mazard, the twelve Nidanas are a description of \"a sequence of stages prior to birth,\" as an \"orthodox defense against any doctrine of a 'supernal self' or soul of any kind [...] excluding an un-mentioned life-force (jīva) that followers could presumed to be additional to the birth of the body, the arising of consciousness, and the other aspects mentioned in the 12-links formula.\" According to Mazard, \"many later sources have digressed from the basic theme and subject-matter of the original text, knowingly or unknowingly.\"\n\nThe notion of karma is integrated into the list of twelve nidanas, and has been extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna. Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit). Both good and bad karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.\n\nAccording to Nagarjuna, the second causal link (\"sankhara\", motivations) and the tenth causal link (\"bhava\", gestation) are two karmas through which sentient beings trigger seven sufferings identified in the Twelve Nidanas, and from this arises the revolving rebirth cycles.\n\nTo be liberated from samsara and dukkha, asserts Buddhism, the 'dependent origination' doctrine implies that the karmic activity must cease. One aspect of this 'causal link breaking' is to destroy the \"deeply seated propensities, festering predilections\" (asavas) which are karmic causal flow because these lead to rebirth.\n\nIn the Madhyamaka philosophy, to say that an object is \"empty\" is synonymous with saying that it is dependently originated. Nāgārjuna equates emptiness with dependent origination in Mūlamadhyamakakārikā 24.18-19; \nIn his analysis, svabhāva is somewhat redefined from the Sarvastivada-Vaibhāṣika interpretation to mean: \"inherent existence\" or \"self-characterization.\" Nagarjuna notably rejected the idea of \"dharmas\" containing svabhāva, meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If a \"dharma\" was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty. \n\nMadhyamaka is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. In the Tibetan Gelug school, all dharmas are said to lack any \"inherent\" existence, according to the Tibetan scholar Tsongkhapa in his Ocean of Reasoning.\n\nIn the Dzogchen tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the concept of dependent origination is considered to be complementary to the concept of emptiness. Specifically, this tradition emphasizes the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness—also known as the relative and absolute aspects of reality:\n\nIn Mipham Rinpoche's \"Beacon of Certainty\", this relationship is explained using the metaphor of the reflection of the moon in water. According to this metaphor:\n\nOne of the founders of Tibetan Buddhism, Padmasambhava, emphasized his respect for this relationship as follows:\n\nThe Huayan school taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in Indra's net. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based in the tradition of the great Madhyamaka scholar Nagarjuna and, more specifically, on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Regarded by D.T. Suzuki as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the \"Avatamsaka Sutra\" elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.\n\nThich Nhat Hanh states, \"\"Pratitya samutpada\" is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (\"samutpada\") and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: \"Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall.\" In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for the idea that there is no first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause.\n\nSogyal Rinpoche states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence, states Rinpoche.\n\nJay L. Garfield states that Mulamadhyamikakarika uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments. Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one's experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.\n\nThe concept of \"pratītyasamutpāda\" has also been compared to Western metaphysics, the study of reality. Schilbrack states that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all. Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is most often translated as \"person\", and as such is sometimes confused with hypostasis, which is sometimes also translated as \"person.\" Prosopon originally meant \"face\" or \"mask\" and derives from Greek theatre, in which actors on a stage wore masks to reveal their character and emotional state to the audience. Both prosopon and hypostasis played central roles in the development of theology about the Trinity and about Jesus Christ (Christology) in the debates of the fourth through seventh centuries.\n\nThe term \"prosopon\" is used for \"the self-manifestation of an individual\" that can be extended by means of other things. For example, a painter includes his brush within his own prosopon. (Grillmeier, 126)\n\nSt. Paul uses the term when speaking of his direct apprehension in the heart of the Face (prosopon) of Christ (II Cor 4:6).\n\nProsopon is the form in which hypostasis appears. Every hypostasis has its own proper prosopon: face or countenance. It gives expression to the reality of the hypostasis with its powers and characteristics. (Grillmeier, 431)\n\nTwo distinct Antiochene Christologists, Theodore of Mopsuestia, followed by his disciple Nestorius, supported the prosopic union of the two natures (physis) of Jesus Christ rather than the accepted hypostatic union.\n\nTheodore of Mopsuestia maintained a vision of Christ that saw a prosopic union of the divine and human. This was a union where Jesus was only a man indissolubly united to God through the permanent indwelling of the Logos. (Grillmeir, 428-39) He believed the incarnation of Jesus represents an indwelling of the spirit of God that is separate from the indwelling experienced by the Old Testament prophets or New Testament apostles. Jesus was viewed as a human being who shared the divine sonship of the Logos; the Logos united himself to Jesus from the moment of Jesus' conception. After the resurrection, the human Jesus and the Logos reveal that they have always been one prosopon. (Norris, 25)\n\nTheodore addresses the prosopic union in applying prosopon to Christ. He accounts for two expressions of Christ – human and divine. Yet, he does not mean Christ achieved a unity of the two expressions through the formation of a third prosopon, but that one prosopon is produced by the Logos giving his own countenance to the assured man. (Grillmeier, 432) He interprets the unity of God and man in Christ along the lines of the body-soul unity. Prosopon plays a special part in his interpretation of Christ. He rejected the Hypostasis concept – believing it to be a contradiction of Christ’s true nature. He espoused that, in Christ, both body and soul had to be assumed. Christ assumed a soul and by the grace of God brought it to immutability and to a full dominion over the sufferings of the body. (Grillmeier, 424-27)\n\nNestorius furthered Theodore’s belief in the prosopic union as thus: \"prosopon is the appearance of the ousia: the prosopon makes known the ousia.\" The two prosopa are united \"In Christ… the one prosopon does not belong to a nature or hypostasis which arose through the natural union of Godhead and manhood, but to the unity of the two unconfused natures.\" (Grillmeier, 510)\n\nNestorian notion of \"two persons\" (prosopic duality) caused heated debates among Christian theologians in the first half of the 5th century, resulting in official condemnation of such views. The Third Ecumenical Council (431) affirmed the teaching of \"One Person\" of Jesus Christ, condemning all other teachings. The Fourth Ecumenical Council (451) reaffirmed the notion of One Person of Jesus Christ, formulating the famous Chalcedonian Definition with its \"monoprosopic\" (having one person) clauses, and in the same time explicitly denying the validity of \"dyoprosopic\" (having two persons) views.\n\n\n"}

Harriet Ottenheimer (2006), a writer in Linguistic Anthropology, defines a semantic domain as a “specific area of cultural emphasis”.\n\nIn lexicography a semantic domain or semantic field is defined as \"an area of meaning and the words used to talk about it ... For instance English has a domain ‘Rain’, which includes words such as rain, drizzle, downpour, raindrop, puddle.\". Semantic domains are the foundational concept for initial stages of vernacular dictionary building projects. This uses techniques such as the Dictionary Development Process (DDP), RapidWords, or software such as WeSay or FLEx. These techniques rely on extensive lists of semantic domains that are relevant to vernacular languages.\n\nIn the social sciences, the concept of semantic domains stemmed from the ideas of cognitive anthropology. The quest was originally to see how the words that groups of humans use to describe certain things are relative to the underlying perceptions and meanings that those groups share (Ottenheimer, 2006, p. 18). Ethnosemantics became the field that concentrated around the study of these semantic domains, and more specifically the study of how categorization and context of words and groups of words reflected the ways that different cultures categorize words into speech and assign meaning to their language.\n\nMany sports have specific semantic domains that entail terminology that is specific to that particular sport. In order to understand the meanings of these terms one would need to understand the context and domain of that sport. For instance, in basketball there are many words that are specific to the sport. Free throw, court, half court, three pointer, and point guard are all terms that are specific to the sport of basketball. These words make very little sense when used outside of the semantic domain of basketball.\n\nAnother example of a semantic domain would be a coffee shop. The words latte, cappucino, or Starbucks probably would not be understood unless one could associate this language with the semantic domain of a coffee shop.\n\nGugeon, J.A., Linde, C., (1980). \"On The Independence of Discourse Structure and Semantic Domain\".

The poem is usually recited during a Mawlid event. The poem is popular among Hadhrami descents, especially of Sayyids in Hadhramaut, in the island of Java and in the towns of Lamu, Mambrui and Mombasa.\n\nHabib Ali bin Muhammad bin Husin al-Habshi was born on Friday November 17, 1843 CE (24 Shawwal 1259 AH) in Qasam, a town in Hadhramaut. He grew up under the care and supervision of both his father, Muhammad bin Husin bin Abdullah Al Habshi and mother, Syarifah Alawiyyah bint Al-Hussain bin Ahmad Al-Hadi Al-Jufri, who at the time was known as a piety woman.\n\nAt a very young age, Ali had studied and finished reciting al-Quran and successfully mastered the outward and inward knowledge before reaching the age that is usually required for that. Since then, he was consented to by the teachers and instructors to give lectures and studies in public, and in short time he became the center of attention and admiration and a place of honor in the hearts of every person in his town. He was handed the responsibility to teach at educational institutions and at large meetings.\n\nFurthermore, he also collected, directed and educated his students to acquire knowledge, as well as to inspire them in the pursuit of high ideals and noble. To accommodate them, he built a mosque called \"al-Riyadh\" in Seiyun, as well as boarding schools which were equipped with various facilities to meet their needs, so that they can study in peace and quiet, free from all disturbing thoughts, especially those concerned with the needs of everyday life.\n\nAli died in Seiyun,on Sunday March 7, 1915 CE (20 Rabi al-Akhir 1333 AH) and survived by sons who have obtained the best education of his own, who continued his ideals in preaching and disseminating Islam. Among his sons, his youngest son Habib Alwi bin Ali Al-Habshi was well known in Indonesia as he founded \"al-Riyadh\" mosque for his father namesake in Pasar Kliwon, Surakarta as well as to hold the \"Simtud Durar\" mawlid for the first time in the country.\n\nThe book \"Simtud-Durar\" (literally means \"A Necklace of Pearls\") is written by al-Habib ‘Ali bin Muhammad al-Habshi when he was at the age of 68 years. He started to write the poem on March 19, 1909 CE (26 Safar 1327 AH). Habib 'Ali dictated the initial paragraph of the Simtud Durar by saying basmalah.\n\nIn the beginning of Rabi 'al-Awwal 1327 AH (around April 1909 CE), he ordered his students to read the poem. He opened it with great Fatiha. Then on Wednesday night, 9 Rabi al Awwal, he began reading the masterpiece at his home after it was perfected. He said, \"The poem is very touching, after having just finished\".\n\nThe poem is similar to Qasida, but mostly in the form of two-column stanza. It consists of 15 chapters which contain the history in poetic prose and praises of the Prophet. In chapter one it starts with Salawat poem.\n\nThe poem is recited during a Mawlid or other similar events. Usually the recitation is started by one person and after finishing one chapter the book is passed along to another person next to him to continue reciting it. Sometimes people recite it while sway to and from as if in spiritual ecstasy.

The central thesis of skeptical theism is that it would not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being's reasons for permitting evils to be beyond human comprehension. That is, what may seem like pointless evils may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils. This central thesis may be argued from a theistic perspective, but is also argued to defend positions of agnosticism.\n\nSkeptical theism can be an informally held belief based on theistic doctrine, but the origin of the term 'skeptical theist' is a 1996 paper by agnostic Purdue Philosopher Paul Draper, \"\"The Skeptical Theist\". Following Draper's publication, the term 'skeptical theism' was adopted in academic philosophy and has developed into a family of positions supporting skeptical theism's central skeptical thesis; we should remain skeptical of claims that human beings can discern God's reasons for evils. One argument is based on analogy, likening our understanding of God's motives to those of a child grasping a parent's reasons for seeking painful medical treatment, for example. Other approaches are the limitations on the human ability to understand the moral realm, and appeals to epistemic factors such as sensitivity or contextual requirements.\n\nIn the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is not a broad skepticism toward human knowledge of God, but is instead putatively presented as a response to philosophical propositions, such as those focused on drawing \"all things considered\" inductive conclusions about God's motives from perceived circumstances. Additionally, skeptical theism is not a position used to defend all forms of theism, though it is most often presented in the defense of orthodox Christian theism. Moreover, skeptical theism is not supported by all theists and some who support its skeptical positions are not theists.\n\nIn philosophy, skeptical theism is a defense of theistic or agnostic positions argued to undercut a crucial premise in the atheology argument from evil, a claim that God could have no good reasons for allowing certain types of evil. It is also presented in response to other atheological arguments claiming to know God's purposes based on circumstances, such as the argument from divine hiddenness .\n\nArgument from evil is an atheological argument asserting that some evils in the world are pointless or gratuitous evils representing evidence against the existence of the orthodox Christian God.\n\nAtheological is the atheistic equivalent to the word theological.\n\nGod (capitalized), for the purposes of skeptical theism is the omniscient (all knowing), omnibenevolent (all good) and omnipotent (all powerful) God of orthodox Christianity.\n\nGratuitous evil is evil permitted to occur in the word, but for which God is argued to have no morally sufficient reason for permitting. It is also sometimes called 'pointless evil' or 'inscrutable evil'.\n\nNoseeum Inference is a philosophical term describing the position asserting that an atheologian's inability to think of a justification for God to permit an evil means it is likely that there is no possible reason.\n\nTheodicies, are theological positions seeking to fully reconcile apparent evils in the world with the existence of the Christian God.\n\nIn the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is the position that we should be skeptical of our ability to assess God's motivations or lack of motivation from our perceptions of the circumstances we observe in the world. As originally proposed by the agnostic Purdue Philosopher Paul Draper the position argues that human cognitive faculties should be insufficient to permit drawing inductive inferences concerning God's reasons or lack of reasons for permitting perceived evils. The position is often argued, seeking to undercut a key premise in the evidential argument from evil.\n\nThe evidential argument from evil asserts that the amount, types, or distribution of evils, provide an evidential basis for concluding that God's existence is improbable. The argument has a number of formulation, but can be stated in the Modus ponens logical form:\n\nIn this logical form the conclusion (3) is true, if both the major premise (1) and minor premise (2) are true. Philosophers have challenged both premises, but skeptical theism focus is on the minor premise (2).\n\nIn 1979, the Philosopher William Rowe provided a defense of the minor premise (2). He argued that no state of affairs we know of is such that an omnipotent, omniscient being’s obtaining it would morally justify that being’s permitting some instances of horrific suffering. Therefore, Rowe concludes, it is likely that no state of affairs exists that would morally justify that being in permitting such suffering. In other words, Rowe argues that his inability to think of a good reason why God would allow a particular evil justifies the conclusion that there is no such reason, and the conclusion that God does not exist.\n\nThe Philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the Philosopher William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil:Some evidential arguments from evil ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically dubious. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move.\n\nSkeptical theism provides a defense against the evidential argument from evil, but does not take a position on God’s \"actual\" reason for allowing a particular instance of evil. The defense seeks to show that there are good reasons to believe that God \"could\" have justified reasons for allowing a particular evil that we cannot discern. Consequently, we are in no position to endorse the minor premise (2) of the argument from evil because we cannot be more than agnostic about the accuracy of the premise. This conclusion would be an undercutting defeater for the premise because there would be no justification for the conclusion that evils in our world are gratuitous. To justify this conclusion, the skeptical theist argues that the limits of human cognitive faculties are grounds for skepticism about our ability to draw conclusions about God's motives or lack of motives; it is therefor reasonable to doubt the second premise. Bergmann and Rae thus concluded that Rowe's inference is unsound.\n"}

{"id": "235032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235032", "title": "Thou", "text": "Thou\n\nThe word thou () is a second person singular pronoun in English. It is now largely archaic, having been replaced in most contexts by \"you\". It is used in parts of Northern England and in Scots (), and also in rural parts of Newfoundland albeit as a recessive feature. \"Thou\" is the nominative form; the oblique/objective form is thee (functioning as both accusative and dative), the possessive is thy (adjective) or thine (adjective before a vowel or pronoun) and the reflexive is thyself. When \"thou\" is the grammatical subject of a finite verb in the indicative mood, the verb form typically ends in \"-(e)st\" (e.g., \"thou goest\"; \"thou do(e)st\"), but in some cases just \"-t\" (e.g., \"thou art\"; \"thou shalt\"), although in some dialects of Old English (mainly in the North), this verb form ended in -s, hence the Quaker habit of using what looks like the third person form of the verb with \"thee\" as the subject (paralleling the usage of \"you\").\n\nOriginally, \"thou\" was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun \"ye\", derived from an ancient Indo-European root. In Middle English, \"thou\" was sometimes abbreviated by putting a small \"u\" over the letter thorn: þͧ. Starting in the 1300s, \"thou\" was used to express intimacy, familiarity or even disrespect, while another pronoun, \"you\", the oblique/objective form of \"ye\", was used for formal circumstances (see T–V distinction). In the 17th century, \"thou\" fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in regional dialects of England and Scotland, as well as in the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry.\n\nEarly English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to God in French (in Protestantism both in past and present, in Catholicism since the post-Vatican II reforms), German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, Turkish, Lithuanian, and Scottish Gaelic (all of which maintain the use of an \"informal\" singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the King James Version of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic and Koine Greek between singular and plural second person pronouns and verb forms, so they used \"thou\", \"thee\", \"thy\", and \"thine\" for singular, and \"ye\", \"you\", \"your\", and \"yours\" for plural.\n\nIn standard modern English, \"thou\" continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language and in certain fixed phrases such as \"fare thee well\". For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of \"thou\" and \"ye\" through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as \"yinz\", \"yous\" and \"y'all\" or the colloquial \"you guys\". \"Ye\" remains common in some parts of Ireland but these examples just given vary regionally and are usually restricted to colloquial speech.\n\nBecause \"thou\" has passed out of common use, its traditional forms are often confused by those imitating archaic speech.\n\nThe English personal pronouns have standardized declension according to the following table:\nVerb forms used after \"thou\" generally end in \"-est\" (pronounced or ) or \"-st\" in the indicative mood in both the present and the past tenses. These forms are used for both strong and weak verbs.\n\nTypical examples of the standard present and past tense forms follow. The \"e\" in the ending is optional; early English spelling had not yet been standardized. In verse, the choice about whether to use the \"e\" often depended upon considerations of meter.\n\n\nModal verbs also have \"-(e)st\" added to their forms:\n\nA few verbs have irregular \"thou\" forms:\n\nIn Proto-English, the second-person singular verb inflection was \"-es\". This came down unchanged from Indo-European and can be seen in quite distantly related Indo-European languages: Russian знаешь, \"znayesh\", thou knowest; Latin \"amas\", thou lovest. (This is parallel to the history of the third-person form, in Old English -eþ, Russian, знает, \"znayet\", he knoweth, Latin \"amat\" he loveth.) The anomalous development from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related German and West Frisian languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the consonant of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du → liebstu → liebst du (lovest thou). The three languages belong to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages, of which West Frisian is the closest to English.\nIn Dutch, the equivalent of \"thou\", \"du\", also became archaic and fell out of use and was replaced by the Dutch equivalent of \"you\", \"gij\" (later \"jij\" or \"u\"), just as it has in English, with the place of the informal plural taken by \"jullie\" (\"cf.\" English \"you people, you guys\").\n\nIn the subjunctive and imperative moods, the ending in \"-(e)st\" is dropped (although it is generally retained in \"thou wert\", the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb \"to be\"). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after \"if\" and the poetic \"and\".\n\nIn modern regional English dialects that use \"thou\" or some variant, such as in Yorkshire, it often takes the third person form of the verb \"-s\". This comes from a merging of Early Modern English second person singular ending \"-st\" and third person singular ending \"-s\" into \"-s\" (the latter a southern variation of \"-þ\" (\"-th\")).\n\nThe present indicative form \"art\" (\"þu eart\") goes back to West Saxon Old English (see OED \"s.v. be\" IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (\"e.g.\" in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from the North, \"cf.\" Icelandic \"þú ert\". For its ultimate origin, see OED \"be\", etymology section i.ε/ζ. The preterite indicative of \"be\" is generally \"thou wast\".\n\n\"Thou\" originates from Old English , and ultimately via Grimm's law from the Proto-Indo-European *\"tu\", with the expected Germanic vowel lengthening in accented monosyllabic words with an open syllable. \"Thou\" is therefore cognate with Icelandic and Old Norse , German and Continental Scandinavian , Latin and all major Romance languages, Irish, Kurdish, Lithuanian and Latvian or , Greek (), Slavic ты / \"ty\" or ти / \"ti\", Armenian (/), Hindi तू (), Bengali: তুই (\"tui\"), Persian () and Sanskrit त्वम् (). A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.\nThe second person pronouns in Uralic languages such as Finnish and Hungarian are also similar.\n\nIn Old English, \"thou\" was governed by a simple rule: \"thou\" addressed one person, and \"ye\" more than one. Beginning in the 1300's \"thou\" was gradually replaced by the plural \"ye\" as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, \"thou\" remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.\n\nThe practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the T–V distinction and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing kings and other aristocrats in the plural. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, \"tu\" was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form \"vous\" was reserved and formal.\n\nFairly suddenly in the 17th century, \"thou\" began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in regional dialects of England and Scotland farther from London, as well as in the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of \"thou\" in the 17th century include the increasing identification of \"you\" with \"polite society\" and the uncertainty of using \"thou\" for inferiors versus \"you\" for superiors (with \"you\" being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.\n\nIn the 18th century, Samuel Johnson, in \"A Grammar of the English Tongue\", wrote: \"in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular\", implying that \"thou\" was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while \"you\" could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the West Midlands (specifically, Lichfield, Staffordshire), where the usage of \"thou\" persists until the present day, see below, so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of southern British English, \"thou\" had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650. \"Thou\" persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T–V distinction.\n\nOne notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns \"thou\", \"thy\", and \"thee\" is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of Early Modern English texts, such as many character interactions in Shakespeare's plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use \"thou\" (rather than \"you\") when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.\n\nMany European languages contain verbs meaning \"to address with the informal pronoun\", such as German \"duzen\", the Norwegian noun \"dus\" refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the De/Dem/Deres formal forms in common use, French \"tutoyer\", Spanish \"tutear\", Swedish \"dua\", Dutch \"jijen en jouen\", Russian \"тыкать (tykat')\", Polish \"tykać\", Romanian \"tutui\", Hungarian \"tegezni\" etc. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh in 1603, when Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to insult Raleigh by saying,\n\nhere using \"thou\" as a verb meaning \"to call (someone) \"thou\" or \"thee\"\". Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in Yorkshire dialect for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:\n\nAnd similar in Lancashire dialect:\n\nSee further the Wiktionary page on \"thou\" as a verb.\n\nAs William Tyndale translated the Bible into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his Hebrew and Greek originals. He used \"thou\" for the singular and \"ye\" for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the addressee. Tyndale's usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier Wycliffe's Bible and the later King James Bible. But as the use of \"thou\" in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century, its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation.\n\nThe 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\", which is still the authorized form of worship in the Church of England, also uses the word \"thou\" to refer to the singular second person.\n\nQuakers formerly used \"thee\" as an ordinary pronoun; the stereotype has them saying \"thee\" for both nominative and accusative cases. This was started at the beginning of the Quaker movement by George Fox, who called it \"plain speaking\", as an attempt to preserve the egalitarian familiarity associated with the pronoun. Most Quakers have abandoned this usage. At its beginning, the Quaker movement was particularly strong in the northwestern areas of England and particularly in the north Midlands area. The preservation of \"thee\" in Quaker speech may relate to this history. Modern Quakers who choose to use this manner of \"plain speaking\" often use the \"thee\" form without any corresponding change in verb form, for example, \"is thee\" or \"was thee\".\n\nIn Latter-day Saint prayer tradition, the terms \"thee\" and \"thou\" are always and exclusively used to address God, as a mark of respect.\n\nIn many of the Quranic translations, particularly those compiled by the Ahmadiyya sect in Islam, the terms \"thou\" and \"thee\" are used. One particular example is The Holy Quran - Arabic Text and English translation, translated by Maulvi Sher Ali.\n\nIn the English translations of the scripture of the Bahá'í Faith, the terms \"thou\" and \"thee\" are also used. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the religion in the first half of the 20th century, adopted a style that was somewhat removed from everyday discourse when translating the texts from their original Arabic or Persian to capture some of the poetic and metaphorical nature of the text in the original languages and to convey the idea that the text was to be considered holy.\n\nThe Revised Standard Version of the Bible, which first appeared in 1946, retained the pronoun \"thou\" exclusively to address God, using \"you\" in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would be familiar to those who knew the King James Version and read the Psalms and similar text in devotional use. The New American Standard Bible (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 Revised English Bible dropped all forms of \"thou\" that had appeared in the earlier New English Bible (1970). The New Revised Standard Version (1989) omits \"thou\" entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of \"thou\" in Bible translation to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity. When referring to God, \"thou\" is often capitalized for clarity and reverence.\n\nLike his contemporaries William Shakespeare uses \"thou\" both in the intimate, French style sense, and also to emphasize differences of rank, but he is by no means consistent in using the word, and friends and lovers sometimes call each other \"ye\" or \"you\" as often as they call each other \"thou\", sometimes in ways that can be analysed for meaning, but often apparently at random.\n\nFor example, in the following passage from \"Henry IV\", Shakespeare has Falstaff use both forms with Henry. Initially using \"you\" in confusion on waking he then switches to a comfortable and intimate \"thou\".\n\nWhile in \"Hamlet\", Shakespeare uses discordant second person pronouns to express Hamlet's antagonism towards his mother.\n\nExcept where everyday use survives in some regions of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested by the use of \"thou\" has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn ritual occasions, in readings from the King James Bible, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as God, a skylark, Achilles, and even \"The Mighty Thor\". In \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Darth Vader addresses the Emperor with the words: \"What is thy bidding, my master?\" In Leonard Cohen's song \"Bird on the Wire\", he promises his beloved that he'll reform, saying \"I will make it all up to thee.\" The Kaiser Chiefs song \"I Predict a Riot\" is mentioned below. In Diana Ross's song \"Upside Down\" (written by Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards) we hear the lyric \"Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'.\" These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; or in the case of \"Upside Down\", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy. \n\nMost modern writers have no experience using \"thou\" in daily speech; they are therefore vulnerable to confusion of the traditional verb forms. The most common mistake in artificially archaic modern writing is the use of the old third person singular ending \"-eth\" with \"thou\", for example \"thou thinketh\". The conversethe use of the second person singular ending \"-est\" for the third person—also occurs (\"So sayest Thor!\"spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern parody and pastiche in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms \"thou\" and \"thee\" are often transposed.\n\nIn the fictional teenage argot nadsat, invented for Anthony Burgess's novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" (and the film adaptation), Alex and his \"droogs\" regularly use \"thou\", which fits in with their semi-Edwardian clothing. For example, when fighting a rival gang, Alex addresses them thus (note the mixing of \"you\" and \"thou\" for the second person):\n\nSome translators render the T–V distinction in English with \"thou\" and \"you\", particularly in places where \"you\" appears in the place of expected \"thou\", or vice versa. This practice has largely fallen out of use. Ernest Hemingway, in his novel \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", uses the forms \"thou\" and \"you\" in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the Spanish language in which both formal (\"usted\") and familiar (\"tú\") second-person pronouns still exist.\n\nIn reading passages with \"thou\" and \"thee\", many modern readers stress the pronouns and the verb endings. Traditionally, however, the \"e\" in \"-est\" ought to be unstressed, and \"thou\" and \"thee\" should be no more stressed than \"you\".\n\n\"You\" is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, \"thou\" has persisted, and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as y'all in the Southern United States. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language.\n\nIn traditional dialects, \"thou\" is used in the counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, Durham, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire and some western parts of Nottinghamshire. Such dialects normally also preserve distinct verb forms for the singular second person, for example \"thee coost\" (standard English: \"you could\", archaic: \"thou couldst\") in northern Staffordshire. The word \"thee\" is used in the East Shropshire dialect which is now largely confined to the Dawley area of Telford and referred to as the Dawley dialect. Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved. The possessive is often written as \"thy\" in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed \"tha\", and the possessive form of \"tha\" has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming \"yours\" or the local word \"your'n\" (from \"your one\"):\n\nThe apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective and genitive forms of this pronoun on the one hand and the modern possessive form on the other may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing \"tha\" to fall into disuse; however, a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.\n\nSome other variants are specific to certain areas. In Sheffield, the pronunciation of the word was somewhere in between a /d/ and a /th/ sound, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth; this led to the nickname of the \"dee-dahs\" for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, \"ta\" was used as an unstressed shortening of \"thou\", which can be found in the song \"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\". These variants are no longer in use.\n\nIn rural North Lancashire between Lancaster and the North Yorkshire border 'tha' is preserved in colloquial phrases such as \"What would \"tha\" like for \"thi\" tea?\" (What would you like for your dinner), and appen \"tha\" waint\" (\"perhaps you won't\"happen being the dialect word for perhaps) and \"tha knows\" (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.\n\nThe use of the word \"thee\" in the hit song \"I Predict a Riot\" by Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs (\"Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee\") caused some comment by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the Yorkshire dialect.\n\nThe use of the phrase \"tha knows\" has been widely used in various songs by Arctic Monkeys, a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. Alex Turner, the band's lead singer, has also often replaced words with \"tha knows\" during live versions of the songs. His election to sing in his native Sheffield accent and their overall revival of the dialect has been met with positive feedback and critical acclaim.\n\nThe use persists somewhat in the West Country dialects, albeit somewhat affected. Some of the Wurzels songs include \"Drink Up Thy Zider\" and \"Sniff Up Thy Snuff\".\n\n\"Thoo\" has also been used in the Orcadian Scots dialect in place of the singular informal \"thou\". In Shetlandic, the other form of Insular Scots, \"du\" and \"de\" are used. The word \"thou\" has been reported in the North Northern Scots dialect of Cromarty as being in common use in the first half of the 20th century and now only in occasional use.\n\nThe word \"thou\" can occasionally be heard in films recorded in certain English dialect. In Ken Loach's films \"Kes\", \"The Price of Coal\" and \"Looks and Smiles\", the word is used frequently in the dialogue. It is used occasionally, but much less frequently, in the 1963 film \"This Sporting Life\".\n\nIn the 2018 film \"Peterloo\", the word is used by many of the working-class characters in Lancashire, including Samuel Bamford.\n\nAll forms of \"thou\" appear in ingame dialogues of the \"Souls video game series\" by FromSoftware. The games are settled in late medieval dark fantasy worlds. An earlier example is the original Dragon Quest for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since January 2015, the training at the Monastery has been led by Shugen Roshi, assisted by Ron Hogen Green, Sensei; Jody Hojin Kimmel, Sensei; and Vanessa Zuisei Goddard, Sensei.\n\nThe monastery was originally built as Camp Wapanachki in the 1930s. The massive Arts and Crafts style stone and wood frame former retreat house and chapel was built in two phases between about 1935 and 1938. The four story \"main house\" is the earliest section. It contains living spaces, libraries, a small cellar and a large kitchen. The later section is built of bluestone and contains a dining hall and chapel.\n\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\n\nStudents and residents of the monastery practice according to Daido Roshi's Eight Gates of Zen training matrix. These gates consist of zazen, face-to-face teaching, liturgy, moral and ethical teachings, work practice, body practice, art practice and academic study. Their practice occurs either at home for lay students or at the monastery during weekend retreats and monthly week-long sesshin (meditation intensives). The monastery's schedule includes a Sunday morning program open to the general public and a variety of weekend and week-long Zen training programs, focusing variously on painting, poetry, shakuhachi performance, Japanese archery (kyūdō), qigong, and many other activities.\n\nThe monastery grounds are also home to the Zen Environmental Studies Institute and Dharma Communications, which runs The Monastery Store and publishes \"Mountain Record: The Zen Practitioner's Journal\" and other print, audio, video and online information resources.\n\nIn addition to supporting the lay community, ZMM is home to a number of monastic practitioners. These individuals have taken life vows of simplicity, selflessness, stability, service and accomplishing the Buddha's Way. As a result, they do not work outside the monastery, earn money, or have children. As the Mountain Record states: \"Monastics in the order are entirely dependent on the sangha while maintaining the Monastery for current practitioners and sustaining it for generations to come.\"\n\nZMM is the main house of the Mountains and Rivers Order, an umbrella organization inspired by the teachings of Dogen as found in the Mountains and Rivers Sutra. Founded by John Daido Loori in 1980, it includes the following branches:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37539855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37539855", "title": "Zen lineage charts", "text": "Zen lineage charts\n\nZen lineage charts depict the transmission of the dharma from one generation to another. They developed during the Tang Dynasty, incorporating elements from Indian Buddhism and East Asian Mahayana Buddhism, but were first published at the end of the Tang.\n\nThe idea of a patriarchal lineage in Chan dates back to the epitaph for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch, Daman Hongren (弘忍 601–674). In the \"Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices\" and the \"Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks\", Daoyu and Dazu Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.\n\nIn the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan lineage was developed:\nAccording to McRae, the schema developed over the course of several centuries. It is a combined product of Indian and Chinese culture, which inherited elements \"from the larger tradition of East Asian Mahayana Buddhism\" such as the seven Buddhas of the past:\n\nThe complete system was published perhaps as early as 801 but certainly by the year 952.\n\nD. T. Suzuki contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had \"no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism\" and that Chan historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.\n\nThe earliest descriptions of the Chán-lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Śākyamuni Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Śākyamuni Buddha is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of the Chán school. The Denkoroku, \"Transmission of the Light\", written by Keizan, gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission:\n\nThe earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. There is no generally accepted 7th Chinese Patriarch.\n\nThe principle teachers of the Chan, Seon and Zen traditions are commonly known in the first English translations as Patriarchs; however, the current trend is to use the more precise terminology of \"Ancestors\" or \"Founders\" (祖) and \"Ancestral Masters\" or \"Founding Masters\" (祖師) as the original terms are gender neutral. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:\n\nThe period of Dayi Daoxin ( 580–651) and Daman Hongren ( 601–674) came to be called the East Mountain Teaching, due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huamgmei. The term was used by Yuquan Shenxiu, the most important successor to Hongren.\n\nYuquan Shenxiu (神秀 606?-706) was the most important successor to Daman Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by Wu Zetian, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period.\n\nAccording to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, Huineng (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chan history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor.\n\nShenhui, a successor to Huineng, claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren instead of the publicly recognized successor Yuquan Shenxiu. The most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was Guifeng Zongmi Shenhui's influence is traceable in the \"Platform Sutra\", which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng, but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Shenhui himself does not figure in the \"Platform Sutra\"; he was effectively written out of Chan history.\n\nThe details of Shítóu's life are found in traditional biographies. Scholar Mario Poceski writes that Shítóu does not appear to have been influential or famous during his lifetime. Sayings to the effect that Shitou and Mazu Daoyi were the two great masters of their day date from decades after their respective deaths. Shítóu's retrospective prominence owes much to the importance of Dongshan Liangjie, a 9th-century teacher who traced his lineage back to Shítóu.\n\nTraditionally, Mazu Daoyi is depicted as a successor in the lineage of Huineng, since his teacher Nanyue Huairang is regarded as a student and successor of Huineng. This connection between Huineng and Nanyue Huairang is doubtful, being the product of later rewritings of Chan history to place Mazu Daoyi in the traditional lineages.\n\nMazu Daoyi is perhaps the most influential teaching master in the formation of Chan Buddhism. While Chan became the dominant school of Buddhism during the Song dynasty, the later Tang dynasty and Mazu Daoyi's Hongzhou school became regarded as the \"golden age\" of Chan. The An Lushan Rebellion (755-763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, and metropolitan Chan began to lose its status while \"other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunnersof the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng.\"\n\nDuring the Song the \"Five Houses (Ch. 五家) of Chán\", or five \"schools\", were recognized. These were not originally regarded as \"schools\" or \"sects\", but based on the various Chán-genealogies. Historically they have come to be understood as \"schools\".\n\nThe Five Houses of Chán are:\n\nThe Guiyang school (潙仰宗 Guíyáng, Jpn. Igyō) was the first established school of the Five Houses of Zen. Guiyang is named after master Guishan Lingyou (771–854) (Kuei-shan Ling-yu, Jpn. Isan Reiyū) and his student, Yangshan Huiji (807-883, or 813–890) (Yang-shan Hui-chi, Jpn. Kyōzan Ejaku). After founding the Guiyang School, Yangshan moved his school to what is now modern Jiangxi.\n\nThe Guiyang school was distinct from the other schools due to its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery in the school's kōans and other teachings.\n\nVia Xuefeng Yicun the Fayang school and Yunmen school are traced back to Shitou Xiqian and Huineng. Xuefeng was one of the most influential Chán-teachers at the end of the Tang Dynasty, when \"a widely influential zen center formed around Xuefeng Yicun\". The loss of control by the Tang Dynasty, and the accompanying loss of support for Buddhist institutions, lead to a regionally based Chan of Xuefeng and his students.\n\nThe \"Zutang ji\" (祖堂集 \"Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall), compiled in 952, the first document which mentions Linji Yixuan, was written to support the Xuefeng Yicun lineage. It pictures this lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school, though Xuefeng Yicun's lineage is traced back to Shitou Xiqian (700-790). It was written by two students of Zhaoqing Wendeng (884-972), a dharma descendant of Xuefeng Yicun.\n\nDuring the Northern Song (960–1127), the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now Kaifeng) and the dynasty controlled most of inner China. The Fayan school was the first faction to gain recognition at the Song court, due to the influence of the buddhist scholar-official Zanning (919-1001). After his death this position was taken over by the linji-faction.\n\nThe linji-school of the Song Dynasty brought together the classical elements of Zen:\n\nAll of these elements, which shaped the picture of the iconoclastic Zen-master who transmits a wordless truth, were shaped by and dependent on \"literary\" products that shaped the Traditional Zen Narrative which furthered the position of the Linji-school. This narrative did not describe the actual Chán-practice, neither of the Song-Dynasty, nor of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nAccording to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (首山省念) (926-993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The \"Tiansheng Guangdeng lu\" (天聖廣燈錄), \"Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record\", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗) (988-1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the Hongzhou school of Mazu Daoyi, displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage. It also established the slogan of \"a special transmission outside the teaching\", supporting the Linji-school claim of \"Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings\".\n\nThe Caodong school was founded by Dongshan Liangjie and his Dharma-heirs in the 9th century.\n\nTwenty-four different Zen-lineages are recorded to be transmitted to Japan. Only three survived until today. Sōtō was transmitted to Japan by Dogen, who travelled to China for Chan training in the 13th century CE. After receiving Dharma transmission in the Caodong line he returned to Japan and established the Sōtō line. The Linji line was also transmitted to Japan several times, where it became known as the Rinzai line.\n\nThough Dōgen emphasized the importance of the purity of the teachings, and highly valued lineage and dharma transmission, the Soto-school has its origins in various lineages and dharma transmissions. Dogen received dharma transmission from his Chinese teacher Rujing, with whom he studied two years, but in medieval Soto he was also considered to be a dharma heir of Myōzen, a Rinzai-teacher, with whom he studied eight years. And Tettsū Gikai, the dharma-grandson of Dogen, was also lineage-holder of Nōnin, the founder of the Dharuma-shu, also a Rinzai-school. Gikai passed this linegae over to Keizan, who thereby was also lineage-holder in at least two lineages.\n\nTo make the history of Soto even more complicated, the Caodong-lineage that Dogen inherited through Rujing was passed on previously from the Caodong-master Dayang Jingxuan to Touzi Yiqing via the Rinzai-master Fushan Fayuan. Fushan Fayuan had once studied under Dayang Jingxuan. When Jingxuan died Fayuan had received Jingxuan's \"portrait, robe, and a verse that expressed his teaching\", promising \"to pass them on to a suitable successor\". Fayuan chose his student Touzi Yiqing to inherit this lineage, a fact that was acknowledged in Keizan's Denkoroku, but \"[i]n the standard versions of Dogen's writings, however, all direct references to Yiqing's indirect succession have been eliminated\".\n\nThe Linji school was first brought to Japan by Eisai.\n\nThe Otokan lineage was founded by Nanpo Jōmyō 南浦紹明 (1235–1308), who received transmission in China from the monk Xutang Zhiyu 虚堂智愚 (Japanese \"Kido Chigu,\" 1185–1269) in 1265, who then returned to Japan in 1267. It was then spread by his student Shuho Myocho (second generation) and Kanzan Egen (third generation), who made it an influential school.\n\nThe two main schools today are Takujū and Inzan, which both descent from Hakuin.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the World Parliament of Religions in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners, other than the descendants of Asian immigrants, pursuing a serious interest in Zen began to reach a significant level. Especially Japanese Zen has gained popularity in the West. Quintessential in this popularity were the books published by D.T. Suzuki. The various books on Zen by Reginald Horace Blyth, and Alan Watts published between 1950 and 1975, contributed to this growing interest in Zen in the West, as did the interest from beat poets such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder.\n\nThe most successful implementation of Zen-practice was brought about by Shunryu Suzuki, Hakuun Yasutani, and Yasutani's student Taizan Maezumi.\n\nShunryu Suzuki (鈴木 俊隆 \"Suzuki Shunryū\", dharma name \"Shōgaku Shunryū\" 祥岳俊隆, often called Suzuki Roshi) (born May 18, 1904, Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan; died December 4, 1971 in San Francisco, CA, USA) was a Sōtō Zen monk and teacher who helped popularize Zen Buddhism in the United States, and is renowned for founding the first Buddhist monastery outside Asia (Tassajara Zen Mountain Center). Suzuki founded San Francisco Zen Center, which along with its affiliate temples, comprises one of the most influential Zen organizations in the United States. A book of his teachings, \"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\", is one of the most popular books on Zen and Buddhism in the West.\n\n was a Sōtō Rōshi, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan Zen Buddhist organization. The Sanbõ Kyõdan incorporates Rinzai Kōan study as well as much of Soto tradition, a style Yasutani had learned from his teacher Harada Daiun Sogaku. As founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, and teacher of Taizan Maezumi, Yasutani has been one of the most influential persons in bringing Zen practice to the west. Although the membership of Sanbo Kyodan is small, 3,790 registered followers and 24 instructors in 1988, \"the Sanbõkyõdan has had an inordinate influence on Zen in the West\". His westerns students have spread out via Taizan Maezumi.\n\n\n\n"}
