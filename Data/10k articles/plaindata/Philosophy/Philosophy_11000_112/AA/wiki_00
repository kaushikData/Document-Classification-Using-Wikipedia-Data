Unlike a casual relationship, which is a physical and emotional relationship between two people who may have sex without expecting a more formal romantic relationship, an affair is by its nature romantic.\nAffair may also describe part of an agreement within an open marriage or open relationship, such as Swinging, dating, or polyamory, in which some forms of sex with one's non-primary partner(s) are permitted and other forms are not. Participants in open relationships, including unmarried couples and polyamorous families, may consider sanctioned affairs the norm, but when a non-sanctioned affair occurs, it is described as infidelity and may be experienced as adultery, or a betrayal both of trust and integrity, even though to most people it would not be considered \"illicit\".\n\nWhen a romantic affair lacks both overt and covert sexual behavior and yet exhibits intense or enduring emotional intimacy it may be referred to as an emotional affair, platonic love, or a romantic friendship.\n\nExtramarital affairs are relationships outside of marriage where an illicit romantic or sexual relationship or a romantic friendship or passionate attachment occurs.\n\nAn Affair that continues in one form or another for years, even as one of the partners to that affair passes through marriage, divorce and remarriage, could be considered the primary relationship and the marriages secondary to it. Several people claim the reason of extra marital affair as their unsuccessful marriage and that both spouses failed to please each other. This may be serial polygamy or other forms of nonmonogamy.\n\nThe ability to pursue serial and clandestine extramarital affairs while safeguarding other secrets and conflict of interest inherent in the practice, requires skill in deception and duplicitous negotiation. Even to hide one affair requires a degree of skill or malicious gaslighting. All these behaviors are more usually called lying.\n\nDeception can be defined as the \"covert manipulation of perception to alter thoughts, feelings, or beliefs\". The presence of deception may indicate the degree to which the deceiver has breached fundamental conditions of fidelity, of reciprocal vulnerability and of transparency. Sometimes these are explicit or assumed pre-conditions of a committed intimate relationship.\n\nIndividuals having affairs with married men or women can be prosecuted for adultery in some jurisdictions and can be sued by the jilted spouses in others, or named as 'co-respondent' in divorce proceedings. As of 2009, eight U.S. states permitted such alienation of affections lawsuits.\n\nThe appearance of computer-mediated communication introduces a new type of communication and consequently a new type of \"affair\". There are various kinds of computer-mediated communication that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people, and communicating in synchronous or asynchronous formats. Online affairs combine features of close and remote relationships. \n\nBen Ze'ef argues that an online affair is a unique kind of affair—termed \"detached attachment\", or just \"detachment\"—that includes opposing features whose presence in a face-to-face affair would be paradoxical. Like direct, face-to-face affairs, online affairs can be spontaneous and casual and show intensive personal involvement. However, online affairs can also be more of a planned discourse than spontaneous talk; like written letters, online messages can be stored and thus have permanent presence, which is absent from face-to-face affairs. \n\nPeople participating in online affairs may be strangers to each other in the sense that they have never actually met each other. However, they are also close to each other since they share intimate information. In online affairs, people try to enjoy the benefits of both close and remote affairs, while avoiding their flaws. People enjoy the highly valued products of close affairs while paying the low cost of remote affairs. As one woman wrote: 'He constantly told me that he can not provide me with what I would want and I would always respond with: \"I'm not asking anything from you, but simply enjoy your company\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the particular method used that is able to follow completely through to trace steps or take point by point a series of found truths in a contingent, ordered search that reaches an end position. This process can take the form of a mental record, a physical marking, or even a philosophical debate; it is the process itself that assumes the name.\n\nThe key element to applying Ariadne's thread to a problem is the creation and maintenance of a record - physical or otherwise - of the problem's available and exhausted options at all times. This record is referred to as the \"thread\", regardless of its actual medium. The purpose the record serves is to permit backtracking - that is, reversing earlier decisions and trying alternatives. Given the record, applying the algorithm is straightforward:\n\n\nThis algorithm will terminate upon either finding a solution or marking all initial choices as failures; in the latter case, there is no solution. If a thorough examination is desired even though a solution has been found, one can revert to the previous decision, mark the success, and continue on as if a solution were never found; the algorithm will exhaust all decisions and find all solutions.\n\nThe terms \"Ariadne's thread\" and \"trial and error\" are often used interchangeably, which is not necessarily correct. They have two distinctive differences:\n\n\nIn short, trial and error \"approaches\" a desired solution; Ariadne's thread blindly exhausts the search space completely, finding any and all solutions. Each has its appropriate distinct uses. They can be employed in tandem - for example, although the editing of a Wikipedia article is arguably a trial-and-error process (given how in theory it approaches an ideal state), article histories provide the record for which Ariadne's thread may be applied, reverting detrimental edits and restoring the article back to the most recent error-free version, from which other options may be attempted.\n\nObviously, Ariadne's thread may be applied to the solving of mazes in the same manner as the legend; an actual thread can be used as the record, or chalk or a similar marker can be applied to label passages. If the maze is on paper, the thread may well be a pencil.\n\nLogic problems of all natures may be resolved via Ariadne's thread, the maze being but an example. At present, it is most prominently applied to \"Sudoku\" puzzles, used to attempt values for as-yet-unsolved cells. The medium of the thread for puzzle-solving can vary widely, from a pencil to numbered chits to a computer program, but all accomplish the same task. Note that as the compilation of Ariadne's thread is an inductive process, and due to its exhaustiveness leaves no room for actual study, it is largely frowned upon as a solving method, to be employed only as a last resort when deductive methods fail.\n\nArtificial intelligence is heavily dependent upon Ariadne's thread when it comes to game-playing, most notably in programs which play chess; the possible moves are the decisions, game-winning states the solutions, and game-losing states failures. Due to the massive depth of many games, most algorithms cannot afford to apply Ariadne's thread \"entirely\" on every move due to time constraints, and therefore work in tandem with a heuristic that evaluates game states and limits a breadth-first search only to those that are most likely to be beneficial, a trial-and-error process.\n\nEven circumstances where the concept of \"solution\" is not so well defined have had Ariadne's thread applied to them, such as navigating the World Wide Web, making sense of patent law, and in philosophy; \"Ariadne's Thread\" is a popular name for websites of many purposes, but primarily for those that feature philosophical or ethical debate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5318217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5318217", "title": "Chakana", "text": "Chakana\n\nThe chakana (or Inca Cross) is a stepped cross made up of an equal-armed cross indicating the cardinal points of the compass and a superimposed square. The square is suggested to represent the other two levels of existence. The three levels of existence are \"Hana Pacha\" (the upper world inhabited by the superior gods), \"Kay Pacha\", (the world of our everyday existence) and \"Ukhu\" or \"Urin Pacha\" (the underworld inhabited by spirits of the dead, the ancestors, their overlords and various deities having close contact to the Earth plane). The hole through the centre of the cross is the Axis by means of which the shaman transits the cosmic vault to the other levels. It is also said to represent Cusco, the center of the Incan empire, and the Southern Cross constellation.\n\nThe geometry of the symbol has a high degree of symmetry. The symbol can be drawn from a circle. A square is inscribed in the circle, with the corners tangent to the circle. This forms the \"middle step\" of the ladder. A smaller square (tilted 45 degrees) is made from the midpoints of the large square. Connecting the midpoints of the small square and extending the lines to the edge of the circle will form the arms of the cross, otherwise known as the \"first\" and \"last\" steps of the chakana. Lines are drawn from the points the lines exit the circle, to complete the cross. A small circle is made from the diameter of the cross lines. To proof the construction, a separate construction line is drawn from the point where the square corners with the cross rectangles to the same point on the opposite side. If the line is 27 degrees from the vertical, the chakana is properly drawn.\n\nThe mestee historian Garcilaso de la Vega, \"el Ynga\", reports about a holy cross of white and red marble or jasper, which was venerated in 16th-century Cusco. The cross had been kept in a royal house, in a sacred place or \"wak'a\", but the Incas did not worship it. They simply admired it because of its beauty. The cross was square (\"quadrada\"), measuring about two by two feet, its branches three inch wide, the edges carefully squared and the surface brightly polished.\n\nThe Incas began to venerate the holy cross, after they heard how Pedro de Candia had miraculously defied a lion and a tiger holding a cross. When the Spaniards captured the city, they transferred the cross to sacristy of the newly built cathedral, where De la Vega saw it in 1560. He was surprised that the clergy had not decorated it with gold or gems. As we know from Middle America, this may have been part of a deliberate strategy by mendicant friars, trying to adapt to indigenous cultural codes. As a rule, the veneration of the holy cross was a carefully designed ecclesiastical enterprise, incorporating native symbols and reproducing them on sacral level. Most surviving Meso-American crosses do not predate the 16th century. Ongoing stories about indigenous crosses contributed to the idea of a 'natural' religion that would have prepared the Indians for their inevitable conversion to Christianity.\n\nActually, this Andean \"cross\" has been documented in Tiwanaku architecture (Bolivia) dating back to 300 BC and AD 300. Other Andean cultures, Mapuche, whose presence in the Americas also predates Western presence and date back 600 t 500 BC.\n\nThe \"chakana\" is an invented tradition. Although the Chakana as the 'Andean cross', presented as an Inca and pre-Inca symbol bearing cultural, spiritual, or mystical interpretations as expressed in this article, has wide popularity in contemporary Andean culture, its roots are no older than the late 20th century, and the popular version, than 2003. The current Chakana mythos as it impacts the New Age belief system and the Peruvian tourist-oriented economy initiates from the 2003 publication of the book Andean Awakening, authored by Jorge Luis Delgado, and Mary Anne Male. This is the source of the myth. They are followed by such authors as Mark Torra and Roger Calverley (CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School). The archaeoastronomer Carlos Milla Villena published his own, distinctly different speculative interpretations of the chacana as “andean, cross” in Génesis de la cultura andina,1983.\n\nMainstream scientific, scholastic, and archaeological sources do not refer to or support the word chakana as the cross-and-box design - rather, it is in Runasimi, the traditional language of the Inca peoples, (modern Quechua), derived from chaka, 'bridge', and means 'to cross over', or 'a crossing'. Among chroniclers such as the Jesuit missionary and naturalist José de Acosta, 1590, it is applied to the group of stars commonly identified as the Belt of Orion. The chroniclers do not refer to the chakana, or chacana, as the “andean cross,” or as reflecting a symbolical or semiotic tradition.\n\nThe twelve-cornered design itself occasionally appears in pre-contact artifacts such as textiles and ceramics from such cultures as the Wari, Ica, and Tiwanaku, but with no particular emphasis and no key or guide to a means of interpretation.\n\nSome Andeans and Andeanists regard the imposition of this modern “invented tradition\"” as cultural appropriation; the Peruvian author Tupaq Katari writes: “When I hear you foreigners, with ease and lightness talking of the Andean themes, this surprises me, since we here in Peru continually try to find details about our own history, which is very complex and you argue so lightness without a historical or experiential support of what are the Andes and its diversity.”\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4265764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4265764", "title": "Disposition", "text": "Disposition\n\nA disposition is a quality of character, a habit, a preparation, a state of readiness, or a tendency to act in a specified way that may be learned.\n\nThe terms dispositional belief and occurrent belief refer, in the former case, to a belief that is held in the mind but not currently being considered, and in the latter case, to a belief that is currently being considered by the mind.\n\nIn Bourdieu's theory of fields, dispositions are the natural tendencies of each individual to take on a specific position in any field. There is no strict determinism through one's dispositions. The \"habitus\" is the choice of positions according to one's dispositions. However, in retrospect a space of possibles can always be observed.\n\nA disposition is not a process or event in some duration in time, but rather the state, preparation, or tendency of a structure \"in waiting\". In the field of possibilities its actual triggering has a statistical value.\n\nThe debate about dispositions in metaphysics attempts to understand the fundamental nature of properties, including how they relate to laws of nature. The initial question asks if dispositions are real. Realism about dispositions, or dispositionalism, argues that dispositions are causally efficacious properties inherent to objects that are sufficient to produce change. Consider fragility. If a glass is suitably struck, it will break. Fragility is a property of the glass that accounts for this breaking. Paradigmatic examples of dispositional properties include fragility, solubility, and flammability. Dispositionalism maintains that even paradigmatic examples of what appears to be qualitative such as squareness has causal powers (for instance - when combined with the property of hardness - to make a square impression in soft wax). This view is historically argued for by Aristotle and Leibniz. Contemporary proponents include Sydney Shoemaker, U.T Place, Stephen Mumford, Alexander Bird, George Molnar, Brian Ellis.\n\nOthers answer that dispositions are not real properties. Anti-realism about dispositions, or categoricalism, argues that dispositions are ontologically derivative of the interaction categorical (or qualitative) properties and laws. Accordingly calling a glass fragile, is useful shorthand for describing the potential interactions of its microstructure (a categorical property) and the laws of nature; dispositions are not additional elements of being. Since the microstructure and laws are enough to explain fragility, there is no causal role for a dispositional property, here fragility, to play. This view is historically argued for by Descartes, Boyle, Hume and the logical positivists. Contemporary proponents, including David Lewis, David Malet Armstrong, and Jonathan Schaffer, continue in a neo-Humaen, empiricist tradition that argues for categoricalism on the assumption that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences.\n\nMiddle ground views are possible. The most notable is the Limit (or Identity) View defended by Charles B. Martin and John Heil. According to this view, dispositional and categorical - or as Martin prefers: \"qualitative,\" because categorical seems to be misleading - predicates are different ways of identifying one and the same property.[6] Additionally, the properties lies on a spectrum in which it could approach either limit; however, it can never reach either end because those concepts are unrealisable. Ontologically, however, there is no real difference between the two. Fragility, for example, is both a real disposition of glass to break upon being struck and an abstraction from the underlying molecular structure. Squareness, to take another example, is both a quality of having four sides of equal length that meet at equal angles and an abstraction from the fact this property interacts with its environment to leave square impressions on soft wax (when combined with the property ‘hardness’).\nIn law, a disposition is a civil or criminal hearing where a case can be resolved.\n\nIn educational research, a learning disposition are characteristics or attitudes to learning. These may be learned. Some examples are taking responsibility, grit and persistence when faced with problems. \n\nIn Catholic thought, \"disposition\" has two meanings. Firstly, it may refer to a deliberately practised habit of behaving in a certain way, for example, \"a virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good.\" Secondly, it may refer to a state of a person that is required for reception of a sacrament, for example, a disposition of genuine repentance is required for the forgiveness of sins in confession.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "187849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187849", "title": "Fitness (biology)", "text": "Fitness (biology)\n\nFitness (often denoted formula_1 or ω in population genetics models) is the quantitative representation of natural and sexual selection within evolutionary biology. It can be defined either with respect to a genotype or to a phenotype in a given environment. In either case, it describes individual reproductive success and is equal to the average contribution to the gene pool of the next generation that is made by individuals of the specified genotype or phenotype. The fitness of a genotype is manifested through its phenotype, which is also affected by the developmental environment. The fitness of a given phenotype can also be different in different selective environments.\n\nWith asexual reproduction, it is sufficient to assign fitnesses to genotypes. With sexual reproduction, genotypes are scrambled every generation. In this case, fitness values can be assigned to alleles by averaging over possible genetic backgrounds. Natural selection tends to make alleles with higher fitness more common over time, resulting in Darwinian evolution.\n\nThe term \"Darwinian fitness\" can be used to make clear the distinction with physical fitness. Fitness does not include a measure of survival or life-span; Herbert Spencer's well-known phrase \"survival of the fittest\" should be interpreted as: \"Survival of the form (phenotypic or genotypic) that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations.\"\n\nInclusive fitness differs from individual fitness by including the ability of an allele in one individual to promote the survival and/or reproduction of other individuals that share that allele, in preference to individuals with a different allele. One mechanism of inclusive fitness is kin selection.\n\nFitness is often defined as a propensity or probability, rather than the actual number of offspring. For example, according to Maynard Smith, \"Fitness is a property, not of an individual, but of a class of individuals — for example homozygous for allele A at a particular locus. Thus the phrase ’expected number of offspring’ means the average number, not the number produced by some one individual. If the first human infant with a gene for levitation were struck by lightning in its pram, this would not prove the new genotype to have low fitness, but only that the particular child was unlucky.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"the fitness of the individual - having an array x of phenotypes — is the probability, s(x), that the individual will be included among the group selected as parents of the next generation.\"\n\nTo avoid the complications of sex and recombination, we initially restrict our attention to an asexual population without genetic recombination. Then fitnesses can be assigned directly to genotypes rather than having to worry about individual alleles. There are two commonly used measures of fitness; absolute fitness and relative fitness.\n\nThe absolute fitness (formula_2) of a genotype is defined as the proportional change in the abundance of that genotype over one generation attributable to selection. For example, if formula_3 is the abundance of a genotype in generation formula_4 in an infinitely large population (so that there is no genetic drift), and neglecting the change in genotype abundances due to mutations, then \n\nAn absolute fitness larger than 1 indicates growth in that genotype's abundance; an absolute fitness smaller than 1 indicates decline.\n\nWhereas absolute fitness determines changes in genotype abundance, relative fitness (formula_1) determines changes in genotype frequency. If formula_7 is the total population size in generation formula_4, and the relevant genotype's frequency is formula_9, then \n\nwhere formula_11 is the mean relative fitness in the population (again setting aside changes in frequency due to drift and mutation). Relative fitnesses only indicate the change in prevalence of different genotypes relative to each other, and so only their values relative to each other are important; relative fitnesses can be any nonnegative number, including 0. It is often convenient to choose one genotype as a reference and set its relative fitness to 1. Relative fitness is used in the standard Wright-Fisher and Moran models of population genetics.\n\nAbsolute fitnesses can be used to calculate relative fitness, since formula_12 (we have used the fact that formula_13, where formula_14 is the mean absolute fitness in the population). This implies that formula_15, or in other words, relative fitness is proportional to formula_16. It is not possible to calculate absolute fitnesses from relative fitnesses alone, since relative fitnesses contain no information about changes in overall population abundance formula_7.\n\nThe change in genotype frequencies due to selection follows immediately from the definition of relative fitness,\n\nThus, a genotype's frequency will decline or increase depending on whether its fitness is lower or greater than the mean fitness, respectively.\n\nIn the particular case that there are only two genotypes of interest (e.g. representing the invasion of a new mutant allele), the change in genotype frequencies is often written in a different form. Suppose that two genotypes formula_19 and formula_20 have fitnesses formula_21 and formula_22, and frequencies formula_23 and formula_24, respectively. Then formula_25, and so\n\nThus, the change in genotype formula_27's frequency depends crucially on the difference between its fitness and the fitness of genotype formula_28. Supposing that formula_27 is more fit than formula_28, and defining the selection coefficient formula_31 by formula_32, we obtain\n\nwhere the last approximation hold for formula_34. In other words, the fitter genotype's frequency grows approximately logistically.\n\nThe British sociologist Herbert Spencer coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" in his 1864 work \"Principles of Biology\" to characterise what Charles Darwin had called natural selection.\n\nThe British biologist J.B.S. Haldane was the first to quantify fitness, in terms of the modern evolutionary synthesis of Darwinism and Mendelian genetics starting with his 1924 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection\". The next further advance was the introduction of the concept of inclusive fitness by the British biologist W.D. Hamilton in 1964 in his paper on \"The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour\".\n\nGenetic load measures the average fitness of a population of individuals, relative either to a theoretical genotype of optimal fitness, or relative to the most fit genotype actually present in the population. Consider n genotypes formula_35, which have the fitnesses formula_36 and the genotype frequencies formula_37 respectively. Ignoring frequency-dependent selection, then genetic load (formula_38) may be calculated as:\n"}

These alternative interpretations and beliefs were inspired by Turkish writer Erdoğan Çınar with the publication of his book \"Aleviliğin Gizli Tarihi\" (\"The Secret History of Alevism\") in 2004.\n\nWhile mainstream Alevis believe the term \"Alevi\" means \"follower of Ali\", as in the Arabic word ‘Alawī (علوي), and consider themselves followers of the teachings and practices of 13th-century Alevi saint Haji Bektash Veli, Ishik believe differently. The Ishik movement claim that the term \"Alevi\" is derived from the old Anatolian Luvians, claiming that the word \"Luvi\" means \"People of light\" in the Hittite language. Some Ottoman documents from the 16th century refer to the ancestors of today's Alevis as \"Işık Taifesi\", meaning \"People of Light\". This is, according to Ishikīs, a proof of the connection between the Luvians and Alevis.\n\nThe Ishik Alevis have been likened to the Kurdish Yezidis, as part of a wider monotheistic tradition called Yazdanism. A shared cultural history of that nature relates to common folklore describing the invention of agriculture by plant domestication. Wheat is assumed to have been first cultured in the northern part of the Middle East; and likewise, regional peoples shared a culinary tradition in the types of vegetables they consume.\n\nIshikīs consider themselves to be esotericists, claiming that Alevism is Esotericism itself, meaning that they identify themselves with every type of esotericism in history (e.g. Jewish esotericists, Christian esotericists, Islamic and Pagan esotericism etc.)\n\nThey claim that Alevism is the oldest religion in the world, that has changed shapes throughout time. This \"First and True Religion\" of the world, is claimed to have been the main source for all other religions and beliefs in the world:\n\nThe Ishikīs also claim that the religious ceremonies practiced by Alevis were practiced as early as by the Hittites and even by the Sumerians. According to Ishikīs, medieval Christian sects as Paulicianism, Bogomilism etc. were also Alevis. A good example of this belief can be found in the translation of the book \"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages\" (2005) by Sean Martin. Even though the original English version does not contain the word \"Alevi\", the Turkish translator has translated the title of the book as \"Ortaçağ'da Avrupa'da Alevi Hareketi - Katharlar\" (An Alevi Movement in The Middle Ages – The Cathars).\n\nCompared to traditional Alevism, the most striking differences of the Ishik movement are their interpretation of history. The Ishik movement claims that Alevis have changed their apparent identity several times in history in order to survive. According to Ishikī belief, heretic sects like the Paulicians and Bogomils were actually Alevis compelled to appear as Christians because of the Byzantine oppression. Likewise the modern Alevis have gained an Islamic appearance because of the Ottoman oppression.\n\nIshikī thought is convinced that most heterodox groups are inventions as a result of oppression, meaning that groups like the Nizārī Ismā'īlī, Bektashism, Nusayrī Alawism, Ghulāt and Ahl-e Haqq are in reality separate from real Islam.\nThe Ishikī versus Traditionalist split has caused a deep gap in Alevi society. This is the first time in centuries that Alevis have experienced such a great split in terms of beliefs.\n\n\nEven though most dedes are still traditionalists, some of them have eventually adopted Ishikī thought. The first dedes who openly declared their non-traditionalist beliefs were Ali Haydar Cilasun, with the publication of his book \"Alevilik Bir Sır Değildir\" (Alevism is Not a Secret) in 1995, and Hasan Kılavuz in 2003. The latter is now one of the prominent figures in the Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) and its television channel YOL TV.\n\nThe Ishik movement have succeeded in becoming very influential in important and powerful Alevi organizations. The Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) for instance, has abandoned its traditional Alevi beliefs in 2006, which it replaced with a marginal Ishikī type of understanding. Recently some Alevi organizations in Turkey have also changed their definitions of Alevism.\n\nThe primary sources of \"Ishikism\" are the works of the Turkish writer Erdoğan Çınar:\n\n\nBut he has also gained the support of other writers as well:\n"}

His teacher was Pedro Fernandez de Castilleja and later Mal Lara taught humanities to Mateo Alemán. It was a decade later, after studying at the University of Salamanca, where he was student of Hernán Núñez one of classmates was Francisco Sánchez de las Brozas, known as the \"Brocense\"; later he went to Valencia and Barcelona, where he completed his studies with Francisco Escobar before returning again to Salamanca. In 1548 he returned to Seville to study Arts. By 1550 he taught at humanities and literature in a grammar school in Sevilla.\n\nIn 1565, the Count of Gelves in Seville, established his \"Merlin's Garden\" in the fields near Tablada, and this became a regular gathering of an academic circle which also included Baltasar del Alcázar, Francisco Pacheco, Juan de la Cueva Christopher Mosquera de Figueroa, Cristóbal de Mesa, Francisco Medina and Fernando de Herrera, which group later were known as the Sevillian Poetry School.\n\nMal Lara was investigated by the Spanish Inquisition in 1561, but was cleared of all charges in 1566, the year he moved to Madrid to join the royal court of king Philip II of Spain. Philip of Spain also claimed to be king of England and Ireland following his marriage to Mary I of England was known as 'the prudent' since despite several financial crisis was an intelligent ruler and dedicated philosophical scholar who particularly studied the work of the Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero which is why in modern Spanish a serious but informal discussion is called \"una tertulia\"\n\nWithin this intensive royal court Mal Laura composed verses to accompany or embellish certain paintings by Titian and was commissioned to create allegorical motif for the flagship of Don Juan de Austria, which included writing an elaborate description of \"the royal galley of Serene Don Juan de Austria, Captain of all the Seas\".\n\nHe married to Maria de Ojeda with whom he had two daughters, Gila and Silvestra. He also worked with scholars and historians as important as Gonzalo Argote de Molina. He is credited, although this is widely disputed, with the invention of the structure of the ten-line stanza known as a Décima popularized Vicente Espinel, in whose honor the décima is also known as a \"Spinel\".\n\nAn unpublished biography of Mal Lara is preserved in the Municipal Archives of Seville.\n\nIn his lifetime he was mostly known for two works: \"Philosophia vulgar\" (Seville, 1568), the first part of which contains \"one thousand and one refrains\": pithy sayings or proverbs to be learned by heart, in which preliminary discourse extols the wisdom embedded in ancient sayings, although this work sometimes follows the Adagia of Erasmus of Rotterdam and other similar classical writers.\n\nThe other major work was a tribute that Mal Lara wrote with Alonso Escribano for \"Rey Phelipe de Seuilla\" (Philip II Spain and thus also of Seville), to deliver in 1570 extolling the virtues of \"the very noble and loyal city of Seuilla\" in gratitude for the warm welcome received by Philip.\n\nMal Lara also described the lavish decoration of the walls of Seville with figures and allegorical verses representing the various divisions within the Seville jurisdiction. The book was published after the victory of the monarch against the Moorish rebellion of Alpujarras.\n\n\"Psyche\", a mythological poem in Hendecasyllable style was not well received at the time. It was inspired \"Psyche and Cupid\" included in \"The Golden Ass\" a novel of Apuleius. His fifth book was published by Mario Gasparini at the Trilingual University College of Salamanca in 1947. He also composed eclogues \"Narciso and Laurea\", \"Annotations to the syntax of Erasmus\", a philosophical dissertation \"Pilgrimage of life\", as well as \"Principles of Grammar\", guidance \"Notes on Emblems of Andrea Alciato\", the \"Scholia of Rhetoric on the introductions of Aphthonius of Antioch\", \"Chronicle of the Holy Apostles\", a poem in octaves \"The Death of Orpheus\" and a Latin poem \"The Martyrdom of Saints Justa and Rufina, patron of Seville\" .\n\nSome of his dramatic works are noteworthy, including the tragedy \"Absalom\" and the comedy \"Locusta\", first performed at the University of Salamanca in 1548 both in Latin and Castilian languages; he continued this dramatic activity in Seville, where he composed the comedy \"In praise of Our Lady of Consolation\" performed by his students in Utrera in 1561. A probable work entitled \"Tragedy of San Hermenegildo\" is lost. Juan de la Cueva, in his \"Poetic Exemplar\" places Mal Lara him among the classical playwrights in the Aristotelian tradition, although with some reservations.\n\n\"The Spirited Hercules\" is an erudite poetic work formerly believed lost but subsequently rediscovered via a copy within the Ajuda National Palace in Portugal. It was highly praised by his contemporaries and contains details about the Seville group and Chansonnier lyrics that deserve careful study. It is written in stanzas and divided into twelve books, each with four songs. It is dedicated to Prince Carlos with the intention to glorify twelve victories of his grandfather, alluded to allegorically within the main theme of the poem, by singing the praises of the mythological feats of the twelve labors of Hercules. Thus, the Nemean lion symbolizes the Revolt of the Comuneros, the Erymanthian Boar is Francis I of France, etc.\n\nThe poem ends with the vision of king Philip II as Theseus,essentially a new Hercules to relieve Atlas. Mal Lara started this work in 1549, but he died suddenly and so was unable to deliver the manuscript to the printer.\n\nThe surviving poems of Mal Lara may be found in Volume XLII of the Biblioteca de Autores Españoles; his complete works were published in three volumes by Manuel Bernal Rodríguez in 1996, within the Castro Library.\n\n"}
{"id": "1220231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1220231", "title": "Kenneth Grant", "text": "Kenneth Grant\n\nKenneth Grant (23 May 1924 – 15 January 2011) was an English ceremonial magician and prominent advocate of the Thelemic religion. A poet, novelist, and writer, he founded his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis—later renamed the Typhonian Order—with his wife Steffi Grant.\n\nBorn in Ilford, Essex, Grant developed an interest in occultism and Asian religion during his teenage years. After several months serving in India with the British Army during the Second World War, he returned to Britain and became the personal secretary of Aleister Crowley, the ceremonial magician who had founded Thelema in 1904. Crowley instructed Grant in his esoteric practices and initiated him into his own occult order, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). When Crowley died in 1947, Grant was seen as his heir apparent in Britain, and was appointed as such by the American head of the O.T.O., Karl Germer. In 1949, Grant befriended the occult artist Austin Osman Spare, and in ensuing years helped to publicise Spare's artwork through a series of publications. \n\nIn 1954 Grant founded the London-based New Isis Lodge, through which he added to many of Crowley's Thelemic teachings, bringing in extraterrestrial themes and influences from the work of fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft. This was anathema to Germer, who expelled Grant from the O.T.O. in 1955, although the latter continued to operate his Lodge regardless until 1962. During the 1950s he also came to be increasingly interested in Hinduism, exploring the teachings of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi and publishing a range of articles on the topic. He was particularly interested in the Hindu tantra, incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of sex magic. On Germer's death in 1969, Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of the O.T.O. This title was disputed by the American Grady McMurtry, who took control of the O.T.O. Grant's Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, operating from his home in Golders Green, north London. In 1959 he began publishing on occultism and wrote the Typhonian Trilogies as well as various novels and books of poetry, much of which propagated the work of Crowley and Spare.\n\nGrant's writings and teachings have proved a significant influence over other currents of occultism, including chaos magic, the Temple of Set and the Dragon Rouge. They also attracted academic interest within the study of Western esotericism, particularly from Henrik Bogdan and Dave Evans.\n\nGrant was born on 23 May 1924 in Ilford, Essex, the son of a Welsh clergyman. By his early teenage years, Grant had read widely on the subject of Western esotericism and Asian religions, including the work of prominent occultist Helena Blavatsky. He had made use of a personal magical symbol ever since being inspired to do so in a visionary dream he experienced in 1939; he spelled its name variously as A'ashik, Oshik, or Aossic. Aged 18, in the midst of the Second World War, Grant volunteered to join the British Army, later commenting that he hoped to be posted to British India, where he could find a spiritual guru to study under. He was never posted abroad, and was ejected from the army aged 20 due to an unspecified medical condition.\nGrant was fascinated by the work of the occultist Aleister Crowley, having read a number of his books. Eager to meet Crowley, Grant unsuccessfully wrote to Crowley's publishers, asking them to give him his address; however, the publisher had moved address themselves, meaning that they never received his letter. He also requested that Michael Houghton, proprietor of Central London's esoteric bookstore Atlantis Bookshop, introduce him to Crowley. Houghton refused, privately remarking that Grant was \"mentally unstable.\" Grant later stated his opinion that Houghton had refused because he didn't wish to \"incur evil \"karma\"\" from introducing the young man to Crowley, but later suggested that it was because Houghton desired him for his own organisation, The Order of Hidden Masters, and thereby didn't want him to become Crowley's disciple. Persisting, Grant wrote letters to the new address of Crowley's publishers, asking that they pass his letters on to Crowley himself. These resulted in the first meeting between the two, in autumn 1944, at the Bell Inn in Buckinghamshire.\n\nAfter several further meetings and an exchange of letters, Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant. Now living in relative poverty, Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money, instead paying him in magical instruction. In March 1945, Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood, a Sussex boarding house where Crowley was living. He continued living there with Crowley for several months, dealing with the old man's correspondences and needs. In turn, he was allowed to read from Crowley's extensive library on occult subjects, and performed ceremonial magic workings with him, becoming a high initiate of Crowley's magical group, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O.T.O. in the UK, writing in his diary, \"value of Grant. If I die or go to the USA, there must be a trained man to take care of the English O.T.O.\" However, they also argued, with Grant trying to convince Crowley to relocate to London. On one occasion Crowley shouted at him: \"You are the most consummate BORE that the world has yet known. And this at 20!\"\n\nGrant's family disliked that he was working for no wage, and pressured him to resign, which he did in June 1945, leaving Netherwood. Crowley wrote to Grant's father, stating that he was \"very sorry to part with Kenneth\" and that he felt that Grant was \"giving up his real future.\" To David Curwen, an O.T.O. member who was another of his correspondents, Crowley related his opinion that \"I may have treated him too severely.\" Crowley put Curwen in contact with Grant, with Grant later claiming that he learned much from Curwen, particularly regarding the Kaula school of Tantra; in his later writings he made reference to Curwen using his Order name of Frater Ani Abthilal. Although they continued to correspond with one another, Crowley and Grant never met again, for the former died in December 1947. Grant attended Crowley's funeral at a Brighton crematorium, while accompanied by his new wife, Steffi.\n\nSteffi Grant introduced herself to the occult artist Austin Osman Spare in 1949, having learned about him while she was modelling for Herbert Budd, a tutor at St. Martin's School of Art who had studied alongside Spare. Steffi purchased two of Spare's artworks, which she gave to Kenneth as a present for his twenty-fifth birthday. She subsequently introduced her husband to Spare.\nAt the time, Spare had fallen into poverty, living in obscurity in a South London flat. Although making some money as an artist and art tutor, he was largely financially supported by his friend Frank Letchford, whom he affectionately referred to as his \"son\". There was some animosity between Letchford and Grant, although it is apparent that Spare preferred the former, having known him for 12 years longer, and placing him first in his will. Grant desired a closer relationship, and in 1954 began signing his letters to Spare \"thy son.\" Letchford claimed that Spare often told the Grants \"white lies ... to boost a flagging ego.\" Grant's first published work represented a brief \"appreciation\" of Spare's work that was included in a catalogue for the artist's exhibition held at Temple Bar in London in 1949.\n\nGrant had continued studying Crowley's work, and a year after Crowley's death was acknowledged as a Ninth Degree member of the O.T.O. by Karl Germer, Crowley's successor as Head of the O.T.O. Grant then successfully applied to Germer for a charter to operate the first three O.T.O. degrees and run his own lodge, which was granted in March 1951. As this would mean that his lodge would be the only chartered O.T.O. body in England at the time, Grant believed that it meant that he was now head of the O.T.O. in Britain. Germer put Grant in contact with Wilfred Talbot Smith, an English Thelemite based in California who had founded the Agape Lodge, knowing that Smith was the only man who had practical knowledge of the O.T.O. degree work. Smith was eager to help, and wrote at length on his experiences in founding a lodge, although he was made uneasy by Grant's magical seal of \"Aossic\" for reasons that have never been ascertained, and their correspondence soon petered out.\n\nGrant began restructuring the system of the O.T.O. by augmenting its grading structure with that of Crowley's other occult order, the A∴A∴. This attempt failed, as Grant's attentions were increasingly drawn into his founding and running of the New Isis Lodge. The lodge became operational in April 1955 when Grant issued a manifesto announcing his discovery of an extraterrestrial \"Sirius/Set current\" upon which the lodge was to be based. In this manifesto, Grant claimed that a new energy was emanating down from Earth from another planet which he identified with Nuit, a goddess who appears in the first chapter of Crowley's Thelemic holy text, \"The Book of the Law\". Germer however deemed it \"blasphemy\" that Grant had identified a single planet with Nuit; on 20 July 1955, Germer issued a \"Note of Expulsion\" expelling Grant from the O.T.O.\n\nGrant however ignored Germer's letter of expulsion, continuing to operate the New Isis Lodge under the claim that he had powers from the \"Inner Plane\". Upon learning of Grant's expulsion, Smith feared that the O.T.O. would split up into warring factions much as the Theosophical Society had done following the death of Blavatsky. Grant's Lodge continued to operate until 1962. According to Grant, the group consisted of about thirty members, and met every seventh Friday at the lodge's premises, which for a while were in the basement of Curwen's furrier's store at Melcombe Street, near to Baker Street in central London. During the period in which he worked with the lodge he claimed to have received two important texts from preternatural sources, the \"Wisdom of S'lba\" and \"OKBISh\" or \"The Book of the Spider\".\n\nFrom 1953 to 1961 Grant immersed himself in the study of Hinduism, becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi. He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, Lord Kusuma Haranath, and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume \"Lord Haranath: A Biography\" by Akella Ramakrishna Sastri. He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the Bombay-based \"The Call Divine\", as well as for Richard Cavendish's \"Man, Myth & Magic\". Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as \"At the Feet of the Guru\" in 2005. Grant believed that the O.T.O.'s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion, in doing so relying heavily on Curwen's ideas about tantra.\n\nAfter Spare's death, Grant began to focus more on his own writing career. From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately published the \"Carfax Monographs\", a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments, each at a limited print run of 100. Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would be reflected in many of Grant's subsequent publications. The \"Carfax Monographs\" would eventually be assembled together and re-released as \"Hidden Lore\" in 1989. In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, \"Black to Black and Other Poems\". During the 1950s and 1960s Grant also authored a number of novellas, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.\n\nIn 1969, Grant co-edited \"The Confessions of Aleister Crowley\" for publication with Crowley's literary executor John Symonds. Over the coming years he edited – often with Symonds – a range of Crowley writings for republication, resulting in the release of \"The Magical Record of the Beast 666\" (1972), \"Diary of a Drug Fiend\" (1972), \"Moonchild\" (1972), \"Magick\" (1973), \"Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law\" (1974) and \"The Complete Astrological Writings\" (1974). The release of these publications has been described as being \"instrumental in the revival of interest in Crowley\".\n\nAt this point, Grant began describing himself as the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.\n\nIn 1972, Frederick Muller Limited published the first book in Grant's \"Typhonian Trilogies\" series, \"The Magical Revival\", in which he discussed various events within the history of Western esotericism while also encouraging future interest in the subject. He followed this with a sequel published in 1973, \"Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God\", in which he examined Crowley's sex magical practices and the Tantra. This was followed in 1975 by \"Cults of the Shadow\", which brought the first Typhonian Trilogy to an end with a discussion of the Left Hand Path in magic, making reference to both Crowley and Spare's work, as well as to Voodoo and Tantra. That same year, Grant also published \"Images and Oracles of Austin Osman Spare\", a collection of his late friend's images based on 20 years of research. The volume did not sell well, with much of the stock being remaindered, although became a rare collector's item in later years. Grant had begun work on the book many years before, and had agreed for 500 copies to be published by Trigram Press Ltd in 1967, although at the last minute the project was cancelled. He had also authored new introductions for re-releases of two of Spare's works, a 1973 publication of \"The Anathema of Zos\" and a 1975 release of \"The Book of Pleasure\".\n\nIn 1977, Grant began the second Typhonian Trilogy with \"Nightside of Eden\", in which he discussed some of his own personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark, dense realm that he variously called 'Universe B' and 'the Tunnels of Set', conceived as a 'dark side' of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Grant made connections between this realm and the extramundane deities of H.P. Lovecraft's horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion. The sequel appeared in 1980 as \"Outside the Circles of Time\", and introduced Grant's thoughts on the relevance of Ufology and insectoid symbolism for occultism. This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge with Blond and Briggs in 1984, while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year. His next book would not appear for another eleven years after \"Outside the Circles of Time\".\n\nIn 1989, Grant began his relationship with Skoob Books Limited, a publisher linked to the Skoob Books bookstore in Bloomsbury, central London which had begun to develop a line of esoteric titles under the leadership of Caroline Wise and Chris Johnson. In 1991, Skoob Books published Grant's \"Remembering Aleister Crowley\", a volume containing his memoirs of Crowley alongside reproductions of diary entries, photographs, and letters. From 1989 to 1994, Skoob reissued a number of Grant's earlier books, and in 1992 published the sixth volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, \"Hecate's Fountain\", in which Grant provided many anecdotes about working in the New Isis Lodge and focused on describing accidents and fatalities that he believed were caused by magic. The seventh volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, \"Outer Gateways\", followed in 1994, discussing Grant's ideas of older Typhonian traditions from across the world, with reference to the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft. It ends with the text of \"The Wisdom of S'lba\", a work that Grant claimed he had received clairvoyantly from a supernatural source.\n\nAfter Skoob Books closed its esoteric publishing division, in 1996 Grant transferred the publishing rights of his books to two companies, Starfire Publishing – which decided to bring out his trilogies and novellas – and Fulgur Limited, which published his work on Spare.\nIn 1997 Starfire published Grant's first novel, \"Against the Light: A Nightside Narrative\", which involved a character also named \"Kenneth Grant\". He asserted that the work was \"quasi-autobiographical\", but never specified which parts were based on his life and which were fictional. In 1998, Starfire published a book co-written by Grant and his wife Steffi, titled \"Zos Speaks! Encounters with Austin Osman Spare\", in which they included 7 years' worth of diary entries, letters, and photographs pertaining to their relationship with the artist. The following year, the next volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, \"Beyond the Mauve Zone\" was published, explaining Grant's ideas on a realm known as the Mauve Zone that he claimed to have explored. A book containing two novellas, \"Snakewand and the Darker Strain\", was published in 2000, while the final volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, \"The Ninth Arch\", was published in 2003. It offered further Qabalistic interpretations of the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft, and the text of another work that Grant claimed had been given to him from a supernatural source, \"Book of the Spider\". That same year, Grant also published two further volumes of fictional stories, \"Gamaliel and Dance, Doll, Dance!\", which told the story of a vampire and a Tantric sex group, and \"The Other Child, and Other Tales\", which contained six short stories.\n\nGrant died on 15 January 2011 after a period of illness. He was survived by his wife.\n\nAlthough based in Thelema, Grant's Typhonian tradition has been described as \"a \"bricolage\" of occultism, Neo-Vedanta, Hindu tantra, Western sexual magic, Surrealism, ufology and Lovecraftian gnosis\".\n\nGrant promoted what he termed the Typhonian or Draconian tradition of magic, and claimed that Thelema was only a recent manifestation of this wider tradition. In his books, he portrayed the Typhonian tradition as the world's oldest spiritual tradition, claiming that it had ancient roots in Africa. According to Grant, Typhonianism was typified by its worship of female deities and its use of sex as a method of spiritual achievement. He claimed that this tradition spread throughout the world, forming the basis of forms of ancient Egyptian religion as well as Indian Tantra and forms of Western esotericism. He added that for millennia, the Typhonian tradition has been opposed by the \"Osirians\" or \"Solarites\", practitioners of patriarchal and solar religions, who have portrayed the Typhonians as evil, corrupt, and debauched. The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic noted that Grant's historical claims regarding Typhonian history were \"at best highly speculative\" and lacked any supporting evidence, however he suggested that Grant may never have intended these claims to be taken literally.\n\nGrant's claims that Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga correlate to Western esoteric traditions, and that both stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has much in common with Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.\n\nInfluenced by Maharshi, Grant adopted the Advaitan world-view that only \"the Self\", or \"atman\", really exists, with the wider universe being an illusory projection. He believed that by mastering magick, one master's this illusory universe, gaining personal liberation and recognising that only the Self really exists. Doing so, according to Grant, leads to the discovery of one's True Will, the central focus of Thelema. Grant further claimed that the realm of the Self was known as \"the Mauve Zone\", and that it could be reached while in a state of deep sleep, where it has the symbolic appearance of a swamp. He also believed that the reality of consciousness, which he deemed the only true reality, was formless and thus presented as a void, although he also taught that it was symbolised by the Hindu goddess Kali and the Thelemic goddess Nuit.\n\nGrant taught that the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions, the most important of which was a woman's menstrual blood. He referred to female sexual secretions as \"kalas\", a term adopted from Sanskrit.\n\nJanine Chapman, an esotericist who met Grant during the 1970s, described him as \"an attractive, well-mannered, well-dressed man in his forties, intelligent, cultivated, and friendly.\" While highlighting Grant's reclusive character, the historian Dave Evans noted that Grant was \"certainly unique\" in the history of British esotericism because of his \"close dealings\" with Crowley, Spare, and Gardner, the \"three most influential Western occultists of the 20th century.\" The occultist and comic book author Alan Moore thought it \"hard to name\" any other living individual who \"has done more to shape contemporary western thinking with regard to Magic\" than Grant, thinking him \"a schoolboy gone berserk on brimstone aftershave.\"\n\nIn 2003, the historian of Western esotericism Henrik Bogdan expressed the view that Grant was \"perhaps (the) most original and prolific English author of the post-modern occultist genre.\" Djurdjevic stated that Grant's engagement with Indian spiritual traditions was \"both substantial and innovative\" as well as controversial, while adding that Grant's emphasis on the importance of female sexual fluids helped contribute to the \"transformation of the hegemonic masculinity\" in Western occultism.\nAlthough membership of Grant's own occult groups remained small, his Typhonian Thelema represented a significant influence over various other occult groups and currents. They included chaos magic, as well as the Temple of Set, the Dragon Rouge, and Andrew D. Chumbley's Cultus Sabbati. The anthropologist Justin Woodman noted that Grant was \"one of the key figures\" for bringing Lovecraft's work into magical theory and practice, adding that his writings were a \"formative influence\" on Lovecraftian groups like the Esoteric Order of Dagon, founded in North America during the late 1980s.\n\nThe occultist Peter Levenda discussed Grant's work in his 2013 book, \"The Dark Lord\". Here, he asserted that Grant's importance was in attempting to create \"a more global character for Thelema\" by introducing ideas from Indian Tantra, Yezidism, and Afro-Caribbean syncretic religions.\n\nGrant published his work over a period of five decades, providing both a synthesis of Crowley and Spare's work and new, often idiosyncratic interpretations of them. Evans described Grant as having \"an often confusing, oblique, and sanity-challenging writing style\" that blends fictional stories with accounts of real-life people.\n\nIn 2003, Bogdan's first edition of a Grant bibliography was published by Academia Esoterica Press. This was followed by a second, updated edition in 2015, which contained a full biography of Grant's work:\n\n"}
{"id": "37374009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37374009", "title": "Knowledge translation", "text": "Knowledge translation\n\nKnowledge translation (KT) is the umbrella term for all of the activities involved in moving research from the laboratory, the research journal, and the academic conference into the hands of people and organizations who can put it to practical use. The term is most often used relative to the health professions, including medicine, nursing, pharmaceuticals, rehabilitation, and public health.\n\nDepending on the type of research being translated, the \"practical user\" might be a medical doctor, a nurse, a teacher, a school administrator, an occupational or physical therapist, a legislator, an epidemiologist, a community health worker, or a parent.\n\nKT is not an action, but a spectrum of activities which will change according to the type of research, the time frame, and the audience being targeted.\n\nThe most widely used definition of knowledge translation was published in 2000 by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR): \"Knowledge translation (KT) is defined as a dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically-sound application of knowledge to improve the health of Canadians, provide more effective health services and products and strengthen the health care system.\"\n\nUsing the CIHR definition as a basis, the National Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research (NCDDR) published this definition of KT in 2005: \"The collaborative and systematic review, assessment, identification, aggregation, and practical application of high-quality disability and rehabilitation research by key stakeholders (i.e., consumers, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers) for the purpose of improving the lives of individuals with disabilities.\"\n\nIn 2006, Graham, et al., acknowledged the proliferation of related terms for the activity of knowledge translation, documenting 29 different terms used by 33 different health research funding agencies in their publications, including knowledge transfer, knowledge mobilization, knowledge exchange, implementation, and translational research.\n\nIn 2007, NCDDR re-published an overview written by Pimjai Sudsawad, then with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, now with the U.S. Department of Education, entitled: \"Knowledge Translation: Introduction to Models, Strategies, and Measures\". The overview correlates a variety of KT models which have been in development since at least 1976, including the Stetler Model of Research Utilization, the Coordinated Implementation Model, the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework, the Ottawa Model of Research Utilization (OMRU), and the Knowledge to Action (KTA) process framework.\n\nThe activity of knowledge translation is observable as far back as agricultural extension services established by the Smith-Lever Act of 1914. The Smith-Lever Act formalized the relationship between United States land-grant universities and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the performance of agricultural extension. Agricultural extension agents based at the land-grant universities disseminated information to farmers and ranchers on seed development, land management and animal husbandry.\n\nIn their Technical Brief #10 2005, NCDDR points out: \"KT is a relatively new term that is used to describe a relatively old problem - the underutilization of evidence-based research in systems of care. Underutilization of evidence-based research is often described as a gap between 'what is known' and 'what is currently done' in practice settings.\"\n\nWhile evaluations of research utilization in the health fields have been going on since at least the mid-1960s, institutional interest in this long-standing issue has accelerated in the last 25 years. In 1989, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services established the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. In 1997, the Canadian government endowed the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) - now called the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement, or CFHI. In 2000, the Canadian government consolidated several existing agencies into the Canadian Institutes for Health Research. In 2006, the U.S. National Institutes of Health created the Clinical and Translational Science Awards, currently funding about 60 academic medical institutions across the country. The role of health research funders is increasingly playing a role in how evidence is being moved to practice, reducing the time between research and implementation.\n\nMore recently, the challenges of filtering information for knowledge translation is being increasingly addressed with Moloney, Taylor & Ralph proposing a \"spillway model\" to better control information flow and improve the implementation of research in healthcare. Other recent studies look at the role of design artefacts such as sketches, visual representations and prototypes to support knowledge translation in research and development projects.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "158925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158925", "title": "Maxims of equity", "text": "Maxims of equity\n\nMaxims of equity are legal maxims that serve as a set of general principles or rules which are said to govern the way in which equity operates. They tend to illustrate the qualities of equity, in contrast to the common law, as a more flexible, responsive approach to the needs of the individual, inclined to take into account the parties’ conduct and worthiness. They were developed by the English Court of Chancery and other courts that administer equity jurisdiction, including the law of trusts. Although the most fundamental and time honored of the maxims, listed on this page, are often referred to on their own as the 'maxims of equity' or 'the equitable maxims', it cannot be said that there is a definitive list of them. Like other kinds of legal maxims or principles, they were originally, and sometimes still are, expressed in Latin.\n\nMaxims of equity are not a rigid set of rules, but are, rather, general principles which can be deviated from in specific cases. Snell's \"Equity\", an English treatise, takes the view that the \"Maxims do not cover the whole ground, and moreover they overlap, one maxim contains by implication what belongs to another. Indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two: 'Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy' and 'Equity acts on the person'\".\n\nSometimes phrased as \"equity regards as done what should have been done\", this maxim means that when individuals are required, by their agreements or by law, to perform some act of legal significance, equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done, even before it has actually happened. This makes possible the legal phenomenon of equitable conversion.\n\nThe consequences of this maxim, and of equitable conversion, are significant in their bearing on the risk of loss in transactions. When parties enter a contract for a sale of real property, the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed.\n\nDue to his equitable interest in the outcome of the transaction, the buyer who suffers a breach may be entitled to the equitable remedy of specific performance (although not always, see below). If he is successful in seeking a remedy at law, he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated.\n\nThe fact that the buyer may be forced to suffer a depreciation in the value of the property means that he bears the risk of loss if, for example, the improvements on the property he bought burn down while he is still in escrow.\n\nProblems may sometimes arise because, through some lapse or omission, insurance coverage is not in force at the time a claim is made. If the policyholder has clearly been at fault in this connection, because, for example, he has not paid premiums when he should have, then it will normally be quite reasonable for an insurer to decline to meet the claim. However, it gets more difficult if the policyholder is no more at fault than the insurer. The fair solution in the circumstances may be arrived at by applying the principle that equity regards that as done that ought to be done. In other words, what would the position have been if what should have been done had been done?\n\nThus, we know in one case, premiums on a life insurance policy were overdue. The insurer's letter to the policyholder warning him of this fact was never received by the policyholder, who died shortly after the policy consequently lapsed. It was clear that if the notice had been received by the policyholder, he or his wife would have taken steps to ensure the policy continued in force, because the policyholder was terminally ill at the time and the coverage provided by the policy was something his wife was plainly going to require in the foreseeable future. Since the policyholder would have been fully entitled to pay the outstanding premium at that stage, regardless of his physical condition, the insurer (with some persuasion from the Bureau) agreed that the matter should be dealt with as if the policyholder had done so. In other words, his widow was entitled to the sum assured less the outstanding premium. In other similar cases, however, it has not been possible to follow the same principle because there has not been sufficiently clear evidence that the policy would have been renewed.\n\nAnother illustration of the application of this equitable principle was in connection with motor vehicle insurance. A policyholder was provided with coverage on the basis that she was entitled to a \"no claims\" discount from her previous insurer. Confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required. When that was not forthcoming, her coverage was cancelled by the brokers who had issued the initial coverage note. This was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the no claims discount was forthcoming. Such proof was eventually obtained by the policyholder, but only after she had been involved in an accident after the cancellation by the brokers of the policy. Here again, the fair outcome was to look at what would have happened if the insurer's normal practice had been followed. In such circumstances, the policyholder would plainly have still had a policy at the time of the accident. The insurer itself had not acted incorrectly at any stage. However, in the circumstances, it was equitable for it to meet the claim.\n\nWhen seeking an equitable relief, the one that has been wronged has the stronger hand. The stronger hand is the one that has the capacity to ask for a legal remedy (judicial relief). In equity, this form of remedy is usually one of specific performance or an injunction (injunctive relief). These are superior remedies to those administered at common law such as damages. The Latin legal maxim is \"ubi jus ibi remedium\" (\"where there is a wrong, there must be a remedy\"), sometimes cited as ubi jus ibi remediam.\n\nThe maxim is necessarily subordinate to positive principles and cannot be applied either to subvert established rules of law or to give the courts a jurisdiction hitherto unknown, and it is only in a general not in a literal sense that the maxim has force.\n\nCase law dealing with the principle of this maxim at law include \"Ashby v White\" and \"Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents\". The application of this principle at law was key in the decision of \"Marbury v. Madison\", wherein it was necessary to establish that Marbury had a right to his commission in the first place in order for Chief Justice Marshall to make his more wide-ranging decision.\n\nWhere two persons have an equal right, the property will be divided equally. \n\nThis maxim flows from the fundamental notion of equality or impartiality due to the conception of Equity and is the source of many equitable doctrines. The maxim is of very wide application. The rule of ordinary law may give one party an advantage over the other. But, the court of equity where it can, put the litigating parties on a footing of equality. Equity proceeds in the principle that a right or liability should as far as possible, be equalized among all interested.\nIn the Simple Word's then Two parties have equal Rights in any of property so the same was distributed equal as per their concerned Law.\n\nTo receive equitable relief, the petitioning party must be willing to complete all of its own obligations as well. The applicant to a court of equity is just as much subject to the power of that court as the defendant. This maxim may also overlap with the clean hands maxim (see below).\n\n\"Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit\".\n\nA person who has been wronged must act relatively swiftly to preserve their rights. Otherwise, they are guilty of laches, an untoward delay in litigation with the presumed intent of denying claims. This differs from a statute of limitations, in that a delay is particularized to individual situations, rather than a general prescribed legal amount of time. In addition, even where a limitation period has not yet run, laches may still occur. The equitable rule of laches and acquiescence was first introduced in \"Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd\"\n\nAlternatives:\n\nGenerally speaking, near performance of a general obligation will be treated as sufficient unless the law requires perfect performance, such as in the exercise of an option. Text writers give an example of a debtor leaving a legacy to his creditor equal to or greater than his obligation. Equity regards such a gift as performance of the obligation so the creditor cannot claim both the legacy and payment of the debt.\nWhere a claimant is under an obligation to do one thing but does another, his action may be treated as close enough approximation of the required act. A claimant who has undertaken an obligation, will, through his later conduct be interpreted as fulfilment of that obligation.\n\nIn England, there was a distinction drawn between the jurisdiction of the law courts and that of the chancery court. Courts of law had jurisdiction over property as well as persons and their coercive power arose out of their ability to adjust ownership rights. Courts of equity had power over persons. Their coercive power arose from the ability, on authority of the crown, to hold a violator in contempt, and take away his or her freedom (or money) until he or she purged himself or herself of his or her contumacious behavior. This distinction helped preserve a separation of powers between the two courts.\n\nNevertheless, courts of equity also developed a doctrine that an applicant must assert a \"property interest\". This was a limitation on their own power to issue relief. This does not mean that the courts of equity had taken jurisdiction over property. Rather, it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests.\n\nToday, a mortgagor refers to his interest in the property as his \"equity\". The origin of the concept, however, was actually a mirror-image of the current practice.\n\nAt common law, a mortgage was a conveyance of the property, with a condition subsequent, that if the grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain (the \"law\" day) then the conveyance would be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. As was inevitable, debtors would be unable to pay on the law day, and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed, the creditor owed no duty to give the land back. So then the debtor would run to the court of equity, plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur, and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the secured debt with interest to date. And the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for the amount of time that had lapsed since the law day had passed. The lender could interpose a defense of laches, saying that so much time had gone by (and so much improvement and betterment had taken place) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance. Other defenses, including equitable estoppel, were used to bar redemption as well.\n\nThis unsettling system had a negative impact on the willingness of lenders to accept real estate as collateral security for loans. Since a lender could not re-sell the property until it had been in uncontested possession for years, or unless it could show changed circumstances, the value of real estate collateral was significantly impaired. Impaired, that is, until lawyers concocted the bill of foreclosure, whereby a mortgagee could request a decree that unless the mortgagor paid the debt by a date certain (and after the law date set in the mortgage), the mortgagor would thereafter be barred and foreclosed of all right, title and equity of redemption in and to the mortgaged premises.\n\nTo complete the circle, one needs to understand that when a mortgagor fails to pay an installment when due, and the mortgagee accelerates the mortgage, requiring immediate repayment of the entire mortgage indebtedness, the mortgagor does not have a right to pay the past-due installment(s) and have the mortgage reinstated. In \"Graf v. Hope Building Corp.\", the New York Court of Appeals observed that in such a case, there was no forfeiture, only the operation of a clause fair on its face, to which the mortgagor had freely assented. In the latter 20th Century, New York's lower courts eroded the \"Graf\" doctrine to such a degree that it appears that it is no longer the law, and that a court of conscience has the power to mandate that a default be excused if it is equitable to do so. Of course, now that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction, we can expect courts to explain where the limits on the newly expanded equity of redemption lie...and it is probably not a coincidence that the cases that have eroded \"Graf v. Hope Building Corp.\" have been accompanied by the rise of arbitration as a means for enforcing mortgages.\n\nAlso: Equity will not compel a court to do a vain and useless thing. It would be an idle gesture for the court to grant reformation of a contract and then to deny to the prevailing party an opportunity to perform it as modified.\n\nIt is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with clean hands (or alternatively, equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong). In other words, if you ask for help about the actions of someone else but have acted wrongly, then you do not have clean hands and you may not receive the help you seek. For example, if you desire your tenant to vacate, you must have not violated the tenant's rights.\n\nHowever, the requirement of clean hands does not mean that a \"bad person\" cannot obtain the aid of equity. \"Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives.\" The defense of unclean hands only applies if there is a nexus between the applicant's wrongful act and the rights he wishes to enforce.\n\nIn \"D & C Builders Ltd v Rees\", a small building firm did some work on the house of a couple named Rees. The bill came to £732, of which the Rees had already paid £250. When the builders asked for the balance of £482, the Rees announced that the work was defective, and they were only prepared to pay £300. As the builders were in serious financial difficulties (as the Rees knew), they reluctantly accepted the £300 \"in completion of the account\". The decision to accept the money would not normally be binding in contract law, and afterwards the builders sued the Rees for the outstanding amount. The Rees claimed that the court should apply the doctrine of promissory estoppel, which can make promises binding even when unsupported by consideration. However, Lord Denning refused to apply the doctrine, on the grounds that the Rees had taken unfair advantage of the builders' financial difficulties, and therefore had not come \"with clean hands\".\n\nWhen a court of equity is presented with a good claim to equitable relief, and it is clear that the plaintiff \"also\" sustained monetary damages, the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief, e.g., monetary damages. Hence equity does not stop at granting equitable relief, but goes on to render a full and complete collection of remedies.\n\nThus, \"where a court of equity has all the parties before it, it will adjudicate upon all of the rights of the parties connected with the subject matter of the action, so as to avoid a multiplicity of suits.\" This is the basis for the procedures of interpleader, class action, and the more rarely used Bill of Peace.\n\nThis maxim, also expressed as \"Aequitas sequitur legem\", means more fully that \"equity will not allow a remedy that is contrary to law.\"\n\nThe Court of Chancery never claimed to override the courts of common law. Story states \"where a rule, either of the common or the statute law is direct, and governs the case with all its circumstances, or the particular point, a court of equity is as much bound by it as a court of law, and can as little justify a departure from it.\" According to Edmund Henry Turner Snell, “It is only when there is some important circumstance disregarded by the common law rules that equity interferes.” Cardozo wrote in his dissent in \"Graf v. Hope Building Corporation\", 254 N.Y 1 at 9 (1930), \"Equity works as a supplement for law and does not supersede the prevailing law.\"\n\nMaitland says, “We ought not to think of common law and equity as of two rival systems.\" \"Equity . of law was to be obeyed, but when all this had been done yet something might be needful, something that equity would require.\" The goal of law and equity was the same but due to historical reasons they chose a different path. Equity respected every word of law and every right at law but where the law was defective, in those cases, equity provides equitable right and remedies.\n\nIn the Province of Ontario, Canada, instead of equity following the law, the law follows equity – as per the Ontario Courts of Justice Act:\n\n(2) \"Where a rule of equity conflicts with a rule of the common law, the rule of equity prevails.\" R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 96 (2); 1993, c. 27, Sched.\n\nA volunteer is defined in equity as one who has not offered consideration for a benefit they have received or expect to receive. For example, if a person A expects from past conversations and friendship to receive property under any will of person B, but person B dies before writing this into their will, person A, having not made any contribution to person B, will not be able to seek equity's aid. \n\nThis maxim is very important in restitution. Restitution developed as a series of writs called special assumpsit, which were later additions in the courts of law, and were more flexible tools of recovery, based on equity. Restitution could provide means of recovery when people bestowed benefits on one another (such as giving money or providing services) according to contracts that would have been legally unenforceable.\n\nHowever, pursuant to the equitable maxim, restitution does not allow a volunteer or \"officious intermeddler\" to recover. \n\nThose successfully pleading benefit from an estoppel (promise relied on to their detriment) will not be considered volunteers for the purpose of this maxim.\n\nEquity will provide no specific remedies where the parties' causes are to be seen to be equal, or where neither has been wronged.\n\nThe significance of this maxim is that applicants to the chancellors often did so because of the formal pleading of the law courts, and the lack of flexibility they offered to litigants. Law courts and legislature, as lawmakers, through the limits of the substantive law they had created, thus inculcated a certain status quo that affected private conduct, and private ordering of disputes. Equity could alter that status quo, ignoring the clearly imposed limits of legal relief, or legal defences. But courts applying equity are reluctant to do so. This maxim reflects this. If the law firmly denied a cause of action or suggested equities between the parties were as a matter of policy equal, equity would provide no relief; if the law did provide relief, then the applicant would be obligated to bring a legal, rather than equitable action. This maxim overlaps with the previously mentioned \"equity follows the law.\"\n\nThis maxim operates where there are two or more competing equitable interests; when two equities are equal the original interest (i.e., the first in time) will succeed.\n\nIf a donor has made an imperfect gift, i.e. lacking the formalities required at common law, equity will not assist the intended donee. This maxim is a subset of equity will not assist a volunteer .\n\nNote the exception in \"Strong v Bird\" (1874) LR 18 Eq 315. If the donor appoints the intended donee as executor of his/her will, and the donor subsequently dies, equity will perfect the imperfect gift.\n\nEquity prevents a party from relying upon an absence of a statutory formality if to do so would be unconscionable and unfair. This can occur in secret trusts, constructive trusts etc.\n\nIf there is no trustee, whoever has legal title to the trust property will be considered the trustee. Otherwise, a court may appoint a trustee. In Ireland, the trustee may be any administrator of a charity to which the trust is related.\n\nDue to limits in old Common Law, no remedy was had for beneficiaries if, for example, a trustee ran off with the trust property. To remedy this and protect intended recipients of trust property, Equity regarded the beneficiary as the true (eventual) owners of the trust property.\n\n\n"}

The term \"mentalism\" has been used primarily by behaviorists who believe that scientific psychology should focus on the structure of causal relationships to conditioned responses, or on the functions of behavior.\n\nNeither mentalism nor behaviorism are mutually exclusive fields; elements of one can be seen in the other, perhaps more so in modern times compared to the advent of psychology over a century ago.\n\nPsychologist Allan Paivio used the term \"classical mentalism\" to refer to the introspective psychologies of Edward Titchener and William James. Despite Titchener being concerned with structure and James with function, both agreed that consciousness was the subject matter of psychology, making psychology an inherently subjective field.\n\nConcurrently thriving alongside mentalism since the inception of psychology was the functional perspective of behaviorism. However, it was not until 1913, when psychologist John B. Watson published his article \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It\" that behaviorism began to have a dominant influence. Watson's ideas sparked what some have called a paradigm shift in American psychology, leading to the objective and experimental study of human behavior, rather than subjective, introspective study of human consciousness. Behaviorists considered that the study of consciousness was impossible to do, and that the focus on it to that point had only been a hindrance to the field reaching its full potential. For a time, behaviorism would go on to be the dominant force driving psychological thought, advanced by the work of other luminaries such as Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, and B.F. Skinner.\n\nA scathing review of B.F. Skinner's book \"Verbal Behavior\" by Noam Chomsky in 1959 heralded a shift back to a focus on the mental in psychology with the beginning of the cognitive revolution. Critical to the successful revival of the mind or consciousness as a primary focus of study in psychology (and in related fields such as cognitive neuroscience) were technological and methodological advances, which eventually allowed for brain mapping, among other new techniques. These advances provided an objectively experimental way to begin to study perception and consciousness, effectively nullifying the main criticism of mentalism half a century earlier.\n\nHowever, the cognitive revolution did not kill behaviorism as a research program; in fact, research on operant conditioning actually grew at a rapid pace during the cognitive revolution. In 1994, scholar Terry L. Smith surveyed the history of radical behaviorism and concluded that \"even though radical behaviorism may have been a failure, the operant program of research has been a success. Furthermore, operant psychology and cognitive psychology complement one another, each having its own domain within which it contributes something valuable to, but beyond the reach of, the other.\"\n\n\n"}

The author or co-author of 18 books about religion and ethics, Vardy was vice-principal of Heythrop College, a Jesuit college in London, from 1999 to 2011. He is known for the religious-studies conferences he runs in the UK for schools.\n\nVardy was born to Mark Vardy and Christa Lund Vardy; his mother was Danish. He attended Charterhouse, an independent school in Godalming, Surrey. In 1974 he married his first wife, Anne Vardy, née Moore; the couple had two sons and three daughters before divorcing in 2004. Vardy remarried in 2009; he and his wife Charlotte, née Fowler, have one daughter. \n\nVardy trained as a chartered accountant, becoming a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants (FCA) in 1967. He ran management-training sessions for the National Westminster Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation, and was the chairman of H. Young Holdings plc from 1979–1983. At the age of 30, Vardy began to study theology, receiving a BA from the University of Southampton in 1979 and a PGCE (a teaching qualification) from the West Sussex Institute of Higher Education in 1980. He was awarded a master's degree in theology from King's College London in 1982, and a PhD in theology in 1984, also from King's, for a thesis entitled \"The concept of eternity\".\n\nVardy taught philosophy of religion at King's College London and the Institute of Education. He began lecturing at Heythrop College in 1986 and in 1999 became the vice-principal, a position he held until his retirement in 2011. \n\nWhilst at Heythrop, he served on the University of London's Board of Theology (1990–1993). Vardy served as President of the London Society for the Study of Religion from 1996 to 1998 and remained a member until at least 2007 when the Society celebrated its centenary.\n\nVardy's primary academic interest is in the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard, whose work he taught at Heythrop for 25 years. From 1987 he organized annual dinners in London on the anniversary of Kierkegaard's death, and in 1996 his book \"Kierkegaard\" was published, later published as \"The SPCK Introduction to Kierkegaard\".\n\nVardy served as chair of the governors of Shebbear College, a Methodist school in Devon. He has also worked as a member of the Methodist Schools Committee, and has been a keynote speaker at conferences in the field of education, including for UNESCO and UNHRC. While at Heythrop, Vardy served as an editorial adviser for \"Dialogue\", a journal of religion and philosophy aimed at sixth-form students, and made a series of teaching videos through Dialogue Education. He began running day conferences for sixth-form students in the mid 1990s and set up Wombat Education Ltd in 1998. In 2002 he and Julie Arliss of Richard Huish College, Taunton, organized a conference there and several others around the UK. In 2009 Vardy and his second wife, Charlotte Vardy, set up Candle Conferences Ltd, and in 2012 Candle Education Ltd, through which they run day conferences for schools.\n\nSince 2010 Vardy has campaigned against the introduction of the English Baccalaureate, which he argues has led to a decline in numbers taking religion studies. He views philosophy of religion as an exercise in exploring the terms left undefined by theology (such as \"God\" and \"soul\") and encouraging humility. Education is a way to help young people become fully human, in his view, or good in the Aristotelian sense. He described the approach in his books \"What is Truth?\" (2001) and \"Being Human\" (2003), and in a paper, \"Becoming Fully Human\", for \"Dialogue Australasia\" in 2007.\n\nIn 1999 Vardy worked as a consultant for an Australian school, Geelong Grammar School, in Geelong, Victoria. Later he helped to set up the Dialogue Australasia Network, promoting the \"five strands\" approach to religious studies in schools that he proposed at the inaugural conference of Dialogue Australasia Network in 1997. This was implemented in a number of Australasian Independent Schools He also served as an editor and occasional author for the journal \"Dialogue Australasia\".\n\nVardy has served as an editorial adviser for BBC and Channel 4 documentaries, has been interviewed by ABC Radio in Australia, and has written for several publications, including \"Times Higher Education\", \"Eureka Street\", and \"The Age\".

On the other hand, most philosophical movements in history consisted in a great number of individual thinkers who disagreed in various ways; it is often inaccurate and something of a caricature to treat any movement as consisting in followers of uniform opinion. More often the defining ideas of any philosophical movement are templates on which individual thinkers develop their own particular ideas.\n\nIn contrast to the idea of a philosophical movement, the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romanticism are broader cultural \"movements\" that happened to be characterized by fairly distinctive philosophical concerns: although they are movements with philosophical cores, they extend beyond the field of philosophy into art and culture more broadly, hence are not specific enough to philosophy to be considered movements within it.\n\nLike specific doctrines and theories, movements are often given names with \"ism\" suffixes.

{"id": "1551073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1551073", "title": "Philosophy of biology", "text": "Philosophy of biology\n\nThe philosophy of biology is a subfield of philosophy of science, which deals with epistemological, metaphysical, and ethical issues in the biological and biomedical sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., Aristotle, Descartes, and even Kant), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s. Philosophers of science then began paying increasing attention to biology, from the rise of Neodarwinism in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 to more recent advances in genetic engineering.\nOther key ideas include the reduction of all life processes to biochemical reactions, and the incorporation of psychology into a broader neuroscience.\n\nThe philosophy of biology can be seen as following an empirical tradition, favoring naturalism.\nMany contemporary philosophers of biology have largely avoided traditional questions about the distinction between life and non-life. Instead, they have examined the practices, theories, and concepts of biologists with a view toward better understanding biology as a scientific discipline (or group of scientific fields).\nScientific ideas are philosophically analyzed and their consequences are explored. It is sometimes difficult to delineate philosophy of biology as separate from theoretical biology. A few of the questions philosophers of biology have attempted to answer, for example, include:\n\nA subset of philosophers of biology with a more explicitly naturalistic orientation hope that biology will provide scientific answers to such fundamental problems of epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, anthropology and even metaphysics.\nFurthermore, progress in biology urges modern societies to rethink traditional values concerning all aspects of human life. The possibility of genetic modification of human stem cells, for example, has led to an ongoing controversy on how certain biological techniques could infringe upon ethical consensus (see bioethics).\nSome of the questions addressed by these philosophers of biology include:\n\nIncreasingly, ideas drawn from philosophical ontology and logic are being used by biologists in the domain of bioinformatics. Ontologies such as the Gene Ontology are being used to annotate the results of biological experiments in a variety of model organisms in order to create logically tractable bodies of data available for reasoning and search. The Gene Ontology itself is a species-neutral graph-theoretical representation of biological types joined together by formally defined relations.\n\nPhilosophy of biology today has become a very visible, well-organized discipline - with its own journals, conferences, and professional organizations. The largest of the latter is the \"International Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology\" (ISHPSSB); the name of the Society reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field.\n\nOne subject within philosophy of biology deals with the relationship between reductionism and holism, contending views with epistemological and methodological significance, but also with ethical and metaphysical connotations.\n\n\nSome philosophers of biology have attempted to explain the rise and fall of reductionism, vitalism, and holism throughout the history of biology. For example, these philosophers claim that the ideas of Charles Darwin ended the last remainders of teleology in biology, though the matter continues to be debated. Debates in these areas of philosophy of biology turn on how one views reductionism.\n\nAll processes in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This has led some biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) to return to the strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach, exemplified by Joseph Henry Woodger, emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave out a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component in the form of an inherited genotype.\n\nBiologists with philosophic interests responded, emphasising the dual nature of the living organism. On the one hand there was the genetic programme (represented in nucleic acids) - the \"genotype\". On the other there was its extended body or \"soma\" - the \"phenotype\". In accommodating the more probabilistic and non-universal nature of biological generalisations, it was a help that standard philosophy of science was in the process of accommodating similar aspects of 20th century physics.\n\nThis led to a distinction between \"proximate\" causes and explanations - \"how\" questions dealing with the phenotype; and \"ultimate causes\" - \"why\" questions, including evolutionary causes, focused on the genotype. This clarification was part of the great reconciliation, by Ernst Mayr, among others, in the 1940s, between Darwinian evolution by natural selection and the genetic model of inheritance. A commitment to conceptual clarification has characterised many of these philosophers since. Trivially, this has reminded us of the scientific basis of all biology, while noting its diversity - from microbiology to ecology. A complete philosophy of biology would need to accommodate all these activities. Less trivially, it has unpacked the notion of \"teleology\". Since 1859, scientists have had no need for a notion of cosmic teleology - a programme or a law that can explain and predict evolution. Darwin provided that. But teleological explanations (relating to purpose or function) have remained stubbornly useful in biology - from the structural configuration of macromolecules to the study of co-operation in social systems. By clarifying and restricting the use of the term to describe and explain systems controlled strictly scientifically by genetic programmes, or other physical systems, teleological questions can be framed and investigated while remaining committed to the physical nature of all underlying organic processes.\n\nSimilar attention has been given to the concepts of \"natural selection\" (what is the target of natural selection? - the individual? the environment? the genome? the species?); \"adaptation; diversity and classification; species and speciation\"; and \"macroevolution\".\n\nJust as biology has developed as an autonomous discipline in full conversation with the other sciences, there is a great deal of work now being carried on by biologists and philosophers to develop a dedicated philosophy of biological science which, while in full conversation with all other philosophic disciplines, attempts to give answers to the real questions raised by scientific investigations in biology.\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of English-speaking scholars operating under the banner of \"\"philosophy of biology\" work within the Anglo-American tradition of analytical philosophy, there is a stream of philosophic work in continental philosophy which seeks to deal with issues deriving from biological science. The communication difficulties involved between these two traditions are well known, not helped by differences in language. Gerhard Vollmer is often thought of as a bridge but, despite his education and residence in Germany, he largely works in the Anglo-American tradition, particularly pragmatism, and is famous for his development of Konrad Lorenz's and Willard Van Orman Quine's idea of evolutionary epistemology. On the other hand, one scholar who has attempted to give a more continental account of the philosophy of biology is Hans Jonas. His \"The Phenomenon of Life\" (New York, 1966) sets out boldly to offer an \"existential interpretation of biological facts\"\", starting with the organism's response to stimulus and ending with man confronting the Universe, and drawing upon a detailed reading of phenomenology. This is unlikely to have much influence on mainstream philosophy of biology, but indicates, as does Vollmer's work, the current powerful influence of biological thought on philosophy. Another account is given by the late Virginia Tech philosopher Marjorie Grene.\n\nPhilosophy of biology was historically associated very closely with theoretical evolutionary biology, however more recently there have been more diverse movements within philosophy of biology including movements to examine for instance molecular biology.\n\nResearch in biology continues to be less guided by theory than it is in other sciences. This is especially the case where the availability of high throughput screening techniques for the different \"-omics\" fields such as genomics, whose complexity makes them predominantly data-driven. Such data-intensive scientific discovery is by some considered to be the fourth paradigm, after empiricism, theory and computer simulation. Others reject the idea that data driven research is about to replace theory. As Krakauer et al. put it: \"machine learning is a powerful means of preprocessing data in preparation for mechanistic theory building, but should not be considered the final goal of a scientific inquiry.\" In regard to cancer biology, Raspe et al. state: \"A better understanding of tumor biology is fundamental for extracting the relevant information from any high throughput data.\" The journal Science chose cancer immunotherapy as the breakthrough of 2013. According to their explanation a lesson to be learned from the successes of cancer immunotherapy is that they emerged from decoding of basic biology.\n\nTheory in biology is to some extent less strictly formalized than in physics. Besides 1) classic mathematical-analytical theory, as in physics, there is 2) statistics-based, 3) computer simulation and 4) conceptual/verbal analysis. Dougherty and Bittner argue that for biology to progress as a science, it has to move to more rigorous mathematical modeling, or otherwise risk to be \"empty talk\".\n\nIn tumor biology research, the characterization of cellular signaling processes has largely focused on identifying the function of individual genes and proteins. Janes showed however the context-dependent nature of signaling driving cell decisions demonstrating the need for a more system based approach. The lack of attention for context dependency in preclinical research is also illustrated by the observation that preclinical testing rarely includes predictive biomarkers that, when advanced to clinical trials, will help to distinguish those patients who are likely to benefit from a drug.\n\n"}

These references represent a period of 1260 years (based on the 360 day Jewish year multiplied by 3.5).\nDivide 1,260 days by 42 months and you will get a 30-day month, as 12 months of 30 days equals 360-days in a year\n\nThese time periods occur eight times in scripture:\n\n\nThe origin appears to be in connection mainly with the following Bible verses referring to the period translated, \"time\".\n\n\"And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.\" Daniel 7:25\n\n\"And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.\" Daniel 12:7\n\n\"And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. \" Revelation 12:14\n\nIn ancient times, twelve thirty-day months were used making a total of 360 days for the year. Abraham, used the 360-day year, which was known in Ur. The Genesis account of the flood in the days of Noah illustrated this 360-day year by recording the 150-day interval till the waters abated from the earth. In other words, it indicates a 5-month period as being exactly 150 days in length, or five 30-day months. \n\nWe see it here in the account of the Flood:\n\n\"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\" Genesis 7:11\n\n\"And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\" Genesis 7:24 \n\n\"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\" Genesis 8:4 \n\nThe 150 days began on the seventeenth day of the second month, and ended on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. This of course had issues in keeping the seasons correctly in context. The Hebrews added an extra month to compensate.\n\nExamples of use of the first definition:\nNow this seventieth week is admittedly a period of seven years, and half of this period is three times described as \"a time, times, and half a time,\" or \"the dividing of times'\"* twice as forty-two months;† and twice as 1,260 days.‡ But 1,260 days are exactly equal to forty-two months of thirty days, or three and a half years of 360 days, whereas three and a half Julian years contain 1,278 days. It follows therefore that the prophetic year is not the Julian year, but the ancient year of 360 days.§\n(*) Dan. vii. 25; xii. 7; Rev. xii. 14.\n† Rev. xi. 2' xiii. 5.\n‡ Rev. xi. 3' xii. 6.\n§ It is noteworthy that the prophecy was given at Babylon, and the Babylonian year consisted of twelve months of thirty days. That the prophetic year is not the ordinary year is no new discovery. It was noticed sixteen centuries ago by Julias Africanus in his \"Chronography\", wherein he explains the seventy weeks to be weeks of \"Jewish\" (lunar) years, beginning with the twentieth of Artaxerxes, the fourth year of the 83rd Olympiad, and ending in the second year of the 202nd Olympiad; 475 Julian years being equal to 490 lunar years.\nThe second and third definition can be said to follow from application of the day for a year principle.\n\nExamples of the third definition:\n...we will find that the twelve hundred and sixty days in the Revelation, being reduced to years, are eighteen years short of Julian years in the prophetical reckoning, by reason of the additional days turned into years in the ordinary accounts now, above the Apocalyptical reckoning.\nTo demonstrate which, I present you with the following scheme:---\nThe Prophetical Year.\nOne 360 + One 360 = Two 720\nThree 1080 + Half 180 = Three Years and a half - 1260\nThe Julian Year.\nOne 365 + One 365 = Two 730\nThree 1095 + Half 183 = Three Years and a half - 1278\nNow if, according to this computation, we subtract twelve hundred and sixty Apocalyptical years from twelve hundred and seventy-eight Julian or Gregorian ones ( I call them so \"ore rotundo\", overlooking the smaller measures of time), there remain eighteen years to be cut off.\n\nIn scripture, Prophetic Years of 360 days instead of normal years of 365 days has been interpreted as being equal to prophetic months of 30 days or years which has been interpreted as being equal to one \"time\" to be able to fit the interpretation that Jesus was the messiah as per Daniel 9. To arrive at that theory, they use \"times, time, and half a time\" mentioned in one verse and subsequently 42 months and 1260 days have been mentioned in other verses as found in Daniel and Revelation, these periods have been taken by many as talking about equal periods of time.\n\nProphetic Months\nOther interpretations, (reference 4) have taken instead, prophetic months as equal to an average of 30.44 years based on 365.2422 divided by 12.\n\n"}

The main purpose for the Reiki share is to give and receive Reiki in a casual atmosphere of friendship, honor, positive energy and devotion.  Reiki shares usually last a few hours or they can be all-day events. The gatherings are often free or the host may ask for a small donation.\n\nPractitioners claim Reiki share offers recipients the combined wisdom and skill from multiple practitioners with different levels of experience. Time spent on the table(s) is shorter than a private Reiki session, but recipients receive attention from several pairs of hands simultaneously. Practitioners also claim that they benefit from giving Reiki as well as receiving it. In addition to giving and receiving Reiki, Reiki shares offer participants the opportunity to: \n\nEach Reiki event is different, but they usually include one of more of the following activities:\nOthers include a variety of different rituals.\n\nDuring a Reiki share, the recipients ultimately break into small groups and take turns lying down on massage tables. Multiple practitioners gather around each recipient and place their hands on or over them, rotating to make sure all attendees receive a similar amount of attention.\n\nReiki exchange implies that both people in the exchange are practitioners. Exchanges are generally restricted to Reiki practitioners.\n\nCircle implies that at some point, the group sits or stands in a circle, sometimes called healing circles. Reiki circles are generally open to the public.\n\nA circle ritual that practitioners claim helps \"sensitize\" and \"ground\" the practitioners at the beginning of a share.

{"id": "205480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205480", "title": "Richard Price", "text": "Richard Price\n\nRichard Price (23 February 1723 – 19 April 1791) was a British moral philosopher, nonconformist preacher and mathematician. He was also a political pamphleteer, active in radical, republican, and liberal causes such as the American Revolution. He was well-connected and fostered communication between a large number of people, including several of the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nPrice spent most of his adult life as minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church, on the outskirts of London. He also wrote on issues of demography and finance, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nRichard Price was the son of Rhys Price, a dissenting minister. His mother was Catherine Richards, his father's second wife. Richard was born at Tyn Ton, a farmhouse in the village of Llangeinor, Glamorgan, Wales. He was educated privately, then at Neath and Pen-twyn. He studied under Vavasor Griffiths at Chancefield, Talgarth.\n\nHe then left Wales for England, where he spent the rest of his life. He studied with John Eames and the dissenting academy in Moorfields, London. Leaving the academy in 1744, Price became chaplain and companion to George Streatfield at Stoke Newington, then a village just north of London. He also held the lectureship at Old Jewry, where Samuel Chandler was minister. Streatfield's death and that of an uncle in 1757 improved his circumstances, and on 16 June 1757 he married Sarah Blundell, originally of Belgrave in Leicestershire.\n\nIn 1758 Price moved to Newington Green, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658.) Price became minister to the Newington Green meeting-house, a church that continues today as Newington Green Unitarian Church. Among the congregation were Samuel Vaughan and his family. Price had Thomas Amory as preaching colleague from 1770.\n\nWhen, in 1770, Price became morning preacher at the Gravel Pit Chapel in Hackney, he continued his afternoon sermons at Newington Green. He also accepted duties at the meeting house in Old Jewry.\n\nA close friend of Price was Thomas Rogers, father of Samuel Rogers, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of \"The Dignity of Human Nature\" and \"Thoughts on Education\", who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation. Price and Rogers joined the Society for Constitutional Information.\n\nThe \"Bowood circle\" was a group of liberal intellectuals around Lord Shelburne, and named after Bowood House, his seat in Wiltshire. Price met Shelburne in or shortly after 1767, or was introduced by his wife Elizabeth Montagu, a leader of the Blue Stocking intellectual women, after the publication of his \"Four Dissertations\" in that year.\n\nIn 1771 Price had Shelburne employ Thomas Jervis. Another member of the circle was Benjamin Vaughan. In 1772 Price recruited Joseph Priestley, who came to work for Shelburne as librarian from 1773.\n\nThe group that Benjamin Franklin christened the \"Club of Honest Whigs\" was an informal dining group around John Canton. It met originally in St Paul's Churchyard, at the London Coffee House; in 1771 it moved to Ludgate Hill. Price and Sir John Pringle were members, as were Priestley and Benjamin Vaughan.\n\nAt home, or at his church itself, Price was visited by Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; other American politicians such as Ambassador John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail; and British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, Earl Stanhope (known as \"Citizen Stanhope\"), and William Pitt the Elder. He knew also the philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith. Among activists, the prison reformer John Howard counted Price as a close friend; also there were John Horne Tooke, and John and Ann Jebb.\n\nOthers acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians William Ellery Channing and Theophilus Lindsey. When Lindsey resigned his living and moved to London to create an avowedly Unitarian congregation Price played a role in finding and securing the premises for what became Essex Street Chapel. At the end of the 1770s Price and Lindsey were concerned about the contraction of dissent, at least in the London area. With Andrew Kippis and others, they established the Society for Promoting Knowledge of the Scriptures in 1783.\n\nPrice and Priestley took diverging views on morals and metaphysics. In 1778 appeared a published correspondence, \"A Free Discussion on the Doctrines of Materialism and Philosophical Necessity\". Price maintained, in opposition to Priestley, the free agency of man and the unity and immateriality of the human soul. Price's opinions were Arian, Priestley's were Socinian.\n\nMary Wollstonecraft moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to Newington Green in 1784, with patron Mrs Burgh, widow of Price's friend James Burgh. Wollstonecraft, originally an Anglican, attended Price's services, where believers of all kinds were welcomed. The Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women, and proved kinder to her than her own family. Price is believed to have helped her with money to go to Lisbon to see her close friend Fanny Blood.\n\nWollstonecraft was then unpublished: through Price she met the radical publisher Joseph Johnson. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at Newington Green pushed her towards a political awakening. She later published \"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\" (1790), a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price; and \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792), extending Price's arguments about equality to women: Tomalin argues that just as the Dissenters were \"excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority\", so too were women, and the \"character defects of both groups\" could be attributed to this discrimination. Price appears 14 times in the diary of William Godwin, Wollstonecraft's later husband.\n\nThe support Price gave to the colonies of British North America in the American War of Independence made him famous. In early 1776 he published \"Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Government, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America\". Sixty thousand copies of this pamphlet were sold within days; and a cheap edition was issued which sold twice as many copies. It commended Shelburne's proposals for the colonies, and attacked the Declaratory Act. Amongst its critics were Adam Ferguson, William Markham, John Wesley, and Edmund Burke; and Price rapidly became one of the best known men in England. He was presented with the freedom of the city of London, and it is said that his pamphlet had a part in determining the Americans to declare their independence. A second pamphlet on the war with America and the debts of Great Britain, followed in the spring of 1777.\n\nPrice's name became identified with the cause of American independence. Franklin was a close friend; Price corresponded with Turgot; and in the winter of 1778 he was invited by the Continental Congress to go to America and assist in the financial administration of the states, an offer he turned down. In 1781 he, solely with George Washington, received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Yale College. He preached to crowded congregations, and, when Lord Shelburne became Prime Minister in 1782, he was offered the post of his private secretary. The same year he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nPrice wrote also \"Observations on the importance of the American Revolution and the means of rendering it a benefit to the World\" (1784). Well received by Americans, it suggested that the greatest problem facing Congress was its lack of central powers.\n\nBoth Price and Priestley, who were millennialists, saw the French Revolution of 1789 as fulfilment of prophecy. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, 4 November 1789, Price preached a sermon entitled \"A Discourse on the Love of Our Country\", and ignited the pamphlet war known as the Revolution Controversy, on the political issues raised by the French Revolution. Price drew a bold parallel between the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (the one celebrated by the London Revolution Society dinner) and the French Revolution of 1789, arguing that the former had spread enlightened ideas and paved the way for the second one. Price exhorted the public to divest themselves of national prejudices and embrace \"universal benevolence\", a concept of cosmopolitanism that entailed support for the French Revolution and the progress of \"enlightened\" ideas. It has been called \"one of the great political debates in British history\". At the dinner of the London Revolution Society that followed, Price also suggested that the Society should send an address to the National Assembly in Paris. This was the start of a correspondence with many Jacobin clubs in Paris and elsewhere in France. Though the London Revolution Society and the Jacobin clubs agreed on basic tenets, their correspondence displayed a sense of growing misunderstanding as the French Jacobins grew more radical and their British correspondents, including Price, were not prepared to condone political violence. The Society's Committee of Correspondence, which included Michael Dodson, took up the contact that was made with French Jacobins, though Price himself withdrew. At the same time, the Revolution Society joined with the Society for Constitutional Information in December 1789, at Price's insistence, in condemning the Test Act and Corporation Act as defacing the British polity, with their restrictions on Dissenters.\n\nBurke's rebuttal in \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790) attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor; William Coxe was another opponent, disagreeing with Price on interpretation of \"our country\". In 1792 Christopher Wyvill published \"Defence of Dr. Price and the Reformers of England\", a plea for reform and moderation.\n\nIn 1767 Price received the honorary degree of D.D. from the University of Aberdeen, and in 1769 another from the University of Glasgow. In 1786 Sarah Price died: there were no children by the marriage.\n\nIn the same year Price with other Dissenters founded Hackney New College. On 19 April 1791 Price died. His funeral was conducted at Bunhill Fields and his funeral sermon was preached by Joseph Priestley.\n\nHis extended family included William Morgan, the actuary, and his brother George Cadogan Morgan (1754–1798), dissenting minister and scientist, both sons of Richard Price's sister Sarah by William Morgan, a surgeon of Bridgend, Glamorganshire.\n\nIn 1744 Price published a volume of sermons. It was, however, as a writer on financial and political questions that Price became widely known. Price rejected traditional Christian notions of original sin and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature, and he wrote on theological questions. He also wrote on finance, economics, probability, and life insurance.\n\nPrice was asked to become literary executor of Thomas Bayes the mathematician. He edited Bayes's major work \"An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\" (1763), which appeared in \"Philosophical Transactions\", and contains Bayes' Theorem, one of the fundamental results of probability theory. Price wrote an introduction to the paper which provides some of the philosophical basis of Bayesian statistics. In 1765 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his work on the legacy of Bayes.\n\nFrom about 1766 Price worked with the Society for Equitable Assurances. In 1769, in a letter to Benjamin Franklin, he made some observations on life expectancy, and the population of London, which were published in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" of that year. Price's views included the detrimental effects of large cities, and the need for some constraints on commerce and movement of population.\n\nIn particular Price took an interest in the figures of Franklin and Ezra Stiles on the colonial population in America, thought in some places to be doubling every 22 years. A debate on the British population had begun in the 1750s (William Brakenridge, Richard Forster, Robert Wallace who pointed to manufacturing and smallpox as factors reducing population, William Bell), but was inconclusive in the face of a lack of sound figures. The issue was of interest to European writers generally. The quantitative form of Price's theory on the contrasting depopulation in England and Wales amounted to an approximate drop in population of 25% since 1688. It was disputed numerically by Arthur Young in his \"Political Arithmetic\" (1774), which took in also criticism of the physiocrats.\n\nIn May 1770 Price presented to the Royal Society a paper on the proper method of calculating the values of contingent reversions. His book \"Observations on Reversionary Payments\" (1771) became a classic, in use for about a century, and providing the basis for financial calculations of insurance and benefit societies, of which many had recently been formed. The \"Northampton table\", a life table compiled by Price with data from Northampton, became standard for about a century in actuarial work. It, too, overestimated mortality. In consequence, it was good for the insurance business, and adverse for those funding annuities. Price's nephew William Morgan was an actuary, and became manager of the Equitable in 1775. He later wrote a memoir of Price's life.\n\nPrice wrote a further \"Essay on the Population of England\" (2nd ed., 1780) which influenced Thomas Robert Malthus. His continuing claim in it on British depopulation was challenged by John Howlett in 1781. Investigation of actual causes of ill-health began at this period, in a group of radical physicians around Priestley, including Price but centred on the Midlands and north-west: with John Aikin, Matthew Dobson, John Haygarth and Thomas Percival. Of these Haygarth and Percival supplied Price with figures, to supplement those he had collected himself in Northampton parishes.\n\nIn 1771 Price published his \"Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the National Debt\" (ed. 1772 and 1774). This pamphlet excited considerable controversy, and is supposed to have influenced William Pitt the Younger in re-establishing the sinking fund for the extinction of the national debt, created by Robert Walpole in 1716 and abolished in 1733. The means proposed for the extinction of the debt are described by Lord Overstone as \"a sort of hocus-pocus machinery,\" supposed to work \"without loss to any one,\" and consequently unsound. Price's views were attacked by John Brand in 1776. When Brand returned to finance and fiscal matters, \"Alteration of the Constitution of the House of Commons and the Inequality of the Land Tax\" (1793), he used work of Price, among others.\n\nThe \"Review of the Principal Questions in Morals\" (1758, 3rd ed. revised 1787) contains Price's theory of ethics. The work is supposedly a refutation of Francis Hutcheson. Price represented a different tradition, deontological ethics rather than the virtue ethics of Hutcheson, going back to Samuel Clarke and John Balguy. The book is divided into ten chapters, the first of which gives his main ethical theory, allied to that of Ralph Cudworth. Other chapters show his relation to Joseph Butler and Immanuel Kant. Philosophically and politically Price had something in common with Thomas Reid. As a moralist Price is now regarded as a precursor to the rational intuitionism of the 20th century. He drew, among other sources, on Cicero and Panaetius, and has been labelled a \"British Platonist\".\n\nJ. G. A. Pocock comments that Price was a moralist first, putting morality well ahead of democratic attachments. He was widely criticised for that and an absence of interest in civil society. As well as Burke, John Adams, Adam Ferguson and Josiah Tucker wrote against him. James Mackintosh wrote that Price was attempting to revive moral obligation. Théodore Simon Jouffroy preferred Price to Cudworth, Reid and Dugald Stewart. See also William Whewell's \"History of Moral Philosophy in England\"; Alexander Bain's \"Mental and Moral Sciences\"; and Thomas Fowler's monograph on Shaftesbury and Hutcheson.\n\nFor Price, right and wrong belong to actions in themselves, and he rejects consequentialism. This ethical value is perceived by reason or understanding, which intuitively recognizes fitness or congruity between actions, agents and total circumstances. Arguing that ethical judgment is an act of discrimination, he endeavours to invalidate moral sense theory. He admits that right actions must be \"grateful\" to us; that, in fact, moral approbation includes both an act of the understanding and an emotion of the heart. Still it remains true that reason alone, in its highest development, would be a sufficient guide. In this conclusion he is in close agreement with Kant; reason is the arbiter, and right is\n\n\nPrice's main point of difference with Cudworth is that while Cudworth regards the moral criterion as a νόημα or modification of the mind, existing in germ and developed by circumstances, Price regards it as acquired from the contemplation of actions, but acquired necessarily, immediately intuitively. In his view of disinterested action (ch. iii.) he follows Butler. Happiness he regards as the only end, conceivable by us, of divine Providence, but it is a happiness wholly dependent on rectitude. Virtue tends always to happiness, and in the end must produce it in its perfect form.\n\nPrice also wrote \"Fast-day Sermons\", published respectively in 1779 and 1781. Throughout the American War, Price preached sermons on fast-days and took the opportunity to attack Britain's coercive policies toward the colonies. A complete list of his works was given as an appendix to Priestley's \"Funeral Sermon\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This argument was explained by Islamic philosophers such as Avicenna, Mulla Sadra and Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i.\n\nSeddiqin means the argument of the sincere men or truthful ones. Seddiqin refers to Those who are just only argue for the God's existence through God. In other words, in this argument, the existence of God argued through only the existence. According to Legenhausen the Seddiqin is synonym with sincere, sincere is antonym with \nhypocritical.The word \"Seddiqin\" is a \"sighah mubalighah\" in Arabic grammar which shows extra attribution.Consequently, Seddiqin means those who are extremist in faith and belief.\n\nThe Seddiqin counted as one of the lasting and permanent argument in Islamic philosophy for the existence of God.This argument also posed by most of Islamic philosophers in different explanation to justify the Necessity Being.It seems that one who first presented the argument is Avicenna. after him, many of Islamic philosophers try to show other explanation of the Seddiqin argument.\n\nAvicenna detailed the argument for the existence of God in three books namely Al-ShifaThe Book of Healing and Al-Nejat and Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat. it seems that for the first time applied the argument of Seddiqin. According to Muhammad Legenhausen little pay attention to Avicenna's proof of sincere.Avicenna described the argument as seddiqin( Borhane seddiqin) because this argumentation applies by those who are truthful. According to Avicenna, those who are truthful persons, their argument is pure truth while there is no symbols of untruthfulness in their argumentation. In other words, Seddiqin witness to existence of God and truth just only by one argument which is the essence of Truth and God. Avicenna refers to the argument as follows:\nAlso Avicenna quotes the Quran to support the argumentation:\" Is it not sufficient as regards your Lord that he is witness over all things\"(surah 41, verse 53).\n\nAvicenna focuses on the view that God is a necessary being in itself. This argument is based on contingency. The claim of Avicenna is that we can establish the existence of God directly by consideration of his existence itself. In other words in the proof of sincere, Avicenna tries to reach the existence of God just through an analysis of existence itself along with the supposition that God is the necessary existent. According to him, if we reflect on any things generally and consider only to its existence, then the existence is either necessary or not. If the existence is necessary then it is God-Avicenna call it (al-Wajib al-wujud) and if the existent is not necessary then it is impossible or contingent. It is not impossible because we assume that it is something therefore it must be contingent. In fact, if we consider the existence of existent alone then it is either the necessary or contingent. The contingent, in respect to its existence, needed ab alio or something which brings it into existence. The preponderant itself is necessary or contingent. If it is necessary, then it is God. If it is contingent, then it is in need of a transcendent cause. The series of these transcendent causes themselves are finite or infinite. The finite series finally arrives to God since that the last member doesn't need to any cause and therefore itself is by definition the Necessary Existent. If the series would be infinite then series as a whole needed to its components in its existence and therefore is contingent.\n\nSuhrawardi, founder of illuminatinism, also referred to the seddiqin. its version is important for two reasons. first that he introduce mystical ideas into the argument. secondly mulla Sadra Shirazi known himself closer to Suhrawardi rather than Avicenna. Suhrawardi has its terminology for the argument. For instance he used word the lights of light in place of God or necessary being. He used rich for necessary being and poor for contingent being. His argument in his collected works are as follows:\n\nOf course the above argument depends upon the impossibility of an infinite regress but in other books he presents as argument in which there is no need to the supposition of infinite regress. This argument is as follows:\nThis argument has closed relation with metaphor of light. According to surawardi, if we suppose that existence is contingent then if the regress of infinite be impossible, consequently there is to be a first.\n\nMulla Sadra explained the proof of sincere in a way that his explanation has some differentiation not only with Avicenna's version but also with Suhrevardi's .This differentiation with Avicenna differs in the argument of the existence as an existent. In other words, he begins his argument with an existent in the world until he reached to the necessary existent. Mulla Sadra also rejects Suhrawardi’s statement of the argument from contingency.\n\n"}
{"id": "1594796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1594796", "title": "Semantic gap", "text": "Semantic gap\n\nThe semantic gap characterizes the difference between two descriptions of an object by different linguistic representations, for instance languages or symbols. According to Hein, the semantic gap can be defined as \"the difference in meaning between constructs formed within different representation systems\". In computer science, the concept is relevant whenever ordinary human activities, observations, and tasks are transferred into a computational representation.\n\nMore precisely the gap means the difference between ambiguous formulation of contextual knowledge in a powerful language (e.g. natural language) and its sound, reproducible and computational representation in a formal language (e.g. programming language). Semantics of an object depends on the context it is regarded within. For practical application this means any formal representation of real world tasks requires the translation of the contextual expert knowledge of an application (high-level) into the elementary and reproducible operations of a computing machine (low-level). Since natural language allows the expression of tasks which are impossible to compute in a formal language there are no means to automatize this translation in a general way. Moreover, the examination of languages within the Chomsky hierarchy indicates that there is no formal and consequently automated way of translating from one language into another above a certain level of expressional power.\n\nThe yet unproven but commonly accepted Church-Turing thesis states that a Turing machine and all equivalent formal languages such as the lambda calculus perform and represent all formal operations respectively as applied by a computing human. However the selection of adequate operations for the correct computation itself is not formally deducible, moreover it depends on the computability of the underlying problem. Tasks, such as the halting problem, may be formulated comprehensively in natural language, but the computational representation will not terminate or does not provide a usable result, which is proven by Rice's theorem. The general expression of limitations for rule based deduction by Gödel's incompleteness theorem indicates that the semantic gap is never to be fully closed. These are general statements, considering the generalized limits of computation on the highest level of abstraction where the semantic gap manifests itself. There are however lots of subsets of problems which may be translated automatically, especially in the higher numbered levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.\n\nReal world tasks are formalized by programming languages, which are executed on computers based on the von Neumann architecture. Since programming languages are only comfortable representations of the Turing machine any program on a von Neumann computer has the same properties and limitations as the Turing machine or its equivalent representation. Consequently, every programming language such as CPU level machine code, assembler, or any high level programming language has the same expressional power as the underlying Turing machine is able to compute. There is no semantic gap between them since a program is transferred from the high level language to the machine code by a program, e.g. a compiler which itself runs on a Turing machine without any user interaction. The semantic gap actually opens between the selection of the rules and the representation of the task.\n\nSelection of rules for formal representations of real world applications, corresponds to writing a program. Writing programs is independent from the actual programming language and basically requires the translation of the domain specific knowledge of the user into the formal rules operating a turing machine. It is this transfer from contextual knowledge into formal representation which cannot be automatized with respect to the theoretical limitations of computation. Consequently, any mapping from real world applications into computer applications requires a certain amount of technical background knowledge by the user, where the semantic gap manifests itself.\n\nIt is a fundamental task of software engineering to close the gap between application specific knowledge and technically doable formalization. For this purpose domain specific (high-level) knowledge must be transferred into an algorithm and its parameters (low-level). This requires the dialogue between user and developer. Aim is always a software which allows the user to represent his knowledge as parameters of an algorithm without knowing the details of the implementation, and to interpret the outcome of the algorithm without the aid of the developer. For this purpose user interfaces play the key role in software design, while developers are supported by frameworks which help organizing the integration of contextual information.\n\nA simple example can be formulated as a series of increasingly difficult natural language queries to locate a \"target document\" that may or may not exist locally on a known computer system.\n\nExample queries:\n\nThe progressive difficulty of these queries is represented by the increasing degree of abstraction from the types and semantics defined the system architecture (directories and files on a known computer) to the types and semantics that occupy the realm of ordinary human discourse (subjects such as \"humor\" and entities such as \"my grandmother\"). Moreover, this disparity of realms is further complicated by leaky abstractions, such as is common in the case of query 4), where the \"target document\" may exist, but may not encapsulate the \"metadata\" in a manner expected by the user, nor the designer of the query processing system.\n\nImage analysis is a typical domain for which a high degree of abstraction from low-level methods is required, and where the semantic gap immediately affects the user. If image content is to be identified to understand the meaning of an image, the only available independent information is the low-level pixel data. Textual annotations always depend on the knowledge, capability of expression and specific language of the annotator and therefore is unreliable.

All emphasize the actual physical, geographical, ecological and infrastructural state the actor is in, which determines that actor's actions or range of actions - all deny that there is any one point of view from which to apply standards of or by authority. This makes such theories unpopular with authority, and popular with those who advocate political decentralisation.\n\nHumans pass through Kohlberg/Gilligan's stages of moral development. Up to stage 3 (Conventional morality:Good Interpersonal Relationships), these stages are compatible with embodiment. Most philosophy of law emphasizes that the fact that bodies take risk to enforce laws, make laws embodied at least to the degree they are enforced.\n\nHowever, the stages become problematic when Lawrence Kohlberg posits a universal ethics - that is, a disembodied ethic. All ethical decisions are necessarily situated in a world. Carol Gilligan's view is closer to an embodied view and emphasizes ethical relationships - necessarily between bodies - over universal ethical principles that require a \"God's Eye view\". Some ethicists emphasize the role of the ethicist to sort out right versus right in a given context. This is stage 4 but assumes that the ethicist is hesitant to damage relationships or violate principles, e.g. that survival or human rights take precedence over property rights.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33922994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33922994", "title": "Timothy Morton", "text": "Timothy Morton\n\nTimothy Bloxam Morton (born 19 June 1968) is a professor and Rita Shea Guffey Chair in English at Rice University. A member of the object-oriented philosophy movement, Morton's work explores the intersection of object-oriented thought and ecological studies. Morton's use of the term 'hyperobjects' was inspired by Björk's 1996 single 'Hyperballad' although the term 'Hyper-objects' (denoting \"n\"-dimensional non-local entities) has also been used in computer science since 1967. Morton uses the term to explain objects so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend localization, such as climate change and styrofoam. His recent book \"Humankind: Solidarity with Non-Human People\" explores the separation between humans and non-humans and from an object-oriented ontological perspective, arguing that humans need to radically rethink the way in which we conceive of, and relate to, non-human animals and nature as a whole, going on to explore the political implications of such a change. Morton has also written extensively about the literature of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley, Romanticism, diet studies, and ecotheory.\n\nMorton received a B.A. and D.Phil. in English from Magdalen College, Oxford. His doctoral dissertation, \"Re-Imagining the Body: Shelley and the Languages of Diet,\" studied the representation of diet, temperance, and consumption in the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. According to Morton, the decision to study English literature, as opposed to more academically fashionable classics, stemmed from a desire to engage with modes of thought evolving internationally \"including all kinds of continental philosophy that just wasn't happening much in England at the time, what with the war against 'theory' and all.\"\n\nBefore obtaining a professorship at Rice University, in 2012, Morton previously taught at the University of California, Davis, New York University and the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nMorton's theoretical writings espouse an eclectic approach to scholarship. His subjects include the poetry and literature of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley, the cultural significance and context of food, ecology and environmentalism, and object-oriented ontology OOO.\n\nIn 1995, Morton published \"Shelley and the Revolution in Taste: The Body and the Natural World\", an extension of the ideas presented in his doctoral dissertation. Investigating how food came to signify ideological outlook in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Morton's book is an attempt at 'green' cultural criticism, whereby bodies and the social or environmental conditions in which they appear are shown to be interrelated. Employing a 'prescriptive' analysis of various Romantic texts, especially Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"A Vindication of Natural Diet\" (1813), Morton argues that the figurative rhetorical elements of these texts should be read not simply as clever language play, but as commands to establish consumptive practices that challenge ideological configurations of how the body relates to normativity. For Morton, authoritarian power dynamics, commodity flows, industrial logic, and the distinction between the domains of nature and culture are inhered in the 'discourses of diet' articulated by the Shelleys. In turn, Shelleyan prose regarding forms of consumption, particularly vegetarianism, is read as a call for social reform and figurative discussions of intemperance and intoxication as warnings against tyranny.\n\nAdditionally, Morton has edited two critical volumes on the Shelleyan corpus. In 2002, he published a compilation of critical and historical reflections on Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" entitled \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: A Routledge Study Guide and Sourcebook\". Then, in 2006, Morton edited \"The Cambridge Companion to Shelley\", an interdisciplinary overview of Percy Bysshe Shelley's themes, language, narrative structure, literary philosophy, and political views.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2004, Morton published three works dealing with the intersection of food and cultural studies. In the first of these to be published, \"The Poetics of Spice: Romantic Consumerism and the Exotic\" (2000), Morton unpacked the evolution of European consumer culture through an analysis of the figurative use of spice in Romantic literature. Viewing spice as a cultural artifact that functioned \"as discourse, not object, naively transparent to itself\" during the Romantic period, he elucidates two general characteristics of the poetics of spice: materiality and transumption. The 'materiality' of spice connects its symbolic and social roles with its capacity for desire production. Morton cites the \"trade winds topos\" (perfumed breeze believed to waft from exotic lands in which spices are domestic) in Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" as an example, concluding that Milton prefigures the symbolic use of spice in later works by presenting Satan's journey from Hell to Chaos as a parallel to the travels of spice traders. In contrast, 'transumption', following Harold Bloom's deployment of the rhetorical concept, entails the use of a metasignifier that \"serves as a figure for poetic language itself.\" According to Morton, the works of John Dryden exemplify transumption, revealing \"a novel kind of capitalist poetics, relying on the representation of the spice trade...Spice is not a balm, but an object of trade, a trope to be carried across boundaries, standing in for money: a metaphor about metaphor.\" Carrying this idea forward to the Romantic era, Morton critiques the manner in which spice became a metaphor for exotic desire that, subsequently, encapsulated the self-reflexivity of modern processes of commodification.\n\nLater, Morton edited \"Radical Food: The Culture and Politics of Eating and Drinking, 1790-1820\" (2000), a three-volume compendium of eighteenth century texts examining the literary, sociocultural, and political history of food, including works on intoxication, cannibalism, and slavery. He also edited \"Cultures of Taste/Theories of Appetite: Eating Romanticism\" (2004), a collection of essays that problematizes the use of taste and appetite as Romantic metaphors for bounded territories and subjectivities, while empirically interrogating the organization of Romantic cultural and economic structures around competing logics of consumption.\n\nSince 2009, Morton has engaged in a sustained project of ecological critique, primarily enunciated in two works, \"Ecology Without Nature\" (2007) and \"The Ecological Thought\" (2010), through which he problematizes environmental theory from the standpoint of ecological entanglement. In \"Ecology Without Nature\", Morton proposes that an ecological criticism must be divested of the bifurcation of nature and civilization, or the idea that nature exists as something that sustains civilization, but exists outside of society's walls. As Morton states:\n\nViewing \"nature,\" in the putative sense, as an arbitrary textual signifier, Morton theorizes artistic representations of the environment as sites for opening ideas of nature to new possibilities. Seeking an aesthetic mode that can account for the differential, paradoxical, and nonidentificational character of the environment, he proposes a materialist method of textual analysis called 'ambient poetics', in which artistic texts of all kinds are considered in terms of how they manage the space in which they appear, thereby attuning the sensibilities of their audience to forms of natural representation that contravene the ideological coding of nature as a transcendent principle. Historicizing this form of poetics permits the politicization of environmental art and its 'ecomimesis', or authenticating evocation of the author's environment, such that the experience of its phenomena becomes present for and shared with the audience.\n\nArt is also an important theme in \"The Ecological Thought\", a \"prequel\" to \"Ecology Without Nature\", in which Morton proposes the concept of 'dark ecology' as a means of expressing the \"irony, ugliness, and horror\" of ecology. From the vantage point of dark ecology, there exists no neutral theoretical ground on which to articulate ecological claims. Instead, all beings are always already implicated within the ecological, necessitating an acknowledgement of coexistential difference for coping with ecological catastrophe that, according to Morton, \"has already occurred.\"\n\nClosely related to dark ecology is Morton's concept of the 'mesh'. Defining the ecological thought as \"the thinking of interconnectedness,\" Morton thus uses 'mesh' to refer to the interconnectedness of all living and non-living things, consisting of \"infinite connections and infinitesimal differences.\" He explains:\n\nThe mesh has no central position that privileges any one form of being over others, and thereby erases definitive interior and exterior boundaries of beings. Emphasizing the interdependence of beings, the ecological thought \"permits no distance,\" such that all beings are said to relate to each other in a totalizing open system, negatively and differentially, rendering ambiguous those entities with which we presume familiarity. Morton calls these ambiguously inscribed beings 'strange strangers', or beings unable to be completely comprehended and labeled. Within the mesh, even the strangeness of strange strangers relating coexistentially is strange, meaning that the more we know about an entity, the stranger it becomes. Intimacy, then, becomes threatening because it veils the mesh beneath the illusion of familiarity.\n\nMorton became involved with object-oriented ontology after his ecological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. One way that his work can be distinguished from other variants of object-oriented thought is by its focus on the causal dimension of object relations. Against traditional causal philosophies, Morton argues that causality is an aesthetic dimension of relations between objects, wherein sensory experience does not indicate direct access to reality, but rather an uncanny interruption of the false ontic equilibrium of an interobjective system. Causation, in this view, is held to be illusion-like or \"magical,\" forming the core of what Morton terms \"realist magic.\"\n\nIn \"The Ecological Thought\", Morton employed the term \"hyperobjects\" to describe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium. He has subsequently enumerated five characteristics of hyperobjects:\n\n\nAccording to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of ecological crisis, but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age in which they live. Additionally, the existential capacity of hyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values, coupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter (what Morton calls a \"demonic inversion of the sacred substances of religion\"), gives them a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future societies may become indistinguishable from reverential care.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1044560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1044560", "title": "Umwelt", "text": "Umwelt\n\nIn the semiotic theories of Jakob von Uexküll and Thomas A. Sebeok, umwelt (plural: umwelten; from the German \"Umwelt\" meaning \"environment\" or \"surroundings\") is the \"biological foundations that lie at the very epicenter of the study of both communication and signification in the human [and non-human] animal\". The term is usually translated as \"self-centered world\". Uexküll theorised that organisms can have different \"umwelten\", even though they share the same environment. The subject of \"umwelt\" and Uexküll's work is described by Dorion Sagan in an introduction to a collection of translations. The term \"umwelt\", together with companion terms \"Umgebung\" (an Umwelt as seen by another observer) and \"Innenwelt\" (the mapping of the self to the world of objects), have special relevance for cognitive philosophers, roboticists and cyberneticians, since they offer a solution to the conundrum of the infinite regress of the Cartesian Theater. \n\nEach functional component of an \"umwelt\" has a meaning and so represents the organism's model of the world. These functional components correspond approximately to perceptual features, as described by Anne Treisman. It is also the semiotic world of the organism, including all the meaningful aspects of the world for any particular organism, i.e. it can be water, food, shelter, potential threats, or points of reference for navigation. An organism creates and reshapes its own \"umwelt\" when it interacts with the world. This is termed a 'functional circle'. The \"umwelt\" theory states that the mind and the world are inseparable, because it is the mind that interprets the world for the organism. Consequently, the \"umwelten\" of different organisms differ, which follows from the individuality and uniqueness of the history of every single organism. When two \"umwelten\" interact, this creates a semiosphere.\n\nAs a term, \"umwelt\" also unites all the semiotic processes of an organism into a whole. Internally, an organism is the sum of its parts operating in functional circles and, to survive, all the parts must work cooperatively. This is termed the \"collective \"umwelt\"\" which models the organism as a centralised system from the cellular level upward. This requires the semiosis of any one part to be continuously connected to any other semiosis operating within the same organism. If anything disrupts this process, the organism will not operate efficiently.\n\nUexküll's writings show a specific interest in the various worlds that he believed to exist ('conceptually') from the point of view of the \"umwelt\" of different creatures such as ticks, sea urchins, amoebae, jellyfish and sea worms.\n\nThe biosemiotic turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The \"umwelt\" is for him an environment-world which is, according to Agamben, \"constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] 'carriers of significance' or 'marks' which are the only things that interest the animal\". Agamben goes on to paraphrase Uexküll's example of the tick, saying,\n\"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood.\"\nThus, for the tick, the \"umwelt\" is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, (2) The temperature of 37°C (corresponding to the blood of all mammals), (3) The hairy topography of mammals.\n\nUexküll's application of the notion of \"umwelt\" to the human person has been contested. In \"Welt und Umwelt\" and \"Die Wahrheit der Dinge\", the philosopher and sociologist Josef Pieper argued that reason allows the human person to live in \"Welt\" (world) while plants and animals do indeed live in an Umwelt—a notion he traces back far beyond Uexküll to Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "856045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=856045", "title": "Will Kymlicka", "text": "Will Kymlicka\n\nWill Kymlicka (; born 1962) is a Canadian political philosopher best known for his work on multiculturalism and animal ethics. He is currently Professor of Philosophy and Canada Research Chair in Political Philosophy at Queen's University at Kingston, and Recurrent Visiting Professor in the Nationalism Studies program at the Central European University in Budapest, Hungary. For over 20 years, he has lived a vegan lifestyle, and he is married to the Canadian author and animal rights activist Sue Donaldson.\n\nKymlicka received his B.A. (Honours) in philosophy and political studies from Queen's University in 1984, and his D.Phil. in philosophy from Oxford University in 1987, under the direction of G. A. Cohen. He has written extensively on multiculturalism and political philosophy, and several of his books have been translated into other languages. Kymlicka has held professorships at a variety of different universities in Canada and abroad, and has also worked as an advisor to the Government of Canada.\n\nOne of his main concerns throughout his work is providing a liberal framework for the just treatment of minority groups, which he divides into two basic categories: polyethnic or immigrant groups, and national minorities (such as the Canadian Québécois, or the Māori of New Zealand). He lists criteria for national minorities or \"minority nations\":\nBy these criteria, the two \"minority nations\" in Canada are the First Nations population and the Québécois. Kymlicka argues that such minority groups deserve unique rights from the state by the nature of their unique role and history within the national population. (\"Group rights\" are also a recent innovation in Western democracy, which, from the Glorious Revolution up to the enfranchisement of women, emphasized individual rights as fundamental, and avoided assigning rights to particular groups, geographic, religious, linguistic or ethnic.)\n\nPolyethnic groups are less deserving of such rights since they come to the state voluntarily and thus have some degree of responsibility to integrate to the norms of their new nation. This does not mean that they are not entitled to any rights as Kymlicka argues that all cultural minorities have a right to choose their own lives, but it does mean that they are not entitled to the same level of group rights which minority nations would be entitled to. Kymlicka makes various exceptions such as the problems faced by refugees, whether from conflict or poverty, and by such minority groups such as African-Americans (whose heritage in America clearly did not begin voluntarily) and argues that their needs with regards to cultural group-specific rights should be considered on a special basis.\n\nIn \"Multicultural Citizenship\" (1995), Kymlicka argues that group-specific rights are consistent with liberalism, and are particularly appropriate, if not outright demanded, in certain situations. He defines three such group-specific rights: special group representation rights (such as affirmative action policies in politics); self-government rights; and polyethnic rights (such as the policy exempting Sikhs from having to wear motorcycle helmets).\n\nA distinction that Kymlicka draws, which is crucial to his liberal defence of group-specific rights for minorities, is between external protection and internal restrictions. Kymlicka argues that external protections between groups may be justified in order to promote equality (but they must not allow for oppression or exploitation, as in apartheid in South Africa). Internal restrictions, however, cannot be justified from a liberal perspective, insofar as they restrict a person's autonomy, though they may be granted in certain cases to national minorities.\n\nThe standard liberal criticism which states that group rights are problematic because they often treat individuals as mere carriers of group identities rather than autonomous social agents is overstated or oversimplified. The actual problem of minorities and how they should be viewed in liberal democracies is much more complex. There is a distinction between good group rights, bad group rights, and intolerable group rights.\n\nThe book \"Zoopolis\", by Sue Donaldson and co-authored with Kymlicka, explores the state of animal rights.\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka believe that abolitionism is an inadequate response to both the ethical and practical challenges of living fairly and constructively with other animals.\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka suggest that animals should be characterized through three categories, serving to determine the nature of the laws that should protect those animals. Domestic animals should be given a kind of adjusted co-citizenship in which their best interest and preferences would be taken into account. Wild animals should be granted sovereignty on their land enough so that they can sustain their way of living and prosper. \"Liminal\" animals (such as mice, pigeons and insects) should be treated as denizens of cities.\n\n\n\n\n"}
