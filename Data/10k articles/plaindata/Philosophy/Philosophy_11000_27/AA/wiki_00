{"id": "4876257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4876257", "title": "Buta Kola", "text": "Buta Kola\n\nButa Kola is a ritual folk dance from the coastal districts (Tulu Nadu) of Karnataka, India. The dance is highly stylized and held in honor of the local deities worshiped by the Tulu speaking population. It bears resemblance to the Theyyam of Kerala and has influenced Yakshagana folk theatre. Buta Kola could be categorized as a form of Shamanism as the dancer performing it goes into a trance and acts as an oracle for the deity being impersonated. \nThe Word is derived from \"būta\" (Tulu for ‘spirit’, ‘deity’; in turn derived from Sanskrit भूत for ‘free elements’,'which is purified','fit','proper', ‘true’,'past','creatures'; Anglicized: \"‘bhuta’, ‘bhoota’, ‘bootha’\") and \"kōla\" (Tulu for ‘play, performance, festival’).\n\nA \"būta kōla\" or \"nema\" is typically an annual ritual performance where local spirits or deities (\"būtas, daivas\") are being impersonated by ritual specialists from certain scheduled castes such as the Nalike, Pambada, or Parawa communities. The \"būta\" cult is prevalent among the non-Brahmin\nTuluvas of Tulu Nadu region . The word \"kōla\" is conventionally reserved for the worship of a single spirit whereas a \"nēma\" involves the impersonation of several spirits in hierarchical order. In \"kōlas\" and \"nēmas\" family and village disputes are referred to the spirit for mediation and adjudication. In feudal times, the justice aspect of the ritual included matters of political justice, such as the legitimation of political authority, as well as aspects of distributive justice. The produce of land directly owned by the \"būta\" (commons) as well as certain contributions from the leading manors was redistributed among the villagers.\n\nThe ritual performance at a \"būta kōla\" or \"daiva nēma\" involves music, dance, recital, and elaborate costumes. Recitals in Old Tulu recount the origins of the deity and tell the story of how it came to the present location. These epics are known as \"pāḍdanas.\"\n\nThurston counts among the best known deities \"Brahmeru, Kodamanitaya, Kukkintaya, Jumadi, Sarala Jumadi, Pancha Jumadi, Rakteswari, Panjurli, Kuppe Panjurli, Rakta Panjurli, Jarandaya, Urundarayya, Hosadēvata (or Hosa Bhūta), Dēvanajiri, Kalkuḍa, Tukkateri, Gulige, Bobbariya, Nicha, Duggalaya, Mahisandaya, Varte, Chāmundi, Baiderukulu, Ukkatiri, Kallurti, Shiraadi, Ullalthi, Okkuballala, and Odityay. According to some, Jumadi is the small-pox goddess Māri. The Bhūtas are supposed to belong to different castes. For example Okkuballala and Dēvanajiri are Jains, Kodamanitaya and Kukkinataya are Bunts, Kalkuḍa is a smith, Bobbariya is a Māppilla, and Nicha a Koraga.\" Some of them are ancestral spirits such as \"Bobbariya\", \"Kalkuḍa\", \"Kallurti\", \"Siri\", \"Kumār\" Koti and Chennayya. Some are deified wild animals such as the boar - \"Paňjurli\" (the female counterpart is \"Varte Paňjurli\") or the tiger - \"Pilichāmuṇḍi.\"\n\nSome \"būtas\" are Androgynous such as some instances of Jumadi who is represented as female below the neck (breasts), but with a male head sporting a mustache. There are anthropomorphic \"būtas\", zoomorphic ones, and mixed forms (such as the Malarāya of Kodlamogaru, Kasargod, who has the head of a wild boar and the body of a woman).\n\nDepending on the significance of the people who worship them, \"būtas\" or \"daivas\" can be family deities (\"kuṭuṃbada būta\"), local or village deities (\"jāgeda būta\", \"ūrada būta\"), or deities associated with administrative units such as manorial estates (\"guțțus\"), groups of estates (\"māgane\"), districts (\"sīme\") or even small kingdoms (royal \"būtas\" or \"rajandaivas\").\n\nAccording to the ethnographer Peter Claus, the Tulu \"pāḍdanas\" reveal a cosmology which is distinctly Dravidian and thus different from the Puranic Hindu cosmology. Importantly, priesthood is not the preserve of a caste learned in scriptures but is shared between the ruling aristocracy on one hand and ritual specialists from the lower strata of society on the other hand. The world is divided in two three realms: firstly, the realm of cultivated lands (grāmya), secondly the realm of wastelands and forests (jāṅgala/āraṇya), and thirdly the realm of spirits (būta-loka). Grāmya and jāṅgala/āraṇya form part of the tangible world, whereas būta-loka is their intangible counterpart. As grāmya is constantly threatened by encroachment, disease, hunger and death form jāṅgala and āraṇya, so is the tangible world under constant threat from the intangible world of the spirits. The world of the forest is the \"world of the wild, unordered, uncontrolled, hungry beings of destruction\".\n\nThe world of the forest and the world of the spirits are therefore seen as mirror images of each other. The wild animals threatening the human cultivator and his fields such as the tiger, the snake, the wild-boar, and the bison, find their mirror images in their corresponding būtas \"Pilli, Naga, Paňjurli\" and \"Maisandaya\".\n\nThe relationship between these three worlds is one of balance and moral order. If this order is upset by the humans, it is believed that the spirits become vicious. If the order is maintained, the spirits are believed to be supportive and benevolent. Thus, the spirits of Tulu culture are neither ‘good’ nor ‘bad’ as such; they are \"neither cruel nor capricious. They methodically and persistently remind a lax humanity of the need for morality and the value of solidarity\". Nobody is believed to be above the moral and cosmological norms of this threefold universe, not even the spirits or the gods. Thus the \"būta\"s are not whimsical or arbitrary in their judgement. The \"būta\"s are their patron’s protectors with regard to a system of moral norms, not despite them.\n\nFeudal relations of tribute and fealty mark the relations among the humans in the tangible world, among spirits in the intangible world and between humans and spirits across tangible and intangible worlds. While the world of humans is ruled by a mortal king, the world of the spirits is ruled by Bermeru, the lord of the forest and of the būtas. And just as the landed aristocracy depended on protection and support from their king, the world of humans depends on protection and support from the spirits. Thus once in a year at the time of \"kōla\" or \"nēma\", the lord of the human world (patriarch, landlord, king) has to be reconfirmed in his authority by reporting to the spirit to which he is accountable. While the temporal lord’s authority is dependent on the spirit\";\" the authority of the spirit is guaranteed by the active participation of the villagers in the ritual. Thereby a certain degree of political legitimacy is upheld by the active participation of the villagers. Their withdrawal from the ritual can seriously affect the authority of the landlord.\n\nAs Claus observes, the principal mediators in this network of feudal transactions are communities who once upon a time may have led a liminal life between grāmya and jāṅgala/āraṇya. Tribal communities living in and off the forest and trading in forest products were predestined to serve as spirit impersonators as their life world, the forest, is only the tangible side of the world of the spirits. In pursuit of their livelihood they regularly transgress structural boundaries between village and forest. They live on the margins of the village, in the wasteland between forest and field, thus they are themselves, in a sense, liminal. That such liminal people should be mediums for the spirits seems entirely apt. Today communities like Nalike, Parava or Pambada who impersonate different kinds of \"būtas\" and \"daivas\" can no longer be characterised as tribal. They are mostly landless agricultural labourers in the wet season and spirit impersonators in the dry season.\n\nToday feudal relations no longer obtain and thus former ruling families no longer hold any political or judicial office. But still the village demands that they sponsor their annual \"kōla\" or \"nēma\" to honour the village deity. The people believe that the neglect of the spirits will make their life miserable. Even though they may have changed, \"būta kōla\" and \"daiva\" \"nēma\" still serve secular as well as religious purposes. In fact the two cannot be separated in a world where the tangible is suffused with the intangible. As the cosmology underlying the \"pāḍdanas\" suggests, the very order of the human world and the order of the spirit world are interdependent.\n\n\"Būtas\" and \"daivas\" are not worshipped on a daily basis like mainstream Hindu gods. Their worship is restricted to annual ritual festivals, though daily \"pūjās\" may be conducted for the ritual objects, ornaments, and other paraphernalia of the būta. Unlike with the better-known Hindu gods of the \"purāṇic\" variety, \"būta\" worship is congregational.\nThe secular function of the \"kōla\" or \"nēma\" has been described as a \"sacred court of justice\" where traditional (feudal) moral ideals are brought to bear on difficult real-life situations. \"Būta kōlas\" and \"daiva\" \"nēmas\" are assemblies of the entire village. Thus they become an occasion to resolve conflicts in the village. The royal \"daiva\" (\"rājan-daiva)\" rules over a former small kingdom or large feudal estate. He or she is mostly the family deity of rich land-owning patrons of the \"Baṇṭ\" caste whose position and power they reflect, confirm and renew. The relationship between the \"būtas\", manor heads, and the villagers forms a transactional network which reaffirms the caste hierarchy and power relations in a village. The duty assigned to every category is differential but based on mutuality. The manor head by staging the \"nēma\" seeks to symbolically proclaim himself to be the natural leader of the community.\n\nThe villagers offer \"sēva\" during the \"nēma\" in the form of service and prostrations and in doing so also offer their support to the \"nēma\" and their recognition of the leader’s status. In return, the villagers expect justice and resolution of disputes by the \"daiva\" during the \"nēma.\" In the \"nēma\", the leading manors offer a part of their farm products to the \"daiva\", which are then redistributed to the villagers. The \"nēma\" thereby underlines the mutuality on which feudal relations used to be based and, in a limited way, takes care of the problem of social (distributive) justice. The \"būta\"s receive these offerings and in return give oracles and blessings to ensure the future prosperity of the village (humans, animals, fields). Finally, a part of these offerings will be distributed as \"prasāda\" among the heads of the \"guṭṭus\" and other villagers according to their ranks. The system of entitlements is constituted in, or embodied by, the mutual gifting activity between the \"būta\"s, as the ultimate owner of the land, and people in rituals, creating a transactional network among them.\n\nThe script of the ritual changes from one n\"ēmā\" to another, thus the following description is somewhat ideal-typical. The ritual begins with the paraphernalia of the \"būta\" being brought to the shrine which serves as a venue for the festival. They are placed on an altar or on a swinging cot, which is the insignium of a royal būta (\"rajan-daiva\"). The Nalike, Parava or Pambada medium prepares for the impersonation of the spirit with a recital of from the \"pāḍdana\" of the \"būta\" or \"daiva\". After this, the medium starts putting on make-up and dressing up in his costume which may include an elaborate \"ani\" (a giant halo stringed to the back of the dancer). Finally, the medium is given the ornaments from the hoard of the shrine. As he enters the arena, the attendant of the spirit (\"pātri\") gives him his sword, his bell and other paraphernalia and the patron (\"jajmān\") gives him one or several burning torches. As the medium begins to dance, the spirit enters his body. Two people hold the torches along with the medium at all times. Thus, the entrance of spirit into this world is restrained. The medium’s dance gains more force as the possession continues. He brings the torches dangerously close to his body. The \"jajmān\" now stands in a ritualistic circle on the ground with his assistants and offerings are made to the \"būta\". These offerings often include the sacrifice of a chicken whose blood is sprinkled on the ground to enhance the fertility of the land. These sacrificial acts are followed by offerings of puffed rice, beaten rice, coconut pieces, bananas, ghee, betel leaf, and areca nut. In the subsequent court of justice the spirit is approached by the villagers for blessings or asked to help resolve conflicts. The judicial program typically starts once the initial rituals are finished. Complaints and judgements are made orally. The \"būta\" issues the judgement after hearing the sides of the plaintiff as well as the defendant, if both are present. The \"būta’s\" justice must be referrable to general principles. \"\"He may take a stand, he cannot take sides”\". While the \"būta\" may take the opinions of the village headman and other eminent persons into consideration, the ultimate judgement rests with the \"būta\". Sometimes judgements are also issued by the tossing of betel leaves and the counting of flower petals (usually areca flower). Particularly difficult cases may also be adjourned to the next year by the \"būta\". Some common disputes that come up are related to land issues, family feuds, questions of honour, robbery, debt, mortgage, breach of contract etc. In cases of theft where the offender is unknown, the \"būta\" may ask for a certain offering before finding the thief. At times the victim offers the entire value of the stolen goods to the \"būta\". If the thief is found and penalised, the person is made to pay to the plaintiff a sum that is more than the value of the goods stolen. If the \"būta\" feels that the thief shows repentance, the gravity of the penalty could be reduced.\n\nThe art of being an impersonator is learned. Young boys belonging to the \"Pambada, Parava,\" \"Nalike\" castes attend rituals where their kin is performing; and they help out with shredding the coconut leaves for the garment of the impersonator, holding the mirror while the impersonator is putting on the makeup etc. They learn the art of the performance by observing the performance of their kin and trying to mimic it. Along with being able to mimic the way their kin performed, what is essential to be a successful impersonator is also the aptitude of being possessed by the deity. There are certain rules the impersonator needs to follow to prepare his body for the possession. This may include being a vegetarian and not drinking alcohol. The impersonator feels the sudden spirit possession only for a few seconds but after that he is filled with the deity’s energy that lets him behave as the deity for the entire ritual.\n\nThere are two types of mediators between the spirits and the humans. The first type of mediator is known as the \"pātri.\" These are members of middle castes such as \"Bunt\" (land-owners) and \"Billava\" (toddy tappers, formerly also bow-men). The second type of mediator (\"impersonators\") typically belongs to scheduled castes such as \"Pambada, Parava or Nalike.\" While the \"pātri\" has only a sword and a bell as ritual tools, the impersonator uses makeup, ornaments, masks etc. Both mediums are believed to impersonate from an altered state of consciousness. But while the impersonator may speak as the \"būta\" (in the first person) and about the \"būta\" (in the third person, i.e. when he recounts his/her \"pāḍdana\"), the pātri only speaks as the būta in the first person.\n\n\"Pāḍdanas\" are major part of Tuluva oral literature. Much of the body of this literature has been built on the legends of the \"būtas\" and \"daivas\". \"Pāḍdanas\" have numerous variations for the same narrative. As in other epic traditions, there is no single author. \"Pāḍdanas\" are orally transmitted and recited. The language of the \"pāḍdanas\" is old Tulu. Some famous examples are the \"Siri-Kumar Pāḍdanas\" and the Koti and Chennayya \"Pāḍdanas.\" The \"pāḍdanas\" sung by women while planting paddy are referred to as ‘field songs’.\n\nThe \"pāḍdanas\" recite the origins of the spirits and deities. This is one way for the rituals to reconstruct the past and render a legitimization to it. The singers act as the indigenous narrators of the history of the native land. The \"pāḍdanas\" also stand in opposition to the \"puranic,\" male based principles as they highlight the feminine principles of mother earth. The \"pāḍdanas\" also reflect multi-socio-cultural background shifts (for example, the move from Matrilineal system to Patrilineal system). The older sense of cosmology is retained through the \"pāḍdanas\". The \"pāḍdanas\" also reflect processes of Hinduisation and Sanskritization.\n\n"}

{"id": "250856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250856", "title": "Divine command theory", "text": "Divine command theory\n\nDivine command theory (also known as theological voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good is equivalent to whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.\n\nNumerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including Saint Augustine, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham and Søren Kierkegaard have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, Robert Merrihew Adams has proposed a \"modified divine command theory\" based on the omnibenevolence of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. Paul Copan has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski's divine motivation theory proposes that God's motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.\n\nSemantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.\n\nVarious forms of divine command theory have been presented by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.\n\nDivine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions, including Judaism, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Christianity, as well as being a part of numerous older polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.\n\nSaint Augustine offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.\n\nScholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing. Scotus argued that the natural law, in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the Ten Commandments. The last seven of the Ten Commandments do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense. Whilst our duties to God are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments \"are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily\". Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that \"those of weak character\" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.\n\nWhilst Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God, Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on Aquinas' moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.\n\nThe deontological ethics of Immanuel Kant has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist R. M. Hare. Kant's view that morality should be determined by the categorical imperative – duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end – has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian John E. Hare has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant's heteronomous will – motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral. American philosopher Lewis White Beck takes Kant's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority. John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that Kantian ethics should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.\n\nAmerican philosopher Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a \"modified divine command theory\". Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:\nHe proposes that God's commands precurse moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically 'wrong' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a Judeo-Christian context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of faith in God, specifically faith in God's goodness, as well as his existence.\n\nAdams proposes that an action is morally wrong if and only if it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case. Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his omnibenevolence. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.\n\nAdams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term 'wrong' is used to mean being contrary to God's commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that 'wrong' entails an emotional attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate. Adams suggests that a believer's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.\n\nMichael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God's omnipotence. Thomas Aquinas argued that God's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas' defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.\n\nPaul Copan argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God's image, conforms to God's sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God's.\nAs an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God's motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to virtue ethics because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God's, as the standard for moral value. Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God's perception of them. God's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude. The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.\n\nPhilosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that \"being commanded by God\" and \"being obligatory\" do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to HO to propose that \"being commanded by God\" does not have an identical meaning to \"being obligatory\". This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation. Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge. Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on modal ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.\n\nMichael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.\n\nThe Euthyphro dilemma was proposed in Plato's dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question 'Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?'\n\nThe Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or omnipotent, which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.\n\nWilliam of Ockham responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by 'biting the bullet'. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the principle of non-contradiction. Robert Adams defended Ockham's view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character. Eleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of divine simplicity, a concept associated with Aquinas and Aristotle which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.\n\nAmerican philosopher William Alston responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God's goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands – if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.\n\nMichael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.\n\nAustin considers the view that, in a world of religious pluralism, it is impossible to know which god's or religion's commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever religion and morality they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that moral truths can be found in all religions and that moral revelation can be found apart from religion. Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist – the commands of God in the Old and New Testaments could seem to contradict each other.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8344", "title": "Docetism", "text": "Docetism\n\nIn Christianity, docetism (from the \"dokeĩn\" \"to seem\", \"dókēsis\" \"apparition, phantom\", is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality. Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion.\n\nThe word \"Dokētaí\" (\"Illusionists\") referring to early groups who denied Jesus's humanity, first occurred in a letter by Bishop Serapion of Antioch (197–203), who discovered the doctrine in the Gospel of Peter, during a pastoral visit to a Christian community using it in Rhosus, and later condemned it as a forgery.. It appears to have arisen over theological contentions concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the Gospel of John: \"the Word was made Flesh\".\n\nDocetism was unequivocally rejected at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and is regarded as heretical by the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Orthodox Tewahedo, and many other Christian denominations that accept and hold to the statements of these early church councils.\n\nDocetism is broadly defined as any teaching that claims that Jesus' body was either absent or illusory. The term 'docetic' is rather nebulous. Two varieties were widely known. In one version, as in Marcionism, Christ was so divine that he could not have been human, since God lacked a material body, which therefore could not physically suffer. Jesus only \"appeared\" to be a flesh-and-blood man; his body was a phantasm. Other groups who were accused of docetism held that Jesus was a man in the flesh, but Christ was a separate entity who entered Jesus's body in the form of a dove at his baptism, empowered him to perform miracles, and abandoned him upon his death on the cross.\n\nDocetism's origin within Christianity is obscure. Ernst Käsemann controversially defined the Christology of St John’s Gospel as \"naïve docetism\" in 1968. The ensuing debate reached an impasse as awareness grew that the very term \"docetism\", like \"gnosticism\", was difficult to define within the religio-historical framework of the debate. It has occasionally been argued that its origins were in heterodox Judaism or Oriental and Grecian philosophies. The alleged connection with Jewish Christianity would have reflected Jewish Christian concerns with the inviolability of (Jewish) monotheism. Docetic opinions seem to have circulated from very early times, 1 John 4:2 appearing explicitly to reject them. Some 1stcentury Christian groups developed docetic interpretations partly as a way to make Christian teachings more acceptable to pagan ways of thinking about divinity.\n\nIn his critique of the theology of Clement of Alexandria, Photius in his Myriobiblon held that Clement's views reflected a quasi-docetic view of the nature of Christ, writing that \"[Clement] hallucinates that the Word was not incarnate but \"only seems to be\".\" (ὀνειροπολεῖ καὶ μὴ σαρκωθῆναι τὸν λόγον ἀλλὰ \"δόξαι\".) In Clement's time, some disputes contended over whether Christ assumed the \"psychic\" flesh of mankind as heirs to Adam, or the \"spiritual\" flesh of the resurrection. Docetism largely died out during the first millennium AD.\n\nThe opponents against whom Ignatius of Antioch inveighs are often taken to be Monophysite docetists. In his letter to the Smyrnaeans, 7:1, written around 110AD, he writes:\nWhile these characteristics fit a Monophysite framework, a slight majority of scholars consider that Ignatius was waging a polemic on two distinct fronts, one Jewish, the other docetic; a minority holds that he was concerned with a group that commingled Judaism and docetism. Others, however, doubt that there was actual docetism threatening the churches, arguing that he was merely criticizing Christians who lived Jewishly or that his critical remarks were directed at an Ebionite or Cerinthian possessionist Christology, according to which Christ was a heavenly spirit that temporarily possessed Jesus.\n\nSome commentators have attempted to make a connection between Islam and Docetism using the following Quranic verse:\n\nThe Quran does not state that Jesus suffered in a false body or more generally support \"discarnate principles of Docetism\". Christian commentators have often argued that in its denial of killing or crucifixion of Jesus the Quran was influenced by Docetic ideas, but this is a hypothesis that has no real proof.\n\nSince Arthur Drews published his \"The Christ Myth\" (Die Christusmythe) in 1909, occasional connections have been drawn between docetist theories and the modern idea that Christ was a myth. Shailer Mathews called Drews' theory a \"modern docetism\". Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare thought any connection to be based on a misunderstanding of docetism. The idea recurred in classicist Michael Grant's 1977 review of the evidence for Jesus, who compared modern scepticism about a historical Jesus to the ancient docetic idea that Jesus only \"seemed\" to come into the world \"in the flesh\". Modern theories did away with \"seeming\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17063", "title": "Guanyin", "text": "Guanyin\n\nGuanyin or Guan Yin () is the most commonly used Chinese translation of the bodhisattva known today as 'Avalokitesvara'. In English usage, Guanyin refers to the Buddhist bodhisattva associated with compassion and venerated chiefly by followers of Mahayana Buddhist schools as practiced in the sinosphere. Guanyin also refers to the bodhisattva as adopted by non-Buddhist religions such as Daoism, Chinese folk religions and other (mainly East Asian) religions, where she is often known as the \"Goddess of Mercy\" in English. The Chinese name Guanyin, is short for Guanshiyin, which means \"[The One Who] Perceives the Sounds of the World\".\n\nSome Buddhists believe that when one of their adherents departs from this world, they are placed by Guanyin in the heart of a lotus, and then sent to the western Pure Land of Sukhāvatī. Guanyin is often referred to as the \"most widely beloved Buddhist Divinity\" with miraculous powers to assist all those who pray to her, as is said in the Lotus Sutra and Karandavyuha Sutra.\n\nSeveral large temples in East Asia are dedicated to Guanyin including Shitennō-ji, Sensō-ji, Kiyomizu-dera, Sanjūsangen-dō, Shaolin, and Dharma Drum Mountain. Guanyin is beloved by all Buddhist traditions in a non-denominational way and found in most Tibetan temples under the name Chenrezig, and found in some influential Theravada temples such as Gangaramaya and Kelaniya of Sri Lanka. Statues are a widely depicted subject of Asian art and found in the Asian art sections of most museums in the world.\n\nGenerally accepted among East Asian adherents, Guanyin originated as the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, but in Chinese folk religion, the mythical accounts about Guanyin's origins do not associate with the Avalokiteśvara described in Buddhist sutras. Commonly known in English as the Mercy Goddess or Goddess of Mercy, often depicted as both male and female to show this figure's limitless transcendence beyond gender, and revered by Taoists as an immortal.\n\n\"Guānyīn\" is a translation from the Sanskrit \"Avalokitasvara\" or \"Avalokiteśvara\", referring to the Mahāyāna bodhisattva of the same name. Another later name for this bodhisattva is \"Guānzìzài\" (). It was initially thought that the Chinese mis-transliterated the word \"Avalokiteśvara\" as \"Avalokitasvara\" which explained why Xuanzang translated it as \"Guānzìzài\" instead of \"Guānyīn\". However, the original form was indeed \"Avalokitasvara\" with the ending \"svara\" (\"sound, noise\"), which means \"sound perceiver\", literally \"he who looks down upon sound\" (i.e., the cries of sentient beings who need his help). This is the exact equivalent of the Chinese translation \"Guānyīn\". This etymology was furthered in the Chinese by the tendency of some Chinese translators, notably Kumarajiva, to use the variant \"Guānshìyīn\", literally \"he who perceives the world's lamentations\"—wherein \"lok\" was read as simultaneously meaning both \"to look\" and \"world\" (Skt. \"loka\"; Ch. 世, \"shì\").\n\nDirect translations from the Sanskrit name \"Avalokitasvara\" include:\n\nThe name \"Avalokitasvara\" was later supplanted by the \"Avalokiteśvara\" form containing the ending \"-īśvara\", which does not occur in Sanskrit before the seventh century. The original form \"Avalokitasvara\" appears in Sanskrit fragments of the fifth century. The original meaning of the name \"Avalokitasvara\" fits the Buddhist understanding of the role of a bodhisattva. The reinterpretation presenting him as an \"īśvara\" shows a strong influence of Śaivism, as the term \"īśvara\" was usually connected to the Hindu notion of Śiva as a creator god and ruler of the world.\n\nWhile some of those who revered \"Avalokiteśvara\" upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of any creator god, Encyclopædia Britannica does cite \"Avalokiteśvara\" as the creator god of the world. This position is taken in the widely used Karandavyuha Sutra with its well-known mantra Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ. In addition, the Lotus Sutra is the first time the \"Avalokiteśvara\" is mentioned. Chapter 25 refers to him as \"Lokeśvara\" (Lord God of all beings) and \"Lokanātha\" (Lord and Protector of all beings) and ascribes extreme attributes of divinity to him.\n\nDirect translations from the Sanskrit name Avalokiteśvara include:\n\nDue to the devotional popularity of Guanyin in Asia, she is known by many names, most of which are simply the localised pronunciations of \"Guanyin\" or \"Guanshiyin\":\n\nIn these same countries, the variant \"Guanzizai\" \"Lord of Contemplation\" and its equivalents are also used, such as in the \"Heart Sutra\", among other sources.\n\nThe \"Lotus Sūtra\" (Sanskrit \"Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra\") is generally accepted to be the earliest literature teaching about the doctrines of Avalokiteśvara. These are found in the twenty fifth chapter of the Lotus Sūtra. This chapter is devoted to Avalokitesvara, describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings, and who works tirelessly to help those who call upon his name. This Chapter also places Avalokiteshwara as Higher than any other being in the Buddhist Cosmology stating that \"if one were to pray with true devotion to Avalokiteshwara for one second, they would generate more blessings than if one worshiped with all types of offerings as many Gods as there are in the grains of sand of 62 Ganges Rivers for an entire lifetime\". As a result, Avalokiteshwara is often considered the most beloved Buddhist Divinity and is venerated in many important temples including Shitennoji, the first official temple of Japan, Sensoji, the oldest temple of Tokyo, Kiyomizu-dera and Sanjusangendo which are the two most visited temples in Kyoto.\n\nThe \"Lotus Sutra\" describes Avalokiteśvara as a bodhisattva who can take the form of any type of God including Indra or Brahma; any type of Buddha, any type of King or Chakravartin or even any kind of Heavenly Guardian including Vajrapani and Vaisravana as well as any gender male or female, adult or child, human or non-human being, in order to teach the Dharma to sentient beings. Folk traditions in China and other East Asian countries have added many distinctive characteristics and legends to Guanyin c.q. Avalokiteśvara. Avalokiteśvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva, and therefore wears chest-revealing clothing and may even sport a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists in the Far East, Guanyin is more often depicted as a woman in modern times. Additionally, some people believe that Guanyin is androgynous or perhaps without gender.\n\nA total of 33 different manifestations of Avalokitasvara are described, including female manifestations, all to suit the minds of various beings. Chapter 25 consists of both a prose and a verse section. This earliest source often circulates separately as its own sūtra, called the \"Avalokitasvara Sūtra\" (Ch. 觀世音經), and is commonly recited or chanted at Buddhist temples in East Asia. The \"Lotus Sutra\" and its thirty-three manifestations of Guanyin, of which seven are female manifestations, is known to have been very popular in Chinese Buddhism as early as in the Sui and Tang dynasties. Additionally, Tan Chung notes that according to the doctrines of the Mahāyāna sūtras themselves, it does not matter whether Guanyin is male, female, or genderless, as the ultimate reality is in emptiness (Skt. \"śūnyatā\").\n\nRepresentations of the bodhisattva in China prior to the Song dynasty (960–1279) were masculine in appearance. Images which later displayed attributes of both genders are believed to be in accordance with the Lotus Sutra, where Avalokitesvara has the supernatural power of assuming any form required to relieve suffering, and also has the power to grant children. Because this bodhisattva is considered the personification of compassion and kindness, a mother goddess and patron of mothers and seamen, the representation in China was further interpreted in an all-female form around the 12th century. On occasion, Guanyin is also depicted holding an infant in order to further stress the relationship between the bodhisattva, maternity, and birth. In the modern period, Guanyin is most often represented as a beautiful, white-robed woman, a depiction which derives from the earlier \"Pandaravasini\" form.\n\nIn some Buddhist temples and monasteries, Guanyin's image is occasionally that of a young man dressed in Northern Song Buddhist robes and seated gracefully. He is usually depicted looking or glancing down, symbolising that Guanyin continues to watch over the world.\n\nIn China, Guanyin is generally portrayed as a young woman donned in a flowing white robe and usually wearing necklaces symbolic of Indian or Chinese royalty. In her left hand is a jar containing pure water, and the right holds a willow branch. The crown usually depicts the image of Amitābha.\n\nThere are also regional variations of Guanyin depictions. In Fujian, for example, a popular depiction of Guanyin is as a maiden dressed in Tang hanfu carrying a fish basket. A popular image of Guanyin as both Guanyin of the South Sea and Guanyin with a Fish Basket can be seen in late 16th-century Chinese encyclopedias and in prints that accompany the novel \"Golden Lotus\".\n\nIn Chinese art, Guanyin is often depicted either alone, standing atop a dragon, accompanied by a white cockatoo and flanked by two children or two warriors. The two children are her acolytes who came to her when she was meditating at Mount Putuo. The girl is called Longnü and the boy Shancai. The two warriors are the historical general Guan Yu from the late Han dynasty and the bodhisattva Skanda, who appears in the Chinese classical novel \"Fengshen Yanyi\". The Buddhist tradition also displays Guanyin, or other buddhas and bodhisattvas, flanked with the above-mentioned warriors, but as bodhisattvas who protect the temple and the faith itself.\n\nIn the Karandavyuha Sutra, Avalokiteshwara is called \"The One With A Thousand Arms and Thousand eyes\" and is described as superior to all Gods and Buddhas of the Indian pantheon. The Sutra also states that \"it is easier to count all the leaves of every tree of every forest and all the grains of sand in the universe than to count the blessings and power of Avalokiteshwara\". This version of Avalokiteshwara with a thousand arms depicting the power of all Gods also shows various Buddhas in the crown depicting the wisdom of all Buddhas. It is called Senju Kannon in Japan and 1000 statues of this nature can be found at the popular Sanjusangendo temple of Kyoto.\n\nOne Buddhist legend from the \"Complete Tale of Guanyin and the Southern Seas\" () presents Guanyin as vowing to never rest until she had freed all sentient beings from saṃsāra or cycle of rebirth. Despite strenuous effort, she realised that there were still many unhappy beings yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, her head split into eleven pieces. The buddha Amitābha, upon seeing her plight, gave her eleven heads to help her hear the cries of those who are suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara attempted to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that her two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha came to her aid and appointed her a thousand arms to let her reach out to those in need.\n\nMany Himalayan versions of the tale include eight arms with which Avalokitesvara skillfully upholds the dharma, each possessing its own particular implement, while more Chinese-specific versions give varying accounts of this number.\n\nIn China, it is said that fishermen used to pray to her to ensure safe voyages. The titles \"Guanyin of the Southern Ocean\" (南海觀音) and \"Guanyin (of/on) the Island\" stem from this tradition.\n\nAnother story from the \"Precious Scroll of Fragrant Mountain\" (香山寶卷) describes an incarnation of Guanyin as the daughter of a cruel king who wanted her to marry a wealthy but uncaring man. The story is usually ascribed to the research of the Buddhist monk Jiang Zhiqi during the 11th century. The story is likely to have its origin in Taoism. When Chiang penned the work, he believed that the Guanyin we know today was actually a princess called Miaoshan (妙善), who had a religious following on Fragrant Mountain. Despite this there are many variants of the story in Chinese mythology.\n\nAccording to the story, after the king asked his daughter Miaoshan to marry the wealthy man, she told him that she would obey his command, so long as the marriage eased three misfortunes.\n\nThe king asked his daughter what were the three misfortunes that the marriage should ease. Miaoshan explained that the first misfortune the marriage should ease was the suffering people endure as they age. The second misfortune it should ease was the suffering people endure when they fall ill. The third misfortune it should ease was the suffering caused by death. If the marriage could not ease any of the above, then she would rather retire to a life of religion forever.\n\nWhen her father asked who could ease all the above, Miaoshan pointed out that a doctor was able to do all of these. Her father grew angry as he wanted her to marry a person of power and wealth, not a healer. He forced her into hard labour and reduced her food and drink but this did not cause her to yield.\n\nEvery day she begged to be able to enter a temple and become a nun instead of marrying. Her father eventually allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the monks to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to work all day and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, she was such a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.\n\nIn one version of this legend, when Guanyin was executed, a supernatural tiger took her to one of the more hell-like realms of the dead. However, instead of being punished like the other spirits of the dead, Guanyin played music, and flowers blossomed around her. This completely surprised the hell guardian. The story says that Guanyin, by merely being in that Naraka (hell), turned it into a paradise.\n\nA variant of the legend says that Miaoshan allowed herself to die at the hand of the executioner. According to this legend, as the executioner tried to carry out her father's orders, his axe shattered into a thousand pieces. He then tried a sword which likewise shattered. He tried to shoot Miaoshan down with arrows but they all veered off.\n\nFinally in desperation he used his hands. Miaoshan, realising the fate that the executioner would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave the executioner for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt the executioner generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand the suffering and horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.\n\nAnother tale says that Miaoshan never died, but was in fact transported by a supernatural tiger, believed to be the Deity of the Place, to Fragrant Mountain.\n\nThe legend of Miaoshan usually ends with Miaozhuangyan, Miaoshan's father, falling ill with jaundice. No physician was able to cure him. Then a monk appeared saying that the jaundice could be cured by making a medicine out of the arm and eye of one without anger. The monk further suggested that such a person could be found on Fragrant Mountain. When asked, Miaoshan willingly offered up her eyes and arms. Miaozhuangyan was cured of his illness and went to the Fragrant Mountain to give thanks to the person. When he discovered that his own daughter had made the sacrifice, he begged for forgiveness. The story concludes with Miaoshan being transformed into the Thousand Armed Guanyin, and the king, queen and her two sisters building a temple on the mountain for her. She began her journey to a pure land and was about to cross over into heaven when she heard a cry of suffering from the world below. She turned around and saw the massive suffering endured by the people of the world. Filled with compassion, she returned to Earth, vowing never to leave till such time as all suffering has ended.\n\nAfter her return to Earth, Guanyin was said to have stayed for a few years on the island of Mount Putuo where she practised meditation and helped the sailors and fishermen who got stranded. Guanyin is frequently worshipped as patron of sailors and fishermen due to this. She is said to frequently becalm the sea when boats are threatened with rocks. After some decades Guanyin returned to Fragrant Mountain to continue her meditation.\n\nLegend has it that Shancai (also called Sudhana in Sanskrit) was a disabled boy from India who was very interested in studying the dharma. When he heard that there was a Buddhist teacher on the rocky island of Putuo he quickly journeyed there to learn. Upon arriving at the island, he managed to find Guanyin despite his severe disability.\n\nGuanyin, after having a discussion with Shancai, decided to test the boy's resolve to fully study the Buddhist teachings. She conjured the illusion of three sword-wielding pirates running up the hill to attack her. Guanyin took off and dashed to the edge of a cliff, the three illusions still chasing her.\n\nShancai, seeing that his teacher was in danger, hobbled uphill. Guanyin then jumped over the edge of the cliff, and soon after this the three bandits followed. Shancai, still wanting to save his teacher, managed to crawl his way over the cliff edge.\n\nShancai fell down the cliff but was halted in midair by Guanyin, who now asked him to walk. Shancai found that he could walk normally and that he was no longer crippled. When he looked into a pool of water he also discovered that he now had a very handsome face. From that day forth, Guanyin taught Shancai the entire dharma.\n\nMany years after Shancai became a disciple of Guanyin, a distressing event happened in the South China Sea. The third son of one of the Dragon Kings was caught by a fisherman while swimming in the form of a fish. Being stuck on land, he was unable to transform back into his dragon form. His father, despite being a mighty Dragon King, was unable to do anything while his son was on land. Distressed, the son called out to all of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHearing this cry, Guanyin quickly sent Shancai to recover the fish and gave him all the money she had. The fish at this point was about to be sold in the market. It was causing quite a stir as it was alive hours after being caught. This drew a much larger crowd than usual at the market. Many people decided that this prodigious situation meant that eating the fish would grant them immortality, and so all present wanted to buy the fish. Soon a bidding war started, and Shancai was easily outbid.\nShancai begged the fish seller to spare the life of the fish. The crowd, now angry at someone so daring, was about to pry him away from the fish when Guanyin projected her voice from far away, saying \"A life should definitely belong to one who tries to save it, not one who tries to take it.\"\n\nThe crowd, realising their shameful actions and desire, dispersed. Shancai brought the fish back to Guanyin, who promptly returned it to the sea. There the fish transformed back to a dragon and returned home. Paintings of Guanyin today sometimes portray her holding a fish basket, which represents the aforementioned tale.\n\nBut the story does not end there. As a reward for Guanyin saving his son, the Dragon King sent his granddaughter, a girl called Longnü (\"dragon girl\"), to present Guanyin with the Pearl of Light. The Pearl of Light was a precious jewel owned by the Dragon King that constantly shone. Longnü, overwhelmed by the presence of Guanyin, asked to be her disciple so that she might study the dharma. Guanyin accepted her offer with just one request: that Longnü be the new owner of the Pearl of Light.\n\nIn popular iconography, Longnü and Shancai are often seen alongside Guanyin as two children. Longnü is seen either holding a bowl or an ingot, which represents the Pearl of Light, whereas Shancai is seen with palms joined and knees slightly bent to show that he was once crippled.\n\nThe \"Precious Scroll of the Parrot\" () tells the story of a parrot who becomes a disciple of Guanyin. During the Tang Dynasty a small parrot ventures out to search for its mother's favourite food upon which it is captured by a poacher (parrots were quite popular during the Tang Dynasty). When it managed to escape it found out that its mother had already died. The parrot grieved for its mother and provides her with a proper funeral. It then sets out to become a disciple of Guanyin.\n\nIn popular iconography, the parrot is coloured white and usually seen hovering to the right side of Guanyin with either a pearl or a prayer bead clasped in its beak. The parrot becomes a symbol of filial piety.\n\nWhen the people of Quanzhou, Fujian could not raise enough money to build a bridge, Guanyin changed into a beautiful maiden. Getting on a boat, she offered to marry any man who could hit her with a piece of silver from the edge of the water. Due to many people missing, she collected a large sum of money in her boat. However, Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals, helped a merchant hit Guanyin in the hair with silver powder, which floated away in the water. Guanyin bit her finger and a drop of blood fell into the water, but she vanished. This blood was swallowed by a washer woman, who gave birth to Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) or Lady Linshui (臨水夫人); the hair was turned into a female white snake and sexually used men and killed rival women. The snake and Chen were to be mortal enemies. The merchant was sent to be reborn as Liu Qi (劉杞).\n\nChen was a beautiful and talented girl, but did not wish to marry Liu Qi. Instead, she fled to Mount Lu in Jiangxi, where she learned many Taoist skills. Destiny eventually caused her to marry Liu and she became pregnant. A drought in Fujian caused many people to ask her to call for rain, which was a ritual that could not be performed while pregnant. She temporarily aborted her child, which was killed by the white snake. Chen managed to kill the snake with a sword, but died either of a miscarriage or hemorrhage; she was able to complete the ritual, and ended drought.\n\nThis story is popular in Zhejiang, Taiwan, and especially Fujian.\n\n\"Quan Am Thi Kinh\" (觀音氏敬) is a Vietnamese verse recounting the life of a woman, Thi Kinh. She was accused falsely of having intended to kill her husband, and when she disguised herself as a man to lead a religious life in a Buddhist temple, she was again falsely blamed for having committed sexual intercourse with a girl named Thi Mau. She was accused of impregnating her, which was strictly forbidden by Buddhist law. However, thanks to her endurance of all indignities and her spirit of self-sacrifice, she could enter into Nirvana and became Goddess of Mercy (Phat Ba Quan Am) P. Q. Phan's 2014 opera \"\" is based on this story.\n\nNext to Sun Wu Kong, the monkey king himself, there is no supernatural entity more important to the famous myths from China about a strange mystical monkey, a couple of exiled gods, a dragon, and a priest trying to bring sacred scrolls back to China than her. She delivered the ring that let the priest control the monkey king. She informed all those involved of their great place in the quest which allowed most of them to reach enlightenment. When a demon was too powerful or tricky even for the monkey king she came to their rescue. And when the monkey king was feeling like abandoning the quest she managed to talk him into returning.\n\nDue to her symbolization of compassion, in East Asia, Guanyin is associated with vegetarianism. Buddhist cuisine is generally decorated with her image and she appears in most Buddhist vegetarian pamphlets and magazines.\n\nIn East Asian Buddhism, Guanyin is the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. Among the Chinese, Avalokiteśvara is almost exclusively called \"Guanshiyin Pusa\" (觀世音菩薩). The Chinese translation of many Buddhist sutras has in fact replaced the Chinese transliteration of Avalokitesvara with \"Guanshiyin\" (觀世音). Some Taoist scriptures give her the title of \"Guanyin Dashi\", sometimes informally \"Guanyin Fozu\".\nIn Chinese culture, the popular belief and worship of Guanyin as a goddess by the populace is generally not viewed to be in conflict with the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara's nature. In fact the widespread worship of Guanyin as a \"Goddess of Mercy and Compassion\" is seen by Buddhists as the boundless salvific nature of bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara at work (in Buddhism, this is referred to as Guanyin's \"skillful means\", or upaya). The Buddhist canon states that bodhisattvas can assume whatsoever gender and form is needed to liberate beings from ignorance and dukkha. With specific reference to Avalokitesvara, he is stated both in the \"Lotus Sutra\" (Chapter 25 \"Perceiver of the World's Sounds\" or \"Universal Gateway\"), and the \"Śūraṅgama Sūtra\" to have appeared before as a woman or a goddess to save beings from suffering and ignorance. Some Buddhist schools refer to Guanyin both as male and female interchangeably.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, gender is no obstacle to attaining enlightenment (or nirvana). The Buddhist concept of non-duality applies here. The \"Vimalakirti Sutra\"s \"Goddess\" chapter clearly illustrates an enlightened being who is also a female and deity. In the \"Lotus Sutra\", a maiden became enlightened in a very short time span. The view that Avalokiteśvara is also the goddess Guanyin does not seem contradictory to Buddhist beliefs. Guanyin has been a buddha called the \"Tathāgata of Brightness of Correct Dharma\" (正法明如來).\n\nGiven that bodhisattvas are known to incarnate at will as living people according to the sutras, the princess Miaoshan is generally viewed by Buddhists as an incarnation of Guanyin.\nGuanyin is immensely popular among Chinese Buddhists, especially those from devotional schools. She is generally seen as a source of unconditional love and, more importantly, as a saviour. In her bodhisattva vow, Guanyin promises to answer the cries and pleas of all sentient beings and to liberate them from their own karmic woes. Based on the Lotus Sutra and the Shurangama sutra, Avalokitesvara is generally seen as a saviour, both spiritually and physically. The sutras state that through his saving grace even those who have no chance of being enlightened can be enlightened, and those deep in negative karma can still find salvation through his compassion.\n\nIn Pure Land Buddhism, Guanyin is described as the \"Barque of Salvation\". Along with Amitābha and the bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta, she temporarily liberates beings out of the Wheel of Samsara into the Pure Land, where they will have the chance to accrue the necessary merit so as to be a Buddha in one lifetime. In Chinese Buddhist iconography, Guanyin is often depicted as meditating or sitting alongside one of the Buddhas and usually accompanied by another bodhisattva. The buddha and bodhisattva that are portrayed together with Guanyin usually follow whichever school of Buddhism they represent. In Pure Land Buddhism, for example, Guanyin is frequently depicted on the left of Amitābha, while on the buddha's right is Mahasthamaprapta. Temples that revere the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha usually depict him meditating beside Amitābha and Guanyin.\n\nEven among Chinese Buddhist schools that are non-devotional, Guanyin is still highly venerated. Instead of being seen as an active external force of unconditional love and salvation, the personage of Guanyin is highly revered as the principle of compassion, mercy and love. The act, thought and feeling of compassion and love is viewed as Guanyin. A merciful, compassionate, loving individual is said to be Guanyin. A meditative or contemplative state of being at peace with oneself and others is seen as Guanyin.\n\nIn the Mahayana canon, the \"Heart Sutra\" is ascribed entirely to Guanyin. This is unique, since most Mahayana Sutras are usually ascribed to Gautama Buddha and the teachings, deeds or vows of the bodhisattvas are described by Shakyamuni Buddha. In the \"Heart Sutra\", Guanyin describes to the arhat Sariputta the nature of reality and the essence of the Buddhist teachings. The famous Buddhist saying \"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form\" (色即是空，空即是色) comes from this sutra.\n\nGuanyin is an extremely popular goddess in Chinese folk religion and is worshiped in many Chinese communities throughout East and South East Asia. In Taoism, records claim Guanyin was a Chinese woman who became an immortal, Cihang Zhenren in Shang Dynasty or Xingyin (姓音).\n\nGuanyin is revered in the general Chinese population due to her unconditional love and compassion. She is generally regarded by many as the protector of women and children. By this association, she is also seen as a fertility goddess capable of granting children to couples. An old Chinese superstition involves a woman who, wishing to have a child, offers a shoe to Guanyin. In Chinese culture, a borrowed shoe sometimes is used when a child is expected. After the child is born, the shoe is returned to its owner along with a new pair as a thank you gift.\n\nGuanyin is also seen as the champion of the unfortunate, the sick, the disabled, the poor, and those in trouble. Some coastal and river areas of China regard her as the protector of fishermen, sailors, and generally people who are out at sea, thus many have also come to believe that Mazu, the goddess of the sea, is a manifestation of Guanyin. Due to her association with the legend of the Great Flood, where she sent down a dog holding rice grains in its tail after the flood, she is worshiped as an agrarian and agriculture goddess. In some quarters, especially among business people and traders, she is looked upon as a goddess of fortune. In recent years there have been claims of her being the protector of air travelers.\n\nGuanyin is also a ubiquitous figure found within the new religious movements of Asia:\n\nSome Buddhist and Christian observers have commented on the similarity between Guanyin and the Blessed Virgin Mary. This can be attributed to the representation of Guanyin holding a child in Chinese art and sculpture; it is believed that Guanyin is the patron saint of mothers and grants parents filial children, this apparition is popularly known as the \"Child-Sending Guanyin\" (送子觀音). One example of this comparison can be found in the Tzu Chi Foundation, a Taiwanese Buddhist humanitarian organisation, which noticed the similarity between this form of Guanyin and the Virgin Mary. The organisation commissioned a portrait of Guanyin holding a baby, closely resembling the typical Roman Catholic Madonna and Child painting. Copies of this portrait are now displayed prominently in Tzu Chi affiliated medical centres, especially since Tzu Chi's founder is a Buddhist master and her supporters come from various religious backgrounds.\n\nDuring the Edo period in Japan, when Christianity was banned and punishable by death, some underground Christian groups venerated Jesus and the Virgin Mary by disguising them as statues of Kannon holding a child; such statues are known as \"Maria Kannon\". Many had a cross hidden in an inconspicuous location.\n\nIt is suggested the similarity comes from the conquest and colonization of the Philippines by Spain during the 16th century, when Asian cultures influenced engravings of the Virgin Mary, as evidenced, for example, in an ivory carving of the Virgin Mary by a Chinese carver.\n\nThe statue of Guanyin (Gwanse-eum) in Gilsangsa Temple in Seoul, South Korea was sculpted by Catholic sculptor Choi Jong-tae, who modeled the statue after the Virgin Mary in hopes of fostering religious reconciliation in Korean society.\n\nIn the 1946 film Three Strangers the titular characters wish for a shared sweepstakes ticket to win before a statue of Guanyin, referred to in the film as Kwan Yin.\n\nFor a 2005 \"Fo Guang Shan\" TV series, Andy Lau performed the song \"Kwun Sai Yam\", which emphasizes the idea that everyone can be like Guanyin.\n\nIn the 2011 Thai movie The Billionaire, also known as Top Secret: Wai Roon Pan Lan (วัยรุ่นพันล้าน), Guanyin appears to entrepreneur Top (Itthipat Peeradechapan), founder of Tao Kae Noi Seaweed Snacks, providing him inspiration during his period of uncertainty.\n\nFantasy author Richard Parks has frequently utilized Guanyin as a character in his fiction, most notably in the short stories \"A Garden in Hell\" (2006) and \"The White Bone Fan\" (2009), the novella \"The Heavenly Fox\" (2011), and the novel \"All the Gates of Hell\" (2013).\n\n\nExplanatory notes\nCitations\nFurther reading\n\n"}

He was a forerunner of the modernization of Japanese Buddhism and the first (in Japan) to attempt to incorporate concepts from the natural sciences into Zen Buddhism.\n\nHara was born in Iwakitaira Domain.

Thoralf Skolem had considered the Skolemizations of formulas in prenex form as part of his proof of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem (Skolem 1920). Herbrand worked with this dual notion of Herbrandization, generalized to apply to non-prenex formulas as well, in order to prove Herbrand's theorem (Herbrand 1930).\n\nThe resulting formula is not necessarily equivalent to the original one. As with Skolemization which only preserves satisfiability, Herbrandization being Skolemization's dual preserves validity: the resulting formula is valid if and only if the original one is.\n\nLet formula_1 be a formula in the language of first-order logic. We may assume that formula_1 contains no variable that is bound by two different quantifier occurrences, and that no variable occurs both bound and free. (That is, formula_1 could be relettered to ensure these conditions, in such a way that the result is an equivalent formula).\n\nThe \"Herbrandization\" of formula_1 is then obtained as follows:\n\n\nFor instance, consider the formula formula_10. There are no free variables to replace. The variables formula_11 are the kind we consider for the second step, so we delete the quantifiers formula_12 and formula_13. Finally, we then replace formula_14 with a constant formula_15 (since there were no other quantifiers governing formula_14), and we replace formula_17 with a function symbol formula_18:\n\nThe \"Skolemization\" of a formula is obtained similarly, except that in the second step above, we would delete quantifiers on variables that are either (1) existentially quantified and within an even number of negations, or (2) universally quantified and within an odd number of negations.

{"id": "53779016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53779016", "title": "Human shields (law)", "text": "Human shields (law)\n\nHuman shields may be civilians used against their will to deter attacks on military targets during an international armed conflict or they may be civilians who voluntarily protect either military or civilian targets from attack. The use of human shields is forbidden by \"Protocol I\" of the Geneva Conventions. It is also a specific intent war crime as codified in the \"Rome Statute\", which was adopted in 1998. The language of the \"Rome Statute\" prohibits \"utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas, or military forces immune from military operations.\"\n\nHistorically the law of armed conflict only applied to sovereign states. Non-international conflicts were governed by the domestic law of the State concerned. Under the current terms of the \"Rome Statute\" the use of human shields is defined as a war crime only in the context of an international armed conflict.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, non-international armed conflicts have become more commonplace. The \"Customary International Humanitarian Law\" guide suggests that rules prohibiting use of civilians as human shields are \"arguably\" customary in non-international armed conflict. The development and application of humanitarian law to modern asymmetric warfare is currently being debated by legal scholars.\n\nThe laws of war first began to develop the distinction between military and civilian targets at The Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907.\n\nDuring World War I, the concept of total war permitted most actions that supported the war effort. In \"total war\" targeting civilians was allowed, if it would support a military objective to demoralize the enemy. Indiscriminate bombing was considered an acceptable method to achieve the military advantage of defeating enemy morale and eroding popular support for the war effort. Early attempts to protect civilians as a class were largely unsuccessful. World War II was also fought within the framework of the total war concept.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions of 1949 were the first significant protections for civilians in war. These protections were expanded by the Additional Protocols in 1977. Protocol I requires that attacks be limited to military objectives, which are defined as targets that make an \"effective contribution to military action\" where the destruction of the target provides a \"definite military advantage\" to the attacker.\n\nMilitary necessity can justify the use of force in certain circumstances, where there is a military advantage to be gained by an attack. When the use of force is excessive relative to its anticipated military advantage it is said to be disproportionate. Disproportionate force is prohibited under international law.\n\nRisk to civilians does not bar military action, but the principle of proportionality requires that precautions be taken to minimize the harm to these protected persons. This analysis includes considerations like whether circumstances permit the attacker to time a military action to minimize the presence of civilians at the location.\n\nUnder the Rome Statute using protected persons as shields in an international armed conflict is a war crime. There is currently debate amongst legal scholars about whether traditional proportionality analysis should be modified to take into account the culpability of actors who use human shields to gain a strategic advantage. In modern asymmetric warfare it has become difficult to distinguish between military targets and civilians, but State actors still rely on traditional principles that present challenges when applied to asymmetric conflicts. Non-state forces, like guerillas and terrorists, conceal themselves among civilian populations and may take advantage of this position to launch attacks. When military action targeting these unconventional combatants results in civilian deaths, State actors may blame the deaths on enemy forces who use human shields.\n\nSome scholars, including Ammon Rubinstein and Yaniv Roznai, argue that the use of human shields should be a factor in determining whether the use of force was justifiable under the guiding principles of distinction and proportionality. In their view, the use of human shields undermines an attackers right to self defense because the military necessity of self-defense must be a consideration in the excessive force analysis. Rubinstein and Roznai have described this analysis as a \"proportionate proportionality.\"\n\nRubinstein and Roznai argue that an attack that would be disproportionate ought to be considered proportionate, if the presence of civilians is due to the wrongful actions of the enemy. They use the term \"impeded party\" to describe the burden placed on the attacking party under International Humanitarian Law norms. They point out that \"attacking party\" has traditionally been synonymous with the aggressor, but that it is often the attacker who is \"defending democracy\" and acting in self-defense when they use force in response to a prior attack.\n\nDouglas Fischer believes that the increase of civilian casualties that began with the Vietnam War is partially due to an increased use of \"illegal and perfidious\" tactics in modern warfare, including the use of civilians as human shields. He has criticized Human Rights Watch for not including human shields doctrine as a factor in excessive force analysis.\n\nCombatants in an armed conflict are prohibited from using protected civilians as involuntary human shields to support an unjust war effort. Civilians who are used as involuntary human shields by unlawful combatants do not lose their basic rights. The use of involuntary human shields does not release the other party from legal obligations to not target civilians or inflict excessive collateral damage.\n\nVoluntary human shields may be considered \"direct participants in hostilities,\" if they shield targeted personnel or properties. This could also be considered treason. However, if they are shielding protected personnel or properties, they may still retain their protected status. This debated area of customary international law has not yet been codified.\n\nThe United States and the European Union are considered the main sources for voluntary human shields. In 2003, human rights activists travelled to Baghdad to serve as human shields and protest the unpopular U.S. invasion.\nAlso in 2003, American peace activist Rachel Corrie was killed after she was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer in Rafah while volunteering with the International Solidarity Movement as a human shield to prevent the demolition of homes in Palestine.\n\nWhile IHL does prohibit attacks on civilians, the precautions a power must take before an attack remain ill-defined. Proportionality remains a nebulous standard that does not set a predictable standard of when a military action would be considered lawful. There is a lack of enforcement, and the increasing role of private actors and contractors on the battlefield presents new challenges.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the United States adopted the Lieber Code, recognized by many scholars as the first detailed code governing conduct in war. Dr. Francis Lieber articulated an early version of the principle of proportionality: that civilians were not to be targeted, but were also not immune in all circumstances.\n\nThe use of human shields is prohibited and defined as a war crime by several U.S. military manuals. It is also defined as a crime triable by military commission under the US Military Commissions Act (2006).\n\nIf the belligerent attacks in areas where human shields are used, this can weaken international and domestic support by exploiting harmed civilians. For nations that are particularly sensitive to collateral damage, an enemy's use of shields may effectively deter or delay military actions.\n\nThere have been numerous documented incidents where this tactic has not been successful in deterring attacks, including the Amiriyah shelter bombing during the First Gulf War.

The book is an appeal against the thesis of neo-Hinduism and a defense of Vivekananda's view of Yoga and Vedanta. The book argues for a unity, coherence, and continuity of the Yogic and Vedantic traditions of Hinduism and Hindu philosophy. It makes proposals for defending Hinduism from what the author considers to be unjust attacks from scholars, misguided public intellectuals, and hostile religious polemicists. A revised edition was published in 2016. \"Indra's Net\" has been reviewed in journals, newspapers, video sharing sites, web fora, and other websites.\nMalhotra had written several previous books defending various aspects of Hinduism. He states that \"Indra's Net\" was catalyzed by a 2012 panel at the meetings of the American Academy of Religion to discuss his book \"Being Different\" (2011). Two panelists based their objections against the book on the \"single premise\" that no unified Hindu tradition existed. These panelists \"regarded any notion of Hindu unity as a dangerous fabrication and saw me as guilty of propagating it.\" Malhotra had known of several distinct cases of bias\nThe book's central metaphor is \"Indra's Net\". As a scriptural image \"Indra's Net\" was first mentioned in the Atharva Veda (c. 1000 BCE). In Buddhist philosophy, Indra's Net served as a metaphor in the Avatamsaka Sutra and was further developed by Huayen Buddhism to portray the interconnectedness of everything in the universe.\nMalhotra employs the metaphor of Indra's Net to express\nThe book uses Indra's Net as a metaphor for the understanding of the universe as a web of connections and interdependences, an understanding which Malhotra wants to revive as the foundation for Vedic cosmology, a perspective that he asserts has \"always been implicit\" in the outlook of the ordinary Hindu.\n\n\"Indra's Net\" was released in India on 29 January 2014 at the Vivekananda International Foundation, where a talk was given by Arun Shourie.\nShourie stated that in the book, Malhotra \"has given us a pair of spectacles, a new pair of spectacles through which to understand... our own religions and our own tradition\".\n\nThe book seeks to expose and refute the so-called neo-Hinduism thesis, intending to refute \"the influential narrative that Hinduism was fabricated during British rule and became a dangerous \"new\" religion\", and the thesis that \"Swami Vivekananda plagiarized Western secular and Christian ideas and then recast them in Sanskrit terminology to claim Indian origins for them.\" As Malhotra explains:\n\"Indra's Net\" contains 12 numbered chapters divided into two major parts, as well as introductory and concluding sections, notes, and an index. The first major part is called \"Purva Paksha\", \"Examination of My Opponents' Positions\". The second major part is called \"Uttara Paksha\", \"My Response.\"\n\nIn this part of the book, Rajiv Malhotra gives an overview of his understanding of the development of the so-called \"neo-Hinduism thesis.\"\n\nChapter One presents the following eight myths that, according to Malhotra, neo-Hinduism thesis supports:\n\nChapter Two, gives a background about \"myth-makers\" and their inter-linkages. This chapter present a history of the neo-Hinduism thesis as it was developed and expressed by scholars and gained wider cultural attention. Malhotra highlights the importance of German scholar who, according to Malhotra, was the first to develop the thesis of Neo-Hinduism in 1950s. According to Malhotra, Hacker \"popularized the use of term Neo-Hinduism to refer to the modernization of Hinduism brought about by many Indian thinkers, the most prominent being Swami Vivekananda.\"\n\nThe book mentions that the roots of thesis of Neo-Hinduism were in the depiction of Hinduism by Christian missionaries as \"India's past being chaotic, incoherent and without clear and ethical philosophical ideas\". In this regard the books cites T.E Slater of London Missionary Society who mentions: \"We cannot properly speak of the religion of India any more than we can speak of India as a country\". He further states that \"Hinduism is rather a congeries of divergent systems of thought, each of which at one time or another called itself Hinduism, but forms no part of a consistent whole\". The book mentions that certain Western scholars subsequently \"began to amplify\" the notion that \"contemporary Hinduism was an attempt to fabricate an identity that had never before existed\"\n\nIn subsequent chapters, most attention is given to writings by the German scholar (ch. 3), Leopold Fischer, later known as Agehananda Bharati (ch. 4), Ursula King (ch. 5), and the Trinidad-born Anantanand Rambachan (ch. 6), who are characterized, along with Hacker's associate William Halbfass, as the \"pioneers\" who established the thesis or myth of Neo-Hinduism. Various details are supplied on these scholars' biographies, ideas, and sometimes methodologies.\n\nMalhotra states that the work of these \"founders\" then led to \"echoes\" among Western humanistic scholars such as Heinrich von Stietencron, Christophe Jaffrelot, Sheldon Pollock, Richard King, and others. These led to further echoes among Indian academics such as Romila Thapar and Meera Nanda, and among Indian public intellectuals such as Pankaj Mishra and Jyotirmaya Sharma. From these circles, the \"myth of neo-Hinduism\" has been widely disseminated through media, popular culture, and government policy-making, and is \"increasingly assumed by cosmopolitan Indians who imagine they are... well-informed\". Part 1 also notes that these views have been resisted by some academic \"defenders\" of contemporary Hinduism, including Arvind Sharma, Brian Smith, and Krishna Prakash Gupta.\n\nThis chapter is about Paul Hacker, who, as per Indra's Net was the pioneer of \"neo-Hinduism\" thesis. Chapter three begins by mentioning that during initial part of his career Hacker had developed \"intense interest in Shankara and Advaita Vedanta\". He spent a year as a professor at Mithila Postgraduate Research Institute in Darbhanga, India and then was awarded Indology Chair (Germany’s oldest chair for Indian studies) at the University of Bonn .\n\nThe chapter indicates that during an initial phase of his life, he used ideas of Hinduism in his personal explorations as a Christian. This is corroborated by Hacker's heir and admirer, Wilhelm Halbfass. Halbfass also mentions that Hacker's conversion from Lutherean Protestantism to Catholicism in 1962 was partly motivated by the need to critique Hinduism from a firmer Christian footing.\n\nThe chapter indicates that the extent of \"positive engagement\" with contemporary Hinduism was limited to what Hacker viewed as \"pure\" traditional Vedanta. It is mentioned that there was a \"tipping point\" beyond which Hacker began to altogether dismiss modern Vedanta as exemplified by Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan.\n\nThe chapter further indicates following important points:\n\nThis Chapter is about Agehananda Bharati and his thesis on \"Neo-Hinduism\", who was influenced by the writings of Paul Hacker. Bharati was professor of Anthropology at Syracuse University for over 30 years, an academic Sanskritist, a writer on religious subjects, and a Hindu monk in the Dasanami Sannyasi order. According to Malhotra, his shift towards what Malhotra calls a negative outlook on the so-called \"Hindu Renaissance,\" called \"contemporary Hinduism\" by Malhotra, started from his paper \"The Hindu Renaissance and its Apologetic Patterns\" published in \"The Journal of Asian Studies\" in 1970. According to Bharati, as summarized and paraphrased by Malhotra, Neo-Hinduism is a \"political and artificial fabrication\" that is \"completely disconnected from the past\". According to Malhotra, two major points made by Bharati are that: (1) \"Neo-Hinduism\" is not “Scholarly” as per western standards and (2) \"Neo-Hinduism\" does not follow the scholarly traditions of Hinduism itself.\n\nBharati introduced the well-known term \"pizza effect\". Pizza, which originated in Italy, was brought to the US by Italian immigrants. Then varieties of taste, toppings, and embellishments were developed in the US. This modified pizza was brought back to Italy. Agehananda Bharati said that Indians similarly copied western ideas and values, gave them Indian names and then re-marketed them to the west. Bharati mentions that even Vivekananda's and Gandhi’s insistence on physical work (linked to Karma Yoga) is a western import (Western work ethics). The success of these familiar ideas in an exotic guise led in turn to an appreciation of the enculturated ideas in India, due to the fame that their proponents acquired in the west.\n\nAn instance of this pizza effect, as noted by Bharati (and incorporated by Neo Hinduism thesis), is that \"Bhagvad Gita was given the exalted stature by Britishers and Western Indologists and Indians simply followed it\". Bharati mentions that Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi \"took inspiration from Gita only after it was glorified by Westerners\". Rajiv Malhotra mentions that \"Bharati conveniently ignores that fact that long before arrival of Europeans, Shankara, Ramanuja, Vallabha had written commentaries on Gita\".\n\nThe second part is called \"Uttara Paksha\", \"My Response.\" It first centers on Andrew J. Nicholson's \"Unifying Hinduism\", which argues that already in medieval times Brahmanical thinkers sought to reconcile the various astika-traditions, and the studies by Anantanand Rambachan, who argues that Vivekananda misunderstood Shankara's use of the term \"anubhava\". The subsequent chapters present Malhotra's view on Hinduism as an \"open architecture,\" and the means to defend this open architecture against western hegemony.\n\nIt opens with chapter eight, which argues, following Nicholson, that prior to colonialism there had been \"a vibrant flow of Indian ideas\" and much unification of Hinduism by thinkers such as Vijnanabhiksu. It presents the concepts of \"astika (those who affirm) and nastika (those who do not affirm)\" — terms sometimes loosely translated as orthodoxy and non-orthodoxy — arguing that\nHowever, the colonial period promulgated several distorted understandings of Indian thought, including views of philosophical schools as \"frozen, homogenized and isolated... at war against one another in a manner typical in Western history\". According to the book, these distortions were shaped by the needs of Europeans to construct arguments in purely \"intra\"-European debates on topics such as pantheism and Europeans' own imagined Sanskrit-speaking Aryan ancestry.\n\nChapter nine document traditional Hinduism's concern for service to society. In chapter ten Malhotra takes issue with Rambachan's scholarly work, arguing that Yoga \"is\" part of Shankara's work. According to Malhotra, \"contemporary Advaita Vedanta [...] is based on the experiences of Ramakrishna and crystallized by Swami Vivekananda.\" Malhotra further argues that Vivekananda's view on anubhava was consistent with later developments in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, and that this \"refutes Rambachan's claim that Vivekananda was mimicking European ideas on direct experience.\"\n\nIn chapter eleven a \"big picture\" vision of Hinduism is presented, based on integral unity, or \"unity-in-diversity\", represented by Indra's Net. The computer-derived image of \"open architecture\" is offered as a metaphor for the Hindu approach to the divine, with a lineage (sampradaya) or individual teacher (guru) functioning analogously to a \"'systems integrator' - who selects the components for the client\" if the client foregoes a do-it-yourself approach. The open-architecture metaphor is \"applicable to numerous different schools which share common principles, symbols, and techniques, all... designed to help people gain access to higher states of consciousness... [and] all have certain common standards and architectural principles\". Swami Vivekananda and other promulgators of contemporary Hinduism were thus merely offering \"an ongoing adaptation\" within \"a long-standing, continually evolving tradition\".\n\nChapter twelve, the concluding chapter, warns that the openness and flexibility of the Indian approach is also making it vulnerable to \"digestion by predators\", such as Western scholars or entrepreneurs who repackage Hindu ideas in Western secular terms, with original Indian sources forgotten. Westerners become \"falsely established as original thinkers\", while the uncredited Indian source is represented as oppressive or irrational.\n\nThe book's concluding chapter proposes ways to prevent \"predators\" from exploiting the open architecture of Hinduism by more clearly establishing its core principles, such as karma and reincarnation.\nMalhotra proposes that the notion of astika could be helpful for defense if it were clarified. He suggests that several criteria could be used to \"disqualify\" any philosophical or religious view from being considered as astika: history centrism, a synthetic cosmology, fear of chaos, and a disembodied view of knowing.\nMalhotra explains that his proposal \"is merely a starting point for further discussion and evolution of the categories... this is how the open architecture has functioned in the past and must function now.\"\n\nReviews have appeared in\n\"The Hindu\",\n\"Mental Health, Religion & Culture,\n\"The Economic Times\",\n\"The Free Press Journal\",\n\"YouTube\",\nat web fora \"Medha Journal\"\nand \"Lokvani\",\nand other websites. One of the criticized scholars, Anantanand Rambachan, has also written a response extensively contesting the representation of his scholarship.\n\"The Hindu\" wrote that the book \"articulates the multidimensional, holographic understanding of reality\" and \"offers a detailed, systematic rejoinder\" to views slandering contemporary Hinduism as illegitimate and inherently oppressive.\n\nIn \"Mental Health, Religion & Culture\", Doug Oman wrote that \"\"Indra’s Net\" is a stimulating, valuable, and partly contentious book that, despite some errors in details, supplies needed correctives for one cluster of serious imbalances in how contemporary\nHinduism has been presented. Over time, concerns it highlights could and should inform health professional training materials for religious diversity\".\nHe also suggested that \"Proposing the distinctive core of Hinduism as a dynamic 'open architecture' is perhaps the book’s most stimulating and important scientific contribution,\" a model that \"suggests many new lines for empirical inquiry\" and that \"might be adapted to study 'spiritual but not religious' Westerners\".\n\nIn \"The Economic Times\", Vithal Nadkarni noted the Atharva Vedic origins of the image of Indra's net. To the reviewer, Malhotra's contention that Hinduism has always spanned traditional, modern and post-modern categories \"evokes the image of Shiva's Trinity, also known as that of Master of Time past, present and future, enshrined at... Elephanta\".\n\nIn \"The Free Press Journal\", M. V. Kamath wrote that \"Malhotra has done his job in explaining Hinduism [remarkably] well\".\n\nOn \"YouTube\", Subramanian Swamy, former president of the Janata Party (1990–2013), stated with regard to \"Indra's Net\" that \"this kind of writing is something that ultimately should become textbook reading for graduate students in India\". He added that \"this imperialism in scholarship [as criticized in the book] is something that Rajiv Malhotra is fighting alone; we need much more support being given to him\".\n\nAt the \"Medha Journal\", Pradip Gangopadhyay wrote that Malhotra had \"written a stout defense of the coherence and unity of Hinduism\", although he expressed differences with some parts of Malhotra's analysis. Gangopadhyay felt that Malhotra's \"defense of <nowiki>[Swami Vivekananda]</nowiki> is genuine and sincere but not always effective\", and was \"amazed\" why Malhotra \"did not see Shankara as a unifier of Hinduism\".\n\nOn his blog, Varadaraja V. Raman wrote that \"Malhotra has done it again: Written a substantial book on a topic that should interest all those who care for the Hindu world... Malhotra does for Hinduism what G. K. Chesterton in \"Orthodoxy\" and C. S. Lewis in \"Mere Christianity\" did for their religion: presenting robust, positive, and enlightened visions of the religion.\" He added that \"What is not pointed out in the book, but deserves mention, is that in spite of more than a century of adverse propaganda, a great many educated people in the West have, by and large, positive images of India and Hinduism.\"\n\nAt the website \"Lokvani\", Bijoy Misra expressed appreciation of the book's concern to refute misrepresentations of Hinduism, explaining that he becomes \"concerned because the new [erroneous western-driven] literature does become the reading material for my own children and grandchildren, who would have little access to good traditional resources,\" and that the book \"has particular significance for people like me who wish to practice their Hindu faith in the open society of the United States.\" Bijoy Misra also published a review in the journal \"World Affairs: The Journal of International Issues\".\n\nAnantanand Rambachan, whose work was repeatedly criticized in \"Indra's Net\", especially in Chapter 6 (\"Rambachan's Argument to Fragment Hinduism\"), published a response in the Indian popular cultural magazine \"Swarajya\". Rambachan stated that \"too many of his [Malhotra's] descriptions of my scholarship belong appropriately to the realm of fiction and are disconnected from reality.\" Rambachan organized his lengthy response \"around thirteen of his [Malhotra's] 'myths' about my work. I can easily double this number,\" also stating that \nIn July 2015, Richard Fox Young of Princeton Theological Seminary and Andrew J.Nicholson who authored \"Unifying Hinduism\", alleged Malhotra plagiarized \"Unifying Hinduism\" in \"Indra's Net\". Nicholson further said that Malhotra not only had plagiarised his book, but also \" twists the words and arguments of respectable scholars to suit his own ends.\" Permanent Black, publisher of Nicholson's \"Unifying Hinduism,\" stated that they would welcome HarperCollins \"willingness to rectify future editions\" of \"Indra's Net\".\n\nIn response to Nicholson, Malhotra stated \"I used your work with explicit references 30 times in Indra’s Net, hence there was no ill-intention,\" and cited a list of these references. He announced that he will be eliminating all references to Nicholson and further explained: \n\nIn the revised second edition, Malhotra eliminated the thirty references to Nicholson's book:\n\nA revised edition of \"Indra's Net\" was published by HarperCollins India in 2016. The revised edition omits most references to the work of Andrew Nicholson, and further explains Malhotra's ideas concerning the unity of Hinduism as inherent in the tradition from the times of its Vedic origins. The revised chapter 8, with references, is available online. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "172466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172466", "title": "Jean Buridan", "text": "Jean Buridan\n\nJean Buridan (; Latin: \"Johannes Buridanus\"; – ) was an influential 14th century French philosopher.\n\nBuridan was a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris for his entire career, focusing in particular on logic and the works of Aristotle. Buridan sowed the seeds of the Copernican revolution in Europe. He developed the concept of impetus, the first step toward the modern concept of inertia and an important development in the history of medieval science. His name is most familiar through the thought experiment known as Buridan's ass, however this thought experiment does not appear in his extant writings.\n\nBuridan was born sometime before 1300 at or near the town of Béthune in Picardy, France. He received his education in Paris, first at the Collège Lemoine and then at the University of Paris, receiving his Master of Arts degree and formal license to teach at the latter by the mid-1320s.\n\nUnusually, he spent his entire academic life in the faculty of arts, rather than obtaining the doctorate in law, medicine or theology that typically prepared the way for a career in philosophy. Also unusual for a philosopher of his time, Buridan further maintained his intellectual independence by remaining a secular cleric, rather than joining a religious order. A papal letter of 1329 refers to him as simply, \"\"clericus Atrebatensis diocoesis, magister in artibus\" [a cleric from the Diocese of Arras and Master of Arts].\" As university statutes only permitted those educated in theology to teach or write on the subject, there are no writings from Buridan on either theological matters or commentary of Peter Lombard's \"Sentences\".\n\nSpeculation on his reasons for avoiding religious matters have remained uncertain. Most scholars think it is unlikely that he went unnoticed, given his philosophical talents. As well, it is unlikely that he could not afford to study theology, given that he received several bursaries and stipends. Indeed, he is listed in a document from 1349 as being among the teachers capable of supporting themselves without the need for financial assistance from the University. Zupko has speculated that Buridan \"deliberately chose to remain among the \"'artists\" [artistae],'\" possibly envisioning philosophy as a secular enterprise based on what is evident to both the senses and the intellect, rather than the non-evident truths of theology revealed through scripture and doctrine.\n\nThe last appearance of Buridan in historical documents came in 1358, where he was mentioned as the adjudicator in a territorial dispute between the English and Picard nations. It is supposed that he died sometime after then, since one of his benefices was awarded to another person in 1361.\n\nThe bishop Albert of Saxony, himself renowned as a logician, was among the most notable of his students.\n\nAn ordinance of Louis XI of France in 1473, directed against the nominalists, prohibited the reading of his works.\n\nApocryphal stories abound about his reputed amorous affairs and adventures which are enough to show that he enjoyed a reputation as a glamorous and mysterious figure in Paris life. None of the stories can be confirmed, and most contradict known historical information.\n\nSome rumors hold that he died when the King of France had him put in a sack and thrown into the River Seine after his affair with the Queen came to light. François Villon alludes to this in his famous poem \"Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis\". Others suggest that he was expelled from Paris due to his nominalist teachings and moved to Vienna to found the University of Vienna. Another story talks of him hitting Pope Clement VI with a shoe.\n\nThe concept of \"inertia\" was alien to the physics of Aristotle. Aristotle, and his peripatetic followers held that a body was only maintained in motion by the action of a continuous external force. Thus, in the Aristotelian view, a projectile moving through the air would owe its continuing motion to \"eddies\" or \"vibrations\" in the surrounding medium, a phenomenon known as \"antiperistasis\". In the absence of a proximate force, the body would come to rest almost immediately.\n\nThe theory of impetus proposed that motion was maintained by some property of the body, imparted when it was set in motion. Buridan was the first to name this motion-maintaining property \"impetus\" but the theory itself probably did not originate with him. A less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in the Avicenna's doctrine of \"mayl\" (inclination). In this he was possibly influenced by John Philoponus who was developing the Stoic notion of \"hormé\" (impulse). The major difference between Buridan's theory and that of his predecessor is that he rejected the view that the impetus dissipated spontaneously, instead asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus. Buridan further held that the impetus of a body increased with the speed with which it was set in motion, and with its quantity of matter. This is closely related to the modern concept of momentum. Buridan saw impetus as \"causing\" the motion of the object:\n\nBuridan also contended that impetus is a variable quality whose force is determined by the speed and quantity of the matter in the subject. In this way, the acceleration of a falling body could be understood in terms of its gradual accumulation of units of impetus.\n\nBecause of his developments, historians of science Pierre Duhem and Anneliese Maier both saw Buridan as playing an important role in the demise of Aristotelian cosmology. Duhem even called Buridan the forerunner of Galileo. Zupko has disagreed, pointing out that Buridan did not use his theory to transform the science of mechanics, but instead remained a committed Aristotelian in thinking that motion and rest are contrary states and that the universe is finite in extent.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was noted for serving as Chief of Protocol of the United States from 1981 to 1982. Annenberg was married to Walter Annenberg, who was an Ambassador to the United Kingdom and newspaper publishing magnate. She also served as the chairman and president of the Annenberg Foundation from 2002 until 2009.\n\nBorn in New York City and raised in Los Angeles, she graduated from Stanford University. After her first two marriages ended in divorce, she married noted businessman Walter Annenberg, who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1969 under President Richard Nixon. In her role as the ambassador's wife, Leonore directed a major renovation of the ambassador's official residence. The Annenbergs contributed to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and upon his inauguration, Leonore was named Chief of Protocol, placing her in charge of advising the president, vice president, and Secretary of State on matters relating to diplomatic protocol.\n\nThe Annenbergs became major philanthropists, donating money to education facilities, charitable causes, and the arts. Leonore served on many committees and boards as well. After her husband's death in 2002, she continued to donate money and succeeded him as chairman and president of the Annenberg Foundation.\n\nLeonore Cohn was born into a Jewish family in New York City on February 20, 1918, to Maxwell and Clara Cohn. Nicknamed \"Lee\", her father operated a textile business. She was seven years old when her mother died. She and her younger sister were raised in Fremont Place, an upper-class neighborhood of Los Angeles, by her uncle Harry Cohn, the founder of Columbia Pictures. Leonore and her younger sister, Judith, attended the Page Boarding School for Girls in Pasadena. Harry Cohn's wife, Rose, raised the girls as Christian Scientists.\n\nLeonore Cohn graduated from Stanford University in 1940 with a B.A. After graduating, she married Beldon Katleman, whose family owned real estate and a national parking lot chain; they had a daughter, Diane, but the marriage ended in divorce after a few years. In 1946, she married Lewis Rosensteil, the multimillionaire founder of the Schenley liquor distillery, and they had a daughter named Elizabeth; that marriage, too, ended in divorce.\n\nShe and Walter Annenberg, then editor of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", met in 1950 at a party in Florida and the two were married the following year.\n\nUpon her husband's appointment as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1969, Mrs. Annenberg ordered a renovation of the thirty-five room Winfield House, the ambassador's official London residence. The total cost of the project was about US$1 million and took six months to complete. While in London, Leonore founded the American Friends of Covent Garden, an organization designed to foster goodwill between the U.S. and Great Britain through musical expression.\n\nThe Annenbergs contributed substantially to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, and upon Reagan's election in 1981, Lee Annenberg was named as Chief of Protocol of the United States. This position placed her in charge of advising the President, Vice President, and Secretary of State on matters dealing with diplomatic protocol, and formally welcoming foreign dignitaries upon their arrival to the United States. Annenberg oversaw a staff of 60 who worked on myriad details, ranging from the choice of the state gifts that will be given to the guest, to the bathrooms the foreign delegation may visit. She said of her position, \"It's all about making your guests feel respected and welcome\". Annenberg attracted some controversy during her tenure when she curtsied before the visiting Prince Charles upon arriving for a diplomatic visit, commentators saying it was unseemly in a republic which gained its independence from the same monarchy.\n\nAs Chief of Protocol, she achieved the rank of Ambassador. Friends of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the Annenbergs hosted the Reagans annually at their Rancho Mirage, California estate, \"Sunnylands\". Annenberg resigned her post in January 1982, stating that she wanted to spend more time with her husband.\n\nAfter leaving her post at the State Department, Lee Annenberg began work to promote and enhance cultural appreciation in the United States. She and her husband continued to donate money to worthy causes as philanthropists. In 2001, Annenberg was awarded the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Upon being presented the award, she explained why she and her husband donated to causes as philanthropists:\n\nWalter and I believe that education is the foundation of a democratic society. When asked what motivates his philanthropic work, my husband has responded with a very powerful statement: 'I regard my philanthropic work as an investment in the future of America. It is the most effective way I can serve my country and help to ensure its benefits for the next generation.'\n\nMrs. Annenberg served many charitable organizations and on many committees.

With it he began the defense of American Integration, first suggested by the Liberator and Statesman Simón Bolívar, giving it his own interpretation based in the context of neocolonialism during the separation of the American Empire and Mexico.\n\nIn his works, Zea demonstrates that historical facts aren't independent from ideas, and that they do not arise from what is considered unusual, but from simple reactions to certain situations of human life.\nIn his vision of a united Latin America, he defended his beliefs concerning the place of mankind in the region. Zea explained that the \"discovery\" of 1492 was nothing more than a \"concealment\" in cultural and known terms, a product of the ideological cross-breeding of the configuration of the Latin American identity, a matter which he revealed on the 5th centenary in 1992. Later, he studied the ontological analysis of Latin America in the cultural and geo-historical planes.\n\nBeing of poor origin, Zea worked in 1933 in the office of \"Telégrafos Nacionales\" to help afford the costs of his secondary and university education.\n\nZea was associated with the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) beginning with his training as a Professor and Philosopher in 1943. In 1947 he founded the Faculty of Philosophy and gave lectures on History of ideas in America. In 1954, he was appointed to a full-time position as a researcher at the Philosophical Studies Center of the University. In 1966 he became Director of the Faculty, holding this position until 1970. During his time as Director he founded the Latin American Studies College (in 1966) and later founded the Coordination and Propagation Center of the UNAM Latin American Studies (1978). He received multiple awards including the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 1980, the Premio Interamericano de Cultura \"Gabriela Mistral\" (of the OAS) and the Medalla Belisario Domínguez (of the Senate of Mexico) in 2000. Three years later he was cataloged and honored by the UNAM as the oldest professor to work continually without interruptions until his death.\n\nZea was compared to many diverse political, revolutionary, and intellectual personalities, such as Germán Arciniegas (who was his friend), Che Guevara, José Gaos (his mentor), Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, Andrés Bello, Simón Bolívar, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and others.\n\nHis philosophy embodied his concept of a united Latin America, not in the terms of a utopia, but based in reality, and the renewal of the fight for a people in demand for said change. As a result, he opened up the discourse to other scholars of the subject in the future.\n\n\n\n"}

The writings in these codices comprised 52 mostly Gnostic treatises, but they also include three works belonging to the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" and a partial translation/alteration of Plato's \"Republic\". In his introduction to \"The Nag Hammadi Library in English\", James Robinson suggests that these codices may have belonged to a nearby Pachomian monastery and were buried after Saint Athanasius condemned the use of non-canonical books in his Festal Letter of 367 A.D. The discovery of these texts significantly influenced modern scholarship's pursuit and knowledge of early Christianity and Gnosticism.\n\nThe contents of the codices were written in the Coptic language. The best-known of these works is probably the Gospel of Thomas, of which the Nag Hammadi codices contain the only complete text. After the discovery, scholars recognized that fragments of these sayings attributed to Jesus appeared in manuscripts discovered at Oxyrhynchus in 1898 (P. Oxy. 1), and matching quotations were recognized in other early Christian sources. Subsequently, a 1st or 2nd century date of composition circa 80 AD or earlier has been proposed for the lost Greek originals of the Gospel of Thomas. The buried manuscripts date from the 3rd and 4th centuries.\n\nThe Nag Hammadi codices are currently housed in the Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nThe story of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945 has been described as 'as exciting as the contents of the find itself'. In December of that year, two Egyptian brothers found several papyri in a large earthenware vessel while digging for fertilizer around the Jabal al-Ṭārif caves near present-day Hamra Dom in Upper Egypt. Neither originally reported the find, as they sought to make money from the manuscripts by selling them individually at intervals. The brothers' mother burned several of the manuscripts, worried, apparently, that the papers might have 'dangerous effects' (Markschies, \"Gnosis\", 48). As a result, what came to be known as the Nag Hammadi library (owing to the proximity of the find to Nag Hammadi, the nearest major settlement) appeared only gradually, and its significance went unacknowledged until some time after its initial discovery.\n\nIn 1946, the brothers became involved in a feud, and left the manuscripts with a Coptic priest. His brother-in-law in October that year sold a codex to the Coptic Museum in Old Cairo (this tract is today numbered Codex III in the collection). The resident Coptologist and religious historian Jean Doresse, realizing the significance of the artifact, published the first reference to it in 1948. Over the years, most of the tracts were passed by the priest to a Cypriot antiques dealer in Cairo, thereafter being retained by the Department of Antiquities, for fear that they would be sold out of the country. After the revolution in 1952, these texts were handed to the Coptic Museum in Cairo, and declared national property. Pahor Labib, the director of the Coptic Museum at that time, was keen to keep these manuscripts in their country of origin.\n\nMeanwhile, a single codex had been sold in Cairo to a Belgian antique dealer. After an attempt was made to sell the codex in both New York City and Paris, it was acquired by the Carl Gustav Jung Institute in Zurich in 1951, through the mediation of Gilles Quispel. It was intended as a birthday present to the famous psychologist; for this reason, this codex is typically known as the Jung Codex, being Codex I in the collection.\n\nJung's death in 1961 resulted in a quarrel over the ownership of the Jung Codex; the pages were not given to the Coptic Museum in Cairo until 1975, after a first edition of the text had been published. The papyri were finally brought together in Cairo: of the 1945 find, eleven complete books and fragments of two others, 'amounting to well over 1000 written pages' are preserved there.\n\nThe first edition of a text found at Nag Hammadi was from the Jung Codex, a partial translation of which appeared in Cairo in 1956, and a single extensive facsimile edition was planned. Due to the difficult political circumstances in Egypt, individual tracts followed from the Cairo and Zurich collections only slowly.\n\nThis state of affairs did not change until 1966, with the holding of the Messina Congress in Italy. At this conference, intended to allow scholars to arrive at a group consensus concerning the definition of gnosticism, James M. Robinson, an expert on religion, assembled a group of editors and translators whose express task was to publish a bilingual edition of the Nag Hammadi codices in English, in collaboration with the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity at the Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California.\n\nRobinson was elected secretary of the International Committee for the Nag Hammadi Codices, which had been formed in 1970 by UNESCO and the Egyptian Ministry of Culture; it was in this capacity that he oversaw the project. A facsimile edition in twelve volumes was published between 1972 and 1977, with subsequent additions in 1979 and 1984 from the publisher E.J. Brill in Leiden, entitled, \"The Facsimile Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices.\" This made all the texts available for all interested parties to study in some form.\n\nAt the same time, in the German Democratic Republic, a group of scholars—including Alexander Böhlig, Martin Krause and New Testament scholars Gesine Schenke, Hans-Martin Schenke and Hans-Gebhard Bethge—were preparing the first German language translation of the find. The last three scholars prepared a complete scholarly translation under the auspices of the Berlin Humboldt University, which was published in 2001.\n\nThe James M. Robinson translation was first published in 1977, with the name \"The Nag Hammadi Library in English\", in collaboration between E.J. Brill and Harper & Row. The single-volume publication, according to Robinson, 'marked the end of one stage of Nag Hammadi scholarship and the beginning of another' (from the Preface to the third revised edition). Paperback editions followed in 1981 and 1984, from E.J. Brill and Harper, respectively. A third, completely revised, edition was published in 1988. This marks the final stage in the gradual dispersal of gnostic texts into the wider public arena—the full complement of codices was finally available in unadulterated form to people around the world, in a variety of languages. A cross reference apparatus for Robinson's translation and the Biblical canon also exists.\n\nAnother English edition was published in 1987, by Yale scholar Bentley Layton, called \"The Gnostic Scriptures: A New Translation with Annotations\" (Garden City: Doubleday & Co., 1987). The volume included new translations from the Nag Hammadi Library, together with extracts from the heresiological writers, and other gnostic material. It remains, along with \"The Nag Hammadi Library in English,\" one of the more accessible volumes of translations of the Nag Hammadi find. It includes extensive historical introductions to individual gnostic groups, notes on translation, annotations to the text, and the organization of tracts into clearly defined movements.\n\nNot all scholars agree that the entire library should be considered Gnostic. Paterson Brown has argued that the three Nag Hammadi Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth cannot be so labeled, since each, in his opinion, may explicitly affirm the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Gnosticism by definition considers illusory.\n\n\"See #External links for complete list of manuscripts\"\n\nThe so-called \"Codex XIII\" is not a codex, but rather the text of \"Trimorphic Protennoia\", written on \"eight leaves removed from a thirteenth book in late antiquity and tucked inside the front cover of the sixth.\" (Robinson, NHLE, p. 10) Only a few lines from the beginning of \"Origin of the World\" are discernible on the bottom of the eighth leaf.\n\nAlthough the manuscripts discovered at Nag Hammadi are generally dated to the 4th century, there is some debate regarding the original composition of the texts. \n\n\n"}

Although such cafés originally provided only Internet services, some have expanded their services to include food, drink, and showers. They are often used by commuters who miss the last train; however, the net café refugee trend has seen large numbers of people use them as their homes.\n\nA Japanese government study estimated that over 5,400 people are spending at least half of their week staying in net cafés. It has been alleged that this phenomenon is part of an increasing wealth gap in Japan, which has historically boasted of having a very economically equal society.\nAccording to the Japanese government survey, those staying have little interest in manga or the Internet, and are instead using the place because of the low price relative to any of the competition for temporary housing, business hotels, capsule hotels, hostels, or any other option besides sleeping on the street. It was also estimated that about half of those staying have no job, while the other half work in low-paid temporary jobs, which paid around 100,000 yen ($1000) per month – lower than what is needed to rent an apartment and pay for transportation in a city like Tokyo.\n\nSome internet cafés offer free showers and sell underwear and other personal items, enabling net café refugees to use the internet cafés like a hotel or hostel.\n\nAnother word for Net café refugees is \"cyber-homeless\", a Japanese word based on English. Typically, the cyber-homeless are unemployed or underemployed and cannot afford to rent even the cheapest apartment, which is more than the cost per month to rent an internet booth daily. The cyber-homeless may even use the address of the internet café on resumes when applying for jobs to conceal their present form of accommodation.\n\nThe fee of around ¥1400 to ¥2400 yen for a night – which may include free soft drinks, TV, comics and internet access – is less than for capsule hotels. Some cyber-homeless may also be freeters.\n\nInternet cafés in Dublin, Ireland are also known to allow homeless people to sleep in chairs or on desks overnight, typically charging €6–10.\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1038052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1038052", "title": "Neuroesthetics", "text": "Neuroesthetics\n\nNeuroesthetics (or neuroaesthetics) is a relatively recent sub-discipline of empirical aesthetics. Empirical aesthetics takes a scientific approach to the study of aesthetic perceptions of art, music, or any object that can give rise to aesthetic judgments. Neuroesthetics received its formal definition in 2002 as the scientific study of the neural bases for the contemplation and creation of a work of art. Neuroesthetics uses neuroscience to explain and understand the aesthetic experiences at the neurological level. The topic attracts scholars from many disciplines including neuroscientists, art historians, artists, psychologists,\n\nNeuroaesthetics is a field of experimental science that aims to combine (neuro-)psychological research with aesthetics by investigating the \"perception, production, and response to art, as well as interactions with objects and scenes that evoke an intense feeling, often of pleasure.\". The recently developed field seeks among other things the neural correlates of aesthetic judgment and creativity. It is argued that visual aesthetics, namely the capacity of assigning different degrees of beauty to certain forms, colors, or movements, is a human trait acquired after the divergence of human and other ape lineages, rendering the experience of beauty a defining characteristic of humankind.\n\nOne core question for the field is whether art or aesthetic preferences are guided by a set of universal laws or principles. Additionally, the evolutionary rationale for the formation and characteristics of these principles are sought. It is believed that identification of the brain circuitry involved in aesthetic judgments (e.g., by using through the use of brain imaging) can help pinpoint the origin of these responses.\n\nResearchers who have been prominent in the field combine principles from perceptual psychology, evolutionary biology, neurological deficits, and functional brain anatomy in order to address the evolutionary meaning of beauty that may be the essence of art. It is felt that neuroscience is a very promising path for the search for the quantified evaluation of art.\nWith the aim of discovering general rules about aesthetics, one approach is the observation of subjects viewing art and the exploration of the mechanics of vision. It is proposed that pleasing sensations are derived from the repeated activation of neurons due to primitive visual stimuli such as horizontal and vertical lines. In addition to the generation of theories to explain this, such as Ramachandran's set of laws, it is important to use neuroscience to determine and understand the neurological mechanisms involved.\n\nThe link between specific brain areas and artistic activity is of great importance to the field of neuroesthetics. This can be applied both to the ability to create and interpret art. A common approach to uncover the neural mechanisms is through the study of individuals, specifically artists, with neural disorders such as savant syndrome or some form of traumatic injury. The analysis of art created by these patients provides valuable insights to the brain areas responsible for capturing the essence of art.\n\nThe aesthetic enjoyment of individuals can be investigated using brain imaging experiments. When subjects are confronted with images of a particular level of aesthetics, the specific brain areas that are activated can be identified. It is argued that the sense of beauty and aesthetic judgment presupposes a change in the activation of the brain's reward system.\n\nA crucial aspect of research lies in whether aesthetic judgment can be thought of as a bottom-up process driven by neural primitives or as a top-down process with high level cognition. Neurologists have had success researching primitives. However, there is a need to define higher level abstract philosophical concepts objectively with neural correlates. It is suggested that aesthetic experience is a function of the interaction between top-down, intentional orientation of attention and the bottom-up perceptual facilitation of image construction. In other words, because untrained persons automatically apply the object-identification habit to viewing artworks, top-down control to reduce this habit may be necessary to engage aesthetic perception. This suggests that artists would show different levels of activation than non-artists.\n\nAesthetic responses to different types of art and techniques has recently been explored. Cubism is the most radical departure from Western forms of art, with the proposed purpose of forcing the viewer to discover less unstable elements of the object to be represented. It eliminates interferences such as lighting and perspective angle to capture objects as they really are. This may be compared to how the brain maintains an object's identity despite varying conditions. Modern, representational, and impressionistic art has also been studied for the purpose of explaining visual processing systems. Yet aesthetic judgments exists in all domains, not just art.\n\nSemir Zeki, professor of neuroesthetics at the University College of London, views art as an example of the variability of the brain. Thus a neurological approach to the source of this variability may explain particular subjective experiences as well as the ranges of abilities to create and experience art. Zeki theorizes that artists unconsciously use techniques to create visual art to study the brain. Zeki suggests that\n\n\"...the artist is in a sense, a neuroscientist, exploring the potentials and capacities of the brain, though with different tools. How such creations can arouse aesthetic experiences can only be fully understood in neural terms. Such an understanding is now well within our reach.\"He proposes two supreme laws of the visual brain.\n\nDespite the changes that occur when processing visual stimuli (distance, viewing angle, illumination, etc.), the brain has the unique ability to retain knowledge of constant and essential properties of an object and discard irrelevant dynamic properties. This applies not only to the ability to always see a banana as the color yellow but also the recognition of faces at varying angles.\n\nComparatively, a work of art captures the essence of an object. The creation of art itself may be modeled off of this primitive neural function. The process of painting for example involves distilling an object down to represent it as it really is, which differs from the way the eyes see it. Zeki also tried to represent the Platonic Ideal and the Hegelian Concept through the statement: forms do not have an existence without a brain and the ability for stored memory, referring to how artists such as Monet could paint without knowing what the objects in order to capture their true form.\n\nThis process refers to the hierarchical coordination where a general representation can be applied to many particulars, allowing the brain to efficiently process visual stimuli. The ability to abstract may have evolved as a necessity due to the limitations of memory. In a way, art externalizes the functions of abstraction in the brain. The process of abstraction is unknown to cognitive neurobiology. However, Zeki proposes an interesting question of whether there is a significant difference in the pattern of brain activity when viewing abstract art as opposed to representational art.\n\nVilayanur S. Ramachandran and his fellow researchers including William Hirstein, developed a highly speculative theory of human artistic experience and the neural mechanisms that mediate it. These \"laws\" combine to develop underlying high order concepts of the human artistic experience. Although not all encompassing as there are undoubtedly many other principles of artistic experience, the theorists claim that they provide a framework for understanding aspects of visual art, aesthetics and design. Although testing of these principles quantitatively may provide future evidence for specific areas of the brain responsible for one kind of aesthetic appeal, the theory faces substantial philosophical and historical objections.\n\nThis psychological phenomenon is typically known for its application in animal discrimination learning. In the peak shift effect, animals sometimes respond more strongly to exaggerated versions of the training stimuli. For instance, a rat is trained to discriminate a square from a rectangle by being rewarded for recognizing the rectangle. The rat will respond more frequently to the object for which it is being rewarded to the point that a rat will respond to a rectangle that is longer and more narrow with a higher frequency than the original with which it was trained. This is called a supernormal stimulus. The fact that the rat is responding more to a 'super' rectangle implies that it is learning a rule.\n\nThis effect can be applied to human pattern recognition and aesthetic preference. Some artists attempt to capture the very essence of something in order to evoke a direct emotional response. In other words, they try to make a 'super' rectangle to get the viewer to have an enhanced response. To capture the essence of something, an artist amplifies the differences of that object, or what makes it unique, to highlight the essential features and reduce redundant information. This process mimics what the visual areas of the brain have evolved to do and more powerfully activates the same neural mechanisms that were originally activated by the original object.\n\nSome artists deliberately exaggerate creative components such as shading, highlights, and illumination to an extent that would never occur in a real image to produce a caricature. These artists may be unconsciously producing heightened activity in the specific areas of the brain in a manner that is not obvious to the conscious mind. It should be noted here that a significant portion of the experience of art is not self-consciously reflected upon by audiences, so it is not clear whether the peak-shift thesis has any special explanatory power in understanding the creation and reception of art.\n\nIsolating a single visual cue helps the organism allocate attention to the output of a single module thereby allowing it to more effectively enjoy the peak shift along the dimensions represented in that module. In other words, there is a need to isolate the desired visual form before that aspect is amplified. This is why an outline drawing or sketch is sometimes more effective as art than an original color photograph. For example, a cartoonist may exaggerate certain facial features which are unique to the character and remove other forms which it shares such as skin tones. This efficiency prevents non-unique features from detracting from the image. This is why one can predict that an outline drawing would be more aesthetically pleasing than a color photograph.\n\nThe viewers attention is drawn towards this single area allowing one's attention to be focused on this source of information. Enhancements introduced by the artist more carefully noted resulting in the amplification of limbic system activation and reinforcement.\n\nPerceptual grouping to delineate a figure from the background may be enjoyable. The source of the pleasure may have come about because of the evolutionary necessity to give organisms an incentive to uncover objects, such as predators, from noisy environments. For example, when viewing ink blots, the visual system segments the scene to defeat camouflage and link a subset of splotches together. This may be accomplished most effectively if limbic reinforcement is fed back to early vision at every stage of visual processing leading up to the discovery of the object. The key idea is that due to the limited attentional resources, constant feedback facilitates processing of features at earlier stages due to the discovery of a clue which produces limbic activation to draw one's attention to important features. Though not spontaneous, this reinforcement is the source of the pleasant sensation. The discovery of the object itself results in a pleasant 'aha' revelation causing the organism to hold onto the image.\n\nAn artist can make use of this phenomenon by teasing the system. This allows for temporary binding to be communicated by a signal to the limbic system for reinforcement which is a source of the aesthetic experience.\n\nExtracting contrast involves eliminating redundant information and focusing attention. Cells in the retina, the lateral geniculate body or relay station in the brain, and in the visual cortex respond predominantly to step changes in luminance rather than homogeneous surface colors. Smooth gradients are much harder for the visual system to detect rather than segmented divisions of shades resulting in easily detectable edges. Contrasts due to the formation of edges may be pleasing to the eye. The importance of the visual neuron's varying responses to the orientation and presence of edges has previously been proven by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. This may hold evolutionary significance since regions of contrast are information rich requiring reinforcement and the allocation of attention. In contrast to the principle of grouping, contrasting features are typically in close proximity eliminating the need to link distant, but similar features.\n\nTied to the detection of contrast and grouping is the concept that discovery of an object after a struggle is more pleasing than one which is instantaneously obvious. The mechanism ensures that the struggle is reinforcing so that the viewer continues to look until the discovery. From a survival point of view, this may be important for the continued search for predators. Ramachandran suggests for the same reason that a model whose hips and breasts are about to be revealed is more provocative than one who is already completely naked. A meaning that is implied is more alluring than one that is explicit.\n\nThe visual system dislikes interpretations which rely on a unique vantage point. Rather it accepts the visual interpretation for which there is an infinite set of viewpoints that could produce the class of retinal images. For example, in a landscape image, it will interpret an object in the foreground as obscuring an object in the background, rather than assuming that the background figure has a piece missing. \nIn theory, if an artist is trying to please the eye, they should avoid such coincidences. However, in certain applications, the violation of this principle can also produce a pleasing effect.\n\nRamachandran defines a metaphor as a mental tunnel between two concepts that appear grossly dissimilar on the surface, but instead share a deeper connection. Similar to the effects of perceptual problem solving, grasping an analogy is rewarding. It enables the viewer to highlight crucial aspects that the two objects share. Although it is uncertain whether the reason for this mechanism is for effective communication or purely cognitive, the discovery of similarities between superficially dissimilar events leads to activation of the limbic system to create a rewarding process.\n\nSupport for this view is highlighted by the symptoms of Capgras delusion, where sufferers experience reduced facial recognition due to impairments in the connections from the inferotemporal cortex to the amygdala, which is responsible for emotions. The result is that a person no longer experiences the warm fuzzy feeling when presented with a familiar face. A person's 'glow' is lost through what is suggested as due to the lack of limbic activation.\n\nThe aesthetic appeal of symmetry is easily understandable. Biologically it is important during the detection of a predator, location of prey, and the choosing of a mate as all of these tend to display symmetry in nature. It complements other principles relating to the discovering of information rich objects. Additionally, evolutionary biologists suggest that the predisposition towards symmetry is because biologically, asymmetry is associated with infection and disease, which can lead to poor mate selection. However, departures from symmetry in visual art are also widely considered beautiful, suggesting that while symmetry may explain the judgment that a particular individual's face is beautiful, it cannot explain the judgment that a work of art is beautiful.\n\nAesthetic perception relies heavily on the processing by the visual centers in the brain such as the V1 cortex. Signals from V1 are distributed to various specialized areas of the brain. There is no single area where all specialized visual circuitry connect, reducing the chances of determining a single neural center responsible for aesthetics, rather a neural network is more likely. Therefore, the visual brain consists of several parallel multistage processing systems, each specialized in a given task such as color or motion. Functional specializations of the visual brain are already known.\n\nPhysiological phenomenon can explain several aspects of art appreciation. Different extrastriate areas of the visual cortex may have evolved to extract correlations of different visual features. The discovery and linking of various visual stimuli is facilitated and reinforced by direct connections from these areas to limbic structures. Additionally, art may be most appealing if it produces heightened activity in a single dimension rather than redundant activation of multiple modules, restricted by the allocation of attentional resources. In experimentation to determine specific areas, many researchers allow the viewer to decide the aesthetic appeal prior to the use of imaging techniques to account for the varying perceptions of beauty. When individuals contemplate the aesthetic appeal, different neural processes are engaged than when pragmatically viewing an image. However, processes of object identification and aesthetic judgment are involved simultaneously in the overall perception of aesthetics. \n\nThe prefrontal cortex is previously known for its roles in the perception of colored objects, decision making, and memory. Recent studies have also linked it to the conscious aesthetic experience because it is activated during aesthetic tasks such as determining the appeal of a visual stimuli. This may be because a judgment is needed, requiring visiospatial memory. In a study performed by Zeki and Kawabata, it was found that the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) is involved in the judgment of whether a painting is beautiful or not. There is high activation in this region when a person views paintings which they consider beautiful. Surprisingly, when a person views a painting which they consider ugly, no separate structures are activated. Therefore, it is proposed that changes in the intensity of activation in the orbito-frontal cortex correlate with the determination of beauty (higher activation) or ugliness (lower activation). Additionally, the medial OFC has been found to respond aesthetics in terms of the context of which it is presented, such as text or other descriptions about the artwork. The current evidence linking the OFC to attributed hedonistic values across gustatory, olfactory, and visual modalities, suggests that the OFC is a common center for the assessment of a stimulus's value. The perception of aesthetics for these areas must be due to the activation of the brain's reward system with a certain intensity.\nAdditionally, the prefrontal dorsalateral cortex (PDC) is selectively activated only by stimuli considered beautiful whereas prefrontal activity as a whole is activated during the judgment of both pleasing and unpleasing stimuli. The prefrontal cortex may be generally activated for directing the attention of the cognitive and perceptual mechanisms towards aesthetic perception in viewers untrained in visual arts. In other words, related directly to a person viewing art from an aesthetic perception due to the top-down control of their cognition. The lateral prefrontal cortex is shown to be linked to higher order self-referential procession and the evaluation of internally generated information. The left lateral PFC, Brodmann area 10, may be involved in maintaining attention on the execution of internally generated goals associated with approaching art from an aesthetic orientation. As previously mentioned, directing of attention towards aesthetics may have evolutionary significance.\n\nEmotions play a large role in aesthetic processing. Experiments designed specifically to force the subjects to view the artwork subjectively (by inquiring of its aesthetic appeal) rather than simply with the visual systems, revealed a higher activation in the brain's emotional circuitry. Results from these experiments revealed high activation in the bilateral insula which can be attributed to the emotional experience of viewing art. This correlates with other known emotional roles of the insula. However, the correlation between the insula's varying states of activation and positive or negative emotions in this context is unknown. The emotional view of art can be contrasted with perception related to object recognition when pragmatically viewing art. The right fusiform gyrus has been revealed to show activation to visual stimuli such as faces and representational art. This holds importance in the field because as Ramachandran also speculated, object recognition and the search for meaning can evoke a pleasant emotional response. The motor cortex was also shown to be involved in aesthetic perception. However, it displayed opposite trends of activation from the OFC. It may be a common correlate for the perception of emotionally charged stimuli despite its previously known roles. Several other areas of the brain were shown to be slightly activated during certain studies such as the anterior cingulate cortex, previously known for its involvement in the feeling of romance, and the left parietal cortex, whose purpose may be to direct spatial attention.\n\nDifferent artistic styles may also be processed differently by the brain. In a study between filtered forms of abstract and representation art, the bilateral occipital gyri, left cingulate sulcus, and bilateral fusiform gyrus showed increased activation with increased preference when viewing art. However, activation in the bilateral occipital gyri may be caused by the large processing requirements placed on the visual system when viewing high levels of visual detail in artwork such as representational paintings. Several areas of the brain have been shown to respond particularly to forms representational art perhaps due to the brain's ability to make object associations and other functions relating to attention and memory. This form of stimuli leads to increased activation in the left frontal lobe and bilaterally in the parietal and limbic lobes. Also, the left superior parietal lobule, Brodmann's area 7, has been shown to play a role in active image construction during the viewing of art specifically containing indeterminate forms such as soft edge paintings. Bottom up processes such as edge detection and the exploration of visual stimuli are engaged during this type of aesthetic perception. These roles are consistent with previously known parietal lobe responsibilities in spatial cognition and visual imagery.\n\nThere are several objections to researchers' attempts to reduce aesthetic experience to a set of physical or neurological laws. It is questionable whether the theories can capture the evocativeness or originality of individual works of art. Experiments performed may not account for these theories directly. Also, current experimentation measures a person's verbal response to how they feel about art which is often selectively filtered. Ramachandran suggests the use of galvanic skin response to quantify the judgment associated viewing aesthetics. Overall, it can be argued that there is lack of proportion between the narrow approach to art taken by researchers versus the grand claims they make for their theories.\n\nSince 2005 the notion of bridging brain science and the visual arts has blossomed into a field of increasing international interest. In his 2008 book, \"Neuroarthistory: from Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki\", Professor John Onians of the University of East Anglia considers himself to be at the forefront of the field of neural scientific biased art historical research, although such a 'history' is much shorter than Onians would have us believe. Many historical figures he deals with as precursors for neuroarthistory (Karl Marx, for example) have very little to do with modern neuroscience as it is understood today. Contemporary artists like Mark Stephen Smith (William Campbell Gallery, USA) and others have developed extensive bodies of work mapping the convergence of brain science and painting. Smith's work explores fundamental visual analogies between neural function and self-expression in abstract art. The past decade has also seen a corresponding growth in the aesthetics of music studied from neuroscientific approaches. Psychological and social approaches to art help provide other theories of experience. Additional research on disorders and psychological conditions that affect visual processing such as dementia may provide other valuable insights.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12141252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12141252", "title": "Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate", "text": "Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate\n\nThe philosophical aspects of the abortion debate are logical arguments that can be made either in support of or in opposition to abortion.\n\nThe philosophical arguments in the abortion debate are deontological or rights-based. The view that all or almost all abortion should be illegal generally rests on the claims: (1) that the existence and moral right to life of human beings (human organisms) begins at or near conception-fertilization; (2) that induced abortion is the deliberate and unjust killing of the embryo in violation of its right to life; and (3) that the law should prohibit unjust violations of the right to life. The view that abortion should in most or all circumstances be legal generally rests on the claims: (1) that women have a right to control what happens in and to their own bodies; (2) that abortion is a just exercise of this right; and (3) that the law should not criminalize just exercises of the right to control one's own body and its life-support functions.\n\nAlthough both sides are likely to see the rights-based considerations as paramount, some popular arguments appeal to consequentialist or utilitarian considerations. For example, anti-abortion advocacy groups (see the list below) sometimes claim the existence of post-abortion syndrome or a link between abortion and breast cancer, alleged medical and psychological risks of abortion. On the other side, pro-choice groups (see the list below) say that criminalizing abortion will lead to the deaths of many women through \"back-alley abortions\"; that unwanted children have a negative social impact (or conversely that abortion lowers the crime rate); and that reproductive rights are necessary to achieve the full and equal participation of women in society and the workforce. Consequentialist arguments on both sides tend to be vigorously disputed, though are not widely discussed in the philosophical literature.\n\nContemporary philosophical literature contains two kinds of arguments concerning the morality of abortion. One family of arguments (see the following three sections) relates to the moral status of the embryo—the question of whether the embryo has a right to life, is the sort of being it would be seriously wrong to kill, or in other words is a \"person\" in the moral sense. An affirmative answer would support claim (1) in the central anti-abortion argument, while a negative answer would support claim (2) in the central pro-choice argument.\n\nAnother family of arguments (see the section on Thomson, below) relates to bodily rights—the question of whether the woman's bodily rights justify abortion \"even if\" the embryo has a right to life. A negative answer would support claim (2) in the central pro-life argument, while an affirmative answer would support claim (2) in the central pro-choice argument.\n\nSince the zygote is genetically identical to the embryo, the fully formed fetus, and the baby, questioning the beginning of personhood could lead to an instance of the Sorites paradox, also known as \"the paradox of the heap\".\n\nMary Anne Warren, in her article arguing for the permissibility of abortion, holds that moral opposition to abortion is based on the following argument:\n\nWarren, however, thinks that \"human being\" is used in different senses in (1) and (2). In (1), \"human being\" is used in a moral sense to mean a \"person\", a \"full-fledged member of the moral community\". In (2), \"human being\" means \"biological human\". That the embryo is a biologically human organism or animal is uncontroversial, Warren holds. But it does not follow that the embryo is a person, and it is persons that have rights, such as the right to life.\n\nTo help make a distinction between \"person\" and \"biological human\", Warren notes that we should respect the lives of highly intelligent aliens, even if they are not biological humans. She thinks there is a cluster of properties that characterize persons:\nA person does not have to have each of these, but if something has all five then it definitely is a person whether it is biologically human or not, while if it has none or perhaps only one then it is not a person, again whether it is biologically human or not. The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is not a person.\n\nOther writers apply similar criteria, concluding that the embryo lacks a right to life because it lacks self-consciousness, or rationality and self-consciousness, or \"certain higher psychological capacities\" including \"autonomy\".\n\nOthers conclude that personhood should be based on \"brain birth\" concept, which is in essence the reversal of the brain death used as a modern definition of medical death. Under this proposal, presence of brain waves would be enough to grant personhood, even with other features lacking. Based on whether brain activity in the brain stem, or just in the cerebral cortex, is relevant for personhood, two concepts of \"brain birth\" emerge:\n\nThese writers disagree on precisely \"which\" features confer a right to life, but agree those features must be certain \"developed\" psychological or physiological features which the embryo lacks.\n\nWarren's arguments face two main objections. The comatose patient objection claims that as patients in a reversible coma do not satisfy Warren's (or some other) criteria—they are not conscious, do not communicate, and so on—therefore they would lack a right to life on her view. One response is that \"although the reversibly comatose lack any \"conscious\" mental states, they do retain all their \"unconscious\" [or \"dispositional\"] mental states, since the appropriate neurological configurations are preserved in the brain.\" This may allow them to satisfy some of Warren's criteria. The comatose also still possess brain activity (brain waves), so this objection does not apply to \"brain birth\" theories. Finally, there are some post-natal humans who are unable to feel pain due to genetic disorders and thus do not satisfy all of Warren's criteria.\n\nThe infanticide objection points out that infants (indeed up to about one year of age, since it is only around then that they begin to outstrip the abilities of non-human animals) have only one of Warren's characteristics—consciousness—and hence would have to be accounted non-persons on her view; thus her view would permit not only abortion but infanticide. Warren agrees that infants are non-persons (and so killing them is not strictly murder), but denies that infanticide is generally permissible. For, Warren claims, once a human being is born, there is no longer a conflict between it and the woman's rights, since the human being can be given up for adoption. Killing such a human being would be wrong, not because it is a person, but because it would go against the desires of people willing to adopt the infant and to pay to keep the infant alive. (Although, this clarification has problems of its own: beef cattle, chickens, or any other livestock raised for meat--or indeed even some plants--have supporters who would pay to keep the animals alive. Thus, according to Warren, it must be wrong to kill animals, and perhaps even plants.)\n\nNonetheless, Warren grants that her argument entails that infanticide would be morally acceptable under some circumstances, such as those of a desert island. Philosopher Peter Singer similarly concludes that infanticide, particularly of severely disabled infants, is justifiable under certain conditions. And Jeff McMahan grants that under very limited circumstances it may be permissible to kill one infant to save the lives of several others. Opponents may see these concessions as a \"reductio ad absurdum\" of these writers' views; while supporters may see them merely as examples of unpleasant acts being justified in unusual cases.\n\nSince brain waves appear in the lower brain (brain stem) in 6–8 weeks of gestation, and in the higher brain (cerebral cortex) in 19-20 weeks of gestation, both \"whole brain\" and \"higher brain\" brain birth personhood concepts based on the presence of brain waves do not permit infanticide.\n\nSome opponents of Warren's view believe that what matters morally is not that one be \"actually exhibiting\" complex mental qualities of the sort she identifies, but rather that one have in oneself a self-directed genetic propensity or natural capacity to develop such qualities. In other words, what is crucial is that one be the \"kind\" of entity or substance that, under the right conditions, actively develops itself to the point of exhibiting Warren's qualities at some point in its life, even if it does not \"actually\" exhibit them because of not having developed them yet (embryo, infant) or having lost them (severe Alzheimer's). Because human beings do have this natural capacity—and indeed have it \"essentially\"—therefore (on this view) they \"essentially\" have a right to life: they could not possibly \"fail\" to have a right to life. Further, since modern embryology shows that the embryo begins to exist at conception and has a natural capacity for complex mental qualities, therefore the right to life begins at conception.\n\nGrounding the right to life in essential \"natural\" capacities rather than accidental \"developed\" capacities is said to have several advantages. As developed capacities are on a continuum, admitting of greater and lesser degrees—some, for example, are more rational and self-conscious than others—therefore: (1) the \"developed capacities\" view must \"arbitrarily\" select some particular degree of development as the cut-off point for the right to life—whereas the \"natural capacities\" view is non-arbitrary; (2) those whose capacities are \"more\" developed would have \"more\" of a right to life on the 'developed capacities' view—whereas the \"natural capacities\" view entails we all have an \"equal\" right to life; and (3) the continuum of developed capacities makes the exact point at which personhood ensues vague, and human beings around that point, say between one and two years of age, will have a shadowy or indeterminate moral status—whereas there is no such indeterminacy on the \"natural capacities\" view.\n\nSome defenders of Warren-style arguments grant that these problems have not yet been fully solved, but reply that the \"natural capacities\" view fares no better. It is argued, for example, that as human beings vary significantly in their natural cognitive capacities (some are naturally more intelligent than others), and as one can imagine a series or spectrum of species with gradually diminishing natural capacities (for example, a series from humans down to amoebae with only the slightest differences in natural capacities between each successive species), therefore the problems of arbitrariness and inequality will apply equally to the \"natural capacities\" view. In other words, there is a continuum not only of developed but of \"natural\" capacities, and so the \"natural capacities\" view will inevitably face these problems as well.\n\nSome critics reject the \"natural capacities\" view on the basis that it takes mere species membership or genetic potential as a basis for respect (in essence a charge of speciesism), or because it entails that anencephalic infants and the irreversibly comatose have a full right to life. Moreover, as with Marquis's argument (see below), some theories of personal identity would support the view that the embryo will never \"itself\" develop complex mental qualities (rather, it will simply give rise to a distinct substance or entity that \"will\" have these qualities), in which case the \"natural capacities\" argument would fail. Respondents to this criticism argue that the noted human cases in fact would not be classified as persons as they do not have a natural capacity to develop any psychological features.\n\nA seminal essay by Don Marquis argues that abortion is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future. Marquis begins by arguing that what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being is the fact that the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim. The harm consists in the fact that \"when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future\": I am deprived of all the valuable \"experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments\" that I would otherwise have had. Thus, if a being has a highly valuable future ahead of it—a \"future like ours\"—then killing that being would be seriously harmful and hence seriously wrong. But then, as a standard embryo \"does\" have a highly valuable future, killing it \"is\" seriously wrong. And so \"the overwhelming majority of deliberate abortions are seriously immoral\", \"in the same moral category as killing an innocent adult human being\".\n\nA consequence of this argument is that abortion is wrong in all the cases where killing a child or adult with the same sort of future as the embryo would be wrong. So for example, \"if\" involuntary euthanasia of patients with a future filled with intense physical pain is morally acceptable, aborting embryos whose future is filled with intense physical pain will also be morally acceptable. But it would not do, for example, to invoke the fact that some embryo's future would involve such things as being raised by an unloving family, since we do not take it to be acceptable to kill a five-year-old just because her future involves being raised by an unloving family. Similarly, killing a child or adult may be permissible in exceptional circumstances such as self-defense or (perhaps) capital punishment; but these are irrelevant to standard abortions.\n\nMarquis's argument has prompted several objections. The contraception objection claims that if Marquis's argument is correct, then, since sperm and ova (or perhaps a sperm and ovum jointly) have a future like ours, contraception would be as wrong as murder; but as this conclusion is (it is said) absurd—even those who believe contraception is wrong do not believe it is as wrong as murder—the argument must be unsound. One response is that neither the sperm, nor the egg, nor any particular sperm-egg combination, will ever \"itself\" live out a valuable future: what will later have valuable experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments is a \"new entity\", a \"new organism\", that will come into existence at or near conception; and it is \"this\" entity, not the sperm or egg or any sperm-egg combination, that has a future like ours.\n\nAs this response makes clear, Marquis's argument requires that what will later have valuable experiences and activities is the \"same entity\", the same biological organism, as the embryo. The identity objection rejects this assumption. On certain theories of personal identity (generally motivated by thought experiments involving brain or cerebrum transplants), each of us is \"not\" a biological organism but rather an \"embodied mind\" or a \"person\" (in \nJohn Locke's sense) that comes into existence when the brain gives rise to certain developed psychological capacities. If either of these views is correct, Marquis's argument will fail; for the embryo (even the early \"fetus\", lacking the relevant psychological capacities) would not \"itself\" have a future of value, but would merely have the potential to give rise to a \"different\" entity, an embodied mind or a person, that \"would\" have a future of value. The success of Marquis's argument thus depends on one's favored account of personal identity.\n\nThe interests objection claims that what makes murder wrong is not just the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future that one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can \"have\" an interest in one's future without \"taking\" an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does \"in fact\" desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.\n\nThe equality objection claims that Marquis's argument leads to unacceptable inequalities. If, as Marquis claims, killing is wrong because it deprives the victim of a valuable future, then, since some futures appear to contain much more value than others—a 9-year-old has a much longer future than a 90-year-old, a middle class person's future has much less gratuitous pain and suffering than someone in extreme poverty—some killings would turn out to be much more \"wrong\" than others. But as this is strongly counterintuitive (most people believe all killings are \"equally\" wrong, other things being equal), Marquis's argument must be mistaken. Some writers have concluded that the wrongness of killing arises not from the harm it causes the victim (since this varies greatly among killings), but from the killing's violation of the intrinsic worth or personhood of the victim. However, such accounts may themselves face problems of equality, and so the equality objection may not be decisive against Marquis's argument.\n\nThe psychological connectedness objection claims that a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future only if there are sufficient psychological connections—sufficient correlations or continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like—between the being as it is now and the being as it will be when it lives out the valuable future. As there are few psychological connections between the embryo and its later self, it is concluded that depriving it of its future does not seriously harm it (and hence is not seriously wrong). A defence of this objection is likely to rest, as with certain views of personal identity, on thought experiments involving brain or cerebrum swaps; and this may render it implausible to some readers.\n\nIn her well-known article \"A Defense of Abortion\", Judith Jarvis Thomson argues that abortion is in some circumstances permissible \"even if\" the embryo is a person and has a right to life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. Her central argument involves a thought experiment. Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something—the use of your body—to which he has no right. Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.\n\nCritics of this argument generally agree that unplugging the violinist is permissible, but claim there are morally relevant disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion. The most common objection is that the violinist scenario, involving a kidnapping, is analogous only to abortion after rape. In most cases of abortion, it is said, the pregnant woman was \"not\" raped but had intercourse voluntarily, and thus has either tacitly consented to allowing the embryo to use her body (the tacit consent objection), or else has a duty to sustain the embryo because the woman herself caused it to stand in need of her body (the responsibility objection). Other common objections turn on the claim that the embryo is the pregnant woman's child whereas the violinist is a stranger (the stranger versus offspring objection); that abortion kills the embryo whereas unplugging the violinist merely lets him die (the killing versus letting die objection); or, similarly, that abortion intentionally causes the embryo's death whereas unplugging the violinist merely causes death as a foreseen but unintended side-effect (the intending versus foreseeing objection; cf the doctrine of double effect).\n\nDefenders of Thomson's argument—most notably David Boonin—reply that the alleged disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not hold, either because the factors that critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but do not apply to abortion in the way that critics have claimed. Critics have in turn responded to Boonin's arguments.\n\nAlternative scenarios have been put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. John Noonan proposes the scenario of a family who was found to be liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect them from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus.\n\nOther critics claim that there is a difference between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother's breast milk, and the baby would either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed. But the mother would never have to give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were. The difference between breastfeeding in that scenario and blood transfusions is the difference between gestation and childbirth on the one hand, and using your body as a kidney dialysis machine on the other.\n\nOne argument against the right to abortion appeals to the (secular) value of a human life. The thought is that all forms of human life, including the fetus, are inherently valuable because they are connected to our thoughts on family and parenthood, among other natural aspects of humanity. Thus, abortion can express the wrong attitudes towards humanity in a way that manifest vicious character. This view is represented by some forms of Humanism and by moral philosopher Rosalind Hursthouse in her widely anthologized article \"Virtue Theory and Abortion\". Thinking about abortion in this way, according to Hursthouse, shows the unimportance of rights because one can act viciously in exercising a moral right. For example, she says, \"Love and friendship do not survive their parties' constantly insisting on their rights, nor do people live well when they think that getting what they have a right to is of preeminent importance; they harm others, and they harm themselves.\" Hursthouse argues that the ending of a human life is always a serious matter and that abortion, when it is wrong, is wrong because it violates a respect for human life.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3241251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3241251", "title": "Social threefolding", "text": "Social threefolding\n\nSocial threefolding is a sociological theory suggesting the progressive independence of society's economic, political and cultural institutions. It aims to foster human rights and equality in political life, freedom in cultural life (art, science, religion, education, the media), and associative cooperation in economic life. The idea was first proposed by Rudolf Steiner in the great cultural ferment immediately following the end of the First World War.\n\nThe process of achieving the cooperative independence of these three societal realms is meant to be achieved through a gradual transformation of existing societal structures. Steiner believed that the three social spheres had very gradually, over thousands of years, been growing independent of each other, and would naturally tend to continue to do so, and that consciously furthering aspects of this independence thus works in accordance with society's natural evolution. \n\nSteiner held it to be socially destructive when one of the three spheres attempts to dominate the others; for example, theocracy means a cultural impulse dominates economy and politics; unregulated and socially irresponsible varieties of capitalism allow economic interests to dominate politics, culture and media; and state socialism means political agendas dominate culture and economic life. A more specific example: Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter suggests governments frequently fail when they begin to give \"discretionary, particularly preferential privileges to competitive industry.\" The goal is for this independence to arise in such a way that those three realms can provide mutual balance. \n\nMany concrete reform proposals to advance a \"threefold social order\" at various scales have been advanced since 1919. Some intentionally cooperative businesses and organizations, mostly in Europe, have attempted to realize a balance between the three spheres, within local structures. Waldorf schools deserve special mention in this regard. Another application has been the creation of various socially responsible banks and foundations. Bernard Lievegoed incorporated significant aspects of social threefolding in his work on organizational development. \n\nPrior to the end of World War I, Steiner spoke increasingly often of the dangerous tensions inherent in the contemporary societal structures and political entanglements. He suggested a collapse of traditional social forms was imminent, and every aspect of society would soon have to be built up consciously rather than relying on the inheritance of past traditions and institutions. After the war, he saw a unique opportunity to establish a healthy social and political constitution and began lecturing throughout post-war Germany, often to large audiences, about his social ideas. These were taken up by a number of prominent cultural and political leaders of the time, but did not succeed in affecting the reconstitution of Germany taking place at the time.\n\nAfter the failure of this political initiative, Steiner ceased lecturing on the subject. The impulse continued to be active in other ways, however, in particular through economic initiatives intended to provide support for non-governmental cultural organizations. Banks, such as; \n\nAll were later founded to provide loans (and sometimes grants) to socially relevant and ethically responsible initiatives. Steiner himself saw the continuation of this impulse in the Waldorf schools, the first of which also opened in 1919. The Rudolf Steiner Foundation has also played a role in support of B-Lab, the non-profit corporation that has sought to midwife \"benefit corporations\" and legislation permitting such corporations to be set up. Benefit corporation officers are legally permitted and required to consider not only shareholder value and profit, but a range of \"socially responsible\" criteria for corporate decision-making.\n\nSteiner distinguished three realms of society:\n\nSteiner suggested the three would only become mutually corrective and function together in a healthy way when each was granted sufficient independence. Steiner argued that increased autonomy for the three spheres would not eliminate their mutual influence, but would cause that influence to be exerted in a more healthy and legitimate manner, because the increased separation would prevent any one of the three spheres from dominating the others, as they had frequently done in the past. Among the various kinds of macrosocial imbalance Steiner observed, there were three major types: \n\n\nSteiner related the French Revolution's slogan, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, to the three social spheres as follows:\n\nAccording to Steiner, those three values, each one applied to its proper social realm, would tend to keep the cultural, economic and political realms from merging unjustly, and allow these realms and their respective values to check, balance and correct one another. The result would be a society-wide separation of powers. \n\n\"Examples:\" \nA government should not be able to control culture; i.e., how people think, learn, or worship. A particular religion or ideology should not control the levers of the State. Steiner held that pluralism and freedom were the ideal for education and cultural life. Concerning children, Steiner held that all families, not just those with economic means, should be enabled to choose among a wide variety of independent, non-government schools from kindergarten through high school.\n\n\"Examples:\" \nThe fact that places of worship do not make the ability to enter and participate depend on the ability to pay, and that libraries and some museums are open to all free of charge, is in tune with Steiner’s notion of a separation between cultural and economic life. Efforts to protect scientific research results from commercial manipulation are also in tune with the idea. In a similar spirit, Steiner held that all families, not just those with the economic means, should have freedom of choice in education and access to independent, non-government schools for their children.\n\n\"Examples:\" \nPeople and businesses should be prevented from buying politicians and laws. A politician shouldn’t be able to parlay his political position into riches earned by doing favors for businessmen. Slavery is unjust, because it takes something political, a person’s inalienable rights, and absorbs them into the economic process of buying and selling. Steiner said, \"In the old days, there were slaves. The entire man was sold as commodity... Today, capitalism is the power through which still a remnant of the human being—his labor power—is stamped with the character of a commodity.\" Yet Steiner held that the solution that state socialism gives to this problem only makes it worse.\n\nSteiner advocated cooperative forms of capitalism, or what might today be called stakeholder capitalism, because he thought that conventional shareholder capitalism \"and\" state socialism, though in different ways, tend to absorb the State and human rights into the economic process and transform laws into mere commodities. Steiner rejected state socialism because of that, but also because he believed it reduces the vitality of the economic process. Yet Steiner disagrees with the kind of libertarian view that holds that the State and the economy are kept apart when there is absolute economic competition. According to Steiner's view, under absolute competition, the most dominant economic forces tend to corrupt and take over the State, in that respect merging State and economy. Second, the State tends to fight back counter-productively under such circumstances by increasingly taking over the economy and merging with it, in a mostly doomed attempt to ameliorate the sense of injustice that emerges when special economic interests take over the State.\n\nBy contrast, Steiner held that uncoerced, freely self-organizing forms of \"cooperative\" economic life, in a society where there is freedom of speech, of culture, and of religion, will 1) make State intervention in the economy less necessary or called for, and 2) will tend to permit economic interests of a broader, more public-spirited sort to play a greater role in relations extending from the economy to the State. Those two changes would keep State and economy apart more than could absolute economic competition in which economic special interests corrupt the State and make it too often resemble a mere appendage of the economy. In Steiner's view, the latter corruption leads in turn to a pendulum swing in the opposite direction: government forces, sometimes with the best of intentions, seek to turn the economy increasingly into a mere appendage of the State. State and economy thus merge through an endless iteration of pendulum swings from one to the other, increasingly becoming corrupt appendages of each other.\n\nSteiner held that State and economy, given increased separateness through a self-organizing and voluntarily more cooperative economic life, can increasingly check, balance, and correct each other for the sake of continual human progress. In Steiner’s view, the place of the State, vis-a-vis the self-organizing, cooperative economy, is \"not\" to own the economy or run it, but to regulate/deregulate it, enforce laws, and protect human rights as determined by the state's open democratic process. Steiner emphasized that none of these proposals would be successful unless the cultural sphere of society maintained and increased its own freedom and autonomy vis-a-vis economic and State power. Nothing would work without spiritual, cultural, and educational freedom.\n\nA central idea in social threefolding is that the economic sphere should donate funds to support cultural and educational institutions that are independent of the State. As businesses become profitable through the exercise of creativity and inspiration, and a society's culture is a key source of its creativity and inspiration, returning a portion of the profits made by business to independent cultural initiatives can act as a kind of seed money to stimulate further creative growth. \n\nIn this view, taxes \"sometimes\" serve as an unhealthy form of forced donation which artificially redirect businesses' profits. Since taxes are controlled by the state, cultural initiatives supported by taxes readily fall under government control, rather than retaining their independence. Steiner believed in educational freedom and choice, and one of his ideals was that the economic sector might eventually create scholarship funds that would permit all families to choose freely from (and set up) a wide variety of independent, non-government schools for their children.\n\nFor Steiner, separation of the cultural sphere from the political and economic spheres meant education should be available to all children regardless of the ability of families to pay for it and, from kindergarten through high school, should be provided for by private and|or state scholarships that a family could direct to the school of its choice. Steiner was a supporter of educational freedom, but was flexible, and understood that a few legal restrictions on schools (such as health and safety laws), provided they were kept to an absolute minimum, would be necessary and justified.\n\nInstitutions of civil society—non-profits that for the most part are independent of both the State and the economic life—are globally on the rise. See also this. And this. There has been a debate among students of Steiner's sociology whether this means the cultural realm as Steiner understood it is developing greater independence from governmental and economic institutions. Nicanor Perlas has argued in the affirmative. Gary Lamb has argued otherwise.\n\nNicanor Perlas, winner of the Right Livelihood Award, in 2009 announced candidacy for the presidency of the Philippines. Perlas has written extensively about social threefolding.\n\nA number of reform movements whose leaders and members may never have heard of social threefolding still unintentionally advance one or another of its three aspects, for example movements seeking to 1) reduce the influence of money in politics by increasing governmental transparency, 2) develop cooperative and socially responsible forms of capitalism (for example, here:), and 3) make it possible for all families, including poor ones, to have educational freedom and the right to choose among independent, non-government schools for their children (for example, here).\n\n\n\n\n\"Journals and articles\"\n"}

Ross\n\nSir William David Ross, (15 April 1877 – 5 May 1971), known as David Ross but usually cited as W. D. Ross, was a Scottish philosopher who is known for his work in ethics. His best-known work is \"The Right and the Good\" (1930), and he is perhaps best known for developing a pluralist, deontological form of intuitionist ethics in response to G. E. Moore's intuitionism. Ross also , in addition to writing on Greek philosophy.\n\nHis accomplishments include his work with John Alexander Smith on a 12-volume translation of Aristotle.\n\nWilliam David Ross was born in Thurso, Caithness in the north of Scotland the son of John Ross (1835-1905).\n\nHe spent most of his first six years as a child in southern India. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1895, he gained a first class MA degree in classics. He completed his studies at Balliol College, Oxford, with a First in Classical Moderations in 1898 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats', a combination of philosophy and ancient history) in 1900. He was appointed to a lectureship at Oriel College in 1900, and elected to a fellowship in 1902.\n\nRoss joined the army in 1915. During World War I, he worked in the Ministry of Munitions and was a major on the special list. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918 in recognition of his services during the war, and was promoted to a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1938.\n\nRoss was White's Professor of Moral Philosophy (1923–1928), Provost of Oriel College, Oxford (1929–1947), Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1941 to 1944 and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (1944–1947). He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1939 to 1940. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy and was its President 1940–1944.\nOf the many governmental committees on which he served was as chair of the Civil Service Tribunal, on which one of his two colleagues was Leonard Woolf, who thought that the whole system of fixing governmental remuneration should be done on the same basis as the US model (of dividing the civil service into a relatively small number of pay grades). Ross did not agree with this radical proposal. In 1947 he was appointed chairman of the first Royal Commission on the Press, United Kingdom.\nHe died in Oxford on 5 May 1971. He is memorialised on his parents grave in the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh.\n\nHis younger brother was Rev Donald George Ross (1879-1943).\n\nHe married Edith Ogden in 1906 and they had four daughters, Margaret (who married Robin Harrison), Eleanor, Rosalind (who married John Miller Martin), and Katharine. Edith died in 1953.\n\nHe was a cousin of Berriedale Keith.\n\nW. D. Ross was a moral realist, a non-naturalist, and an intuitionist. He argued that there are moral truths. He wrote:\n\nThe moral order...is just as much part of the fundamental nature of the universe (and...of any possible universe in which there are moral agents at all) as is the spatial or numerical structure expressed in the axioms of geometry or arithmetic.\n\nThus, according to Ross, the claim that something is good is true if that thing really is good. Ross also agreed with G.E. Moore's claim that any attempt to define ethical statements solely in terms of statements about the natural world commits the naturalistic fallacy.\n\nRoss rejected Moore's consequentialist ethics. According to consequentialist theories, what people ought to do is determined only by whether their actions will bring about the most good. By contrast, Ross argues that maximising the good is only one of several \"prima facie\" duties (prima facie obligations) which play a role in determining what a person ought to do in any given case.\n\nIn \"The Right and the Good,\" Ross lists seven \"prima facie\" duties, without claiming his list to be all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; justice; beneficence; non-maleficence; and self-improvement. In any given situation, any number of these prima facie duties may apply. In the case of ethical dilemmas, they may even contradict one another. Someone could have a prima facie duty of reparation, say, a duty to help people who helped you move house, move house themselves, and a prima facie duty of fidelity, such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict. Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the prima facie duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the \"absolute obligation\" or \"absolute duty\", the action that the person ought to perform.\n\nIt is frequently argued, however, that Ross should have used the term \"pro tanto\" rather than \"prima facie\". Shelly Kagan, for example, wrote:\n\nExplaining the difference between pro tanto and prima facie, Kagan wrote: \"A pro tanto reason has genuine weight, but nonetheless may be outweighed by other considerations. Thus, calling a reason a pro tanto reason is to be distinguished from calling it a prima facie reason, which I take to involve an epistemological qualification: a prima facie reason appears to be a reason, but may actually not be a reason at all\".\n\n\n\n"}

While this interpretation may appear to some to be a departure from the traditional view of seeking refuge in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), it is actually a deliberate declaration and poetic polemic of the Chan (Zen) school written as a response to the increasingly popular movement of faith in Amitaba Buddha known as Pure Land Buddhism. From the Chan/Zen point of view, Buddha and Mind are one (即心即佛) (see the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch (六祖壇經)), as expressed in Mazu's famous dictum \"Mind is Buddha\".

John McRae (1986:316 n. 64) argues that the title should be translated as \"Inscription on Relying on the Mind\" or \"Inscription of the Perfected Mind\". The word \"inscription\" does accurately convey the idea of a truth that can survive the test of time and is the more literal meaning of \"ming\" (銘).\n\nAnother reading of the text allows that Xinxin could be understood as the Truthful Mind, which is always ready and perfect, implying that there is no need to further \"perfect\" it. Because in the Chinese language today, Xinxin (信心) usually means \"trust\", \"confidence\", or \"believing mind\", it is often forgotten that Xinxin can also be understood as the truthful mind (信實的心).\n\nFrom the Chan/Zen view, the true mind is perfect as it is and only false views obscure the true mind's inherent perfection. As the text states,\n\n\"Any degeneration of your previous practice on emptiness arises because of false perspectives.\nThere is really no need to go after the Truth but there is indeed a need to extinguish biased views.\" (前空轉變 皆由妄見 不用求真 唯須息見)\n\nMoreover, the passage that follows immediately after explicitly warns against losing the original, true mind (失心):\n\n\"Do not dwell in the two biased views. Make sure you do not pursue. The moment you think about right and wrong, that moment you unwittingly lose your true mind.\" (二見不住 慎勿追尋 才有是非 紛然失心)\n\nWhether translated as Faith in Mind, Believing in Mind, Trust in Mind, or The Truthful Mind, the central message of the Xinxin Ming is the same: to point directly to Mind by giving up one-sided views so we can see the One Suchness of reality as it is.(心若不異 萬法一如)\n\nAlthough Sengcan has been traditionally been attributed as the author, modern scholars believe that the verse was written well after Sengcan's death, probably during the Tang Dynasty (Chinese: 唐朝; pinyin: Tángcháo) (618 – 907). (Dumoulin, p 97) Some scholars note the similarity with a poem called Mind Inscription by Niu-t'ou Fa-jung (594-657) (Gozu Hõyû 牛頭法融) of the Ox-head School of Chan and have speculated that the Xinxin Ming is an abridged version of the Mind Inscription. The classical source of the Xinxin Ming can be found in the Transmission of the Lamp (Wade–Giles: Ching-te Ch'uan-teng Lu; Japanese: Keitoku Denkōroku 景德傳燈錄 景徳伝灯録).\n\nThe Xinxin Ming has been much beloved by Chan (Zen) practitioners for over a thousand years. It is still studied in Western Zen circles.\n\nAs an early expression of Chan Buddhism, the \"Inscription on Faith in Mind\" reveals the Buddhist missionary use of expedient means (upaya) in China by adapting Taoist terminology to the Buddhist context of awakening. It also draws on the Wisdom sutras as well as the Avatamsaka Sutra and Lankavatara Sutra to express the essential unity of opposites and the basic nature of emptiness (\"śūnyatā\") \n\nThe poem professes the need to take pleasant and unpleasant life experiences with a sense of equanimity. Broadly speaking, the Xinxin Ming deals with the principles and practice of non-duality, that is, with the application of nonduality and the results of its practice.\n\nThe opening verse, variously translated, sets out the fundamental principle:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThe poem ends with:\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\n"}
