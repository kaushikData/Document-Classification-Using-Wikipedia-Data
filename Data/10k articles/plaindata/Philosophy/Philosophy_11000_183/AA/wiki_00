{"id": "243665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243665", "title": "A Theory of Justice", "text": "A Theory of Justice\n\nA Theory of Justice is a work of political philosophy and ethics by John Rawls, in which the author attempts to solve the problem of distributive justice (the socially just distribution of goods in a society) by utilising a variant of the familiar device of the social contract. The resultant theory is known as \"Justice as Fairness\", from which Rawls derives his two principles of justice. Together, they dictate that society should be structured so that the greatest possible amount of liberty is given to its members, limited only by the notion that the liberty of any one member shall not infringe upon that of any other member. Secondly, inequalities – either social or economic – are only to be allowed if the worst off will be better off than they might be under an equal distribution. Finally, if there is such a beneficial inequality, this inequality should not make it harder for those without resources to occupy positions of power – for instance, public office.\n\nFirst published in 1971, \"A Theory of Justice\" was revised in 1975 (for the translated editions) and 1999.\n\nIn \"A Theory of Justice,\" Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society. Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. Principles of justice are sought to guide the conduct of the parties. These parties are recognized to face moderate scarcity, and they are neither naturally altruistic nor purely egoistic. They have ends which they seek to advance, but prefer to advance them through cooperation with others on mutually acceptable terms. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and right-libertarian accounts.\n\nRawls belongs to the social contract tradition, although he takes a different view from that of previous thinkers. Specifically, Rawls develops what he claims are principles of justice through the use of an artificial device he calls the \"Original position\"; in which, everyone decides principles of justice from behind a veil of ignorance. This \"veil\" is one that essentially blinds people to all facts about themselves so they cannot tailor principles to their own advantage:\n\nAccording to Rawls, ignorance of these details about oneself will lead to principles that are fair to all. If an individual does not know how he will end up in his own conceived society, he is likely not going to privilege any one class of people, but rather develop a scheme of justice that treats all fairly. In particular, Rawls claims that those in the \"Original Position\" would all adopt a maximin strategy which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off.\n\nRawls bases his \"Original Position\" on a \"thin theory of the good\" which he says \"explains the rationality underlying choice of principles in the Original Position\". A full theory of the good follows after we derive principles from the original position. Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two such principles, which would then govern the assignment of rights and duties and regulate the distribution of social and economic advantages across society. The difference principle permits inequalities in the distribution of goods only if those inequalities benefit the worst-off members of society. Rawls believes that this principle would be a rational choice for the representatives in the original position for the following reason: Each member of society has an equal claim on their society's goods. Natural attributes should not affect this claim, so the basic right of any individual, before further considerations are taken into account, must be to an equal share in material wealth. What, then, could justify unequal distribution? Rawls argues that inequality is acceptable only if it is to the advantage of those who are worst-off.\n\nThe agreement that stems from the original position is both \"hypothetical\" and \"ahistorical\". It is hypothetical in the sense that the principles to be derived are what the parties would, under certain legitimating conditions, agree to, not what they have agreed to. Rawls seeks to use an argument that the principles of justice are what \"would\" be agreed upon if people were in the hypothetical situation of the original position and that those principles have moral weight as a result of that. It is ahistorical in the sense that it is not supposed that the agreement has ever been, or indeed could ever have been, derived in the real world outside of carefully limited experimental exercises.\n\nIn chapter forty-seven, Rawls makes his final clarification on the principles of justice in one paragraph:\"First Principle: Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.\"\n\n\"Second Principle: Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\"These principles are lexically ordered, and Rawls emphasizes the priority of liberty. The first principle is often called \"the greatest equal liberty principle.\" The second, until (b), \"the difference principle\" and the final addendum in (b) \"the\" \"equal opportunity principle\".\n\nMainly concerned with distribution of rights and liberties, the basic liberties of citizens are the political liberty to vote and run for office, freedom of speech and assembly, liberty of conscience, freedom of personal property and freedom from arbitrary arrest. However, it is a matter of some debate whether freedom of contract can be inferred to be included among these basic liberties:\n\nRawls' claim in (a) is that departures from equality of a list of what he calls primary goods—\"things which a rational man wants whatever else he wants\" [Rawls, 1971, p. 92]—are justified only to the extent that they improve the lot of those who are worst-off under that distribution in comparison with the previous, equal, distribution. His position is at least in some sense egalitarian, with a provision that inequalities are allowed when they benefit the least advantaged. An important consequence of Rawls' view is that inequalities can actually be just, as long as they are to the benefit of the least well off. His argument for this position rests heavily on the claim that morally arbitrary factors (for example, the family one is born into) shouldn't determine one's life chances or opportunities. Rawls is also keying on an intuition that a person does not morally deserve their inborn talents; thus that one is not entitled to all the benefits they could possibly receive from them; hence, at least one of the criteria which could provide an alternative to equality in assessing the justice of distributions is eliminated.\n\nFurther, the just savings principle requires that some sort of material respect is left for future generations, even though Rawls is ambiguous about what should be left for them, it can generally be understood as \"a contribution to those coming later\" [Rawls, 1971, p. 255].\n\n(b) offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of \"fair equality of opportunity\"The stipulation in (b) is lexically prior to that in (a). This is because \"equal opportunity\" requires not merely that offices and positions are distributed on the basis of merit, but that all have reasonable opportunity to acquire the skills on the basis of which merit is assessed, even if one might not have the necessary material resources - due to a beneficial inequality stemming from the difference principle.\n\nIt may be thought that this stipulation, and even the first principle of justice, may require greater equality than the difference principle, because large social and economic inequalities, even when they are to the advantage of the worst-off, will tend to seriously undermine the value of the political liberties and any measures towards fair equality of opportunity.\n\nA key problem to Rawls is to show how such principles would be universally adopted and here the work borders on general ethical issues. He introduces a theoretical “veil of ignorance” in which all the “players” in the social game would be placed in a situation which is called the “original position”. Having only a general knowledge of the facts of “life and society”, each player is to abide based on their moral obligation. By denying the players any specific information about themselves, it forces them to adopt a generalized point of view that bears a strong resemblance to the moral point of view.\n\nIn 1972, \"A Theory of Justice\" was reviewed in \"The New York Times Book Review\" by Marshall Cohen, who described the work as \"magisterial,\" and suggested that Rawls' use of the techniques of analytic philosophy made the book the \"most formidable\" defense of the social contract tradition to date. He credited Rawls with showing that the widespread claim that \"systematic moral and political philosophy are dead\" is mistaken, and with providing a \"bold and rigorous\" account of \"the principles to which our public life is committed.\" Though he suggested that it might take years before a satisfactory appraisal of the work could be made, he noted that Rawls' accomplishments had been compared by scholars to those of John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant. However, he criticized Rawls for \"looseness in his understanding of some fundamental political concepts.\"\n\n\"A Theory of Justice\" received criticism from several philosophers. Robert Nozick criticized Rawls' account of distributive justice in his defense of libertarianism, \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" (1974). Allan Bloom, writing in \"American Political Science Review\" in 1975, noted that \"A Theory of Justice\" had \"attracted more attention in the Anglo-Saxon world than any work of its kind in a generation\", attributing its popularity to its being \"the most ambitious political project undertaken by a member of the school currently dominant in academic philosophy\" and to Rawls' \"radical egalitarian interpretation of liberal democracy.\" Bloom criticized Rawls for failing to account for the existence of natural right in his theory of justice and wrote that Rawls absolutizes social union as the ultimate goal which would conventionalize everything into artifice. Robert Paul Wolff criticized Rawls from a Marxist perspective in \"Understanding Rawls: A Critique and Reconstruction of A Theory of Justice\" (1977), arguing Rawls offers an apology for the status quo insofar as he constructs justice from existing practice and forecloses the possibility that there may be problems of injustice embedded in capitalist social relations, private property or the market economy.\n\nMichael Sandel criticized Rawls in \"Liberalism and the Limits of Justice\" (1982), arguing that Rawls encourages people to think about justice while divorced from the values and aspirations that define who they are as persons and that allow people to determine what justice is. Susan Moller Okin wrote in \"Justice, Gender, and the Family\" (1989) that Rawls had provided \"the most influential of all twentieth-century theories of justice\", but criticized him for failing to account for the injustices and hierarchies embedded in familial relations. Economists Kenneth Arrow and John Harsanyi criticized the assumptions of the original position, and in particular, the use of maximin reasoning, with the implication that Rawls' selection of parameters for the original position was result-oriented, \"i.e.\", calculated to derive the two principles that Rawls desired to advance, and/or, as the \"contractarian critique\" holds, that the persons in the original position articulated by Rawls would not in fact select the principles that \"A Theory of Justice\" advocates. In reply Rawls emphasized the role of the original position as a \"device of representation\" for making sense of the idea of a fair choice situation for free and equal citizens, and that the relatively modest role that maximin plays in his argument: it is \"a useful heuristic rule of thumb\" given the curious features of choice behind the veil of ignorance.\n\nThe economist Amartya Sen has raised concerns over Rawls' emphasis on primary social goods, arguing in \"Inequality Reexamined\" (1992) that we should attend not only to the distribution of primary goods, but also how effectively people are able to use those goods to pursue their ends. Norman Daniels has wondered why health care shouldn't be treated as a primary good, and some of his subsequent work has addressed this question, arguing for a right to health care within a broadly Rawlsian framework. The philosopher Gerald Cohen, in \"If You're An Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich?\" (2000) and \"Rescuing Justice and Equality\" (2008), criticizes Rawls' avowal of inequality under the difference principle, his application of the principle only to social institutions, and what he sees as his obsession with the using primary goods as his currency of equality.\n\nSen critiques and attempts to revitalize \"A Theory of Justice\" in \"The Idea of Justice\" (2009). He credits Rawls for revitalizing the interest in the ideas of what justice means and the stress put on fairness, objectivity, equality of opportunity, removal of poverty, and freedom. However, Sen, as part of his general critique of the contractarian tradition, states that ideas about a perfectly just world do not help redress actual existing inequality. Sen faults Rawls for an over-emphasis on institutions as guarantors of justice not considering the effects of human behaviour on the institutions' ability to maintain a just society. Sen believes Rawls understates the difficulty in getting everyone in society to adhere to the norms of a just society. He also claims that Rawls' position that there be only one possible outcome of the reflective equilibrium behind the veil of ignorance is misguided. Sen believes that multiple conflicting but just principles may arise and that this undermines the multi-step processes that Rawls laid out as leading to a perfectly just society.\n\n\"A Theory of Justice\" inspired a 2013 musical, \"\", written and produced by Eylon Aslan-Levy, Ramin Sabi, Tommy Peto and Toby Huelin.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13529329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13529329", "title": "Categories (Peirce)", "text": "Categories (Peirce)\n\nOn May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Charles Sanders Peirce, who eventually founded pragmatism, presented a paper entitled \"\" to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among other things, this paper outlined a theory of predication involving three universal categories that Peirce continued to apply in philosophy and elsewhere for the rest of his life. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern which one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"\" (1878 foundational paper for pragmatism), and in numerous other three-way distinctions in his work.\n\nIn Aristotle's logic, categories are adjuncts to reasoning that are designed to resolve equivocations, ambiguities that make expressions or signs recalcitrant to being ruled by logic. Categories help the reasoner to render signs ready for the application of logical laws. An equivocation is a variation in meaning — a manifold of sign senses — such that, as Aristotle put it about names in the opening of \"\" (1.11–12), \"Things are said to be named ‘equivocally’ when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each\". So Peirce's claim that three categories are sufficient amounts to an assertion that all manifolds of meaning can be unified in just three steps.\n\nThe following passage is critical to the understanding of Peirce's Categories:\nI will now say a few words about what you have called Categories, but for which I prefer the designation Predicaments, and which you have explained as predicates of predicates.\n\nThat wonderful operation of hypostatic abstraction by which we seem to create \"entia rationis\" that are, nevertheless, sometimes real, furnishes us the means of turning predicates from being signs that we think or think \"through\", into being subjects thought of. We thus think of the thought-sign itself, making it the object of another thought-sign.\n\nThereupon, we can repeat the operation of hypostatic abstraction, and from these second intentions derive third intentions. Does this series proceed endlessly? I think not. What then are the characters of its different members?\n\nMy thoughts on this subject are not yet harvested. I will only say that the subject concerns Logic, but that the divisions so obtained must not be confounded with the different Modes of Being: Actuality, Possibility, Destiny (or Freedom from Destiny).\n\nOn the contrary, the succession of Predicates of Predicates is different in the different Modes of Being. Meantime, it will be proper that in our system of diagrammatization we should provide for the division, whenever needed, of each of our three Universes of modes of reality into Realms for the different Predicaments. (Peirce 1906).\nThe first thing to extract from this passage is the fact that Peirce's Categories, or \"Predicaments\", are predicates of predicates. Meaningful predicates have both \"extension\" and \"intension\", so predicates of predicates get their meanings from at least two sources of information, namely, the classes of relations and the qualities of qualities to which they refer. Considerations like these tend to generate hierarchies of subject matters, extending through what is traditionally called the \"logic of second intentions\", or what is handled very roughly by \"second order logic\" in contemporary parlance, and continuing onward through higher intensions, or \"higher order logic\" and \"type theory\".\n\nPeirce arrived at his own system of three categories after a thoroughgoing study of his predecessors, with special reference to the categories of Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel. The names that he used for his own categories varied with context and occasion, but ranged from reasonably intuitive terms like \"quality\", \"reaction\", and \"representation\" to maximally abstract terms like \"firstness\", \"secondness\", and \"thirdness\", respectively. Taken in full generality, \"nth\"-ness can be understood as referring to those properties that all \"n\"-adic relations have in common. Peirce's distinctive claim is that a type hierarchy of three levels is generative of all that we need in logic.\n\nPart of the justification for Peirce's claim that three categories are both necessary and sufficient appears to arise from mathematical ideas about the reducibility of \"n\"-adic relations. According to Peirce's Reduction Thesis, (a) triads are necessary because genuinely triadic relations cannot be completely analyzed in terms of monadic and dyadic predicates, and (b) triads are sufficient because there are no genuinely tetradic or larger polyadic relations—all higher-arity \"n\"-adic relations can be analyzed in terms of triadic and lower-arity relations. Others, notably Robert Burch (1991) and Joachim Hereth Correia and Reinhard Pöschel (2006), have offered proofs of the Reduction Thesis.\n\nThere have been proposals by Donald Mertz, Herbert Schneider, Carl Hausman, and Carl Vaught to augment Peirce's threefolds to fourfolds; and one by Douglas Greenlee to reduce them to twofolds.\n\nPeirce introduces his Categories and their theory in \"On a New List of Categories\" (1867), a work which is cast as a Kantian deduction and is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.\n\n\n\n"}

He was an expert on animal behaviour and academic author in this field. He was one of the first to study the impacts of factory farming. He advocated the study of animal behaviour to gauge what implied \"humane treatment\" for different species, and tried to balance these factors against economic viability for the farmer. He looked at the impact of stress upon animals and held that animals should be treated as individuals not as a \"commodity\". In these studies he concluded that food supply was the essential factor in controlling animal behaviour.\n\nHe was one of the first to both see the benefits of and physically introduce the concept of free range farming.\n\nHe was born in Transkei in South Africa on 20 November 1922 into a Quaker family of British origin. He was educated at Grahamstown. His university career was interrupted by the Second World War during which he served in North Africa in the South African Air Force as a navigator in a bombing crew. He lost his lower left arm in 1944 whilst home on leave, due to a motorcycle accident where he was riding pillion. The driver, his friend, the pilot of his bombing crew, was killed in the accident. David was plagued by phantom pains in the missing hand for all his life.\n\nAfter the war he studied Science at Witwatersrand University, graduating BSc in 1948. Increasing despairing at his county’s politics and apartheid policy, he left in 1949, going to the University of Edinburgh (which had a growing reputation in the field of genetics) as a postgraduate where he gained both a doctorate in 1952 (PhD) and a Diploma in Animal Genetics (studying under Prof Conrad Hal Waddington and Dr Alan William Greenwood). He thereafter began work at the Poultry Research Centre. Due to his personal limb loss he did much research to establish if animals might feel similar phantom pains to his own due to actions such as dehorning etc. He was always concerned of potential pain and animal suffering in various procedures.\nIn 1975 he conducted an infamous experiment on a remote Scottish island, re-wilding domesticated chickens to measure how they survived. Unfortunately all were killed by a resident population of escaped mink. In 1976 he repeated the experiment somewhat more successfully using pigs.\n\nIn 1978 the Poultry Research Centre decided to relocate to Roslin, Midlothian and began more industry-based research. Given David’s disapproval of this and his lack of driving licence (due to his missing arm) making it very difficult to reach this remote site. He moved to more academic roles in Edinburgh instead. In 1978 he began teaching Applied Animal Behaviour at the University of Edinburgh He was given an Honorary Professorship by the University of Edinburgh in 1981. In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Noel Farnie Robertson, Aubrey Manning, John Mitchison, Peter M. B. Walker, Peter McDonald and John E. Dale.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1987 he was President of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. He was also Chairman of the International Society of Applied Ethology.

The Demeter certification program was established in 1928, and as such was the first ecological label for organically produced foods.\n\nCertification is difficult to come by and must be renewed annually. Demeter’s “biodynamic” certification requires biodiversity and ecosystem preservation, soil husbandry, livestock integration, prohibition of genetically engineered organisms and viewing the farm as a living “holistic organism”. The certification verifies the fulfillment of the standards on behalf of the farmers, which in turn guarantees high quality food products to the consumers. This is rewarded by receiving a higher price for food certified with the “Demeter” label, ranging from 10-30% on average.\n\nThe origin of Demeter is a Cooperative for the processing of products of the biodynamic agriculture created in Berlin, Germany, in 1927. The trademark Demeter was registered in 1928. Demeter was administered by the German agronomist Erhard Bartsch who also directed the Experimental Circle of anthroposophical (biodynamic) farmers, and who had chosen the name Demeter, jointly with the German chemist Franz Dreidax.

It is the ecclesiastical arm of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), an international fraternal initiatory organization devoted to promulgating the Law of Thelema.\n\nThelema is a philosophical, mystical and religious system elaborated by Aleister Crowley, and based on \"The Book of the Law\". The word \"Catholic\" denotes the universality of doctrine and not a Christian or Roman Catholic belief set.\n\nThe chief function of \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" is the public and private performance of the Gnostic Mass (\"Liber XV\"), a eucharistic ritual written by Crowley in 1913. According to William Bernard Crow, Crowley wrote the Gnostic Mass \"under the influence of the Liturgy of St. Basil of the Russian Church\". Its structure is also influenced by the initiatory rituals of the \"Ordo Templi Orientis\". Its most notable separation from similar rites of other churches is a Priestess officiating with a Priest, Deacon, and two Children. In addition to the Eucharist, baptism, confirmation, marriage, and last rites are offered by E.G.C. Marriage is not limited to couples of opposite gender.\n\nAbout the Gnostic Mass, Crowley wrote in \"The Confessions of Aleister Crowley\", \"... the Ritual of the Gnostic Catholic Church ... I prepared for the use of the O.T.O., the central ceremony of its public and private celebration, corresponding to the Mass of the Roman Catholic Church.\" It is the single most commonly performed ritual at O.T.O. bodies, with many locations celebrating the Mass monthly or more frequently. Most O.T.O. bodies make some or all of these celebrations open to interested members of the public, so the Mass is often an individual's first experience of the O.T.O.\n\n\"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" has a hierarchical structure of clergy, assisting officers, and laity which parallels the degree structure of the O.T.O. initiatory system. Before 1997, the two systems were more loosely correlated, but since then there have been strict rules concerning minimum O.T.O. degrees required to serve in particular E.G.C. roles.\n\nMembership in \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" is similar to the Roman Catholic Church, with some important differences. As currently constituted, E.G.C. includes both clergy and laity. Clergy must be initiate members of O.T.O., while laity may affiliate to E.G.C. through baptism and confirmation without undertaking any of the degree initiations of the Order.\n\nNovice clergy are initiate members who participate in the administration of E.G.C. sacraments, although they have not yet taken orders (i.e., been through a ceremony of ordination).\n\nThe first ordination in E.G.C. is that of the diaconate. Second Degree initiates of O.T.O. who have been confirmed in E.G.C. can be ordained as Deacons, whose principal duties are to assist the Priesthood.\n\nThe sacerdotal ordination admits members to the priesthood. Sacerdotal ordinands must hold at least the K.E.W. degree of O.T.O., a degree only available by invitation. The Priesthood is responsible for administering the sacraments through the Gnostic Mass and other ceremonies as authorized by their supervising Bishops.\n\nThe Priesthood is supervised and instructed by the Episcopate, or Bishops. Full initiation to the Seventh Degree of O.T.O. includes episcopal consecration in E.G.C. The Tenth Degree Supreme and Holy King serves as the Primate or chief Bishop for any country in which O.T.O. has organized a Grand Lodge. The Frater (or Soror) Superior of O.T.O. is also the Patriarch (Matriarch) of the Church, with ultimate authority over the clergy.\n\nThe principal ritual of \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" is the Gnostic Mass, a Eucharistic ceremony written by Aleister Crowley in 1913. Theodor Reuss produced and authorized a German translation in 1918.\n\nThe text of the Gnostic Mass makes reference to ceremonies of baptism, confirmation, and marriage. Crowley left some notes towards a baptism ritual, and his \"Liber CVI\" was written for use in a last rites circumstance. The Bishops of the contemporary Church have developed rituals for all of these purposes, as well as infant benedictions, consecration of holy oil, funerals, and home administration of the Eucharist to the sick.\n\nAlthough some Gnostic Masses are held privately for initiates only, there is nothing 'secret' about E.G.C. rituals as such, and they are commonly open to the public.\n\nThe Gnostic Saints of \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" are a series of historical and mythological figures revered in the religion of Thelema. They are found in the fifth Collect of Liber XV, titled \"The Saints\".\n\nTwo Gnostic Saints have been officially added to the original list. William Blake was so recognized based on a discovered writing by Aleister Crowley which described him as such. Giordano Bruno was more recently added to the list.\n\nThe \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" descended from a line of French Gnostic revival churches that developed in the 19th century. At that time, these Gnostic churches were essentially Christian in nature. In 1907, Gerard Encausse, Jean Bricaud and Louis-Sophrone Fugairon founded their own, simply called the Gnostic Catholic Church. In 1908, they gave O.T.O. Grand Master Theodor Reuss episcopal consecration and primatial authority in their GCC. Later that year, Reuss incorporated the Gnostic Catholic Church into O.T.O. after the original founders renamed their own church to the Universal Gnostic Church.\n\nThe name \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" was not applied to the church until Crowley wrote the Gnostic Mass in 1913, which Reuss proclaimed to be the church's official rite. This marked the first time an established church was to accept the Law of Thelema as its central doctrine. Reuss then announced a new title for himself: the \"Sovereign Patriarch and Primate of the Gnostic Catholic Church\".\n\nIn 1979, Hymenaeus Alpha X° (Grady McMurtry) separated \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" from \"Ordo Templi Orientis\", and made it into an independent organization, with himself at the head of both. During this period of separation \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" published its own quarterly magazine. However, in 1986, his successor, Hymenaeus Beta, dissolved the separate Gnostic Catholic Church corporation and folded the church back into O.T.O. Since then the Church has expanded greatly, and in recent years several books and articles dealing with the E.G.C. and the Gnostic Mass have been published by its Clergy, notably by Tau Apiryon & Tau Helena, James Wasserman & Nancy Wasserman, Rodney Orpheus & Cathryn Orchard, and T Polyphilus.\n\nA creed is a statement of belief—usually religious belief—or faith. The word derives from the Latin \"credo\" for \"I believe\". The creed of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica—also known as the Gnostic Creed—is recited in the Gnostic Mass, during the Ceremony of the Introit.\n\nThe text of the Creed is as follows:\n\nThe first six articles profess several beliefs by the congregants. The remaining two are confessions. The Creed ends with the Thelemic form of the Pranava, equivalent to the sacred Vedic syllable \"Aum\" or to the \"Amen\" of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. On the basic form of the Creed, Tau Apiryon and Helena (1998) write:\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike traditional humanisms, however, Sartre disavowed any reliance on an essential nature of man – on deriving values from the facts of human nature – but rather saw human value as self-created through undertaking projects in the world: experiments in living.\nAlbert Camus, in his book \"The Plague\", suggests that some of us may choose to be heroic, even knowing that it will bring us neither reward nor salvation; and Simone de Beauvoir, in her book \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\", argues that embracing our own personal freedom requires us to fight for the freedoms of all humanity.\n\nMartin Heidegger attacked Sartre's concept of existential humanism in his \"Letter on Humanism\" of 1946, accusing Sartre of elevating Reason above Being.\n\nMichel Foucault followed Heidegger in attacking Sartre's humanism as a kind of theology of man, though in his emphasis on the self-creation of the human being he has in fact been seen as very close to Sartre's existential humanism.\n"}

He worked with all three subjects on university level, but is best remembered as Norway's first professor of psychology.\n\nHe was born in Dypvåg as a son of bishop Kristian Schjelderup (1853–1913) and Hendy Hassel (1855–1922). He was a brother of Kristian Schjelderup, Jr, he too a bishop. He finished his secondary education at Kristiansand Cathedral School in 1912, and graduated in physics from the Royal Frederick University. Here he also worked as research assistant of Lars Vegard. He also worked with anatomy, microscopy and philosophy. He released the paper \"Hovedlinjer i filosofiens utvikling fra midten av det 19. århundre til nutiden\" in 1916, and was hired as a research fellow in philosophy in 1917. In line with the tendency of the day, his philosophy was positivist and crossed into psychology. He studied experimental psychology in Copenhagen and Göttingen, and took the dr.philos. degree in 1919 with the thesis \"Til sansefornæmmelsernes psykofysiologi\". He then studied in Berlin and Freiburg, and was appointed as a professor in 1922. After six years as a professor of philosophy, he became Norway's first professor of psychology in 1928. He worked at the Royal Frederick University (from 1939: the University of Oslo).\n\nAmong other things, Schjelderup learned psychoanalysis. He helped persons like Otto Fenichel and Wilhelm Reich to migrate from Nazi Germany to Norway. Then, after Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Schjelderup became leader of the university's \"Aksjonsutvalget\", a resistance committee. Open protests ensued when the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students. The staff Johannes Andenæs, Bjørn Føyn, Johan Christian Schreiner, Eiliv Skard, Anatol Heintz, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Carl Jacob Arnholm, Endre Berner and Harald K. Schjelderup were sent to Grini concentration camp. Schjelderup was first incarcerated at Bredtveit from 15 October to 22 November, then at Berg until 8 December, then at Grini until 5 May 1945. He also spent time at Victoria Terrasse under interrogation.\n\nAfter the war Schjelderup returned as professor, and helped build and consolidate the university's psychology studies. He became professor emeritus in 1965. Important books include \"Psykologi\" (1927), \"Über drei Haupttypen der religiösen Erlebnisformen\" (1932, written with his brother), \"Innføring i psykologi\" (1957) and \"Det skjulte menneske\" (1961). He was a board member of the International Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (1922) and the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and was decorated as a Knight 1st Class of the Order of St. Olav (1961). He was married twice, and died in August 1974 in Oslo. A building at the University of Oslo, \"Harald Schjelderups hus\", bears his name.\n"}

The formal establishment of Human Rights Day occurred at the 317th Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on 4 December 1950, when the General Assembly declared resolution 423(V), inviting all member states and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.\n\nThe day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. In addition it is traditionally on 10 December that the five-yearly United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights and Nobel Peace Prize are awarded. Many governmental and non-governmental organizations active in the human rights field also schedule special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organizations.\n\nHuman Rights Day is the day in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe formal inception of Human Rights Day dates from 1950, after the Assembly passed resolution 423(V) inviting all States and interested organizations to adopt 10 December of each year as Human Rights Day. The popularity of the day can be shown by the fact that the commemorative Human Rights Day stamp issued by the United Nations Postal Administration in 1952, received approximately 200,000 advance orders.\n\nWhen the General Assembly adopted the Declaration, with 48 states in favor and eight abstentions, it was proclaimed as a \"common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\", towards which individuals and societies should \"strive by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance\". The measure was received by both advocates and critics alike as \"being more declarative than legislative, more suggestive than binding.\"\n\nAlthough the Declaration with its broad range of political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights is not a binding document, it inspired more than 60 human rights instruments which together constitute an international standard of human rights. Today the general consent of all United Nations Member States on the basic Human Rights laid down in the Declaration makes it even stronger and emphasizes the relevance of Human Rights in our daily lives.\n\nThe High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the main United Nations rights official, and his Office play a major role in coordinating efforts for the yearly observation of Human Rights Day:\n\nThe 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights occurred on 10 December 2008, and the UN Secretary-General launched a year-long campaign leading up to this anniversary. Because the UDHR holds the world record as the most translated document (except for the Bible), organizations around the globe used the year to focus on helping people everywhere learn about their rights.\n\nOn 9 December 2001, President George W. Bush made a Presidential proclamation that Human Rights Week began on 9 December. He also made the same proclamation on 10 December 2008.\n\nIn South Africa, Human Rights Day is celebrated on 21 March, in remembrance of the Sharpeville massacre which took place on 21 March 1960. This massacre occurred as a result of protests against the Apartheid regime in South Africa. South African Human Rights Day was declared a national holiday when the ANC was elected as the government with Nelson Mandela as the first democratically elected leader. Parliament's role on this day is to empower the people so that the democratic processes becomes known to all South Africans.\n\nIt is celebrated on 11 December in Kiribati.\n\n\n"}

(November 7, 1942 in Valladolid, Castilla y Leon, Spain – November 16, 1989 in San Salvador, El Salvador) was a scholar, social psychologist, philosopher and Jesuit priest. He was one of the victims of the 1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador\n\nMartín-Baró entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Orduña, Spain, on September 28, 1959. Shortly after, he was transferred to the novitiate of Villagarcía and then sent to Central America, where he completed his second year in the novitiate of the Society of Jesus.\n\nAt the end of September 1961, he began his studies in classical humanities at the Catholic University in Quito. On graduating, he travelled to Bogotá, where he studied philosophy at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, run by the Jesuits. In 1964 he received his bachelor's degree in philosophy and in 1965 his licentiate (licenciatura) in philosophy and literature. In 1966 he returned to El Salvador, where he got a job as a teacher and academic coordinator at the Externado San José. In 1967, he started teaching at the Universidad Centroamericana \"José Simeón Cañas\" (UCA).\n\nHe travelled to Frankfurt in 1967 to study theology. Returning to San Salvador to continue his studies, he obtained his bachelor's degree from Eegenhoven, Belgium, in 1970. He then began studying psychology at UCA, where he was also lecturer. In 1975 he completed his licentiate in psychology.\n\nIn 1971 and 1972 he taught psychology in the National Nursing Academy in Santa Ana. Later he was dean of Students between 1972 and 1975, and a member of the University Board, at UCA. From 1971 until 1974 he was head of the editorial board of the academic journal \"Estudios Centroamericanos\" (\"ECA\").\n\nIn 1977 he earned a master's degree in social sciences from the University of Chicago and two years later, in 1979, a Ph.D. in social and organisational psychology from the same institution. In his master's thesis, he discussed social attitudes and group conflict in El Salvador, a theme which he continued in his doctoral dissertation which focused on population density of the lowest social classes in El Salvador.\n\nOn completing his studies he returned to San Salvador, where he lectured in psychology at UCA. By 1981 he was Academic Vice-Rector and member of the Board of Directors. In 1982 he became head of the psychology department. In 1986 he founded and directed the University Institute of Public Opinion, IUDOP. In 1989, the academic vice-rector's office was split in two and Martín-Baró became director of post-graduate studies and research.\n\nHe was a member of the editorial board of UCA Editores and \"Estudios Centroamericanos\" (\"ECA\"), the Salvadoran Journal of Psychology and the Costa Rican magazine \"Polémica\". He was a visiting professor at the Central University of Venezuela, the Universidad del Zulia in Maracaibo, the University of Puerto Rico, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, Universidad Complutense in Madrid and Universidad de Costa Rica in San José. He was a member of the American Psychological Association as well as the Salvadoran Psychological Association. He was the vice-president of the Mesoamerican division of the Interamerican Psychological Society.\n\nMartín-Baró published eleven books and a long list of cultural and scientific articles, in various Latin American and North American academic journals and magazines.\n\nMartín Baró argued that psychology should be developed to address the historical context, the social conditions and aspirations of the people. He believed that students of psychology should learn to analyse human behaviour in the location of their practice, bearing in mind the criteria outlined for that location.\n\nIn his writings and lectures he rejected the idea of universal, impartial psychology, and developed a psychology that was critically committed with the projects for alternative societies that existed in Latin America. For him, the psychical situation of individuals could either be an abnormal reaction to normal circumstances, or a normal reaction to abnormal conditions.\n\nFor Martín-Baró, the solution to mental health problems in societies characterised by oppression, where \"normal abnormality\" prevails, is the transformation of society to transcend the historical reality of oppression. Psychologists cannot ignore the influence that difficult contexts have on mental health. Furthermore, if they do, then they become accomplices to the social injustices (or abnormalities) that may have caused these mental health problems.\n\nHe integrated diverse theories, and was so convinced of the benefits to be gained by the \"de-ideologising\" potential of social psychology that he openly questioned the theoretical models of mainstream psychology. He considered these models inadequate to address the effects of the structural violence that prevailed in El Salvador.\n\nHis work inspired the development of liberation psychology in Latin America and influenced community psychology throughout the world.\n\nThrough grant-making and education, the \"Martín-Baró Fund for Mental Health and Human Rights\" fosters psychological well-being, social consciousness, active resistance, and progressive social change in communities affected by institutional violence, repression and social injustice. \n\nExplaining why reparations are a crucial part of the national reconciliation processes:\n\n\"It is clear that no one is going to return to the imprisoned dissident his youth; to the young woman who has been raped her innocence; to the person who has been tortured his or her integrity. Nobody is going to return the dead and the disappeared to their families. What can and must be publicly restored [are] the victims' names and their dignity, through a formal recognition of the injustice of what has occurred, and, wherever possible, material reparation... Those who clamour for social reparation are not asking for vengeance. Nor are they blindly adding difficulties to a historical process that is already by no means easy. On the contrary, they are promoting the personal and social viability of a new society, truly democratic.\" \n\n\"... a mind that was probing and humane, wide-ranging in interests and passionate in concerns, and dedicated with a rare combination of intelligence and heroism to the challenge his work sets forth to construct a new person in a new society.\" Noam Chomsky, MIT\n\n\"... the major dimensions along which Martín-Baró's work developed: political psychology, war and trauma, and 'de-ideologizing' reality ... his contributions to social psychology as well as his intense involvement in the social reality of his adoptive country, El Salvador ... is required reading for psychologists seeking a more critical psychology—one that takes responsibility for its social position and privilege, and challenges the status quo. It is an equally important resource for those who seek ideas and examples for developing 'indigenous psychology' from the base of marginalized people's lives, in coalition with them.\" M.

{"id": "166200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166200", "title": "Jewish philosophy", "text": "Jewish philosophy\n\nJewish philosophy () includes all philosophy carried out by Jews, or in relation to the religion of Judaism. Until modern \"Haskalah\" (Jewish Enlightenment) and Jewish emancipation, Jewish philosophy was preoccupied with attempts to reconcile coherent new ideas into the tradition of Rabbinic Judaism, thus organizing emergent ideas that are not necessarily Jewish into a uniquely Jewish scholastic framework and world-view. With their acceptance into modern society, Jews with secular educations embraced or developed entirely new philosophies to meet the demands of the world in which they now found themselves.\n\nMedieval re-discovery of ancient Greek philosophy among the Geonim of 10th century Babylonian academies brought rationalist philosophy into Biblical-Talmudic Judaism. The philosophy was generally in competition with Kabbalah. Both schools would become part of classic Rabbinic literature, though the decline of scholastic rationalism coincided with historical events which drew Jews to the Kabbalistic approach. For Ashkenazi Jews, emancipation and encounter with secular thought from the 18th century onwards altered how philosophy was viewed. Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities had later more ambivalent interaction with secular culture than in Western Europe. In the varied responses to modernity, Jewish philosophical ideas were developed across the range of emerging religious movements. These developments could be seen as either continuations of or breaks from the canon of Rabbinic philosophy of the Middle Ages, as well as the other historical dialectic aspects of Jewish thought, and resulted in diverse contemporary Jewish attitudes to philosophical methods.\n\nRabbinic literature sometimes views Abraham as a philosopher. Some have suggested that Abraham introduced a philosophy learned from Melchizedek; Some Jews ascribe the \"Sefer Yetzirah\" \"Book of Creation\" to Abraham. A midrash describes how Abraham understood this world to have a creator and director by comparing this world to \"a house with a light in it\", what is now called the argument from design. Psalms contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current. Ecclesiastes is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the Hebrew Bible; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.\n\nPhilo attempted to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which he learned from Jewish exegesis and Stoicism. Philo attempted to make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious \"truths\". These \"truths\" he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy was used as an aid to \"truth\", and a means of arriving at it. To this end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle's doctrine of the \"eternity and indestructibility of the world\".\n\nDr. Bernard Revel, in dissertation on Karaite halakha, points to writings of a 10th-century Karaite, Jacob Qirqisani, who quotes Philo, illustrating how Karaites made use of Philo's works in development of Karaite Judaism. Philo's works became important to Medieval Christian scholars who leveraged the work of Karaites to lend credence to their claims that \"these are the beliefs of Jews\" - a technically correct, yet deceptive, attribution.\n\nWith the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Second Temple Judaism was in disarray, but Jewish traditions were preserved especially thanks to the shrewd maneuvers of Johanan ben Zakai, who saved the Sanhedrin and moved it to Yavne. Philosophical speculation was not a central part of Rabbinic Judaism, although some have seen the Mishnah as a philosophical work. Rabbi Akiva has also been viewed as a philosophical figure: his statements include 1.) \"\"How favored is man, for he was created after an image \"for in an image, Elokim made man\" \"(Gen. ix. 6)\"\"\", 2.) \"Everything is foreseen; but freedom \"[of will]\" is given to every man\", 3.) \"The world is governed by mercy... but the divine decision is made by the preponderance of the good or bad in one's actions\".\n\nAfter the Bar Kokhba revolt, Rabbinic scholars gathered in Tiberias and Safed to re-assemble and re-assess Judaism, its laws, theology, liturgy, beliefs and leadership structure. In 219 CE, the Sura Academy (from which Jewish Kalam emerged many centuries later) was founded by Abba Arika. For the next five centuries, Talmudic academies focused upon reconstituting Judaism and little, if any, philosophic investigation was pursued.\n\nRabbinic Judaism had limited philosophical activity until it was challenged by Islam, Karaite Judaism, and Christianity—with Tanach, Mishnah, and Talmud, there was no need for a philosophic framework. From an economic viewpoint, Radhanite trade dominance was being usurped by coordinated Christian and Islamic forced-conversions, and torture, compelling Jewish scholars to understand nascent economic threats. These investigations triggered new ideas and intellectual exchange among Jewish and Islamic scholars in the areas of jurisprudence, mathematics, astronomy, logic and philosophy. Jewish scholars influenced Islamic scholars and Islamic scholars influenced Jewish scholars. Contemporary scholars continue to debate who was Muslim and who was Jew—some \"Islamic scholars\" were \"Jewish scholars\" prior to forced conversion to Islam, some Jewish scholars willingly converted to Islam, such as Abdullah ibn Salam, while others later reverted to Judaism, and still others, born and raised as Jews, were ambiguous in their religious beliefs such as ibn al-Rawandi, although they lived according to the customs of their neighbors.\n\nAround 700 CE, ʿAmr ibn ʿUbayd Abu ʿUthman al-Basri introduces two streams of thought that influence Jewish, Islamic and Christian scholars:\n\nThe story of the Bahshamiyya Muʿtazila and Qadariyah is as important, if not more so, as the intellectual symbiosis of Judaism and Islam in Islamic Spain.\n\nAround 733 CE, Mar Natronai ben Habibai moves to Kairouan, then to Spain, transcribing the Talmud \"Bavli\" for the Academy at Kairouan from memory—later taking a copy with him to Spain.\n\nBorrowing from the Mutakallamin of Basra, the Karaites were the first Jewish group to subject Judaism to Muʿtazila. Rejecting the Talmud and Rabbinical tradition, Karaites took liberty to reinterpret the Tanakh. This meant abandoning foundational Jewish belief structures. Some scholars suggest that the major impetus for the formation of Karaism was a reaction to the rapid rise of Shi'i Islam, which recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith but claimed that it detracted from monotheism by deferring to Rabbinic authority. Karaites absorbed certain aspects of Jewish sects such as the followers of Abu Isa (Shi'ism), Maliki (Sunnis) and Yudghanites (Sufis), who were influenced by East-Islamic scholarship yet deferred to the Ash'ari when contemplating the sciences.\n\nThe spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa rendered Muslim all that was once Jewish. Greek philosophy, science, medicine and mathematics was absorbed by Jewish scholars living in the Arab world due to Arabic translations of those texts; remnants of the Library of Alexandria. Early Jewish converts to Islam brought with them stories from their heritage, known as \"Isra'iliyyat\", which told of the \"Banu Isra'il\", the pious men of ancient Israel. One of the most famous early mystics of Sufism, Hasan of Basra, introduced numerous \"Isra'iliyyat\" legends into Islamic scholarship, stories that went on to become representative of Islamic mystical ideas of piety of Sufism.\n\nHai Gaon of Pumbedita Academy begins a new phase in Jewish scholarship and investigation (\"hakirah\"); Hai Gaon augments Talmudic scholarship with non-Jewish studies. Hai Gaon was a savant with an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time so much so that Moses ibn Ezra called him a mutakallim. Hai was competent to argue with followers of Qadariyyah and Mutazilites, sometimes adopting their polemic methods. Through correspondence with Talmudic Academies at Kairouan, Cordoba and Lucena, Hai Gaon passes along his discoveries to Talmudic scholars therein.\n\nThe teachings of the Brethren of Purity were carried to the West by a Spanish Arab of Madrid, Muhammad Abu'l-Qasim al-Majnti al-Andalusi, who died in AD 1004–1005. Thanks to Averroes, Spain became a center of philosophical learning as is reflected by the explosion of philosophical inquiry among Jews, Muslims and Christians.\n\nAccording to Sa'adya Gaon, the Jewish community of Balkh (Afghanistan) was divided into two groups: \"Jews\" and \"people that are called Jews\"; Hiwi al-Balkhi was a member of the latter. Hiwi is generally considered to be the very first \"Jewish\" philosopher to subject the Pentateuch to critical analysis. Hiwi is viewed by some scholars as an intellectually conflicted man torn between Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Gnostic Christianity, and Manichaean thought.\n\nHiwi espoused the belief that miraculous acts, described in the Pentateuch, are simply examples of people using their skills of reasoning to undertake, and perform, seemingly miraculous acts. As examples of this position, he argued that the parting of the Red Sea was a natural phenomenon, and that Moses' claim to greatness lay merely in his ability to calculate the right moment for the crossing. He also emphasized that the Egyptian magicians were able to reproduce several of Moses' \"miracles,\" proving that they could not have been so unique. According to scholars, Hiwi's gravest mistake was having the Pentateuch redacted to reflect his own views - then had those redacted texts, which became popular, distributed to children. Since his views contradicted the views of both Rabbanite and Karaite scholars, Hiwi was declared a heretic. In this context, however, we can also regard Hiwi, while flawed, as the very first critical biblical commentator; zealous rationalistic views of Hiwi parallel those of Ibn al-Rawandi.\n\nSaʿadya Gaon dedicated an entire treatise, written in rhyming Hebrew, to a refutation of Ḥīwī's arguments, two fragments of which, preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have been published (Davidson, 1915; Schirmann, 1965). Ḥīwī's criticisms are also noted in Abraham ibn Ezra's commentary on the Pentateuch. Sa'adya Gaon denounced Hiwi as an extreme rationalist, a \"Mulhidun\", or atheist/deviator. Abraham Ibn Daud described HIwi as a sectarian who \"denied the Torah, yet used it to formulate a new Torah of his liking\".\n\nSaadia Gaon, son of a proselyte, is considered the greatest early Jewish philosopher. During his early years in Tulunid Egypt, the Fatimid Caliphate ruled Egypt; the leaders of the Tulunids were Ismaili Imams. Their influence upon the Jewish academies of Egypt resonate in the works of Sa'adya. Sa'adya's \"Emunoth ve-Deoth\" (\"Beliefs and Opinions\") was originally called \"Kitab al-Amanat wal-l'tikadat\" (\"Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma\"); it was the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism, completed at Sura Academy in 933 CE.\n\nLittle known is that Saadia traveled to Tiberias in 915CE to study with Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (Tiberias), a Jewish theologian and Bible translator from Tiberias whose main claim to fame is the fact that Saadia Gaon studied with him at some point. He is not mentioned in any Jewish source, and apart from the Andalusian heresiographer and polemicist Ibn Hazm, who mentions him as a Jewish mutakallim (rational theologian), our main source of information is the \"Kitāb al-Tanbīh\" by the Muslim historian al-Masʿūdī (d. 956). In his brief survey of Arabic translations of the Bible, al-Masʿūdī states that the Israelites rely for exegesis and translation of the Hebrew books—i.e., the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, twenty-four books in all, he says—on a number of Israelites whom they praise highly, almost all of whom he has met in person. He mentions Abū ʾl-Kathīr as one of them, and also Saadia (\"Saʿīd ibn Yaʿqūb al-Fayyūmī\"). Regardless of what we do not know, Saadia traveled to Tiberias (home of the learned scribes and exegetes) to learn and he chose Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabariya. The extent of Abū ʾl-Kathīr's influence on Saadia's thought cannot be established, however.\n\nAbū ʾl-Kathīr's profession is also unclear. al-Masʿūdī calls him a \"kātib\", which has been variously interpreted as secretary, government official, (biblical) scribe, Masorete, and book copyist. For lack of further information, some scholars have tried to identify Abū ʾl-Kathīr with the Hebrew grammarian Abū ʿAlī Judah ben ʿAllān, likewise of Tiberias, who seems to have been a Karaite Jew. However, al-Masūdī unequivocally describes Abu ʾl-Kathīr (as well as his student Saadia) as an ashmaʿthī (Rabbanite).\n\nIn \"Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma\" Saadia declares the rationality of the Jewish religion with the caveat that reason must capitulate wherever it contradicts tradition. Dogma takes precedence over reason. Saadia closely followed the rules of the Muʿtazila school of Abu Ali al-Jubba'i in composing his works. It was Saadia who laid foundations for Jewish rationalist theology which built upon the work of the Muʿtazila, thereby shifting Rabbinic Judaism from mythical explanations of the Rabbis to reasoned explanations of the intellect. Saadia advanced the criticisms of Muʿtazila by Ibn al-Rawandi.\n\nDavid ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas was author of the earliest known Jewish philosophical work of the Middle Ages, a commentary on the \"Sefer Yetzirah\"; he is regarded as the father of Jewish medieval philosophy. Sl-Mukkamas was first to introduce the \"methods\" of Kalam into Judaism and the first Jew to mention Aristotle in his writings. He was a proselyte of Rabbinic Judaism (not Karaite Judaism, as some argue); al-Mukkamas was a student of physician, and renowned Christian philosopher, Hana. His close interaction with Hana, and his familial affiliation with Islam gave al-Mukkamas a unique view of religious belief and theology.\n\nIn 1898 Abraham Harkavy discovered, in Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, fifteen of the twenty chapters of David's philosophical work entitled \"Ishrun Maḳalat\" (Twenty Chapters) of which 15 survive. One of the oldest surviving witnesses to early Kalām, it begins with epistemological investigations, turns to proofs of the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of a Creator, discusses the unity of the Creator (including the divine attributes), and concludes with theodicy (humanity and revelation) and a refutation of other religions (mostly lost).\n\nIn 915 CE, Sa'adya Gaon left for Palestine, where, according to al-Masʿūdī (Tanbīh, 113), he perfected his education at the feet of Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (d. 320/932). The latter is also mentioned by Ibn Ḥazm in his K. al-Fiṣlal wa 'l-niḥal, iii, 171, as being, together with Dāwūd ibn Marwān al-Muqammiṣ and Sa'adya himself, one of the mutakallimūn of the Jews.\n\nSince al-Muqammiṣ made few references to specifically Jewish issues and very little of his work was translated from Arabic into Hebrew, he was largely forgotten by Jewish tradition. Nonetheless, he had a significant impact on subsequent Jewish philosophical followers of the Kalām, such as Saʿadya Gaon.\n\nSamuel ibn Naghrillah, born in Mérida, Spain, lived in Córdoba and was a child prodigy and student of Hanoch ben Moshe. Samuel ibn Naghrillah, Hasdai ibn Shaprut, and Moshe ben Hanoch founded the Lucena Yeshiva that produced such brilliant scholars as Isaac ibn Ghiyyat and Maimon ben Yosef, the father of Maimonides. Ibn Naghrillah's son, Yosef, provided refuge for two sons of Hezekiah Gaon; Daud Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi and Yitzhak Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi. Though not a philosopher, he did build the infrastructure to allow philosophers to thrive. In 1070 the gaon Isaac ben Moses ibn Sakri of Denia, Spain traveled to the East and acted as \"rosh yeshivah\" of the Baghdad Academy.\n\nSolomon ibn Gabirol was born in Málaga then moved to Valencia. Ibn Gabirol was one of the first teachers of Neoplatonism in Europe. His role has been compared to that of Philo. Ibn Gabirol occidentalized Greco-Arabic philosophy and restored it to Europe. The philosophical teachings of Philo and ibn Gabirol were largely ignored by fellow Jews; the parallel may be extended by adding that Philo and ibn Gabirol both exercised considerable influence in secular circles; Philo upon early Christianity and Ibn Gabirol upon the scholars of medieval Christianity. Christian scholars, including Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, defer to him frequently.\n\nAbraham bar Hiyya, of Barcelona and later Arles-Provence, was a student of his father Hiyya al-Daudi and one of the most important figures in the scientific movement which made the Jews of Provence, Spain and Italy the intermediaries between Averroism, Muʿtazila and Christian Europe. He aided this scientific movement by original works, translations and as interpreter for another translator, Plato Tiburtinus. Bar-Hiyya's best student was v. His philosophical works are \"Meditation of the Soul\", an ethical work written from a rationalistic religious viewpoint, and an apologetic epistle addressed to Judah ben Barzillai.\n\nOriginally known by his Hebrew name Nethanel Baruch ben Melech al-Balad, Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī, known as \"Hibat Allah\", was a Jewish philosopher and physicist and father-in-law of Maimonides who converted to Islam in his twilight years - once head of the Baghdad Yeshiva and considered the leading philosopher of Iraq.\n\nHistorians differ over the motive for his conversion to Islam. Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon him because he was a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted at the edge of a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon Anusim). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.\n\nHis writings include \"Kitāb al-Muʿtabar\" (\"The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection\"); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet; and the treatise \"On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime.\" According to Hibat Allah, \"Kitāb al-Muʿtabar\" consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work.\n\nNatan'el al-Fayyumi of Yemen, was the twelfth-century author of \"Bustan al-Uqul\" (\"Garden of Intellects\"), a Jewish version of Ismaili Shi'i doctrines. Like the Ismailis, Natan'el al-Fayyumi argued that God sent different prophets to various nations of the world, containing legislations suited to the particular temperament of each individual nation. Ismaili doctrine holds that a single universal religious truth lies at the root of the different religions. Some Jews accepted this model of religious pluralism, leading them to view Muhammad as a legitimate prophet, though not Jewish, sent to preach to the Arabs, just as the Hebrew prophets had been sent to deliver their messages to Israel; others refused this notion in entirety. Natan'el's son Yaqub turned to Maimonides, asking urgently for counsel on how to deal with forced conversions to Islam and religious persecutions at the hand of Saladin. Maimonides' response was the \"Epistle to Yemen\".\n\nBahye ben Yosef Ibn Paquda, of Zaragoza, was author of the first Jewish system of ethics \"Al Hidayah ila Faraid al-hulub\", (\"Guide to the Duties of the Heart\"). Bahya often followed the method of the Arabian encyclopedists known as \"the Brethren of Purity\" but adopts some of Sufi tenets rather than Ismaili. According to Bahya, the Torah appeals to reason and knowledge as proofs of God's existence. It is therefore a duty incumbent upon every one to make God an object of speculative reason and knowledge, in order to arrive at true faith. Baḥya borrows from Sufism and Jewish Kalam integrating them into Neoplatonism. Proof that Bahya borrowed from Sufism is underscored by the fact that the title of his eighth gate, \"Muḥasabat al-Nafs\" (\"Self-Examination\"), is reminiscent of the Sufi \"Abu Abd Allah Ḥarith Ibn-Asad\", who has been surnamed \"El Muḥasib\" (\"the self-examiner\"), because—say his biographers—\"he was always immersed in introspection\"\n\nJudah Halevi of Toledo, Spain defended Rabbinic Judaism against Islam, Christianity and Karaite Judaism. He was a student of Moses ibn Ezra whose education came from Isaac ibn Ghiyyat; trained as a Rationalist, he shed it in favor of Neoplatonism. Like al-Ghazali, Judah Halevi attempted to liberate religion from the bondage of philosophical systems. In particular, in a work written in Arabic \"Kitab al-Ḥujjah wal-Dalil fi Nuṣr al-Din al-Dhalil\", translated by Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon, by the title \"Kuzari\" he elaborates upon his views of Judaism relative to other religions of the time.\nAbraham ibn Daud was a student of Rabbi Baruch ben Yitzhak Ibn Albalia, his maternal uncle. Ibn Daud's philosophical work written in Arabic, \"Al-'akidah al-Rafiyah\" (\"The Sublime Faith\"), has been preserved in Hebrew by the title \"Emunah Ramah\". Ibn Daud did not introduce a new philosophy, but he was the first to introduce a more thorough systematic form derived from Aristotle. Accordingly, Hasdai Crescas mentions Ibn Daud as the only Jewish philosopher among the predecessors of Maimonides. Overshadowed by Maimonides, ibn Daud's \"Emunah Ramah\", a work to which Maimonides was indebted, received little notice from later philosophers. \"True philosophy\", according to Ibn Daud, \"does not entice us from religion; it tends rather to strengthen and solidify it. Moreover, it is the duty of every thinking Jew to become acquainted with the harmony existing between the fundamental doctrines of Judaism and those of philosophy, and, wherever they seem to contradict one another, to seek a mode of reconciling them\".\n\nMaimonides wrote \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" — his most influential philosophic work. He was a student of his father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef (a student of Joseph ibn Migash) in Cordoba, Spain. When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan — a student of Isaac Alfasi. Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah. In some ways his position was parallel to that of Averroes; in reaction to the attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions. The principles which inspired all of Maimonides' philosophical activity was identical those of Abraham Ibn Daud: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created \"ex nihilo\". In \"Guide for the Perplexed\" (1:17 & 2:11)\" Maimonides explains that Israel lost its Mesorah in exile, and with it \"we lost our science and philosophy — only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.\n\nMaimonides writings almost immediately came under attack from Karaites, Dominican Christians, Tosafists of Provence, Ashkenaz and Al Andalus. His genius was obvious, protests centered around his writings. Scholars suggest that Maimonides instigated the Maimonidean Controversy when he verbally attacked \"Samuel ben Ali Ha-Levi al-Dastur\" (\"Gaon of Baghdad\") as \"one whom people accustom from his youth to believe that there is none like him in his generation,\" and he sharply attack the \"monetary demands\" of the academies. \"al-Dastur\"was an anti-Maimonidean operating in Babylon to undermine the works of Maimonides and those of Maimonides' patrons (the Al-Constantini Family from North Africa). To illustrate the reach of the Maimonidean Controversy, \"al-Dastur\", the chief opponent of Maimonides in the East, was excommunicated by \"Daud Ibn Hodaya al Daudi\" (Exilarch of Mosul). Maimonides' attacks on Ibn al-Dastur may not have been entirely altruistic given the position of Maimonides' in-laws in competing Yeshivas.\n\nIn Western Europe, the controversy was halted by the burning of Maimonides' works by Christian Dominicans, in 1232. Avraham son of Rambam, continued fighting for his father's beliefs in the East; desecration of Maimonides' tomb, at Tiberias by Jews, was a profound shock to Jews throughout the Diaspora and caused all to pause and reflect upon what was being done to the fabric of Jewish Culture. This compelled many Anti-Maimonideans to recant their assertions and realize what cooperation with Christians meant to them, their texts and their communities.\n\nMaimonidean controversy flared up again at the beginning of the fourteenth century when Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet, under influence from Asher ben Jehiel, issued a cherem on \"any member of the community who, being under twenty-five years, shall study the works of the Greeks on natural science and metaphysics.\"\n\nContemporary Kabbalists, Tosafists and Rationalists continue to engage in lively, sometimes caustic, debate in support of their positions and influence in the Jewish world. At the center of many of these debates are 1) \"Guide for the Perplexed\", 2) \"13 Principles of Faith\", 3) \"Mishnah Torah\", and 4) his commentary on Anusim.\n\nJoseph ben Judah of Ceuta was the son of Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan and a student of Maimonides for whom the \"Guide for the Perplexed\" is written. Yosef traveled from Alexandria to Fustat to study logic, mathematics, and astronomy under Maimonides. Philosophically, Yosef's dissertation, in Arabic, on the problem of \"Creation\" is suspected to have been written before contact with Maimonides. It is entitled \"Ma'amar bimehuyav ha-metsiut ve'eykhut sidur ha-devarim mimenu vehidush ha'olam\" (\"A Treatise as to (1) Necessary Existence (2) The Procedure of Things from the Necessary Existence and (3) The Creation of the World\").\n\nJacob ben Abba Mari ben Simson Anatoli is generally regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonidean Rationalism to the study of Jewish texts. He was the son-in-law of Samuel ibn Tibbon, translator of Maimonides. Due to these family ties Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides, the study of which was such a great revelation to him that he, in later days, referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures, while he frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him. Anatoli wrote the \"Malmad\" exhibiting his broad knowledge of classic Jewish exegetes, as well as Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the non-Jewish branches of learning. To Anatoli all men are, in truth, formed in the image of God, though the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election—\"the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness\"\n\nFirstly, Hillel ben Samuel's importance in the history of medieval Jewish philosophy lies in his attempt to deal, systematically, with the question of the immortality of the soul. Secondly, Hillel played a major role in the controversies of 1289–90 concerning the philosophical works of Maimonides. Thirdly, Hillel was the first devotee of Jewish learning and Philosophy in Italy, bringing a close to a period of relative ignorance of Hakira in Verona (Italy). And finally, Hillel is one of the early Latin translators of \"the wise men of the nations\" (non-Jewish scholars).\n\nDefending Maimonides, Hillel addressed a letter to his friend Maestro Gaio asking him to use his influence with the Jews of Rome against Maimonides' opponents (Solomon Petit). He also advanced the bold idea of gathering together Maimonides' defenders and opponents in Alexandria, in order to bring the controversy before a court of Babylonian rabbis, whose decision would be binding on both factions. Hillel was certain the verdict would favor Maimonides.\n\nHillel wrote a commentary on the 25 propositions appearing at the beginning of the second part of the Guide of the Perplexed, and three philosophical treatises, which were appended to Tagmulei ha-Nefesh: the first on knowledge and free will; the second on the question of why mortality resulted from the sin of Adam; the third on whether or not the belief in the fallen angels is a true belief.\n\nShem-Tov ibn Falaquera was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued reconciliation between Jewish dogma and philosophy. Scholars speculate he was a student of Rabbi David Kimhi whose family fled Spain to Narbonne. Ibn Falaquera lived an ascetic live of solitude. Ibn Falaquera's two leading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides. Ibn Falaquera defended the \"Guide for the Perplexed\" against attacks of anti-Maimonideans. He knew the works of the Islamic philosophers better than any Jewish scholar of his time, and made many of them available to other Jewish scholars – often without attribution (\"Reshit Hokhmah\"). Ibn Falaquera did not hesitate to modify Islamic philosophic texts when it suited his purposes. For example, Ibn Falaquera turned Alfarabi's account of the origin of philosophic religion into a discussion of the origin of the \"virtuous city\". Ibn Falaquera's other works include, but are not limited to Iggeret Hanhagat ha-Guf we ha-Nefesh, a treatise in verse on the control of the body and the soul.\n\n\nIbn Kaspi was a fierce advocate of Maimonides to such an extent that he left for Egypt in 1314 in order to hear explanations on the latter's Guide of the Perplexed from Maimonides' grandchildren. When he heard that the Guide of the Perplexed was being studied in the Muslim philosophical schools of Fez, he left for that town (in 1332) in order to observe their method of study.\n\nIbn Kaspi began writing when he was 17 years old on topics which included logic, linguistics, ethics, theology, biblical exegesis, and super-commentaries to Abraham Ibn Ezra and Maimonides. Philosophic system he followed Aristotle and Averroes. He defines his aim as \"not to be a fool who believes in everything, but only in that which can be verified by proof...and not to be of the second unthinking category which disbelieves from the start of its inquiry,\" since \"certain things must be accepted by tradition, because they cannot be proven.\" Scholars continue to debate whether ibn Kaspi was a heretic or one of Judaisms most illustrious scholars.\n\nRabbi Levi ben Gershon was a student of his father Gerson ben Solomon of Arles, who in turn was a student of Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera. Gersonides is best known for his work \"Milhamot HaShem\" (\"Wars of the Lord\"). \"Milhamot HaShem\" is modelled after the \"Guide for the Perplexed\". Gersonides and his father were avid students of the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias, Aristotle, Empedocles, Galen, Hippocrates, Homer, Plato, Ptolemy, Pythagoras, Themistius, Theophrastus, Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi, Ali ibn Ridwan, Averroes, Avicenna, Qusta ibn Luqa, Al-Farabi, Al-Fergani, Chonain, Isaac Israeli, Ibn Tufail, Ibn Zuhr, Isaac Alfasi, and Maimonides. Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts. \"Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God's foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom, suggests that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual. God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make.\"\n\nMoses ben Joshua composed commentaries on Islamic philosophical works. As an admirer of Averroes; he devoted a great deal of study to his works and wrote commentaries on a number of them. His best-known work is his \"Shelemut ha-Nefesh\" (\"Treatise on the Perfection of the Soul\"). Moses began studying philosophy with his father when he was thirteen later studying with Moses ben David Caslari and Abraham ben David Caslari - both of whom were students of Kalonymus ben Kalonymus. Moses believed that Judaism was a guide to the highest degree of theoretical and moral truth. He believed that the Torah had both a simple, direct meaning accessible to the average reader as well as a deeper, metaphysical meaning accessible to thinkers. Moses rejected the belief in miracles, instead believing they could be explained, and defended man's free will by philosophical arguments.\n\nIsaac ben Sheshet Perfet, of Barcelona, studied under Hasdai Crescas and Rabbi Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi. Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi, was a steadfast Rationalist who did not hesitate to refute leading authorities, such as Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, Moses ben Nahman, and Solomon ben Adret. The pogroms of 1391, against Jews of Spain, forced Isaac to flee to Algiers - where he lived out his life. Isaac's responsa evidence a profound knowledge of the philosophical writings of his time; in one of Responsa No. 118 he explains the difference between the opinion of \"Gersonides\" and that of \"Abraham ben David of Posquières\" on free will, and gives his own views on the subject. He was an adversary of Kabbalah who never spoke of the Sefirot; he quotes another philosopher when reproaching kabbalists with \"\"believing in the \"Ten\" (Sefirot) as the Christians believe in the Trinity\"\".\n\nHasdai Crescas, of Barcelona, was a leading rationalist on issues of natural law and free-will. His views can be seen as precursors to Baruch Spinoza. His work, \"Or Adonai\", became a classic refutation of medieval Aristotelism, and harbinger of the scientific revolution in the 16th century. Hasdai Crescas was a student of Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi, who in turn was a student of Reuben ben Nissim Gerondi. Crescas was not a Rabbi, yet he was active as a teacher. Among his fellow students and friends, his best friend was Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet. Cresca's students won accolades as participants in the Disputation of Tortosa.\n\nInfluenced by the teaching of Rabbi Nissim of Gerona, via Ephraim Vidal's Yeshiva in Majorca, Duran's commentary \"Magen Avot\" (\"The Shield of the Fathers\"), which influenced Joseph Albo, is important. He was also a student of philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and especially of medicine, which he practiced for a number of years at Palma, in Majorca. \"Magen Avot\" deals with concepts such as the nature of God, the eternity of the Torah, the coming of the Messiah, and the Resurrection of the dead. Duran believed that Judaism has three dogmas only: the existence of God, the Torah's Divine origin, and Reward and Punishment; in this regard he was followed by Joseph Albo.\n\nJoseph Albo, of Monreal, was a student of Hasdai Crescas. He wrote \"Sefer ha-Ikkarim\" (\"Book of Principles\"), a classic work on the fundamentals of Judaism. Albo narrows the fundamental Jewish principles of faith from thirteen to three -\nAlbo rejects the assumption that creation ex nihilo is essential in belief in God. Albo freely criticizes Maimonides' thirteen principles of belief and Crescas' six principles. According to Albo, \"belief in the Messiah is only a 'twig' unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk\"; not essential to Judaism. Nor is it true, according to Albo, that every law is binding. Though every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, it is not true that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned. Contemporary Orthodox Jews, however, vehemently disagree with Albo's position believing that all Jews are divinely obligated to fulfill every applicable commandment.\n\nHoter ben Shlomo was a scholar and philosopher in Yemen heavily influenced by Nethanel ben al-Fayyumi, Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and al-Ghazali. The connection between the \"Epistle of the Brethren of Purity\" and Ismailism suggests the adoption of this work as one of the main sources of what would become known as \"Jewish Ismailism\" as found in Late Medieval Yemenite Judaism. \"Jewish Ismailism\" consisted of adapting, to Judaism, a few Ismaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy, and hermeneutics. There are many examples of the Brethren of Purity influencing Yemenite Jewish philosophers and authors in the period 1150–1550. Some traces of Brethren of Purity doctrines, as well as of their numerology, are found in two Yemenite philosophical midrashim written in 1420–1430: \"Midrash ha-hefez\" (\"The Glad Learning\") by Zerahyah ha-Rofé (a/k/a Yahya al-Tabib) and the \"Siraj al-'uqul\" (\"Lamp of Intellects\") by Hoter ben Solomon.\n\nIsaac Abravanel, statesman, philosopher, Bible commentator, and financier who commented on Maimonides' thirteen principles in his \"Rosh Amanah\". Isaac Abravanel was steeped in Rationalism by the Ibn Yahya family, who had a residence immediately adjacent to the \"Great Synagogue of Lisbon\" (also built by the Ibn Yahya Family). His most important work, \"Rosh Amanah\" (\"The Pinnacle of Faith\"), defends Maimonides' thirteen articles of belief against attacks of Hasdai Crescas and Yosef Albo. \"Rosh Amanah\" ends with the statement that \"Maimonides compiled these articles merely in accordance with the fashion of other nations, which set up axioms or fundamental principles for their science\".\n\nIsaac Abravanel was born and raised in Lisbon; a student of the Rabbi of Lisbon, \"Yosef ben Shlomo Ibn Yahya\". Rabbi Yosef was a poet, religious scholar, rebuilder of \"Ibn Yahya Synagogue of Calatayud\", well versed in rabbinic literature and in the learning of his time, devoting his early years to the study of Jewish philosophy. The Ibn Yahya family were renowned physicians, philosophers and accomplished aides to the Portuguese Monarchy for centuries.\n\nIsaac's grandfather, Samuel Abravanel, was forcibly converted to Christianity during the pogroms of 1391 and took the Spanish name \"Juan Sanchez de Sevilla\". Samuel fled Castile-León, Spain, in 1397 for Lisbon, Portugal, and reverted to Judaism - shedding his \"Converso\" after living among Christians for six years. Conversions outside Judaism, coerced or otherwise, had a strong impact upon young Isaac, later compelling him to forfeit his immense wealth in an attempt to redeem Iberian Jewry from coercion of the Alhambra Decree. There are parallels between what he writes, and documents produced by Inquisitors, that present conversos as ambivalent to Christianity and sometimes even ironic in their expressions regarding their new religion - crypto-jews.\n\nJudah Leon Abravanel was Portuguese physician, poet and philosopher. His work \"Dialoghi d'amore\" (\"Dialogues of Love\"), written in Italian, was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. In an attempt to circumvent a plot, hatched by local Catholic Bishops to kidnap his son, Judah sent his son from Castile, to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized. This was a devastating insult to Judah and his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah's life and the topic of his writings years later; especially since this was not the first time the Abravanel Family was subjected to such embarrassment at the hands of the Catholic Church.\n\nJudah's \"Dialoghi\" is regarded as the finest of Humanistic Period works. His neoplatonism is derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of Ibn Gabirol. Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of his work. In \"Dialoghi d'amore\", Judah defines love in philosophical terms. He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract \"characters\": Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, Philo+Sophia (philosophia).\n\nThe word \"Kabbalah\" was used in medieval Jewish texts to mean \"tradition\", see Abraham Ibn Daud's \"Sefer Ha-Qabbalah\" also known as the \"Book of our Tradition\". \"Book of our Tradition\" does not refer to mysticism of any kind - it chronicles \"our tradition of scholarship and study\" in two Babylonian Academies, through the Geonim, into Talmudic Yeshivas of Spain. In Talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in Judaism, known as \"Maaseh Bereshith\" (the work of creation) and \"Maaseh Merkavah\" (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these texts as referring to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah.\n\nIn the 13th century, however, a mystical-esoteric system emerged which became known as \"the Kabbalah.\" Many of the beliefs associated with Kabbalah had long been rejected by philosophers. Saadia Gaon had taught in his book \"Emunot v'Deot\" that Jews who believe in gilgul have adopted a non-Jewish belief. Maimonides rejected many texts of \"Heichalot\", particularly \"Shi'ur Qomah\" whose anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.\n\nIn the 13th century, *Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in \"Milhhemet Mitzvah\") against early Kabbalists, singled out \"Sefer Bahir\", rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the tanna R. Nehhunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content as follow -\n\n\nSome of the Monarchies of Asia Minor and European welcomed expelled Jewish Merchants, scholars and theologians. Divergent Jewish philosophies evolved against the backdrop of new cultures, new languages and renewed theological exchange. Philosophic exploration continued through the Renaissance period as the center-of-mass of Jewish Scholarship shifted to France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey.\n\nElia del Medigo was a descendant of \"Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz\" and \"Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz\". Eli'ezer del Medigo, of Rome, received the surname \"Del Medigo\" after studying Medicine. The name was later changed from \"Del Medigo\" to \"Ha-rofeh\". He was the father and teacher of a long line of rationalist philosophers and scholars. Non-Jewish students of Delmedigo classified him as an \"Averroist\", however, he saw himself as a follower of Maimonides. Scholastic association of Maimonides and Ibn Rushd would have been a natural one; Maimonides, towards the end of his life, was impressed with the Ibn Rushd commentaries and recommended them to his students. The followers of Maimonides (Maimonideans) had therefore been, for several generations before Delmedigo, the leading users, translators and disseminators of the works of Ibn Rushd in Jewish circles, and advocates for Ibn Rushd even after Islamic rejection of his radical views. Maimonideans regarded Maimonides and Ibn Rushd as following the same general line. In his book, Delmedigo portrays himself as defender of Maimonidean Judaism, and — like many Maimonideans — he emphasized the rationality of Jewish tradition.\nMoses Almosnino was born Thessaloniki 1515 - died Constantinople abt 1580. He was a student of Levi Ibn Habib, who was in turn a student of Jacob ibn Habib, who was, in turn, a student of Nissim ben Reuben.\nIn 1570 he wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch titled \"\"Yede Mosheh\" (The Hands of Moses); also an exposition of the Talmudical treatise \"Abot\" (Ethics of the Fathers), published in Salonica in 1563; and a collection of sermons delivered upon various occasions, particularly funeral orations, entitled \"Meammeẓ Koaḥ\"\" (Re-enforcing Strength).\n\nal-Ghazâlî's Intentions of the Philosophers (De'ôt ha-Fîlôsôfîm or Kavvanôt ha-Fîlôsôfîm) was one of the most widespread philosophical texts studied among Jews in Europe having been translated in 1292 by Isaac Albalag. Later Hebrew commentators include Moses Narboni, and Moses Almosnino.\n\nMoses ben Jehiel Ha-Kohen Porto-Rafa (Rapaport), was a member of the German family \"Rafa\" (from whom the Delmedigo family originates) that settled in the town of Porto in the vicinity of Verona, Italy, and became the progenitors of the renowned Rapaport Rabbinic family. In 1602 Moses served as rabbi of Badia Polesine in Piedmont. Moses was a friend of Leon Modena.\n\nAbraham ben Judah ha-Levi Minz was an Italian rabbi who flourished at Padua in the first half of the 16th century, father-in-law of Meïr Katzenellenbogen. Minz studied chiefly under his father, Judah Minz, whom he succeeded as rabbi and head of the yeshiva of Padua.\n\nMeir ben Isaac Katzellenbogen was born in Prague where together with Shalom Shachna he studied under Jacob Pollak. Many rabbis, including Moses Isserles, addressed him in their responsa as the \"av bet din of the republic of Venice.\" The great scholars of the Renaissance with whom he corresponded include \"Shmuel ben Moshe di Modena\", \"Joseph Katz\", \"Solomon Luria\", \"Moses Isserles\", \"Obadiah Sforno\", and \"Moses Alashkar\".\nRabbi Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm was a student of Rabbi Solomon Luria who was, in turn a student of Rabbi Shalom Shachna - father-in-law and teacher of Moses Isserles. Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm was also a cousin of Moses Isserles.\n\nRabbi Eliezer ben Elijah Ashkenazi Ha-rofeh Ashkenazi of Nicosia (\"the physician\") the author of \"Yosif Lekah\" on the Book of Esther.\n\n\nWith expulsion from Spain came the dissemination of Jewish philosophical investigation throughout the Mediterranean Basin, Northern Europe and the Western Hemisphere. The center-of-mass of Rationalism shifted to France, Italy, Germany, Crete, Sicily and Netherlands. Expulsion from Spain and the coordinated pogroms of Europe resulted in the cross-pollination of variations on Rationalism incubated within diverse communities. This period is also marked by the intellectual exchange among leaders of the Christian Reformation and Jewish scholars. Of particular note is the line of Rationalists who migrated out of Germany, and present-day Italy into Crete, and other areas of the Ottoman Empire seeking safety and protection from the endless pogroms fomented by the House of Habsburg and the Roman Catholic Church against Jews.\n\nRationalism was incubating in places far from Spain. From stories told by Rabbi Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm, German-speaking Jews, descendants of Jews who migrated back to Jerusalem after Charlemagne's invitation was revoked in Germany many centuries earlier, who lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century, were influenced by prevailing Mutazilite scholars of Jerusalem. A German-speaking Palestinian Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed \"Dolberger\". When the knights of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued German-speaking Jews in Palestine and brought them back to the safety of Worms, Germany, to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.\n\nAll of the foregoing resulted in an explosion of new ideas and philosophic paths.\n\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo was a physician and teacher – Baruch Spinoza was a student of his works.\n\nBaruch Spinoza founded Spinozism, broke with Rabbinic Jewish tradition, and was placed in \"herem\" by the Beit Din of Amsterdam. The influence in his work from Maimonides and Leone Ebreo is evident. Elia del Medigo claims to be a student of the works of Spinoza. Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, \"Der Spinozismus im Judenthum\") claimed to detect the influence of the Kabbalah, while others (e.g., Leibniz) regarded Spinozism as a revival of Averroism – a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism. In the centuries that have lapsed since the \"herem\" declaration, scholars have re-examined the works of Spinoza and find them to reflect a body of work and thinking that is not unlike some contemporary streams of Judaism. For instance, while Spinoza was accused of pantheism, scholars have come to view his work as advocating panentheism, a valid contemporary view easily accommodated by contemporary Judaism.\n\nRabbi Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi was a student of his father, but most notably also a student of his grandfather Rabbi Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm.\n\nRabbi Jacob Emden was a student of his father Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi a Rabbi in Amsterdam. Emden, a steadfast Talmudist, was a prominent opponent of the Sabbateans (Messianic Kabbalists who followed Sabbatai Tzvi). Though anti-Maimonidean, Emden should be noted for his critical examination of the Zohar concluding that large parts of it were forged.\n\n\nRabbi Leone di Modena wrote that if we were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be compatible with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the Kabbalistic doctrine of the Sefirot.\n\nA new era began in the 18th century with the thought of Moses Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn has been described as the \"'third Moses,' with whom begins a new era in Judaism,\" just as new eras began with Moses the prophet and with Moses Maimonides. Mendelssohn was a German Jewish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews, Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment) is indebted. He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, though Reform spokesmen have been \"resistant to claim him as their spiritual father\". Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Germans and Jews. His most significant book was \"Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum\" (\"Jerusalem\"), first published in 1783.\n\nAlongside Mendelssohn, other important Jewish philosophers of the eighteenth century included:\n\nImportant Jewish philosophers of the nineteenth century included:\n\nHaredi traditionalists who emerged in reaction to the Haskalah considered the fusion of religion and philosophy as difficult because classical philosophers start with no preconditions for which conclusions they must reach in their investigation, while classical religious believers have a set of religious principles of faith that they hold one must believe. Most Haredim contended that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of a revealed religion. In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, for example, viewed all philosophy as untrue and heretical. In this he represents one strand of Hasidic thought, with creative emphasis on the emotions.\n\nOther exponents of Hasidism had a more positive attitude towards philosophy. In the Chabad writings of Schneur Zalman of Liadi, Hasidut is seen as able to unite all parts of Torah thought, from the schools of philosophy to mysticism, by uncovering the illuminating Divine essence that permeates and transcends all approaches. Interpreting the verse from Job, \"from my flesh I see HaShem\", Shneur Zalman explained the inner meaning, or \"soul\", of the Jewish mystical tradition in intellectual form, by means of analogies drawn from the human realm. As explained and continued by the later leaders of Chabad, this enabled the human mind to grasp concepts of Godliness, and so enable the heart to feel the love and awe of God, emphasised by all the founders of hasidism, in an internal way. This development, the culminating level of the Jewish mystical tradition, in this way bridges philosophy and mysticism, by expressing the transcendent in human terms.\n\nOne of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through existentialism. Among the early Jewish existentialist philosophers was Lev Shestov (Jehuda Leib Schwarzmann), a Russian-Jewish philosopher. One of the most influential Jewish existentialists in the first half of the 20th century was Franz Rosenzweig. While researching his doctoral dissertation on the 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Rosenzweig reacted against Hegel's idealism and developed an existential approach. Rosenzweig, for a time, considered conversion to Christianity, but in 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. He became a philosopher and student of Hermann Cohen. Rozensweig's major work, \"Star of Redemption\", is his new philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between haShem, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. Orthodox rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and Conservative rabbis Neil Gillman and Elliot N. Dorff have also been described as existentialists.\n\nThe French philosopher and Talmudic commentator Emmanuel Levinas, whose approach grew out of the phenomenological tradition in philosophy, has also been described as a Jewish existentialist.\n\nRationalism has re-emerged as a popular perspective among Jews. Contemporary Jewish rationalism often draws on ideas associated with medieval philosophers such as Maimonides and modern Jewish rationalists such as Hermann Cohen.\n\nCohen was a German Jewish neo-Kantian philosopher who turned to Jewish subjects at the end of his career in the early 20th century, picking up on ideas of Maimonides. In America, Steven Schwarzschild continued Cohen's legacy. Another prominent contemporary Jewish rationalist is Lenn Goodman, who works out of the traditions of medieval Jewish rationalist philosophy. Conservative rabbis Alan Mittleman of the Jewish Theological Seminary and Elliot N. Dorff of American Jewish University also see themselves in the rationalist tradition, as does David Novak of the University of Toronto. Novak works in the natural law tradition, which is one version of rationalism.\n\nPhilosophers in modern-day Israel in the rationalist tradition include David Hartman and Moshe Halbertal.\nSome Orthodox rationalists in Israel take a \"restorationist\" approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify Rabbinic Judaism and bring all Jews, regardless of status or stream of Judaism, closer to observance of Halacha, Mitzvot, Kashrut and embrace of Maimonides' \"13 Principles of Faith\". Dor Daim, and Rambamists are two groups who reject mysticism as a \"superstitious innovation\" to an otherwise clear and succinct set of Laws and rules. According to these rationalists, there is shame and disgrace attached to failure to investigate matters of religious principle using the fullest powers of human reason and intellect. One cannot be considered wise, or perceptive, if one does not attempt to understand the origins, and establish the correctness, of one's beliefs.\n\nJudaism has traditionally taught that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Yet, these claims are in jarring contrast with the fact that there is much evil in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is \"how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?\" or \"how can there be good without bad?\" \"how can there be a God without a devil?\" This is the problem of evil. Within all monotheistic faiths many answers (theodicies) have been proposed. However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the Holocaust, many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust? This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on Holocaust theology.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan. His theology was a variant of John Dewey's pragmatist philosophy. Dewey's naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional Judaism. In agreement with the classical medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that haShem is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of haShem are, at best, imperfect metaphors. Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that haShem is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled. Kaplan wrote that \"to believe in haShem means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society.\"\n\nA recent trend has been to reframe Jewish theology through the lens of process philosophy, more specifically process theology. Process philosophy suggests that fundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience. According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions of these occasions of experience. Occasions of experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping of many smaller occasions of experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because \"mind\" is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.\n\nIntrinsic to this worldview is the notion that all experiences are influenced by prior experiences, and will influence all future experiences. This process of influencing is never deterministic; an occasion of experience consists of a process of comprehending other experiences, and then reacting to it. This is the \"process\" in \"process philosophy\". Process philosophy gives God a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them; thus process philosophy is a form of panentheism.\n\nThe original ideas of process theology were developed by Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000), and influenced a number of Jewish theologians, including British philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859–1938), and Rabbis Max Kadushin, Milton Steinberg and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky, and Bradley Shavit Artson. Abraham Joshua Heschel has also been linked to this tradition.\n\nKabbalah continued to be central to Haredi Orthodox Judaism, which generally rejected philosophy, although the Chabad strain of Chasidism showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in Kabbalah. In academic studies, Gershom Scholem began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations, Jewish Renewal and Neo-Hasidism, spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah is a collection of esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.\n\nAmong modern the modern critics of Kabbalah was Yihhyah Qafahh, who wrote a book entitled \"Milhamoth ha-Shem\", (\"Wars of the Name\") against what he perceived as the false teachings of the Zohar and the false Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. He is credited with spearheading the Dor Daim. Yeshayahu Leibowitz publicly shared the views expressed in Rabbi Yihhyah Qafahh's book \"Milhhamoth ha-Shem\" and elaborated upon these views in his many writings.\n\n\n\n\nIn the twentieth and twenty-first centuries there have also been many philosophers who are Jewish or of Jewish descent, and whose Jewish background might influence their approach to some degree, but whose writing is not necessarily focused on issues specific to Judaism. These include:\n\n\nOnline\n\nPrint Sources\n\n"}

These strikes are generally not violent, and will often relieve muscle cramps for the individual being struck. They sound like a loud whack and can terrify newcomers, but they \"are not particularly painful\". In the Rinzai school, the jikijitsu may strike a student without a student's request if they feel the student has gone astray.

Karl Popper, the prominent philosopher of science, claimed \"Woodger... influenced and stimulated the evolution of the philosophy of science in Britain and in the United States as hardly anybody else\".\n\nJoseph Woodger was born at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, and studied at University College London from 1911 until 1922, except for a period serving in the First World War. He then became a reader at the University of London Middlesex Hospital Medical School. He became a professor there in 1947, and eventually retired in 1959 as emeritus professor of biology. He was a member of the Theoretical Biology Club along with Joseph Needham, Conrad Hal Waddington, John Desmond Bernal, and Dorothy Wrinch. Karl Popper described the club as \"one of the most interesting study circles in the field of the philosophy of science.\"\n\nWoodger was known to friends and family as \"Socrates\", and with his wife Eden (born Buckle) he lived at Epsom in Surrey, where they had four children. His eldest child was Mike Woodger (born 1923), a computer pioneer who worked with Alan Turing at the National Physical Laboratory, leading to the early Pilot ACE computer. He died in 1981.\n\nWoodger led the introduction of positivist philosophy of science into biology with his 1929 book \"Biological Principles\", for which he has been roundly if unfairly criticised. He saw a mature science as being characterised by a framework of hypotheses which could be verified by facts established by experiments. He criticised the traditional natural history style of biology, including the study of evolution, as immature science, since it relied on narrative.\n\nFor example, he wrote \"Admittedly, some hypotheses have become so well established that no one doubts them. But this does not mean that they are known to be true. We cannot determine the truth of a hypothesis by counting the number of people who believe it, and a hypothesis does not cease to be a hypothesis when a lot of people believe it.\"\n\nWoodger set out to play for biology the role of Robert Boyle's \"Sceptical Chymist\", intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the Vienna Circle of logical positivists like Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap, to reduce biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist J. B. S. Haldane to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and helped to bring about the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, combining genetics, evolution, ecology and other disciplines.\n\n\n"}

It was during this period that he discovered philosophy, through Plato (which weaned him from his interest in Practical Psychology) and Bertrand Russell. he gained a place at the University of Ghana, Legon. After graduating in 1958, he went to University College, Oxford to read for the B.Phil..\n\nAt Oxford Wiredu was taught by Gilbert Ryle (his thesis supervisor), Peter Strawson (his College tutor), and Stuart Hampshire (his special tutor), and wrote a thesis on \"Knowledge, Truth, and Reason\". Upon graduating in 1960 he was appointed to a teaching post at the University College of North Staffordshire (now the University of Keele), where he stayed for a year. He returned to Ghana, where he accepted a post teaching philosophy for his old university. He remained at the University of Ghana for twenty-three years, during which time he became first Head of Department and then Professor. In 1987, he held a professorship at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nWiredu has held a number of visiting professorships:\n\nHe was a member of the Committee of Directors of the International Federation of Philosophical Societies from 1983 to 1998. He has also been a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (1985) and the National Humanities Center, North Carolina (1986).\n\nHe is Vice-President of the Inter-African Council for Philosophy.\n\nOne of Wiredu's concerns when defining \"African Philosophy\" is keeping colonialised African philosophy in a separate category from precolonised Africa. Wiredu (1998) proposes that the African philosopher has a unique opportunity to re-examine many of the assumptions of Western philosophers by subjecting them to an interrogation based on African languages. Let's say hypothetically an African was born and raised in China. Their thoughts and philosophy will be biased to the culture of the language. Not only will they naturally philosophise in that language, but also shape their life around that language.\n\nWiredu opposes the ethnophilosophical\" and \"philosophical sagacity\" approaches to African philosophy, arguing that all cultures have their distinctive folk-beliefs and world-views, but that these must be distinguished from the practice of philosophising. It is not that \"folk philosophy\" cannot play a part in genuine philosophy; on the contrary, he has acknowledged his own debt to his own (Akan) culture's history of thought. Rather, he argues that genuine philosophy demands the application to such thought of critical analysis and rigorous argument.\n\nOne of Wiredu's most prominent discussions revolves around the Akan concept of personhood. He believes this traditional framework hosts a two part conception of a person. First, and most intuitive to Western conceptions of persons, is the ontological dimension. This includes one's biological constitution. Further, Wiredu states that the second dimension, the normative conception of personhood, is based on one's ability to will freely. One's ability to will freely is dependent on one's ethical considerations. One can be said to have free will if one has a high regard to ethical responsibilities. This then designates a person to become a person. One is not born a person but becomes one through events and experiences that lead one to act ethically. This differs from the Western conception of personhood in that people, in traditional Akan thought, are not born as willed beings. Wiredu also is certain that African tradition is not \"purely theoretical because he shows how certain aspects of African political thought may be applied to the practical resolution of some of Africa's most pressing problems.\"\n\nHis influences include, apart from his tutors at Oxford, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant, and the pragmatist John Dewey, and the epistemological, metaphysical, and ethical resources of the Akan culture. The result is philosophy that is at once universally relevant and essentially African.\n\nWiredu, in his work, has enlightened many people on the philosophy and religion of Africa. Not only does he summarise and outline their beliefs in many of his works but he also challenges outsiders predispositions to African beliefs. He wants to shed light and understanding to their belief systems and what they believe to be true and physical. He expresses his thoughts and ideas in The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion on African Religions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

When asserted in litigation, it is an equity defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy. The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has \"slept on its rights\", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed, witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc., such that it is no longer a just resolution to grant the plaintiff's claim. Laches is associated with the maxim of equity, \"Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping ones [that is, those who sleep on their rights].\" Put another way, failure to assert one’s rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches.\n\nLaches is a legal term derived from the Old French \"laschesse,\" meaning \"remissness\" or \"dilatoriness,\" and is viewed as the opposite of \"vigilance.\" The United States Supreme Court case \"Costello v.

Invoking laches is a reference to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, in particular with regard to equity, and so is an \"unreasonable delay pursuing a right or claim, in a way that prejudices the [opposing] party\". When asserted in litigation, it is an equitable defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy. The essential element of \"laches\" is an unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in bringing the claim; because laches is an equitable defense, it is ordinarily applied only to claims for equitable relief (such as injunctions), and not to claims for legal relief (such as damages). The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has \"slept on its rights\", and that, as a result of this delay, witnesses and/or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, and circumstances have changed such that it is no longer just to grant the plaintiff's original claim; hence, laches is associated with the maxim of equity: \"Vigilantibus non dormientibus æquitas subvenit\" (\"Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping ones [that is, those who sleep on their rights]\"). Put another way, failure to assert one’s rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches. Sometimes courts will also require that the party invoking the doctrine has changed its position as a result of the delay, but that requirement is more typical of the related (but more stringent) defense and equally cause of action of estoppel.\n\nA claim of laches requires the following components:(1) a delay in bringing the action, (2) a delay that is unreasonable and (3) that prejudices the defendant.\n\nThe period of delay begins when the plaintiff knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that the cause of action existed; the period of delay ends only when the legal action is formally filed. Informing or warning the defendant of the cause of action (for example by sending a cease-and-desist letter or merely \"threatening\" a lawsuit) does \"not\", by itself, end the period of delay.\n\nTo invoke laches the delay by the opposing party in initiating the lawsuit must be unreasonable. The courts have recognized the following causes of delay as reasonable:\n\nBy contrast, it is \"not\" reasonable to delay a lawsuit to \"capitalize on the value of the infringer's labor\". In \"Danjaq v. Sony\", the Ninth Circuit decided that a screenwriter who waited for a film studio to publicize and distribute a film based on a script he allegedly owned had delayed his lawsuit unreasonably.\n\nUnreasonable delay must prejudice the defendant. Examples of such prejudice include:\nUnreasonable delay may also prejudice the rights of third-parties who were unknown in the case, earlier but whose rights got created in the intervening period of the delay (e.g.: the defendant inducts new persons on a disputed property by sale, or by lease)\n\nA defense lawyer raising the defense of \"laches\" against a motion for injunctive relief (a form of equitable relief) might argue that the plaintiff comes \"waltzing in at the eleventh hour\" when it is now too late to grant the relief sought, at least not without causing great harm that the plaintiff could have avoided. In certain types of cases (for example, cases involving time-sensitive matters, such as elections), a delay of even a few days is likely to be met with a defense of \"laches\", even where the applicable statute of limitations might allow the type of action to be commenced within a much longer time period. In courts in the United States, laches has often been applied even where a statute of limitations exists, although there is a division of authority on this point.\n\nIf a court does accept the laches defense, it can decide either to deny the request for equitable relief or to narrow the equitable relief that it would otherwise give. Even if the court denies equitable relief to a plaintiff because of laches, the plaintiff may still have a claim for legal relief if the statute of limitations has not run out.\n\nUnder the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"laches\" is an affirmative defense, which means that the burden of asserting \"laches\" is on the party responding to the claim to which it applies.\n\nThe \"laches\" defense does not apply if the claimant was a minor during the time that the claim was not brought, so a party can bring a claim against an historical injustice when they reach their majority.\n\nThe defense of \"laches\" resembles a statute of limitations since both are concerned with ensuring that plaintiffs bring their claims in a timely fashion.\n\nHowever, a statute of limitations is concerned only with the time that has passed. Laches is concerned with the reasonableness of the delay in a particular situation and so is more case-specific and more focused on the equitable conduct of the plaintiff. Those considerations are not unique to the laches defense because they are characteristic of equitable reasoning and equitable remedies. Whereas, limitation is a statutory remedy.\n\nIn the US, the proper disposal of claims in light of those two areas of law has required attention through to the Supreme Court. In \"Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" (2014), the US Supreme Court rebuffed a defendant's claim that laches barred a copyright infringement suit because Congress had established a detailed statutory scheme, including a statute of limitations.\n\nIn the Virginia Republican primary for the 2012 US presidential election, several candidates did not appear on the ballot because they failed to obtain sufficient petition signatures in time; four of the unsuccessful candidates—Rick Perry, Jon Huntsman, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum—sued, claiming that restrictions on the persons allowed to gather signatures were unconstitutional. Their claim was dismissed by the district court on the grounds of laches, because, in the words of the appellate court: The appeals court upheld the dismissal on grounds of laches, but it added that the challenge would likely have succeeded if it had been brought in a timely fashion.\n\nIn Grand Haven, Michigan, the Northwest Ottawa Community Health System sued Grand Haven Township and Health Pointe, which was in the process of building a competing medical facility in the township, arguing that the township ignored its own zoning ordinance in approving the project. On March 24, 2017, as part of the ruling dismissing the lawsuit, Circuit Court Judge Jon A. Van Allsburg noted that the Northwest Ottawa Community Health System delayed more than eight months from the date the project was approved before filing the lawsuit and that during that time, plaintiff Health Pointe had purchased construction materials. Therefore, the doctrine of laches invalidated a lawsuit that was filed so long after the fact.\n\n\n"}

Put another way, an outcome is not Pareto efficient if there is a way to improve at least one person's situation without harming anyone else.\n\nFor example, suppose a mother has ten dollars which she intends to give to her two children Carlos and Shannon. Suppose the children each want only money, and they do not get jealous of one another. The following distributions are Pareto efficient:\n\nBut a distribution that gives each of them $2 and where the mother wastes the remaining $6 is not Pareto efficient, because she could have given the wasted money to either child and made that child better off without harming the other.\n\nIn this example, it was presumed that a child was made better or worse off by gaining or losing money, respectively, and that neither child gained or lost by evaluating her share in comparison to the other. To be more precise, we must evaluate all possible preferences that the child might have and consider a situation as Pareto efficient if there is no other social state that at least one person favors (or prefers) and no one disfavors.\n\nPareto efficiency is often used in economics as a minimal sense of economic efficiency. If a mechanism does not result in Pareto efficient outcomes, it is regarded as inefficient since there was another outcome which could have made some people better off without harming anyone else.\n\nThe view that markets produce Pareto efficient outcomes is regarded as an important and central justification for capitalism. This result was established (with certain assumptions) in an area of study known as general equilibrium theory, and is known as the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics. As a result, these results often feature prominently in libertarian justifications of unregulated markets.\n\nSen's original example used a simple society with only two people and only one social issue to consider. The two members of society are named \"Lewd\" and \"Prude\". In this society there is a copy of a \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" and it must be given either to Lewd to read, to Prude to read, or disposed of unread. Suppose that Lewd enjoys this sort of reading and would prefer to read it himself rather than have it disposed of. However, he would get even more enjoyment out of Prude being forced to read it.\n\nPrude thinks that the book is indecent and that it should be disposed of unread. However, if someone must read it Prude would prefer that he, himself read it rather than Lewd since Prude thinks it would be even worse for someone to read and enjoy the book rather than read it in disgust.\n\nGiven these preferences of the two individuals in the society, a social planner must decide what to do. Should the planner force Lewd to read the book, force Prude to read the book, or let it go unread? More particularly, the social planner must rank all three possible outcomes in terms of their social desirability. The social planner decides that she should be committed to individual rights, each individual should get to choose whether he, himself will read the book. Lewd should get to decide whether the outcome \"Lewd reads\" will be ranked higher than \"No one reads\", and similarly Prude should get to decide whether the outcome \"Prude reads\" will be ranked higher than \"No one reads\".\n\nFollowing this strategy, the social planner declares that the outcome \"Lewd reads\" will be ranked higher than \"No one reads\" (because of Lewd's preferences) and that \"No one reads\" will be ranked higher than \"Prude reads\" (because of Prude's preferences). Consistency then requires that \"Lewd reads\" be ranked higher than \"Prude reads\", and so the social planner gives the book to Lewd to read.\n\nNotice that this outcome is regarded as worse than \"Prude reads\" by both Prude \"and\" Lewd, and the chosen outcome is therefore Pareto inferior to another available outcome—the one where Prude is forced to read the book.\n\nAnother example was provided by philosopher Allan Gibbard. Suppose there are two individuals Alice and Bob who live next door to each other. Alice loves the color blue and hates red. Bob loves the color green and hates yellow. If each were free to choose the color of their house independently of the other, they would choose their favorite colors. But Alice hates Bob with a passion, and she would gladly endure a red house if it meant that Bob would have to endure his house being yellow. Bob similarly hates Alice, and would gladly endure a yellow house if that meant that Alice would live in a red house.\n\nIf each individual is free to choose their own house color, independently of the other, Alice would choose a blue house and Bob would choose a green one. But, this outcome is not Pareto efficient, because both Alice and Bob would prefer the outcome where Alice's house is red and Bob's is yellow. As a result, giving each individual the freedom to choose their own house color has led to an inefficient outcome—one that is inferior to another outcome where neither is free to choose their own color.\n\nMathematically, we can represent Alice's preferences with this symbol: formula_1 and Bob's preferences with this one: formula_2. We can represent each outcome as a pair: (\"Color of Alice's house\", \"Color of Bob's house\"). As stated Alice's preferences are:\n\nAnd Bob's are:\n\nIf we allow free and independent choices of both parties we end up with the outcome (Blue, Green) which is dispreferred by both parties to the outcome (Red, Yellow) and is therefore not Pareto efficient.\n\nSuppose there is a society \"N\" consisting of two or more individuals and a set \"X\" of two or more social outcomes. (For example, in the Alice and Bob case, \"N\" consisted of Alice and Bob, and \"X\" consisted of the four color options ⟨Blue, Yellow⟩, ⟨Blue, Green⟩, ⟨Red, Yellow⟩, and ⟨Red, Green⟩.)\n\nSuppose each individual in the society has a total and transitive preference relation on the set of social outcomes \"X\". For notation, the preference relation of an individual \"i\"∊\"N\" is denoted by ≼. Each preference relation belongs to the set \"Rel(X)\" of all total and transitive relations on \"X\".\n\nA social choice function is a map which can take any configuration of preference relations of \"N\" as input and produce a subset of (\"chosen\") social outcomes as output. Formally, a social choice function is a map\n\nformula_9\nfrom the set of functions between \"N\"→\"Rel(X)\", to the power set of \"X\". (Intuitively, the social choice function represents a societal principle for choosing one or more social outcomes based on individuals' preferences. By representing the social choice process as a \"function\" on \"Rel(X)\", we are tacitly assuming that the social choice function is defined for any possible configuration of preference relations; this is sometimes called the Universal Domain assumption.)\nThe liberal paradox states that every social choice function satisfies \"at most one\" of the following properties, never both:\n\n\nIn other words, the liberal paradox states that for every social choice function \"F\", there is a configuration of preference relations \"p\"∊\"Rel(X)\" for which \"F\" violates either Pareto optimality or Minimal liberalism (or both). In the examples of Sen and Gibbard noted above, the social choice function satisfies minimal liberalism at the expense of Pareto optimality.\n\nBecause the paradox relies on very few conditions, there are a limited number of ways to escape the paradox. Essentially one must either reject the \"universal domain\" assumption, the \"Pareto principle\", or the \"minimal liberalism principle.\" Sen himself suggested two ways out, one a rejection of universal domain another a rejection of the Pareto principle.\n\nJulian Blau proves that Sen's paradox can only arise when individuals have \"nosy\" preferences—that is when their preference depends not only on their own action but also on others' actions. In the example of Alice and Bob above, Alice has a preference over how Bob paints his house, and Bob has a preference over Alice's house color as well.\n\nMost arguments which demonstrate market efficiency assume that individuals care about only their own consumption and not others' consumption and therefore do not consider the situations that give rise to Sen's paradox. In fact, this shows a strong relationship between Sen's paradox and the well known result that markets fail to produce Pareto outcomes in the presence of externalities. Externalities arise when the choices of one party affect another. Classic examples of externalities include pollution or over fishing. Because of their nosy preferences, Alice's choice imposes a negative externality on Bob and vice versa.\n\nTo prevent the paradox, Sen suggests that \"The ultimate guarantee for individual liberty may rest not on rules for social choice but on developing individual values that respect each other's personal choices.\" Doing so would amount to limiting certain types of nosy preferences, or alternatively restricting the application of the Pareto principle only to those situations where individuals fail to have nosy preferences.\n\nNote that if we consider the case of cardinal preferences—for instance, if Alice and Bob both had to state, within certain bounds, how much happiness they would get for each color of each house separately, and the situation which produced the most happiness were chosen—a minimally-liberal solution does not require that they have no nosiness at all, but just that the sum of all \"nosy\" preferences about one house's color are below some threshold, while the \"non-nosy\" preferences are all above that threshold. Since there are generally some questions for which this will be true—Sen's classic example is an individual's choice of whether to sleep on their back or their side—the goal of combining minimal liberalism with Pareto efficiency, while impossible to guarantee in all theoretical cases, may not in practice be impossible to obtain.\n\nAlternatively, one could remain committed to the universality of the rules for social choice and to individual rights and instead reject the universal application of the Pareto principle. Sen also hints that this should be how one escapes the paradox: \n\nMost commentators on Sen's paradox have argued that Sen's minimal liberalism condition does not adequately capture the notion of individual rights. Essentially what is excluded from Sen's characterization of individual rights is the ability to voluntarily form contracts that lay down one's claim to a right.\n\nFor example, in the example of Lewd and Prude, although each has a right to refuse to read the book, Prude would voluntarily sign a contract with Lewd promising to read the book on condition that Lewd refrain from doing so. In such a circumstance there was no violation of Prude's or Lewd's rights because each entered the contract willingly. Similarly, Alice and Bob might sign a contract to each paint their houses their dispreferred color on condition that the other does the same.\n\nIn this vein, Gibbard provides a weaker version of the minimal liberalism claim which he argues is consistent with the possibility of contracts and which is also consistent with the Pareto principle given any possible preferences of the individuals.\n\nAlternatively, instead of both Lewd and Prude deciding what to do at the same time, they should do it one after the other. If Prude decides not to read, then Lewd will decide to read, same outcome. However, if Prude decides to read, Lewd won't. \"Prude reads\" is preferred by Prude (and also Lewd) than \"Lewd reads\", so he will decide to read (with no obligation, voluntarily) to get this Pareto Efficient outcome. Marc Masat hints that this should be another way out of the paradox: \n"}

{"id": "191761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191761", "title": "Name binding", "text": "Name binding\n\nIn programming languages, name binding is the association of entities (data and/or code) with identifiers. An identifier bound to an object is said to reference that object. Machine languages have no built-in notion of identifiers, but name-object bindings as a service and notation for the programmer is implemented by programming languages. Binding is intimately connected with scoping, as scope determines which names bind to which objects – at which locations in the program code (lexically) and in which one of the possible execution paths (temporally).\n\nUse of an identifier codice_1 in a context that establishes a binding for codice_1 is called a binding (or\ndefining) occurrence. In all other occurrences (e.g., in expressions, assignments, and subprogram calls), an identifier stands for what it is bound to; such occurrences are called applied occurrences.\n\n\nAn example of a static binding is a direct C function call: the function referenced by the identifier cannot change at runtime.\n\nBut an example of dynamic binding is dynamic dispatch, as in a C++ virtual method call. Since the specific type of a polymorphic object is not known before runtime (in general), the executed function is dynamically bound. Take, for example, the following Java code:\n\ncodice_3 is an interface, so codice_4 must refer to a subtype of it. Is it a reference to a codice_5, an codice_6, or some other subtype of codice_3? The actual method referenced by codice_8 is not known until runtime. In C, such an instance of dynamic binding may be a call to a function pointed to by a variable or expression of a function pointer type whose value is unknown until it actually gets evaluated at run-time.\n\nRebinding should not be confused with mutation.\n\n\nConsider the following Java code:\n\nThe identifier codice_4 initially references nothing (it is uninitialized); it is then rebound to reference an object (a linked list of strings). The linked list referenced by codice_4 is then mutated, adding a string to the list. Lastly, codice_4 is rebound to codice_12.\n\nLate static binding is a variant of binding somewhere between static and dynamic binding. Consider the following PHP example:\nIn this example, the PHP interpreter binds the keyword codice_13 inside codice_14 to class codice_15, and so the call to codice_16 produces the string \"hello\". If the semantics of codice_17 had been based on late static binding, then the result would have been \"bye\".\n\nBeginning with PHP version 5.3, late static binding is supported. Specifically, if codice_17 in the above were changed to codice_19 as shown in the following block, where the keyword codice_20 would only be bound at runtime, then the result of the call to codice_16 would be \"bye\":\n\n"}

{"id": "39681327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39681327", "title": "Philosophy of architecture", "text": "Philosophy of architecture\n\nPhilosophy of Architecture is a branch of philosophy of art, dealing with aesthetic value of architecture, its semantics and relations with development of culture.\n\nPlato, whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as Pythagoras. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.\n\nDue to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the philosophy of art, which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century. Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, Immanuel Kant and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, with their ideal of \"pure art.\"\n\nAs it was noted by Michel Foucault, the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In \"Discipline and Punish\" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison Panopticon. The point of this project by Jeremy Bentham was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.\n\nHowever, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the Avant-garde`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of mechanical reproduction of the image, was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of Constructivism and Functionalism find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. Cubism and Futurism set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.\n\nArchitecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of Postmodernism. According to R. Martin \"it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture.\"\nSome scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of \"style of Modern\" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that \"it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge.\" As it was noted by researchers, \"Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin.\" So important to postmodern writers like R. Bart and U. Eco, saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.\nF. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism. However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern \"architectural origins,\" so Andreas Huyssen, suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that \"Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s.\" Lyotard contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism and, as Lyotard states it in his article, \"Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?\": \"under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism.\"\n\nA special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect Robert Venturi, whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of postmodernism, than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to pop-art. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.\n\nThe Wittgenstein House is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "851289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=851289", "title": "Problem-oriented policing", "text": "Problem-oriented policing\n\nProblem-oriented policing (POP), coined by University of Wisconsin–Madison professor Herman Goldstein, is a policing strategy that involves the identification and analysis of specific crime and disorder problems, in order to develop effective response strategies. For years, police focused on the “means” of policing rather than its “ends”, according to Goldstein. Goldstein (1979) called to replace what he termed the reactive, incident-driven “standard model of policing”. This approach requires police to be proactive in identifying underlying problems which can be targeted to reduce crime and disorder at their roots. Goldstein’s view emphasized a paradigm shift in criminal law, but also in civil statutes and the use of municipal and community resources. Goldstein’s 1979 model was expanded in 1987 by John E. Eck and William Spelman into the SARA model for problem solving.\n\nThis strategy places more emphasis on research and analysis as well as crime prevention and the engagement of public and private organizations in the reduction of community problems. \n\nProblem-oriented policing relies on the identification of problems by rank-and-file officers. Not all departments will define problems the same way, but a typical definition is:\nKey concepts Goldstein argued that one must tackle the causes of the problem. Eck and Spelman developed a twelve-step model of what problem-oriented policing agency should do:\nWhere, under a traditional system, a patrol officer might answer repeated calls to a certain problem area or \"hot spot\" and deal only with each individual incident, that officer is encouraged under POP to discover the root cause of the problem and come up with ways of solving it. The goal is to find a cure for the ailment instead of merely treating the symptoms. Some might confuse community-oriented policing with problem-oriented policing, but the main focus of community-oriented policing is the improvement of the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens, while problem-oriented policing is depending on information of the citizens and a good relationship with the community.\n\nThe exploration of possible responses to a problem is handled by patrol officers. Once a problem is identified, officers are expected to work closely with community members to develop a solution, which can include a wide range of alternatives to arrest. Problem-oriented policing gives law enforcement a model for addressing the conditions that created and caused other problems of concern to the community. Communities must ensure law enforcement are addressing and responding to concerns of citizens. Problem-oriented policing is predicated on community involvement and support is key if law enforcement hopes to rectify crime. In SARA, “Scanning” is the first step and require police identifying and prioritizing potential problems in their jurisdiction. Second, the acronym “A” stands for analysis, for example analyzing the time of day when incidents occur, determining who the offenders are and why they prefer the park and investigate the particular areas of the park that are most conducive to the activity. In addition, evaluating their environmental design characteristics. Analysis also involves the police to use data sources, so the proper responses can be manifested. The third step, response, has the police develop and implement interventions designed to rectify the problems. The final step is assessment, which involves evaluating the impact of the response and what good has been accomplished.\n\nThese may focus on the offender, the community, the environment, outside agencies, or the need for some kind of mediation. Situations often demand that police and citizens fashion tailor-made responses to problems, so a high degree of importance is placed on creativity and discretion.\n\nSuccesses in problem solving are well documented in study after study. One anthology by Ronald Glensor, Mark Correia and Kenneth Peak suggest it represents a \"new policing\". However, it is a new policing with varying degrees of success (Policing Communities: Understanding Crime and Solving Problems, Roxbury Publishing, 2000, page 1). This success has led to the problem-oriented approach being popular among police administrators and high-ranking city officials. Other factors affecting this preference is that public favor translates into job security for administrators and elected officials and that it gives the opportunity to collect substantial sums of money through federal grants. In 1995, a federal grant of $327 million from the U.S. Department of Justice was divided up among police departments implementing POP programs in the state of Arizona. The availability of federal grant money creates a real incentive for police agencies to use POP. Federal agencies and national policing groups, the creation of national awards for effective problem-oriented policing programs and implementation throughout the world. The U.S federal agency, the office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) adopted key strategy, and funding for POP (www.popcenter.org).\n\nBecause POP policy may require considerable organizational restructuring, administrators can justify applications for inordinately large funds.\n\nSome rank-and-file officers, however, often do not share their administrators' enthusiasm. One of the reasons for this may be a lack of clarity with respect to organizational goals. Policing has from the beginning had a lack of clarity of organizational goals, and the introduction of POP does not always solve the problem. Consequently, rank and file officers assuming this lack of clarity concern will be resolved by POP and are disappointed when that is not done. Poorly defined or ambiguous goals can lead to stress and frustration. Another possible source of rank-and-file discontent is militant police unionism in which union leadership sees POP as an expansion of police duties and attempts to include these duties into collective bargaining.\n\nA further source of frustration by some officers is the conflict between the administration's community policing mandate and the continuing need to respond to calls for service.\n\nProblem-oriented policing often has a number of effects and some unintended consequences that flow from them.\nThe majority of problem-oriented policing projects fail to investigate displacement. Law enforcement is generally satisfied to achieve a crime reduction in the targeted area and may be less concerned if crime is displaced outside their jurisdiction. However assessing and understanding potential displacement effects can help ensure the effectiveness of your problem-oriented policing. However determining the extent of displacement will also assist in defending your results to critics. According to the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, “Crime displacement is the relocation of crime from one place, time target offense, or tactic to another as a result of some prevention initiative”(Defining 2012). In addition, displacement is viewed as a negative consequence of crime prevention efforts, however, it can provide benefits. However, if a community has no trust in law enforcement, then situations like the above case studies will take place. Law enforcement and the community will have friction. As difficult as it often is for police officers to obtain \"buy-in\" within. It is often even more difficult to convince people outside\nthe police department to carry out specific tasks faithfully and properly without a negative inference of its inadequacy in satisfying the expectations of the masses (Scott n.d).\n\nAmong the most dramatic impacts of POP is that it works. POP successes are robust and are demonstrated in studies and publications over two decades.\n\nOne example of these success stories is the hundreds of POP projects submitted to the Herman Goldstein Problem-Solving Award program each year at the International POP Conference (www.popcenter.org). The projects illustrate that police departments across the world have been implementing POP measures onto a wide range of issues from car theft and school bullying to homicide and gang problems. The projects demonstrate the wide acceptance of the method as a way to reduce significant problems.\n\nAnother example of these successes are the numerous publications documenting success over the decades. Examples include Kenneth Peak and Ronald Glensor's text \"Community Policing and Problem Solving: Strategies and Practices\" (Prentice Hall, 1996) and Corina Sole Brito and Tracy Allan's \"Problem Oriented Policing: Crime-Specific Problems, Critical Issues, Making POP Work - Volume 2\" (Police Executive Research Forum, 1999).\n\nUnder POP, the public has a much more direct hand in defining the goals of the police and influencing what issues the police will focus on. On one hand it is possible that this can cause a conflict between what is traditionally of high importance to the police, such as robberies, burglaries and violent crime, and what is a priority to community members – which may be things as mundane as loitering crowds or acts of graffiti.\n\nThis mismatch of priorities can hinder the relationship between the police and the community. It can also make the officer’s job more difficult and stressful as he or she is presented with conflicting mandates, one set coming from within and the other from without (the community).\n\nOn the other hand, actual experience in POP illustrates how POP projects also focuses on those very same crime concerns of importance to police. One example is the gangs and gun homicide reduction project reported by Anthony Bragga, David Kennedy, Anne Piehl and Elin Waring is their evaluation study \"The Boston Gun Project's Operation Ceasefire - Measuring the Impact of Operation Ceasefire\" (National Institute of Justice, 2001).\n\nCase Study 1 \n\nCase study 2 Another case study that used SARA for tackling hot spots and crime using Mutualism is Mobile County. For example, in Mobile County in the state of Alabama, methamphetamine was on the rise. Mobile Counties narcotics unit seized 29 pounds 12 ounces of methamphetamine and more than 1 gallon of methamphetamine (Bettner n.d). The investigators used traditional drug enforcement techniques but were unsuccessful. The second approach was the availability and precursors needed to manufacture Methamphetamine. For example, the MCSO Narcotics Unit concentrated on state laws such as (20-2-190) that focused and managed reporting/tracking requirements on medication containing Pseudophedrine as a precursor.\n\nComplications can arise if police managers are unschooled in the proper implementation of POP strategies. For example, certain officers in each department are designated as community problem solvers or if a few enthusiastic officers earnestly commit themselves to the POP process, as this leaves the others on the same shift to pick up the slack in responding to calls for service. This can lead to tension and resentment, which in turn can diminish morale and adversely affect the ability of the officers to function as a team and be productive.\n\nOf course the bigger question is \"productive for what?\". POP argues that traditionally police were productive in handing out tickets and making arrests. However, these tactics did not ensure crime decreased. In fact, numerous criminological studies showed they made no impact whatsoever on the greater sense of public safety as first reported in the famous study by George Kelling and others (The Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment, Police Foundation, 1974). POP creates specific goals in tackling tangible problems. Productivity is determined by resolving problems. If tickets and arrests help do that, they are employed. If they don't help that, then other more creative strategies are employed. Consequently, the actual reason tension and resentment arises is because officers are ill-trained in creative problem-solving and feel they do not get adequate supervision or time to do POP.\n\nContrary to the tension and resentment issue in some agencies, in other more successful agencies, proper implementation of POP is established so that sophisticated problem-solving is part of the promotional process and officers come to see involvement in POP as a career path to more advanced ranks.\n\nIncreased discretion creates a risk for abuses of authority. POP encourages police to actively intervene in situations they had previously left alone, which presents more opportunities for abuse and a “net-widening” effect, though there is little evidence to suggest this is actually happening. The POP projects published to date (over 700 are listed in the POP library at www.popcenter.org) suggest that in most cases officers collaborate with community members in selecting proper levels of discretion and choose problems they, and the public, want resolved.\n\nAlthough there is no evidence to suggest it is actually happening, there is a possibility that increased discretion coupled with the possibility of larger social consequences could make officers more conservative in their approach; perhaps too conservative to fully achieve POP goals.\n\nIn summary, POP represents one of the more lasting and successful components of the community policing movement. It has stood the test of time thus far and delivered a plethora of successful projects in resolving community crime and disorder. Michael Scott's 20-year retrospective concludes: \"After 20 years, problem-oriented policing has demonstrated an internal logic that has been successfully applied at the project level, and remains a promising approach for the foreseeable future.\" (Michael Scott, Problem Oriented Policing: Reflections on the First 20 Years, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, 2000. page 129).\n\nThe Center For Evidence-Based Crime Policy in George Mason University identifies the following randomized controlled trials on community policing as very rigorous.\n\n\nReferences\nDefining Displacement (2012, October 22).

Prosecutors are bound by a sets of rules which outline fair and dispassionate conduct.\n\n\nProsecutors are given discretion about how they conduct their business. However, while some practices are not illegal, they may be seen as unethical and/or abusive and in need of reform, particularly by defendants and criminal defense attorneys:\n\n\nIn late 1993, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that John Demjanjuk had been a victim of prosecutorial misconduct during a 1986 trial in which federal prosecutors withheld evidence. Demjanjuk's sentence was overturned, but he lost when his case was retried.\n\nIn the 1995 murder trial of O. J. Simpson, the defense argued that Los Angeles Police Department detective Mark Fuhrman had planted evidence at the crime scene. Although Fuhrman denied the allegations, Simpson was found not guilty, although he was later held liable for the deaths in a civil suit filed by the families of the victims. In \"USA Today\" (August 24, 1995), Francis Fukuyama stated, \"[Such defenses lead to] a distrust of government and the belief that public authorities are in a vast conspiracy to violate the rights of individuals.\" However, such misconduct may actually be widespread in the United States. \"It’s a result-oriented process today, fairness be damned,\" Robert Merkle, former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida, said. Prosecutors are protected from civil liability even when they knowingly and maliciously break the law in order to secure convictions, and the doctrine of harmless error can be used by appellate courts to uphold convictions despite such illegal tactics, which some argue gives prosecutors few incentives to comply with the law.\n\nA more recent example of prosecutorial misconduct can be seen in the 2006 Duke lacrosse case. In that incident, members of the Duke University men's lacrosse team hired a female stripper for a team party. She went on to accuse three players of raping her at that party. Making the case even more volatile was the fact that the stripper was black and the three accused players were white. The actions of the prosecutor in this case, Mike Nifong, drew enormous criticism, as he proceeded with the case despite numerous inconsistencies in the accuser's story, a lack of DNA evidence conclusively linking any player to any sexual assault, and at least two of the accused having solid alibis. He also made numerous inflammatory statements to the media. The case against the players eventually collapsed; all charges were dropped, and the North Carolina Attorney General took the unusual step of declaring the players innocent. The North Carolina State Bar eventually disbarred Nifong for his actions during this case.\n\nIn 2011 a Texas man, Michael Morton was released from prison after serving nearly 25 years for the murder of his wife in 1987. He was released after DNA evidence pointed to another man as the killer. The prosecutor, Ken Anderson later plead guilty to withholding evidence that could have helped Morton fight the murder charge. He was sentenced to spend 10 days in jail and was also disbarred.\n\nDespite such, the defense has been successful in roughly 1 out of 6 times it has been used from 1970 to 2003. During that period, judges have cited misconduct by prosecutors as a reason to dismiss charges, reverse convictions, or reduce sentences in 2,012 cases, according to a study by the Center for Public Integrity released in 2003; the researchers looked at 11,452 cases in which misconduct was alleged.\n\nA debate persists over the meaning of the term. Prosecutors have asked judges to stop using the term to refer to an unintentional error, and to restrict its use to describe a breach of professional ethics. E. Norman Veasey, the chief justice of Delaware Supreme Court, answered one such request in 2003 by noting the term's extensive use in rulings over the past 60 years. \"We believe it would be confusing to change the terminology in view of this history,\" he wrote in reply.\n\n\n"}

The philosopher Annette Baier wrote that \n“This beautifully organized and lucidly argued book might be taken as a model of how a sustained philosophical argument should proceed. Wallace’s thesis is that our practices of holding persons responsible for their choices and actions, and reacting to those that offend against moral norms with blame, indignation or resentment, make perfectly good sense, even if determinism is true.\"\n\nHis collection of papers, \"Normativity and the Will,\" brings together essays mostly written in the decade after the 1996 book \"Responsibility and the Moral Sentiments,\" which \"develop the moral psychology behind his Strawsonian account of moral responsibility as depending on our practices of holding people morally accountable.\"\n\nHis most recent book, \"The View from Here,\" was described by Thomas Nagel in the \"London Review of Books\" as follows: \"This interesting, careful and occasionally outrageous book explores the complex interaction and competition between the attitudes of affirmation and regret that are almost inevitable as we look back on our lives and celebrate or deplore the conditions and choices that have made us what we are – that underlie our successes and failures, and our personal attachments.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded by groups of Persian philosophers, most notably Mir Damad, Sheykh Baha'i and Mir Fendereski. The name was coined by Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Henry Corbin.\n\nBecause of the attention of Shah Abbas during the Safavid Dynasty in Iran to intellectual tradition in Islam, Isfahan became a famous academic city, and the intellectual center of Iran at the time, along with the cities of Rey and Shiraz.\n\nThis school of thought began to develop once Iran was economically and politically stable. The Safavid court also provided funding for the arts, which also contributed to the development. At the time, there were many disputes between Shiite scholars, such as Ahamad Alavi, and Christian and Jewish scholars. In this period the intellectual life of Suhrevardi was revived by Mir Damad and Mulla Sadra. According to Seyyed Hosein Nasr, this school of thought plays an important role both in terms of the relation between philosophy and prophecy, and in the training of Mulla Sadra. The school of Isfahan is a subsidiary of the Shiraz school of philosophy. Several philosophers that were not part of the Shiraz school of thought had very important roles in preparing the Isfahan school, such as Ibn Turkah, Qadi Maybudi and Ibn Abi Jomhour Ahsaei. The group of founders then announced Shia as formal religion in Persia, in an attempt to unify the entire country, with Isfahan as their capital.\n\nMir Damad founded the Isfahan philosophical school. He was the nephew of Muhaqiq Karaki, an important Shia scholar who had influence in the Shia jurisprudence. Some consider him familiar with philosophical prophecy as a result to the problem of Time. Corbin describes Mir Damad as having an analytic mind and aware of religious foundation of knowledge. Perhaps the most important characteristic of Mira Damad's philosophy is a synthesis between Avicennism and Averroism, or his synthesis is between the intellectual and the spiritual. Mir Damad's theory on Time is as popular as Huduth Dahri's, though Damad's philosophical opinion is criticized by Huduth's pupil, Mulla Sadra. Historically, there was great strife between Mulla Sadra and Mir Damad, as a result of the differences of their philosophical theories on subjects such as time.\n\nMir Abul Qasim Findiriski was a peripatetic philosopher and follower of Farabi an Avicenna. He select a Peripatetic stance, as opposed to the illuminationists. As a scholar, He taught several scientific subjects in the physical Isfahan school, such as mathematics and Medicine. it is debated whether or not Mulla Sadra studied under him, though the two worked together extensivally. Mir Findiriski also studied other religions, such as Zoroastrianism and Hindi. He also wrote several works on Indian philosophy, a series of treatises on fine arts, and one on his mystical experiences. According to Nasr, he was all well rounded in different philosophy, poetry, alchemy, and the philosophy of Yoga. Mir Findiriski collaborated with Mir Damad to wrote a piece called the Treatise of Sanaiyyah attempting to link philosophy and prophecy. Mir Findiriski also attempted to translate several Indian philosophical works into Persian.\n\nShaykh-i Baha’i was one of the three masters of Mulla Sadra, worked in the Isfahan school, and served as chief jurist on the Safavid Court. Like many Islamic scholars of the era, he was both a scientist and a man of wisdom; like Mir Damad and Mir Fenedereski, he was skilled in several sciences. At the time, he attempted to harmonize the relationship between Shariah and Tariqah. He coined the term Hikmate Yamani (wisdom of believing.) He believed that humans were the only being capable of intelligence in a philosophy called \"The Place of Illumination for Existence\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is held at Confucian sites across South Korea including hyanggyos and the Confucian temple Munmyo located at Sungkyunkwan, on Confucius' birthday in fall (28 September) and the anniversary of his death in spring (11 May). \"Seokjeon\" is made up of the two Chinese characters, 釋 (to lay out) and 奠 (alcohol), and \"Seokjeon Daeje\" means \"Laying out offerings ceremony\". It involves an elaborate ceremony with sacrificial offerings of alcohol and foods, as well as an elaborate dance known as \"munmyo ilmu\" accompanied by musical performances \"munmyo jeryeak\". Ceremonies honoring Confucius date back to 372 in Korea, during the Three Kingdoms Period.\n\nIn 2011, Korea nominated the ceremony for the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list, however, it did not satisfy the criteria for selection and UNESCO invited the Korean government to submit it again in the future with additional information. The ceremony is recognized in Korea as important intangible cultural heritage no.85.\n\nThe Seokjeon rite resembles a large-scale version of Jesa ancestral funerary rites.\n\n(1) Entrance and preparation: Welcoming the honored spirits by way of the main gate and the spirit path (yeongsin).\nThe master of music leads the musicians and dancers to their places.\nThe usher escorts the Confucian scholars to their places.\nThe usher conducts the reader of the invocation or ceremonial address and the deacons to their places.\nThe reader and the deacons bow four times.\nThe announcer requests that the first offerer opens the ceremony.\nMusic is played by the Ground Orchestra, and the Civil Dance begins\n\n(2) Offerings of Tribute and Sacrificial Food (jeonpyerye) to the spirits of Confucius and the Four Assessors.\nThe first offerer kneels in front of the tablet of Confucius, burns incense three times, offers the sacrifices, and rises.\nThe first offerer proceeds to the tablet of Tseng Tzu, kneels, burns incense three times, offers the sacrifice, and rises.\nThe first offerer proceeds to the tablet of Mencius, kneels, burns incense three times, offers the sacrifice, and rises.\n\n(3) First Wine Offering (choheon).

The central entrance, usually reserved in royal palaces for kings, is intended only for the spirits of Confucius and his disciples. The path known as Yeongshin (spirit path) stretching from Sinsammun to Daeseongjeon is intended only for spirits, and visitors are prevented from crossing it during ceremonies by specially designated workers.\n\nThe Munmyo Ilmu dance is performed in a grid of 8X8 dancers clad in red robes. Dance steps are slow, deliberate, and solemn. Throughout the ceremony, different hats are worn and different tools are held. Dancers raise their arms to the heavens to welcome spirits to earth, repeating the steps while facing each compass direction. The dance has been performed by SKKU students in recent years.\n\nTo match the 64 dancers, there are 64 musicians playing a variety of percussion and woodwind instruments in a performance of \"munmyo jeryeak\". The music is a type of Aak, punctuated by flat notes by striking a bell, which are maintained for several seconds before raising sharply at the end with the help of wood flutes.\n\n\nThe Seokjeon Daeje honors 39 historical figures of East Asia.\n\nThe Five Sages include Confucius and his four disciples:\n\nTen of the disciples of Confucius are also memorialized. \n\nThere are also 24 Men of Virtue, six from the Song Dynasty and 18 from Korea.

{"id": "44871143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44871143", "title": "Sesto Pals", "text": "Sesto Pals\n\nSesto Pals, pen name of Simion (or Semion) Șestopali (born Шестопаль, also rendered as \"S(h)estopal\", \"Sestopaly\", or \"Sestopali\"; ca. 1912 – October 27, 2002), was a Russian-born Romanian and Israeli writer. Primarily a poet-philosopher, he also earned recognition as a graphic artist. He first became known in his teenage years, when, as a friend and associate of Gherasim Luca, he put out the review \"Alge\". Its avant-garde aesthetics and its testing of censorship resulted in their prosecution. While Luca endured as a public intellectual and a founder of the Romanian surrealist cell, Pals became a recluse.\n\nForgotten by the general public, exposed to antisemitic and later communist persecution, he continued to write for himself and an intimate circle of friends. He had a successful career in civil and railway engineering, but political nonconformity resulted in his marginalization for part of the 1960s.\n\nMoving to Haifa in 1970, Pals was rediscovered by later generations of Romanian and Israeli readers, known to them for the moderate surrealism of his poetry and prose, and, to a lesser degree, for his take on Hegelian philosophy. His editorial debut came well into his 80s, when Pals was already bedridden and contemplating death. This led to his rediscovery as a contributor to both Romanian and Israeli literature.\n\nSimion \"Senia\" Shestopal, the scion of a Ukrainian Jewish family, was born in Odessa, officially on September 18, 1913, but more likely on September 5, 1912. According to literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu, his familiarity with Jewish mythology and the Hebrew language can be read as a clue that he was enlisted in a \"cheder\". He lived in Odessa with his parents and his brother Fima until 1920, when they were chased out of the country by the revolutionary war.\n\nHis father obtained protection status from the Italian diplomatic mission, before moving with his family to Romania and legally changing his name to \"Emanoil Șestopali\". Simion's mother, Berta née Berman, later arranged for her own relatives to settle in the new country. They lived in Galați, where Simion and Fima began their schooling, until 1923, then moved to Bucharest. Simion enlisted at the Matei Basarab High School, where he was colleagues with poet Gherasim Luca. Sharing a school-desk, the two became close friends. They also associated with Aurel Baranga, who was in the same school, but slightly younger. Their circle also included female colleagues and admirers, among them Henriette Iacobsohn, future wife of the cartoonist Saul Steinberg, and Amelia Pavel, later an essayist and art historian. Pavel, who vacationed with Simion at Sovata in summer 1930, remembered him as a \"nice and well-behaved youth\".\n\nNevertheless, all three young men made a habit of deriding cultural conventions: Pals was almost expelled from school when he burst out laughing during a lecture on poet-laureate Vasile Alecsandri. In 1930, having kept up with the Western European and Romanian avant-garde, Luca founded the radical youth magazine \"Alge\" (\"Algae\"), with collaborations from Șestopali (the nominal \"chief editor\"), Baranga, and Jules Perahim; they were later joined by Paul Păun. Șestopali experimented with literary pseudonyms, sometimes signing his work for \"Alge\" as \"D. Amprent\" and then, for the first time ever, \"Sesto Pals\". A quasi-anagram of his Romanian name-and-initial, it was sometimes corrected to \"Șesto Pals\" in later reference, but the poet always signed his work \"sans\" diacritic. The family name probably originated in a Russian moniker for \"six fingers\" or \"six toes\", and Șestopali bragged that he himself had inherited an extra toe.\n\nUnderfunded, \"Alge\" only put out six or seven issues in this 1930 edition. By February 1932, Pals had established his own single-issue magazine, titled \"Muci\" (\"Snot\") and distributed free of charge at one of Perahim's art shows. Like Păun and the other \"Alge\" men, he was also co-opted by \"unu\", the more established avant-garde sheet, but had a tense encounter with its editor, Sașa Pană. Nonetheless, \"unu\" hosted some of Pals' prose poems, including one which mockingly advertised Perahim's art as a \"horrid crime\" against the state. In addition to writing poetry, he was interested in hard science, taking his baccalaureate with honors in physics. He barely passed the overall examination, after having again slammed Alecsandri's work in his Romanian literature paper.\n\nIn 1933, Luca reissued \"Alge\" in a more licentious edition, and challenged the cultural establishment by sending a copy to Nicolae Iorga, the nationalist historian and political figure. A clampdown on their activities followed: all known contributors were caught in a police investigation, and Pals' home was searched for incriminating proof. Despite no longer being a contributor (and feeling alienated by Păun and Baranga's leftist militancy), Pals was implicated by his nominal editorial contribution. He was eventually arrested and sent to Văcărești prison, where his colleagues were also rounded up. Pals later recalled being subjected to a thorough interrogation by the examining magistrate, and sharing a cell with a known communist. Taking his instructions from Iorga, the coroner alleged that the Șestopalis were themselves communists, sent in from the Soviet Union to subvert Romanian society. The family was threatened with expulsion.\n\nThe writers' parents eventually obtained their release, with Emanoil pleading with his son that he amend his ways. The court ruled against the \"Alge\" group, and issued two-year suspended sentences against them. This tarnished their judicial record, leaving Pals exposed to persecution. Pals was traumatized by the whole experience, and no longer bothered with his college admission, although his grades qualified him for enlistment at the Bucharest Polytechnic.\n\nIn 1934, when he and his family were naturalized Romanian, Pals finally matriculated with the Polytechnic, where he majored in mining engineering and metallurgy. He kept out of literary life. When, in 1939, Luca returned from Paris a committed surrealist, Pals was invited to attend the sessions of his Bucharest surrealist circle. He did so on occasion, meeting with new recruits such as Dolfi Trost and Gellu Naum, but, as Pals biographer Michäel Finkenthal notes, \"chain smoked [and] kept himself dead silent.\" Pals himself later asserted: \"I never did 'fade' out of sight, I have always been out of sight.\"\n\nPals graduated in 1940, just as the National Renaissance Front dictatorship had barred Jews from employment in most fields, including technical. Pushed out of literary life, Pals discovered philosophy, and became an avid reader of Hegel. Finkenthal notes that his \"rather obsessive preoccupation\" was \"to quantify qualitative values\", a \"strange mixture of Hegelianism and abstract arithmetic\". Then, at the height of World War II, the Șestopalis came to be persecuted under tighter racial laws. Pals' brother Fima escaped to Palestine. Pals was singled out for compulsory labor, and sent to work as a \"Jewish engineer\" for the State Railways. Making occasional returns to Bucharest, he had an amorous affair with Lucia \"Lucy\" Metsch, a Paris-trained painter of Bukovina Jewish extraction. She had narrowly escaped the \"Einsatzgruppen\", and was working at The Barașeum.\n\nPals sought full employment after the antifascist coup of 1944, and, in 1945, was dispatched to oversee the construction of railway tunnels in Cluj County. Later that year, he returned to Bucharest, joining the City Planning Institute as founder and president of its geotechnical engineering section. In 1946, engineer Șestopali parted with Lucy and married Valentina Berman. This created controversy: Valentina was Pals' first cousin and his junior by 15 years. She was also Holocaust survivor, having just returned from the concentration camp in Berezivka, Transnistria. Although he still refrained from an open affiliation, Pals continued to visit Luca and the surrealists, introducing his wife to them. His half-sister-in-law, Mura Vlad, was a published novelist and translator from Russian.\n\nThe marriage soon crumbled: Pals was an absentee husband, and Valentina found it hard to cope with the rigors of life in Communist Romania. Working as a typist, she met the poet Ion Caraion, becoming his admirer, muse, and lover. Pals accepted the informal separation, resuming his love affair with Lucy Metsch, who now worked as a scenic painter for Sahia Film. He was increasingly withdrawn and troubled, dedicating himself to writing down a whole corpus of literary and philosophical works that he would not publish.\n\nDuring that decade, the Șestopalis came into conflict with the communist regime. In 1957, an investigation began into Caraion's samizdat poetry, which was highly critical of the regime, and which Valentina had helped circulate. At the risk of incriminating himself, Pals returned to his conjugal home and protected his estranged wife. In mid 1958, Valentina was arrested by the Securitate, then implicated in Caraion's trial for sedition. She dismissed the option to denounce Caraion in exchange for freedom, and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.\n\nIn 1962, Pals applied for an exit visa and emigration to Israel, a rebellious gesture which saw his demotion with reduced pay and his relocation to the remote town of Dej. Valentina, released from prison under a general amnesty, divorced him in 1963, and later married Caraion. Pals also married Lucy in 1965, and, starting 1967, retook his position at the Bucharest Planning Institute. He earned respect in the engineers' community, and had several professional awards to his name, while privately working on a set of essays which sought to reconcile Hegelianism with existentialism and phenomenology.\n\nBy his own account, Pals lived a quiet and exceptionally fulfilling life down to 1970: caught up in his work during daytime, he turned to writing literature at night, and reconnected with his avant-garde friends. He still refrained from going public, although two of his close friends, former avant-garde writers Baranga and Geo Bogza, were well regarded by the regime and could arrange him a publishing deal. He was more preoccupied with discovering (as he put it) \"the mystery of existence through one's own existence\". That interval came to an end in 1970, when he and his wife were allowed to emigrate. They were seen to their plane by Bogza, the dissenting communist. Pals was forced by the authorities to leave his voluminous manuscripts behind in Romania; he split them into fascicles, which he hid in various places. Ion and Valentina Caraion, together with their daughter Marta, were themselves allowed to leave in 1981, moving to Lausanne. Caraion, who had agreed to collaborate with the Securitate in return for his freedom, was repeatedly blackmailed by his former supervisors.\n\nPals resumed his professional career in Haifa, where he oversaw the digging of utility tunnels. He traveled outside the country to meet Luca, who was living in Paris. However, his health declined abruptly, and he was forced to take retirement in 1982. He suffered from gastrointestinal cancer, and was treated at the Rabin Medical Center.\n\nWorking from his home, a small apartment in Bnei Brak, Pals focused entirely on philosophical essays, which he composed in French, and a new set of visual poetry pieces. He reluctantly agreed to have samples of these works published in Romanian diaspora magazines—including Caraion's \"Don Quijote\" and Alexandru Lungu's \"Argo\". In 1985, the Honolulu exile Ștefan Baciu dedicated him a special issue of his \"MELE\", a poetry newsletter. It included homage pieces by his old friends Păun and Bogza. Interviewed about his work by journalist Solo Har-Herescu in 1993, Pals was oblique: \"I am not fit to answer, as my head is filled with those snake-like questions, poisoning my replies, eating them up as they [...] bite into their own tails, making it hard to know where tails begin and heads end.\" His only reason for writing was \"an inner urging\", as \"so much better poems\" already existed, which were still \"of no use to the reading public\".\n\nSesto Pals the poet was rediscovered in Romania only after the 1989 Revolution: in 1998, Nicolae Tzone published a book of his poetry with Editura Vinea, as \"Omul ciudat\" (\"The Bizarre Man\"). It was only at this time that Pals' former colleagues in the Bucharest Planning Institute discovered that he was the same as the avant-garde poet, as one of them confessed in a letter to the editors. \"Omul ciudat\" had a small circulation and, according to critic Răzvan Voncu, was only popular among the \"connoisseurs of the avant-garde\". The book earned Pals the Benjamin Fondane Award, granted by the Association of Romanian Writers in Israel. Pals' health condition was declining to such a degree that he had to be carried to that ceremony; by 1999, he was bedridden and tube-fed, but fully conscious and perfecting poems that were supposed to convey his final message to the world. He was still working on this on October 17, 2002, when he had to be taken to hospital.\n\nPals died in Tel Aviv, on October 27, 2002. Just days before this happened, the Romanian review \"Tribuna\" hosted three of his final poems. Pals' last work saw print a month later, in \"Ultima Oră\", the Tel Aviv Romanian-Jewish newspaper. A revised edition of \"Omul ciudat\" came out at Editura Paideia, with illustrations by Mariana Macri, daughter of Pals' friend Ionathan X. Uranus.\n\nMuch of Pals' sizable fortune was bequeathed to the Rabin Medical Center, founding a research unit \"for early detection and prevention of gastrointestinal cancer\". Pals was survived by Lucy, who died in 2006, and by Valentina Caraion, both of whom participated in the effort to recover and edit his work. Although most of Pals' texts remained unpublished and under-researched, a follow-up to \"Omul ciudat\", titled \"Întuneric și lumină\" (\"Darkness and Light\") was put out in Romania in 2007.\n\nHis 2013 centennial was celebrated in Romania under the auspices of the Museum of Romanian Literature and Gaudeamus Book Fair. Interest in Pals' work and personality was kept alive by the philosopher-physicist Michäel Finkenthal, who also collected some of the lesser known prose works into a 2014 anthology. A fictionalized portrayal of Pals as \"the bizarre poet\" is found in Virgil Duda's 2011 novel, \"Un cetățean al lumii\" (\"A Citizen of the World\").\n\nVarious exegetes have reached the conclusion that Pals' \"Alge\" poetry is ahead of its time and context, one of the more notable contribution to the second-wave avant-garde in Romania. Paul Cernat describes a clash of visions between the \"prophetic\" ambitions of \"Alge\" and Pals' character, that of a \"vulnerable introvert, terrorized by the precariousness of the human condition\". According to Ion Pop, some of these poems stand out among the \"purely awkward exercises\" of youth, as \"unhinged\" expressionist pieces in succession to those of Adrian Maniu and Jules Laforgue. Other, tamer, pieces were directly inspired by the hermetic Ion Barbu and the mainstream modernist Tudor Arghezi. Several poems are singled out by Crohmălnicanu for being biblical-themed and distinctly apocalyptic, while yet others are \"socially-inspired\", \"unanimistic\" and \"fraternal\", addressed to \"those people I meet on the tram\".\n\nBy the mid 1950s, when he settled for a format of blank verse and haikus, Pals was prone to philosophical meditation, and explored much deeper into lyrical themes. As argued by Finkenthal, this change was prompted by his separation from Valentina: \"From now on, the poet finds himself locked in a world where things happen, things change, where there is no longer room for any refuge into love or wisdom.\" According to Voncu, there was another cultural layer: like Gellu Naum and other late arrivals on the avant-garde scene, Pals was moving away from the sheer negativity of \"Alge\", and attempting to construct instead a post-philosophical surrealism. Cernat sees Pals' surrealism as having \"a familiar face\", with classical-format quatrains like those of Tristan Tzara, H. Bonciu, and Jacques Prévert.\n\nSome of Pals' poems, tentatively dated to 1958, seemingly allude to Valentina's arrest by the communists and the whole wave of political repression. Such dark and brooding works are held by both Finkenthal and Voncu as proof that Caraion and Pals influenced each other directly, despite their erotic rivalry. One fragment depicts silent struggles between the scheming fishermen and their catch, implying that fish still have a dying hope:\nIn 1960s prose poems which display influences from Franz Kafka or Urmuz, Pals amplified his sense of bafflement about the human condition. Nonetheless, Finkenthal writes, his very series of lyrical verse hints at \"truths that are inaccessible to common mortals\". He reconciled himself with the idea of time by denying its concreteness, but drew a line between general time and \"the time of creation\". The latter allowed for a future, and therefore provided room for \"affirmation and oblivion\". This meant that, \"once he puts himself on the line, an artist will have to fade into his own affirmation.\" The moribund Pals sketched out a quaint prophecy:\n\n"}

He is important chiefly because of his influence on Eusebius, on all the later writers of Church history among the Church Fathers, and on the whole Greek school of chroniclers.\n\nThe Suidas claims Africanus was a \"Libyan philosopher\", while Gelzer considers him of Roman descent. Julius called himself a native of Jerusalem – which some scholars consider his birthplace – and lived at the neighbouring Emmaus. His chronicle indicates his familiarity with the topography of historic Judea.\n\nLittle of Africanus's life is known and all dates are uncertain. One tradition places him under the Emperor Gordianus III (238–244), others mentions him under Severus Alexander (222–235). He appears to have known Abgar VIII.(176–213).\n\nAfricanus may have served under Septimius Severus against the Osrhoenians in 195. He went on an embassy to the emperor Severus Alexander to ask for the restoration of Emmaus, which had fallen into ruins. His mission succeeded, and Emmaus was henceforward known as Nicopolis.\n\nAfricanus traveled to Greece and Rome and went to Alexandria to study, attracted by the fame of its catechetical school, possibly about the year 215. He knew Greek (in which language he wrote), Latin, and Hebrew. He was at one time a soldier and had been a pagan; he wrote all his works as a Christian.\n\nWhether Africanus was a layman or a cleric remains controversial. Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont argued from Africanus's addressing the priest Origen as \"dear brother\" that Julius must have been a priest himself but Gelzer points out that such an argument is inconclusive.\n\nAfricanus wrote \"Chronographiai\", a history of the world in five volumes. The work covers the period from Creation to the year AD 221. He calculated the period between Creation and Jesus as 5500 years, placing the Incarnation on the first day of AM 5501 (our modern March 25 1 BC). (Note that this dating implies that the birth of Jesus was in December, nine months later.) This method of reckoning led to several Creation eras being used in the Greek Eastern Mediterranean, which all placed Creation within one decade of 5500 BC.\n\nThe history, which had an apologetic aim, is no longer extant. But copious extracts from it are to be found in the \"Chronicon\" of Eusebius, who used it extensively in compiling the early episcopal lists. There are also fragments in George Syncellus, Cedrenus and the \"Chronicon Paschale.\" Eusebius gives some extracts from his letter to one Aristides, reconciling the apparent discrepancy between Matthew and Luke in the genealogy of Christ by a reference to the Jewish law of Levirate marriage, which compelled a man to marry the widow of his deceased brother, if the latter died without issue. His terse and pertinent letter to Origen impugning the authority of the part of the Book of Daniel that tells the story of Susanna, and Origen's wordy and uncritical answer, are both extant.\n\nThe ascription to Africanus of an encyclopaedic work entitled \"Kestoi\" (Κέστοι \"Embroidered\"), treating of agriculture, natural history, military science, etc., has been disputed on account of its secular and often credulous character. August Neander suggested that it was written by Africanus before he had devoted himself to religious subjects. A fragment of the \"Kestoi\" was found in the Oxyrhynchus papyri. According to the New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, the Kestoi \"appears to have been intended as a sort of encyclopedia of the material sciences with the cognate mathematical and technical branches, but to have contained a large proportion of merely curious, trifling, or miraculous matters, on which account the authorship of Julius has been questioned. Among the parts published are sections on agriculture, liturgiology, tactics, and medicine (including veterinary practise).\"\n\nOnly fragments of his religious writings have been preserved. One fragment deals with eschatology.\n\n\nAfter referring to the standard interpretation of the 'ram' and the 'he-goat', as symbolizing Persia and Greece, Africanus suggested that the 2300 days might be taken form months, totaling about 185 years which he applied to the time from the Capture of Jerusalem to the 20 year of Artaxerxes. He seems to be the only one who developed this interpretation.\n\n\nAfricanus begins the seventy weeks Daniel 9 with the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, in Olympiad 83, year 4, (444 B.C.) and ends the period in Olympiad 202, year 2, (31 A.D.) or 475 solar years inclusive, which would be equivalent to 490 uncorrected lunar years. \n\nThis work does not survive except in fragments, chiefly those preserved by Eusebius and Georgius Syncellus. In turn Africanus preserves fragments of the work of Polemon of Athens' Greek History.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Buchanan, in which the author argues that western culture is dying and will soon be imperilled. Western cultures have lower-than-replacement birth rates while populations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are exploding. \n\nBuchanan argues that the United States will be a Third World Nation by the year 2050. He uses United Nations population statistics to analyze the recent trends in global populations, especially major declines in European nations and major increases in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \n\nBuchanan argues that the United States has a \"nation within a nation\" already. The population of 30 million foreign born (of which 11 million are illegal aliens) is larger than the entire population of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. \n\nBuchanan argues that \"counter culture\" of the 1960s has become the dominant culture, which aims to rewrite American history and dismantle its heritage. He says: \"A new generation has now grown up for whom the cultural revolution is not a revolution at all, but the culture they were born into and have known all their lives.<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\n\nHe also argues that the death of the Christian faith is the primary cause of low birth rates, hopelessness, and political utopianism. He cites examples of anti-Christian sentiment such as the negative reactions to Catholic films and the triumphant attitude of secularism. He says: \"Western Man has decided he can disobey God without consequence and become his own God.\" And at the same time: \"The new hedonism seems unable to give people a reason to go on living.\"\n\nJohn Attarian praised the book. To avert catastrophe, Buchanan rightly calls for repudiating the left's ideology of national suicide. But he offers valuable specifics too. It may be too late for Europe to exit the highway, but America still can. Depopulation being the worse problem, we must encourage American women to have children, with pro-family tax relief such as raising the federal tax credit for each child, giving employers tax incentives to pay parents higher wages, and so on... Buchanan concedes that it may be too late to save the West, but closes by affirming that America is a beautiful country. \"And that is why we must never stop trying to take her back.\" That call to undaunted perseverance is the right parting note.\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" panned the book. The review called it \"[s]hameless, embarrassing rantings\" and also remarked that \"[l]ittle attests to the moral health of this nation more than the fact that it’s made a mockery of Buchanan's presidential ambitions time and again.\" The review particularly criticized Buchanan's claim that \"[h]ad it not been for the West, African rulers would still be trafficking in the flesh of their kinsmen\" as an example of dishonest historical revisionism.\n\nJonah Goldberg of \"The National Review:\" First, let me say I both admire and dislike Buchanan's writing for the same reason: He brilliantly manages to do with one language what Yassir Arafat does with two. He offers red meat to the extremists while at the same giving himself the wiggle room to deny he said anything controversial in the first place. This is no mean feat.\n\n\n"}

The goal of TSY is for trauma survivors to develop a greater sense of mind-body connection, ease their physiological experiences of trauma, gain a greater sense of ownership over their bodies, and augment their overall well-being.\n\nTrauma-sensitive yoga has been adapted from traditional yoga. Traditional yoga is a form of exercise conceptualized as a mind-body practice, which incorporates man forms and varies by class style. It typically includes techniques of body positioning, typically referred to as “physical postures”, and includes breathing exercises, mindfulness, and meditation. Research has demonstrated that traditional yoga can reduce stress, enhance physical health, and a heighten one's sense of self. \n\nTSY was first established at the Trauma Center in Brookline, Massachusetts by David Emerson and colleagues. It was designed to promote an enhanced feeling of safety for individuals as they engage in an exercise that is focused on body awareness, which may otherwise be overwhelming for a traumatized population. TSY addresses the need for a trauma-informed yoga practice that could identify and mitigate potentially triggering environmental and physiological circumstances, while still providing the psychological and physical benefits that typical yoga practice offers.\n\nTSY has been heavily formulated out of five core domains which are crucial to consider as they could produce adverse side effects under nonoptimal conditions among a traumatized population, potentially due to production of reminders of practitioners’ traumas. The first core domain of TSY is the environment. TSY places greater emphasis on the environment as compared with traditional yoga, as trauma survivors must feel that the space is welcoming, safe, and comfortable, in order to minimize overwhelming feelings of vulnerability. The second core domain of TSY is the physical exercise. While traditional yoga places a strong weight on achieving a particular posture, TSY highlights the importance of internal sensations in such postures to promote feelings of safety and self-acceptance. The third and fourth core domains are the hands-on adjustments and instructor style. Traditional yoga teachers are often directive and may provide hands-on adjustments to students' postures, whereas TSY instructors are encouraged to provide gentleness and space, and allow students to remain in control of their practice. Lastly, in contrast to traditional yoga instructors, TSY instructors pay particular attention to their directive language as traditional yoga verbiage could be a reminder of one's trauma.\n\nPsychological trauma occurs when an individual has experienced a traumatic event, which becomes lived and relived in the body and the mind. Trauma can trigger a chronic stress response in the body, which may manifest as an uncontrollable and constant state of heightened arousal and fear in the body. Those with a history of trauma may also interpret this chronic stress response as a threat to their sense of self and relation to the world. Some research suggests that traumatized individuals often have difficulty soothing their overactive internal sensations without relying on external stimuli, such as food, substances, or self-harm. Therefore, psychological trauma is not only associated with psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, but also with somatic disorders. \n\nThough most evidence-based treatments focus on the psychological effects of trauma first and foremost, attrition rates are still high, possibly due to heightened physiological arousal during the initial stages of exposure therapy. Research has implicated mind-body approaches as an alternative to traditional psychotherapy, to allow traumatized individuals to reconnect with and identify their own physical sensations. Mind-body approaches also allow those with a history of trauma to work through their somatic trauma memories and feel safe enough to emotionally and verbally process their traumatic memories. Such approaches involve increasing awareness of, and attention to, body sensations, while emphasizing present-moment experience to counteract dissociative responses. Finally, mind-body approaches help the traumatized individual to nurture the body using internal resources. In this way, messages from the physical body may provide information for traumatized individuals about their identities and help individuals regain ownership over their internal responses.\n\nThe techniques of yoga, in general, have been shown to alleviate effects on the body’s nervous system. The mindfulness and meditation aspect of yoga allows the mind to maintain objective awareness on the body’s physical sensations, while maintaining a state of calm. The aspect of yoga geared toward breath manipulation has been shown to play a role in enhanced capacity for emotion regulation. Thus, yoga has been found to reduce the overall intensity of one’s stress response and improve one’s ability to self-sooth. \n\nResearch has found that traditional yoga is associated with a reduction in physiological and somatic complaints often attributable to PTSD, such as pain and anxiety. Research also suggests that yoga produces a number of psychological benefits for individuals with PTSD such as reduction of stress, a decrease in depression as associated with the mindfulness component, a greater sense of interconnectedness with others when practiced in group settings, enhanced self-efficacy and self-esteem, and a feeling of overall empowerment. \n\nTrauma-sensitive yoga (TSY) is designed to begin gently, with a seated breathing exercise, followed by light movements. While adhering to the particular TSY conditions of the five core domains (i.e., physical environment, exercises, teaching style, adjustments, and language), the instructor guides the class through a series of physical postures at a level of difficulty fitting the advancement of the participants. In each posture, instructors encourage students to observe their internal sensations, without judgment, and respond to them compassionately. Throughout TSY, participants are encouraged to make choices for themselves about what feels comfortable and safe in their bodies, and instructors spaciously invite students to modify any posture as needed. TSY class ends similarly to traditional yoga in a resting pose (“savasana”) wherein students lie face up on the floor with their arms wide and eyes closed. \n\nCertain conditions remain constant in TSY to ensure that participants have a felt sense of safety. Such conditions include consistency of room appearance and class structure, instructors' reminders to participants of where the exits are located, and bright lights so participants can see their surroundings.\n\nIndividuals who have experienced psychological trauma often view their internal body sensations as dangerous and foreign, and form destructive habits as a means of coping with their internal experiences. Throughout TSY, instructors strive to create an environment that feels both physically and emotionally safe for the participants, thereby facilitating a healing atmosphere for traumatic individuals. When students feel increased levels of safety and groundedness in their environment, they are said to be at an appropriate mid-range level of arousal for working with their traumas effectively. Once TSY participants are at a mid-range level of arousal, they can learn to work with the physiological experiences of trauma in a more adaptive and less destructive manner. \n\nResearch suggests that trauma-sensitive yoga (TSY) is effective for improving the psychological symptoms for women who have survived interpersonal violence. Improvements may include a reduction in PTSD symptom severity, reduction in depression symptom severity, and reduction in anxiety symptom severity. In addition to symptom alleviation, research has found that survivors of interpersonal violence who engage in TSY have reported increased feelings of safety and agency, higher self-esteem and self-compassion, decreased feelings of isolation, greater feelings of relaxation, and a greater sense of agency over their own bodies, as compared with prior to TSY. \n\nCurrently, research has highlighted the importance of utilizing trauma-sensitive yoga (TSY) only as an alternative and complementary treatment to other evidence-based treatments (e.g., psychotherapy, medication) for trauma. TSY classes are designed to differ from class to class, and thus efficacy has not been established. Research has suggested the use of TSY as a primer to individual psychotherapy, as a means of preparing and grounding the body before uncovering the stored traumatic memories, and establishing a traumatized individual’s buy-in for treatment.\n\nIt may be important for consumers of TSY to consider the matter of confidentiality as it differs between TSY instructors and mental health professionals. Though TSY instructors are most often required to complete at least 200 hours of yoga instructor training with a trauma focus, confidentiality is typically not the focus of training.\n"}

Until 1887 he was a teacher at grammar schools in Prague and Nikolsburg. In 1888 he became a member of the staff of teachers at the grammar school \"k.k. Staatsgymnasium im VIII.Bezirk\" (\"Bundesgymnasium Wien 8\") in Vienna. In 1891 he was an outside lecturer at the University of Vienna. One of his interests was education, and he demanded a change of the educational system in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Another of his fields of interest was the education of minorities. He wrote a monograph about the education of the deafblind. In 1890 he published a psychological study about the deafblind Laura Bridgman. \n\nHe is regarded as the discoverer of the literary talent of the deaf-blind writer Helen Keller and corresponded with her. They never met personally. From scientific work about the deafblind he developed the Austrian direction of the philosophical method of \"Pragmatism\". In 1907 he translated William James's \"Pragmatism\" into German. After World War I he became an associate professor of philosophy and educational theory at the University of Vienna . In 1919 he became one of the teachers of the \"Schönbrunner Schule\" (Schönbrunn School) which came about after the Vice Mayor of Vienna Max Winter had obtained a considerable part of the Viennese Schönbrunn Palace to be used for the advancement of the education of young women, and a small number of men, to become educators and teachers.\n\nIn 1923, Jerusalem became a Professor of the University of Vienna. He died of a heart attack on 15 July 1923, in Vienna.\n\nAmong his students were the writer Stephan Hock, the politician Karl Renner, the composer Viktor Ullmann, the poet Anton Wildgans and Otto Felix Kanitz.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2351829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2351829", "title": "William Molyneux", "text": "William Molyneux\n\nWilliam Molyneux (; 17 April 1656 – 11 October 1698) was an Irish writer on science, politics and natural philosophy.\n\nHe is noted as a close friend of fellow philosopher John Locke, and for proposing Molyneux's Problem, a thought experiment widely discussed. \n\nHe was born in Dublin to Samuel Molyneux (1616–1693), lawyer and landowner (whose grandfather, Sir Thomas Molyneux, had come to Dublin from Calais in the 1560s), and his wife, Anne, née Dowdall. The second of five children, William Molyneux came from a relatively prosperous Anglican background, with his father established at Castle Dillon in County Armagh, and his uncle Colonel Adam Molyneux holding large estates inherited from the Dowdall's in Ballymulvey, near Ballymahon in County Longford. He was close to his brother Sir Thomas Molyneux, with whom he later shared philosophical interests. His sister Jane married Anthony Dopping, the eventual Anglican Bishop of Meath. In 1671 Molyneux started at Trinity College, Dublin where he became an avid reader of the leading figures of the Scientific Revolution. After attaining a Bachelor of Arts there, Molyneux was sent to study law in the Middle Temple, London from 1675 to 1678. In 1678 he married Lucy Domville (?–1691), the youngest daughter of Sir Wiliam Domville the Attorney-General for Ireland. His wife became ill, which led to blindness after their marriage and died young. Of their 3 children, only Samuel Molyneux (1689–1728) lived past childhood. Samuel went on to become an astronomer and politician who worked with his father on various scientific endeavours.\n\nBecause of his inheritance, Molyneux was financially independent. Nonetheless, he held a number of official positions throughout his life. He was appointed Joint Surveyor General of the King's buildings and works in Ireland in 1684. In 1687 he invented a new type of sundial called a Sciothericum telescopicum that used special double gnomon and a telescope to measure the time of noon to within 15 seconds. He represented Dublin University in Parliament from 1692 until his death. He had also served as a commissioner of forfeited estates in 1693, resigning a few months later due to ill health.\n\nMeanwhile, Molyneux was responsible for a number of publications reflecting his diverse interests. His first book was editing and translating into English the work of René Descartes which was published in London, 1680 as \"Six Metaphysical Meditations, Wherein it is Proved that there is a God...\". In 1682 Molyneux collaborated with Roderic O'Flaherty to collect material for Moses Pitt's \"Atlas\". In 1685, Pitt's financial crisis lead to cancellation of the project but much valuable early Irish history had been collected. Molyneux struck a friendship with O'Flaherty and assisted when the latter's treatise \"Ogygia\" was published in London.\n\nMeanwhile, in October 1683 he founded the Dublin Philosophical Society along the lines of the Royal Society (of which Molyneux became a fellow in 1685), and became its first Secretary. He was active in the proceedings of the society—recording weather data, calculating eclipses and demonstrating instruments and experiments.\n\nMolyneux also published several papers in Philosophical Transactions, as well as papers on optics, natural philosophy, and miscellaneous topics. Perhaps his best known scientific work was \"Dioptrica Nova, A treatise of dioptricks in two parts, wherein the various effects and appearances of spherick glasses, both convex and concave, single and combined, in telescopes and microscopes, together with their usefulness in many concerns of humane life, are explained\", published in London 1692. \n\nAfter John Locke published his \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690), Molyneux wrote to him praising the work.\n\nEarly in 1698, Molyneux published \"The Case of Ireland's being Bound by Acts of Parliament in England, Stated\". This controversial work—through application of historical and legal precedent—dealt with contentious constitutional issues that had emerged in the latter years of the seventeenth century as a result of attempts on the part of the English Parliament to pass laws that would suppress the Irish woolen trade. It also dealt with the disputed appellate jurisdiction of the Irish House of Lords. Molyneux's arguments reflected those made in an unpublished piece written by his father-in-law Sir William Domville, entitled \"A Disquisition Touching That Great Question Whether an Act of Parliament Made in England Shall Bind the Kingdom and People of Ireland Without Their Allowance and Acceptance of Such Act in the Kingdom of Ireland\".\n\nFollowing a debate in the English House of Commons, it was resolved that Molyneux's publication was 'of dangerous consequence to the crown and people of England by denying the authority of the king and parliament of England to bind the kingdom and people of Ireland'. Despite condemnation in England, Molyneux was not punished but his work was condemned as seditious and was ceremonially burned at Tyburn by the public hangman. His arguments remained topical in Ireland as constitutional issues arose throughout the eighteenth century, and formed part of Swift's argument in \"Drapier's Letters\". The tract also gained attention in the American colonies as they moved towards independence. Although \"The Case of Ireland, Stated\" was later associated with independence movements—both in Ireland and America—as one historian points out, 'Molyneux's constitutional arguments can easily be misinterpreted' and he was 'in no sense a separatist'.\n\nMolyneux also proposed the philosophical question that has since become known as Molyneux's Problem, which Locke discussed in later editions of the \"Essay\". The problem of the blind man who gains sight, which he proposed to Locke, remains a topic that is discussed into the 21st Century. The University Philosophical Society of Trinity College, Dublin views itself as the successor of the Dublin Philosophical Society, and thus recognises Molyneux as its founder and first president. Molyneux died in Dublin on 11 October 1698 and was buried in St. Audoen's Church, within the burial vault of his great-grandfather, Sir William Ussher.\n\n"}

Thompson\n\nWilliam Robin Thompson (June 29, 1887 - January 30, 1972) was a Canadian entomologist and philosopher.\n\nThompson was born in London, Ontario. After studying biology at the University of Toronto, he obtained a B.S in 1909 and started working at the United States Department of Agriculture. During his employment there, he continued to study at Cornell University and received his master's degree in entomology in 1912. The following year, he resigned from the Department of Agriculture to conduct research at University of Cambridge during 1914-1915. He then pursued his research at the European Parasite Laboratory in 1919 and graduated in 1921 which a doctorate in zoology at University of Paris. In 1924 he obtained another doctorate, this time in philosophy at St. Maximin College in France.\n\nIn 1928, Thompson left France and became assistant director of the Imperial Institute of Entomology in Britain, a service he held until 1947 when he returned to Canada. He became a professor at the Institute of Civil Service of Canada in 1949. Thompson was Director of the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control in Ottawa (1946-1958). He was appointed Fellow of the Royal Society in 1933.\n\nThompson published about 150 articles in various scientific journals. Between 1947 and 1958 he was editor of the magazine \"The Canadian Entomologist\". He died in Ottawa.\n\nThompson was a Catholic who held anti-Darwinian views. He was influenced by the philosophical writings of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. He wrote the critical 16-page introduction for the 1956 Everyman Edition of Charles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\". His introduction was reprinted by the Evolution Protest Movement in 1967. Thompson rejected natural selection. Historian of science Sharon E. Kingsland has noted that:\n\n\"Thompson believed that all species possessed an essence, or form, in the strict Aristotelian sense, which could not be changed by material means. He had a strong aversion to the hypothesis that all adapted types had been produced by the random actions of mutation and natural selection. Such random processes might explain microevolution, but they could not explain macroevolution. Thompson could not suggest an alternative hypothesis for the ones he had rejected; he simply regarded evolution as an unsolved problem.\"\n\nThompson also rejected theistic evolution and was critical of the ideas of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. In his book \"Science and Common Sense\", he wrote that \"there has been \"some\" evolution, but we cannot decide upon a \"priori\" principles how much. Natural science has no key to this problem.\" Biologist E. S. Russell noted that Thompson treated the philosophy of living organisms from an Aristotelian standpoint.\n\nAfter reading D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's \"On Growth and Form\", he became interested in the possible application of mathematics to biology. This view was unpopular at the time amongst American and Canadian biologists. In the 1920s he was influenced by the work of mathematician Vito Volterra. Thompson has been described as \"one of the pioneers of mathematical modeling in ecology\", but later became a staunch critic of it.\n\nIn the 1930s, Thompson radically changed his opinions about the use of mathematics in biology, believing the association was strongly negative. This was largely due to the work on population genetics by J. B. S. Haldane and Ronald Fisher which he believed was too abstract and devoid\nof common sense and empirical facts. Thompson was concerned that many of the arguments from mathematical biology were not based on biological observation. He believed that mathematical speculation should not replace the study of nature through laborious field research.\n\nThompson outlined his views on mathematics, philosophy and science in his book \"Science and Common Sense: An Aristotelian Excursion\" (1937).\n\nThompson wrote papers on the species problem and systematics. In a 1952 paper he argued against the reality of species based on his opinion that the species taxon is an \"abstraction\" taken from the features of many individuals but species themselves are not \"the individual or the collectivity of individuals.\"\n\n\n"}
