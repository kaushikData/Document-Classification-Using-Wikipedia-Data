The term also has uses in linguistics, sociology, computer programming theory, and astrology.\n\nAlgirdas Julien Greimas (1917–1992), professor of semiotics, is widely credited with producing the actantial model in 1966. This model reveals the structural roles typically performed in story telling; such as \"hero, villain (opponent of hero), object (of quest), helper (of hero) and sender (who initiates the quest).\" Each of these roles fulfill an integral component of the story, or, narrative. Without the contribution of each actant, the story may be incomplete. Thus, an \"actant\" is not simply a character in a story, but an integral structural element upon which the narrative revolves.\n\nAn actant can also be described as a binary opposition pairing, such as a hero paired with a villain, a dragon paired with a dragon slaying sword, a helper paired with an opponent. Actantal relationships are therefore incredibly useful in generating problems within a narrative that have to be overcome, providing contrast, or in defining an antagonistic force within the narrative. However, the same character can simultaneously have a different actant (or way of concern) in regard to a different sequence of action, event or episode in the story. Therefore, it should be distinguished from a character's consistent role in the story like the archetype of a character. The concept of actant is important in structuralism of narratology to regard each situation as the minimum independent unit of story.\n\nIn 1969 Julia Kristeva also attempted to understand the dynamic development of the situations in narratives with Greimas's actantial model. She thought the subject and the object can exchange positions, and accordingly the supporter and the opponent can exchange positions too. Furthermore, the pair of subject and object sometimes exchanges its position with the pair of supporter and opponent. There are, however, multiple overlapping situations in narrative at a given time. To contend with the overlapping situations present in all narrative structure, she called the potential actant shifts not \"change\", but \"transformation.\" This should not be confused with Greimas's own transformational model, another narratological framework.\n\nIndependently, researching Russian folklores, Vladimir Propp also provided the \"7 act spheres\":\nHowever, these are not the types of the person in the story, but rather patterns of behavior: the same person may sometimes as one \"sphere\", and at other times as a different \"sphere\".\n\nLinguist Lucien Tesnière considered the function of a verb as most important in dependency grammar and invented the term \"actant\", various persons that accompany a verb:\nThis concept of actant is similar to that of argument.\n\nAlgirdas Julien Greimas redefined actants as the 3 pairs \"Modulations\":\n\nIn sociology, the semiotic term \"actant\" was incorporated into the actor-network theory by Bruno Latour and Michel Callon, the activity of which is described as \"mediation\" or \"translation\".\n\nSince ancient times, astrology considered and analyzed the position of the persons concerning a situation with the symbols of the celestial objects and constellations. Georges Polti counted up the needed positions in his famous \"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations\". Étienne Souriau reduced them to only 6 positions named \"dramaturgic functions\" with astrological symbols:\n\n\n"}

It is posed as a criticism of direct realism.\n\nNaturally-occurring illusions best illustrate the argument's points, a notable example concerning a stick: I have a stick, which appears to me to be straight, but when I hold it underwater it seems to bend and distort. I know that the stick is straight and that its apparent flexibility is a result of its being seen through the water, yet I cannot change the mental image I have of the stick as being bent. Since the stick is not in fact bent its appearance can be described as an illusion. Rather than directly perceiving the stick, which would entail our seeing it as it truly is, we must instead perceive it indirectly, by way of an image or \"sense-datum\". This mental representation does not tell us anything about the stick's true properties, which remain inaccessible to us.\n\nWith this being the case, however, how can we be said to be certain of the stick's initial straightness? If all we perceive is sense-data then the stick's apparent initial straightness is just as likely to be false as its half-submerged bent appearance. Therefore, the argument runs, we can never gain any knowledge about the stick, as we only ever perceive a sense-datum, and not the stick itself. This argument was defended by A. J. Ayer.\n\nA critical argument would be as follows: Because the stick provides a contrasting surface in the surrounding water, the bent appearance of the stick is evidence of the previously unaccounted for physical properties of the water. It would be a mistake to categorize an optical effect resulting from a physical cause as sensory fallibility because it results from an increase in information from another previously unaccounted-for object or physical property. Unless the water is not taken into consideration, the example in fact reinforces the reliability of our visual sense to gather information accurately. This criticism, which was most strongly voiced by J.L. Austin, is that perceptual variation which can be attributed to physical causes does not entail a representational disconnect between sense and reference, owing to an unreasonable segregation of parts from the perceived object. \n\nFurther arguments are based on the extended mind theory, which appeals to external sources of mental items. For example, the theory holds that perception is the result of a complex interaction of mind, body and the environment. This would rule out internal items such as sense data as referred to in the statement of the argument.\n\n"}

He was one of the greatest original thinkers of the Brahmo Samaj and did work in comparative religion and on the philosophy of science. He systematised the humanism of the Brahmo philosophical thought. In his work, he underscored the tectonic shift in Brahmo theology in the late eighteenth century from liberal theism to secular humanism. Like his better known ideological precursor Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Seal was an educator, a firm believer in the cause of rationalism and scientific enquiry, a polymath in his own right and yet at the same time a preacher of humanism as a religious doctrine (as opposed to organised religion).\n\nHe was born in Calcutta in 1864. His father Mohendranath Seal was one of the earliest followers of Comtean positivism in Bengal. As a student of philosophy at the General Assembly's Institution (now Scottish Church College, Calcutta), he became attracted to Brahmo theology. And along with his better-known classmate and friend Narendranath Dutta, the future Swami Vivekananda, he regularly attended meetings of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. Later they would part ways with Dutta aligning himself with Keshub Chunder Sen's New Dispensation (and later on to found his own religious movement, the Ramakrishna Mission) and Seal staying on as an initiated member. During this time spent together, both Seal and Dutta sought to understand the intricacies of faith, progress and spiritual insight into the works of John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer and G.W.F. Hegel. Seal had a natural aptitude for mathematics and logic.\n\nHe earned his M.A. degree in philosophy from the University of Calcutta in 1884 and started out as a lecturer at the City College, Calcutta.\n\nAlthough he had started out as a college lecturer, his deep insatiable thirst for knowledge, coupled with financial constraints made him shift from one college to another (the colleges where Seal taught include Morris College, Nagpur and Krishnath College, Berhampur). During the time period 1883 to 1907, he composed his first major work \"New Essays in Criticism\", in which he applied Hegelian dialectics to literary criticism. Although he was an ardent admirer of English Romanticism and Romantic literature in particular, his work reveals him to be an early precursor of the school of logical positivism. In 1915, he earned his doctorate from the University of Calcutta on the subject of \"The Positive Sciences of the Ancient Hindus\".\n\nIn 1896, Maharaja Nripendra Narayan Bhupa Bahadur, the son-in-law of Keshub Chunder Sen offered him the post of a principal of the newly established Victoria College in Cooch Behar. With a certain level of financial security assured, Seal finished his \"New Essays in Criticism\" and also composed an epic poem called \"Quest Eternal\" that traced his intellectual and philosophical odyssey. His further studies on ancient Hindu scientific philosophy led him to contribute a chapter in Prafulla Chandra Roy's \"History of Chemistry in Ancient India\". His publications were noticed abroad and in 1902, his candidacy was seriously considered for a professorship in philosophy at the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe financial support provided by the Maharaja helped Seal to visit Europe in 1899, 1906 and 1911. In 1906, Seal addressed the International Congress of Orientalists in Rome and in 1911, the First Universal Race Congress in London. In 1911, while in London, the sudden death of his patron, the Maharaja, and subsequent withdrawal of financial support for his cultural and comparative-historical studies forced him to quit his job and reconsider his philosophical beliefs. During this phase, he underwent a transformation from being a believer of Brahmo rationalist doctrine to being a spiritual humanist. His analysis on the \"Comparative Studies in Vaishnavism and Christianity\" (1912) expresses the urge to break free from the hegemony of method as applicable in Eurocentric academic enquiry (as in disciplines like Indology and anthropology) and instead focus on comparative methodology, that would be largely immune to any possible colonialist bias. In this, Seal was motivated not merely as a recipient of orientalist hegemony in the academia, or as a counter cultural or for that matter, as a cultural nationalist response to imperialist discourse, as he was due so a more profound love for rationalist spirit of enquiry, albeit in a colonial context. For he was a rational humanist first, and a cultural nationalist much later.\n\nAfter his resignation from Victoria College, he was offered the most prestigious chair of philosophy in India, the King George V professorship of philosophy at the University of Calcutta (other holders of this chair include Professor Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan among others). He used this period (1913–1921) to travel extensively, give lectures, publish books and philosophical tracts and support the efforts of Vice-Chancellor Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee to make the University of Calcutta one of the best known seats of learning to the east of Suez. His scholarly contribution was recognised again with the award of an Honorary doctorate (Doctor of Science) from the University of Calcutta, on 17 December 1921.\n\nHe helped Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in founding the Visva-Bharati University on 22 December 1921. By virtue of being India's leading scholar on philosophy and comparative-historical studies and its first Western visiting scholar, Seal was honoured as the first Chancellor of that university. During the same time, he was also appointed the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, a position he held till 1930, when ill health forced him to retire. In 1926, the government of British India knighted him. During his stay in Mysore, he authored a textbook of Indian philosophy and a biography of Raja Rammohun Roy.\n\nAfter retirement, and notwithstanding his general physical deterioration and failing eyesight, he achieved the grand finale of his long philosophical journey. In 1936, when he was bedridden and blind, he finished his magnum opus called \"Quest Eternal\", which is one of the few modern Indian epics on the theme of the Faustian man in search of the reason for human existence. The conditions in which he wrote parallels that of the English poet John Milton when he wrote his Paradise Lost. The Faustian urge of this brilliant mind to find the meaning of life is at once an existential quest as a Modernist one. Although Seal was writing as a subject of the imperialist enterprise, and not as a party to it, it could be argued that he was a Modernist and an existentialist without his knowing it.\n\nAlthough he was initially inspired by the Hegelian philosophy of the unilinearlity of history, one that resonated well with the official Sadharan Brahmo Samaj doctrine, Seal eventually rejected the Hegelian thesis of the linear flow of historical progress from East to West as being too narrow and parochial. The logical culmination of the Hegelian idea envisioned all human races as being surrogates and appendages to the dominant Greco-Roman-Gothic type, which in its wake resonated perfectly well with the Orientalist doctrine. Seal saw this discourse as being dangerously Eurocentric that in effect precluded the possibility of an equitable cultural dialogue. As he saw it, the philosophy of the subaltern societies or those relegated to the periphery would be seen as being in a state of primitivism when compared to the philosophy of the dominant societies. As he saw it, the Orientalist bias espoused by Hegelianism:\n\nSeal drew close to what is today called postcolonialism. As contrary to colonial discourse, he argued that in any proper comparative-historical analysis, all societies should be seen as being in similar stages in the development of culture. All cultural traditions could be relatively seen as they evolved parallel patterns wherein\n\nAs distinct from the Hegelian world view, Seal espoused that the idea of Western civilisation as being the focal point or the culmination of world civilisation was fundamentally erroneous, that failed to take into account the myriad richness and complex mosaic of cultural continuum that manifested themselves in Hindu, Islamic, and Chinese civilisations. Human civilisation, far from being a centripetal order where the West was to be considered as the center around which other (non-Western) cultures revolved was for Seal, \nThus, as he saw it (in \"Comparative Studies in Vaishnavism and Christianity\"), Vaishnavism and Christianity were two distinct religious traditions, each with its own uniquely rich tradition of historical exegesis that spanned two millennia and could in no way be seen as being phases in the development of (a Eurocentric) human civilisation, as one leading to another in a pattern of cause and effect. Seal's philosophical insights were to be developed by his latter day successor from his college A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the ISKCON movement.\n\nHis epic poem \"Quest Eternal\" is rich in the application of symbolism of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions. It stands out as a very sophisticated cross-cultural analysis of the dilemma of the modern Everyman in search of meaning in life. For Seal, this search for meaning has two dimensions: firstly, the historical dimension that explores how a world view or a zeitgeist is shaped by the continuum of the ancient, medieval and the modern, and secondly the cultural dimension which spells out how specific patterns of human configurations shape a world view in the mode of causality. Seal's hero is on an adventure on a scale far more grandiose, magnificent, world-encompassing and demanding than Goethe's Faust. The hero is the prototype of the modern cosmopolitan man in search of an ever-elusive unity in the pluralistic universe:\n<br>\nSeal's hero (in the initial stages) is not merely the man who is trapped within the confines of ancient social order where he is merely a hapless victim of circumstances beyond his control but the hero who undergoes a spiritual transformation to a medieval wizard knight (who closely resembles the modern scientific man) who seeks out scientific rationalism in nature. He seeks the truth in the \"Magician Commonwealth of Reason\" and eventually wins the ever-elusive trophy of the \"Zodiac shield of the Sun for his victories over Untruth\". However like all well intended adventures, his quest is ultimately Promethean and Sisyphean and must end in failure: \n<br>\nThe modern man of science, much like Dr. Faustus, (and not unlike Christian, an Everyman character) is an eternally homeless wanderer, \"... in search of a Wisdom that is able to master Death\". Death is not merely physical, but a metaphor for \"the dark power in life who frustrates our goals and strivings\" who assists the victory of \"brute Matter and blind Sense\" over \"realms of Soul, of Nature, and of Man in History\". In despair, the hero expostulates:\n<br>\nSeal's hero is not proletarian, and does not take recourse to rationalism, scientism, Marxism or any salvation theology, but a universal redeemer whose task, like Prometheus, is to \"redeem humanity from the bondage of the Gods\":\n<br>\nSeal's epic redeems collective suffering as a means to redeem humanity . His belief in the religion of universal humanity found parallel reflection in Rabindranath Tagore's concept of the \"Vishwa Manav\" of the Universal Man, who would rise from the ashes like a phoenix to redeem the depravities of humanity. And yet like Prometheus, he would be eternally trapped by the vicissitudes of existence.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30320952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30320952", "title": "Branding national myths and symbols", "text": "Branding national myths and symbols\n\nBranding national myths and symbols (BNMS) is a field of research focusing on branding and marketing of a nation's myths and symbols. The research blends the theories of marketing, cultural communications, sociology, public relations, and semiotics. The awareness of a nation’s (or a collective group’s) internal myths and symbols may result in raising cultural relations between nations, according to this theory. The use dates from before the 1990, and field of study dates from about 2000, but was not given this moniker by a scholar until 2009.\n\nThe principles of BNMS are related to, but are different from Nation branding. The main difference between two principles is that nation branding is primarily concerned with raising the global image of a nation for better economic return, while BNMS is concerned with the revealing and demonstrating the meanings behind a nation’s internal myths and symbols. In other words, nation branding is the selling or promotion of the external identity of a nation, while BNMS is the revealing of their internal identity, either for its own citizens to believe in, or to achieve better global relations between nations. According to the theory, each national myth and symbol has its own hidden meanings that may reinforce these misunderstandings between nations.\n\nExamples of BNMS include changing the symbols on currency, a national anthem (see, \"e.g.\", National Anthem Project by the United States), and advertising in political campaigns.\n\nA national myth is an inspiring narrative or anecdote about a nation's past. Such myths often serve as an important national symbol and affirm a set of national values. A national myth may sometimes take the form of a national epic, part of the nation's civil religion, a legend or fictionalized narrative, which has been elevated to serious mythological, symbolical and esteemed level so as to be true to the nation. It might simply over-dramatize true incidents, omit important historical details, or add details for which there is no evidence; or it might simply be a fictional story that no one takes to be true literally, but contains a symbolic meaning for the nation.\n\nThe national folklore of many nations includes a founding myth, which may involve a struggle against colonialism or a war of independence. National myths serve many social and political purposes, such as state-sponsored propaganda, or of inspiring civic virtue and self-sacrifice.\n\nIn some cases, the meaning of the national myth may become disputed among different parts of the population, such as majority and minority groups, which makes \"branding\" and \"advertising\" of the national myth necessary.\n\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has conducted a number of symposia on the protection of folklore, \"i.e.\", \"traditional cultural expressions\", with the goal of preventing their \"misappropriation\" by branding, patenting, trademarking, or copyright by other persons.\n\nA recent, clear example as of 2011 is the use of \"Greco-Roman symbols merged into Christianity\" on the Euro note. Many nations have put their national ideas on their money \"via branding national myths and symbols.\" The image of the crowning Charlemagne is on a Euro note, because he is \"accepted as the Father of Europe and thereby of the EU, with buildings and rooms named after him.\" The accepted \"symbol for EU culture ... symbolises a Doric column ...\" but does not necessarily represent Europe’s other cultures (Norse, etc.). Ultimately, Europe is based on the myth of the demi-god \"Europa\" and many of its symbols are based on ancient Greek art forms. If Turkey joined the EU, the current images could be a source of conflict:\nAnother example from 2011 is that of Japan's self-branding of its scientific expertise, which fell apart after the earthquake and tsunami that March, followed by the nuclear accidents. In the \"New York Times\", Mitsuyoshi Numano wrote, \"It even begins to appear that Japan’s vaunted scientific and technical prowess has taken on the character of a kind of myth, and that myth has deluded the nation’s politicians and business leaders.\"\n\nJonathan Rose first wrote about this concept in 2000, in which he claimed that Canada has had \"an unholy alliance between advertising agencies and political parties\" since the formation of the Confederation in 1867.\n\nIn a 2003 article, Rose wrote that national myths and symbols reinforce and create a \"community and binding [its citizens]. These myths are not judged on their veracity but rather [on] their metaphorical and symbolic meaning.\" Rose maintained that the messages within these \"created\" myths are disseminated and ultimately maintained through its \"civil society from its institutions, public policies and government\". His prototypical study was on the Canadian government's creation of national myths in the 1980s and 1990s. Rose pointed out what was unique (in the 1980s) several major points:\n\n\"Branding National Myths and Symbols\" was first coined in 2009 by Turkish-Australian scholar Hatice Sitki, who proposed in \"Myths, Symbols and Branding: Turkish National Identity and the EU\", that these long-existing myths keep us from truly understanding and working with the \"other\". Sitki proposes that cultural misunderstanding will continue between nations until they understand one another’s cultural myths and symbols. Sitki explains in the \"Cyclical Formula \"Us/Other+Other\"\", how Turkey and the European Union can benefit by accepting that they have, and continue, to play a \"triple role\" to one another.\n\n\"BNMS\" argues that collective groups such as the EU do not need to be \"branded\" in order to improve their economic value. Rather, they need to be branded to achieve their cultural goal of moving from a \"poly-cultural\" society to becoming a \"multicultural\" society. One way for this to be achieved is for nations to realise and work with the hidden meanings of their myths and symbols. Vijay Prashad proposes that the concept of polyculturalism is a way to combat anti-racism. Prashad defines poly cultures as a \"provisional concept grounded in antiracism, rather than in diversity...\" Roger Hewitt takes a different approach to how peoples with different languages can understand each other. Hewitt argues that the concept of polyculturalism is \"not intrinsically equal.\"\n\nThe \"national myths\" used in \"Masterpiece Theatre\" lead to \"strengthen[ing] imperial attitudes\", according to a 2009 book about the spate of Victorian British novels made in films from the 1980s through the 21st Century, and sources it cited.\n\nElizabeth Hafkin Pleck argues that the \"invented tradition ... of Kwanzaa\" was equivalent to the American Indian challenge to \"the National myth of inclusion of Thanksgiving...\"\n\n\n\n"}

He was a major figure in logical empiricism, a 20th-century movement in the philosophy of science. He is especially well known for his articulation of the deductive-nomological model of scientific explanation, which was considered the \"standard model\" of scientific explanation during the 1950s and 1960s. He is also known for the raven paradox (also known as \"Hempel's paradox\").\n\nHempel studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Göttingen and subsequently at the University of Berlin and the Heidelberg University. In Göttingen, he encountered David Hilbert and was impressed by his program attempting to base all mathematics on solid logical foundations derived from a limited number of axioms.\n\nAfter moving to Berlin, Hempel participated in a congress on scientific philosophy in 1929 where he met Rudolf Carnap and became involved in the Berlin Circle of philosophers associated with the Vienna Circle. In 1934, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Berlin with a dissertation on probability theory, titled \" Beiträge zur logischen Analyse des Wahrscheinlichkeitsbegriffs\" (\"Contributions to the Logical Analysis of the Concept of Probability\"). Hans Reichenbach was Hempel's main doctoral supervisor, but after Reichenbach lost his philosophy chair in Berlin in 1933, Wolfgang Köhler and Nicolai Hartmann became the official supervisors.\n\nWithin a year of completing his doctorate, the increasingly repressive and anti-semitic Nazi regime in Germany had prompted Hempel to emigratehis wife was of Jewish ancestryto Belgium. In this, he was aided by the scientist Paul Oppenheim, with whom he co-authored the book \"Der Typusbegriff im Lichte der neuen Logik\" on typology and logic in 1936. In 1937, Hempel emigrated to the United States, where he accepted a position as Carnap's assistant at the University of Chicago. He later held positions at the City College of New York (1939–1948), Yale University (1948–1955) and Princeton University, where he taught alongside Thomas Kuhn and remained until made emeritus in 1973. Between 1974 and 1976, he was an emeritus at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before becoming University Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh in 1977 and teaching there until 1985. In 1989 the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University renamed its Three Lecture Series the 'Carl G. Hempel Lectures' in his honor.\n\nHempel never embraced the term \"logical positivism\" as an accurate description of the Vienna Circle and Berlin Group, preferring to describe those philosophersand himselfas \"logical empiricists\". He believed that the term \"positivism\", with its roots in Auguste Comte, invoked a materialist metaphysics that empiricists need not embrace. He regarded Ludwig Wittgenstein as a philosopher with a genius for stating philosophical insights in striking and memorable language, but believed that he (or, at least, the Wittgenstein of the \"Tractatus\") made claims that could only be supported by recourse to metaphysics. To Hempel, metaphysics involved claims to know things which were not knowable; that is, metaphysical hypotheses were incapable of confirmation or disconfirmation by evidence.\n\nIn 2005, the City of Oranienburg, Hempel's birthplace, renamed one of its streets \"Carl-Gustav-Hempel-Straße\" in his memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was prosecuted in 1945 for atrocities committed by troops under his command in the Philippines, in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Yamashita was charged with \"unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes.\"\n\nFurthermore, the so-called \"Medina standard\" clarified the U.S. law to clearly also encompass U.S officers, so that those as well as foreign officers such as General Yamashita can be prosecuted in the United States. The \"Medina standard\" is based upon the 1971 prosecution of U.S. Army Captain Ernest Medina in connection with the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. It holds that a U.S. commanding officer, being aware of a human rights violation or a war crime, will be held criminally liable if he does not take action. However, Medina was acquitted of all charges.\n\nIn \"The Art of War\", written during the 6th century BC, Sun Tzu argued that it was a commander's duty to ensure that his subordinates conducted themselves in a civilised manner during an armed conflict. Similarly, in the Bible (Kings 1: Chapter 21), within the story of Ahab and the killing of Naboth, King Ahab was blamed for the killing of Naboth on orders from Queen Jezebel, because Ahab (as king) is responsible for everyone in his kingdom.\n\nThe trial of Peter von Hagenbach by an ad hoc tribunal of the Holy Roman Empire in 1474, was the first \"international\" recognition of commanders' obligations to act lawfully. Hagenbach was put on trial for atrocities committed during the occupation of Breisach, found guilty of war crimes and beheaded. Since he was convicted for crimes \"he as a knight was deemed to have a duty to prevent\" Hagenbach defended himself by arguing that he was only following orders from the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, to whom the Holy Roman Empire had given Breisach. Despite the fact there was no explicit use of a doctrine of \"command responsibility\" it is seen as the first trial based on this principle.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the concept developed further, as is seen in the \"Lieber Code\". This regulated accountability by imposing criminal responsibility on commanders for ordering or encouraging soldiers to wound or kill already disabled enemies. Article 71 of the Lieber Code provided that:\n\nWhoever intentionally inflicts additional wounds on an enemy already wholly disabled, or kills such an enemy, or \"who orders or encourages soldiers to do so\", shall suffer death, if duly convicted, whether he belongs to the Army of the United States, or is an enemy captured after having committed his misdeed.\nThe Hague Convention of 1899 was the first attempt at codifying the principle of command responsibility on a multinational level and was reaffirmed and updated entirely by the Hague Convention of 1907. The doctrine was specifically found within \"Laws and Customs of War on Land\" (Hague IV); October 18, 1907: \"Section I on Belligerents: Chapter I The Qualifications of Belligerents\", \"Section III Military Authority over the territory of the hostile State\", and \"Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention\" (Hague X); October 18, 1907. Article 1 of Section I of the 1907 Hague IV stated that: \n\nThe laws, rights, and duties of war apply not only to armies, but also to militia and volunteer corps fulfilling the following conditions: \nAnother example of command responsibility is shown in Article 43 of Section III of the same convention which stipulated that: \n\nThe authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.\nIn \"Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention\" (Hague X), Article 19 stated that:\n\nThe commanders in chief of the belligerent fleets must arrange for the details of carrying out the preceding articles, as well as for cases not covered thereby, in accordance with the instructions of their respective Governments and in conformity with the general principles of the present Convention.\nWhile the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 does not explicitly create a doctrine of command responsibility, it does uphold a notion that a superior must account for their actions of his subordinates. It also suggests that military superiors have a duty to ensure that their troops act in accordance with international law and if they fail to command them lawfully, their respective states may be held criminally liable. In turn, those states may choose to punish their commanders. At such, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 has been viewed as a foundational root of modern doctrine of command responsibility. After World War I, the Allied Powers' Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on the Enforcement of Penalties recommended the establishment of an international tribunal, which would try individuals for \"order[ing], or, with knowledge thereof and with power to intervene, abstain[ing] from preventing or taking measures to prevent, putting an end to or repressing, violations of the laws or customs of war.\"\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, private contractors have become more prevalent in zones of conflict. Both political and legal scholars highlight the multiple challenges this has introduced when tracing the responsibility of crimes in the field. Some, such as Martha Lizabeth Phelps, go as far to claim that if hired contractors are indistinguishable from national troops, the contractors borrow the state's legitimacy. The command responsibility of actions in warfare become increasingly unclear when actors are viewed as being part of a state's force, but are, in truth, private actors.\n\nCommand responsibility is an omission mode of individual criminal liability: the superior is responsible for crimes committed by his subordinates and for failing to prevent or punish (as opposed to crimes he ordered). \"In re Yamashita\" before a United States military commission in 1945, General Yamashita became the first to be charged solely on the basis of responsibility for an omission. He was commanding the 14th Area Army of Japan in the Philippines during the Pacific Theater of World War II when some of the Japanese troops engaged in atrocities against thousands of civilians and prisoners of war. As commanding officer, he was charged with \"unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes.\"\n\nBy finding Yamashita guilty, the Commission adopted a new standard, stating that where \"vengeful actions are widespread offenses and there is no effective attempt by a commander to discover and control the criminal acts, such a commander may be held responsible, even criminally liable.\" However, the ambiguous wording resulted in a long-standing debate about the amount of knowledge required to establish command responsibility. The matter was appealed, and was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in 1946. After sentencing, Yamashita was executed.\n\nFollowing \"In re Yamashita\", courts clearly accepted that a commander's actual knowledge of unlawful actions is sufficient to impose individual criminal responsibility.\n\nIn the \"High Command Case\" (1947–8), the U.S. military tribunal argued that in order for a commander to be criminally liable for the actions of his subordinates \"there must be a personal dereliction\" which \"can only occur where the act is directly traceable to him or where his failure to properly supervise his subordinates constitutes criminal negligence on his part\" based upon \"a wanton, immoral disregard of the action of his subordinates amounting to acquiescence\".\n\nIn the \"Hostage Case\" (1947–8), the U.S. military tribunal seemed to limit the situations where a commander has a duty to know to instances where he has already had some information regarding subordinates' unlawful actions.\n\nAfter World War II, the parameters of command responsibility were thus increased, imposing liability on commanders for their failure to prevent the commission of crimes by their subordinates. These cases – the latter two part of the Nürnberg tribunals – discussed explicitly the requisite standard of \"mens rea\", and were unanimous in finding that a lesser level of knowledge than actual knowledge may be sufficient.\n\nThe first international treaty to comprehensively codify the doctrine of command responsibility was the Additional Protocol I (\"AP I\") of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Article 86(2) states that:\n\nArticle 87 obliges a commander to \"prevent and, where necessary, to suppress and report to competent authorities\" any violation of the Conventions and of AP I.\n\nIn Article 86(2) for the first time a provision would \"explicitly address the knowledge factor of command responsibility\".\n\nIn the discussion regarding \"command responsibility\" the term \"command\" can be defined as\n\nA. De jure (legal) command, which can be both military and civilian. The determining factor here is not rank but subordination. Four structures are identified:\nInternational case law has developed two special types of \"de jure commanders.\"\n\nB. De facto (factual) command, which specifies effective control, as opposed to formal rank. This needs a superior-subordinate relationship. Indicia are:\n\nAdditional Protocol I and the Statutes of the ICTY, the ICTR, and the ICC makes prevention or prosecution of crimes mandatory.\n\nFollowing World War II, communis opinio was that the atrocities committed by the Nazis were so severe a special tribunal had to be held. However, contemporary jurists such as Harlan Fiske Stone criticized the Nuremberg Trials as victor's justice. The Nuremberg Charter determined the basis to prosecute people for:\n\nThe jurisdiction ratione personae is considered to apply to \"leaders, organisers, instigators and accomplices\" involved in planning and committing those crimes.\n\nThe ICTY statute article 7 (3) establishes that the fact that crimes \"were committed by a subordinate does not relieve his superior of criminal responsibility if he knew or had reason to know that the subordinate was about to commit such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators.\"\n\nIn The Prosecutor v. Delalić et al. (\"the Čelebići case\") first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that \"had reason to know\" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have \"had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of ... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether ... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates.\"\n\nIn The Prosecutor v. Blaškić (\"the Blaškić case\") this view was corroborated. However, it differed regarding \"mens rea\" required by AP I. The Blaškić Trial Chamber concluded that \"had reason to know\", as defined by the ICTY Statute, also imposes a stricter \"should have known\" standard of \"mens rea\".\n\nThe conflicting views of both cases were addressed by the Appeals Chambers in Čelebići and in a separate decision in Blaškić. Both rulings hold that some information of unlawfal acts by subordinates must be available to the commander following which he did not, or inadequately, discipline the perpetrator.\n\nThe concept of command responsibility has developed significantly in the jurisprudence of the ICTY. One of the most recent judgements that extensively deals with the subject is the Halilović judgement of 16 November 2005 (para. 22-100).\n\nThe United Nations Security Council Resolution 955 (1994) set up an international criminal tribunal to judge people responsible for the Rwandan Genocide and other serious violations of international law in Rwanda, or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between 1 January and 31 December 1994; additional later resolutions expanded the scope and timeline of the tribunal. The tribunal has jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.\n\nThe judgement against Jean-Paul Akayesu established rape as a war crime. Rape was placed in line with \"other acts of serious bodily and mental harm\" rather than the historical view of rape as \"a trophy of war.\" Akayesu was held responsible for his actions and non-actions as mayor and police commander of a commune in which many Tutsis were killed, raped, tortured, and otherwise persecuted.\n\nAnother case prosecuted persons in charge of a radio station and a newspaper that incited and then encouraged the Rwandan genocide. The defendants were charged with genocide, incitement to genocide, and crimes against humanity for their positions of control and command in the \"hate media,\" although they physically had not committed the acts.\n\nFollowing several ad hoc tribunals, the international community decided on a comprehensive court of justice for future crimes against humanity. This resulted in the International Criminal Court, which identified four categories.\n\nArticle 28 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court codified the doctrine of command responsibility. With Article 28(a) military commanders are imposed with individual responsibility for crimes committed by forces under their effective command and control if they:\n\nIt uses the stricter \"should have known\" standard of mens rea, instead of \"had reason to know,\" as defined by the ICTY Statute.\n\nThe Bush administration has adopted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act and entered in Article 98 agreements in an attempt to protect any US citizen from appearing before this court. As such it interferes with implementing the command responsibility principle when applicable to US citizens.\n\nA number of commentators have advanced the argument that the principle of \"command responsibility\" could make high-ranking officials within the Bush administration guilty of war crimes committed either with their knowledge or by persons under their control.\n\nAs a reaction to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. government adopted several controversial measures (e.g., asserting \"unlawful combatant\" status and \"enhanced interrogation methods\").\n\nAlberto Gonzales and others argued that detainees should be considered \"unlawful combatants\" and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions in multiple memoranda regarding these perceived legal gray areas.\n\nGonzales' statement that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions \"substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act\" suggests, at the least, an awareness by those involved in crafting policies in this area that U.S. officials are involved in acts that could be seen to be war crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court overruled the premise on which this argument is based in \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\", in which it ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applies to detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and that the Guantanamo military commission used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law because it was not created by Congress.\n\nOn April 14, 2006, Human Rights Watch said that Secretary Donald Rumsfeld could be criminally liable for his alleged involvement in the abuse of Mohammad al-Qahtani. Dave Lindorff contends that by ignoring the Geneva Conventions. the U.S. administration, including President Bush, as Commander-in-Chief, is culpable for war crimes. In addition, former chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg Trials Benjamin Ferencz has called the invasion of Iraq a \"clear breach of law\", and as such it constitutes a crime against peace. On November 14, 2006, invoking universal jurisdiction, legal proceedings were started in Germany - for their alleged involvement of prisoner abuse - against Donald Rumsfeld, Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo, George Tenet and others. This allegedly prompted recently retired Donald Rumsfeld to cancel a planned visit to Germany.\n\nFormer Army Lt. Ehren Watada refused to be deployed to Iraq based on his claims of command responsibility. Although his own deployment was not ordered until after Security Council Resolution 1511 authorized a multinational force in Iraq, Watada argued that the invasion of Iraq was illegal, and as such he claimed he was bound by command responsibility to refuse to take part in an illegal war. He was discharged from the Army in 2009.\n\nThe Military Commissions Act of 2006 is seen as an amnesty law for crimes committed in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act and by abolishing habeas corpus, effectively making it impossible for detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.\n\nLuis Moreno-Ocampo told \"The Sunday Telegraph\" that he is willing to start an inquiry by the International Criminal Court (ICC), and possibly a trial, for war crimes committed in Iraq involving British Prime Minister Tony Blair and American President George W. Bush, even though under the Rome Statute the ICC has no jurisdiction over Bush, since the United States is not a State Party to the relevant treaty—unless Bush were accused of crimes inside a State Party, or the UN Security Council (where the United States has a veto) requested an investigation. However, Blair does fall under ICC jurisdiction as Britain is a State Party.\n\nNat Hentoff wrote on August 28, 2007, that a leaked report by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the July 2007 report by Human Rights First and Physicians for Social Responsibility, titled Leave No Marks: Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the Risk of Criminality, might be used as evidence of American war crimes if there was a Nuremberg-like trial regarding the War on Terror.\n\nShortly before the end of President Bush's second term, newsmedia in other countries started opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the United States is obligated to hold those responsible for prisoner abuse to account under criminal law. One proponent of this view was the United Nations special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Professor Manfred Nowak) who, on January 20, 2009, remarked on German television that former president George W. Bush had lost his head of state immunity and under international law, the United States would now be mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture. Law professor Dietmar Herz explained Nowak's comments by saying that under U.S. and international law former President Bush is criminally responsible for adopting torture as an interrogation tool.\n\nHuman Rights Watch commented on this conflict by stating that:\n\nThe Sunday Times in March 2006, and the Sudan Tribune in March 2008, reported that the UN Panel of Experts determined that Salah Gosh and Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein\n\nFollowing an inquiry by the United Nations, regarding allegations of involvement of the Government in genocide, the dossier was referred to the International Criminal Court. On May 2, 2007, the ICC issued arrest warrants for militia leader Ali Muhammad al-Abd al-Rahman, of the Janjaweed, a.k.a. Ali Kushayb, and Ahmad Muhammad Haroun for crimes against humanity and war crimes. To this day Sudan has refused to comply with the arrest warrants and has not turned them over to the ICC.\n\nThe International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, announced on July 14, 2008, ten criminal charges against President Omar al-Bashir, accusing him of sponsoring war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. The ICC's prosecutors have charged al-Bashir with genocide because he \"masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part\" three tribal groups in Darfur because of their ethnicity. The ICC's prosecutor for Darfur, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, is expected within months to ask a panel of ICC judges to issue an arrest warrant for Bashir.\n\nFor his conduct as President of Zimbabwe, including allegations of torture and murder of political opponents, it is suggested Robert Mugabe may be prosecuted using this doctrine. Because Zimbabwe has not subscribed to the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction it may be authorised by the United Nations Security Council. The precedent for this was set by its referral to bring indictments relating to the crimes committed in Darfur. Otherwise, a Zimbabwean regime following Mugabe's would have jurisdiction over his alleged crimes (in the absence of any amnesty law) as would the numerous countries with universal jurisdiction over torture, including the UK.\n\n"}

In guided imagery, a trained practitioner or teacher helps a participant or patient to evoke and generate mental images that simulate or re-create the sensory perception of sights, sounds, tastes, smells, movements, and touch, as well as imaginative or mental content that the participating subject experiences as defying conventional sensory categories.\n\nNonetheless, visual and auditory mental images are reported as being the most frequently experienced by people ordinarily, in controlled experiments, and when participating in guided imagery, with visual images remaining the most extensively researched and documented in scientific literature.\n\nAll mental imagery, including the visual images generated through creative visualization, can precipitate or be associated with strong emotions or feelings.\n\nThe therapeutic application of creative visualization aims to educate the patient in altering mental imagery, which in turn contributes to emotional change. Specifically, the process facilitates the patient in replacing images that aggravate physical pain, exacerbate psychological pain, reaffirm debilitation, recollect and reconstruct distressing events, or intensify disturbing feelings such as hopelessness and anxiety, with imagery that emphasizes and precipitates physical comfort, cognitive clarity, and emotional equanimity. This process may be facilitated by a practitioner or teacher in person to an individual or a group. Alternatively, the participants or patients may follow guidance provided by a sound recording, video, or audiovisual media comprising spoken instruction that may be accompanied by music or sound.\n\nWhether provided in person, or delivered via media, the verbal instruction consists of words, often pre-scripted, intended to direct the participant's attention to intentionally generated visual mental images that precipitate a positive psychologic and physiologic response, incorporating increased mental and physical relaxation and decreased mental and physical stress.\n\nAccording to the computational theory of imagery, which derives from experimental psychology, the process of creative visualization comprises four stages:\n\nStage 1 is \"Image Generation\". This involves generating mental imagery, from memory, from fantasy, or a combination of both.\n\nStage 2 is \"Image Maintenance\". This involves the intentional sustaining or maintaining of imagery, without which a mental image is subject to rapid decay, and does not remain for sufficient duration to proceed to the next stages.\n\nStage 3 is \"Image Inspection\". In this stage, once generated and maintained, a mental image is inspected and explored, elaborated in detail, and interpreted in relation to the participant. This often involves a scanning process, by which the participant directs attention across and around an image, simulating shifts in perceptual perspective.\n\nStage 4 is \"Image Transformation\". In this stage, the participant transforms, modifies, or alters the content of generated mental imagery, in such a way as to substitute images that provoke negative feelings, are indicative of suffering and exacerbate psychological pain, or that reaffirm disability or debilitation, for those that elicit positive emotion, and are suggestive of autonomy, ability to cope, and an increased degree of mental aptitude and physical ability.\n\nFor the participant to benefit from this staged process of creative visualization, he or she must be capable of or susceptible to absorption, which is an \"openness to absorbing and self-altering experiences\".\n\nFurthermore, the process of processing visual images places demands upon cognitive attentional resources, including working memory.\n\nConsequently, in clinical practice, creative visualization is often provided as part of a multi-modal strategy that integrates other interventions, most commonly guided meditation or some form of meditative praxis, relaxation techniques, and meditation music or receptive music therapy, because those methods can increase the participant's or patient's capacity for or susceptibility to absorption, enhance control of attention, and replenish requisite cognitive resources, thereby increasing the potential efficacy of creative visualization.\n\nIndividuals with ADHD often exhibit a greater creative potential, and an increased ability to produce and visualize unique verbal and nonverbal ideas. However, they also show a weaker ability to generate creative solutions when given restrictive criteria, such as procedure, practicality, and time. This weakness is due to cognitive rigidity, which frequently co-morbid with ADHD. The weaknesses in attention, focus, and motivation are exacerbated by frustration from rigidity, making creative conceptualization substantially harder when guidelines are given. However, increased mind-wandering, lateral thinking, and persistence from ADHD allows for more out of the box thinking. As a result, while affected individuals are able to visualize more creative and original abstractions, they fall short on creating and finalizing ideas when given specific criteria.\n\nAlthough, visual and auditory mental images are reported as being the most frequently experienced by people and even with visual images remaining the most extensively researched and documented in scientific literature, the term \"creative visualization\" is far less frequently used in scientific, peer-reviewed, and scholarly publications than the term \"guided imagery\", which research authors commonly use to indicate the generation, maintenance, inspection, and transformation of mental imagery across all modalities, and to refer exclusively and specifically to the processing of visual imagery. Also, some authors use the term \"creative visualization\" interchangeably with \"guided imagery\". Meanwhile, others refer to guided imagery in a way to indicate that it includes creative visualization.\n\nFurthermore, investigative, clinical, scientific, and academic authors frequently measure, analyze, and discuss the effects of creative visualization and guided imagery, collectively and inseparably from other mind–body interventions they are commonly combined with—including meditation music or receptive music therapy, relaxation, guided meditation or meditative praxis, and self-reflective diary-keeping or journaling. This often makes it difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any one of the specific techniques.\n\nCreative visualization might help people with cancer feel more positive, but there \"is no compelling evidence to suggest positive effects on physical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.\"\n"}
{"id": "4966357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4966357", "title": "Dhyana in Hinduism", "text": "Dhyana in Hinduism\n\nDhyana (IAST: Dhyāna) in Hinduism means contemplation and meditation. \"Dhyana\" is taken up in Yoga exercises, and is a means to samadhi and self-knowledge.\n\nThe various concepts of \"dhyana\" and its practice originated in the Vedic era of Hinduism, and the practice has been influential within the diverse traditions of Hinduism. It is, in Hinduism, a part of a self-directed awareness and unifying Yoga process by which the yogi realizes Self (Atman, soul), one's relationship with other living beings, and Ultimate Reality. Dhyana is also found in other Indian religions such as Buddhism and Jainism. These developed along with dhyana in Hinduism, partly independently, partly influencing each other.\n\nThe term \"Dhyana\" appears in Aranyaka and Brahmana layers of the Vedas but with unclear meaning, while in the early Upanishads it appears in the sense of \"contemplation, meditation\" and an important part of self-knowledge process. It is described in numerous Upanishads of Hinduism, and in Patanjali's Yogasutras - a key text of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy.\n\n\"Dhyāna\" (Sanskrit: ध्यान, Pali: झान) means \"contemplation, reflection\" and \"profound, abstract meditation\".\n\nThe root of the word is \"Dhi\", which in the earliest layer of text of the Vedas refers to \"imaginative vision\" and associated with goddess Saraswati with powers of knowledge, wisdom and poetic eloquence. This term developed into the variant \"dhya-\" and \"dhyana\", or \"meditation\".\n\nThomas Berry states that Dhyana, is \"sustained attention\" and the \"application of mind to the chosen point of concentration\". Dhyana is contemplating, reflecting on whatever \"Dharana\" has focused on. If in the sixth limb of yoga one is concentrating on a personal deity, Dhyana is its contemplation. If the concentration was on one object, Dhyana is non-judgmental, non-presumptuous observation of that object. If the focus was on a concept/idea, Dhyana is contemplating that concept/idea in all its aspects, forms and consequences. Dhyana is uninterrupted train of thought, current of cognition, flow of awareness.\n\nA related term is \"nididhyāsana\", the pondering over Upanishadic statements. It is a composite of three terms, namely \"dhyai\", \"upasana\" (\"dwelling upon\"), and \"bhavana\" (\"cultivating\").\n\nThe term \"dhyana\" is used in Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, with somewhat different meanings.\nThe origins of the practice of \"dhyana\", which culminates into \"samadhi\", are a matter of dispute. According to Bronkhorst, the mainstream concept developed and is evidenced in Vedic era texts of Hinduism. Dhyana, states Sagarmal Jain, has been essential to Jaina religious practices, but the origins of Dhyana and Yoga in the pre-canonical era (before 6th-century BCE) is unclear, and it likely developed in the Sramanic culture of ancient India.\n\nThe earliest Jaina texts, on Dhyana such as \"Sutrakranga\", \"Antakrta-Dasanga\" and \"Rsibhashita\", mention Uddaka Ramaputta who is said to be the teacher of some meditation methods to Buddha, as well as the originator of \"Vipassana\" and \"Preksha\" meditation techniques. The Jaina tradition believes Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara, to have founded meditation, but there is no historical confirming evidence. The earliest mention of Dhyana in the canonical Jaina texts simply mention \"Dhyana\" as a means of emancipation, but in them ascetic practices are not emphasized nor is the discussion as systematic as in later Jaina texts or Hindu texts such as the Patanjali's Yogasutras. There is no archeological or literary evidence, states Sagarmal Jain, about the origins of systems for Dhyana and Yoga, and there is a great deal of similarities between Jaina, Buddhist, Ajivika, Samkhya, Yoga and other ancient Indian traditions. The earliest texts, such as \"Tattvarthasutra\" suggest that these ideas developed in parallel, sometimes with different terms for similar ideas in various Indian traditions, influencing each other.\n\nBuddhism introduced its own ideas, states Bronkhorst, such as the four dhyanas, which did not affect the mainstream meditation traditions in Jaina and Hindu traditions for a long time. All traditions, Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, introduced unique aspects and context to \"Dhyana\", and mutually influenced each other. According to Bronkhorst, while Jaina and Hindu meditation traditions predate Buddhism, the Buddhist terminology such as Samadhi, may have influenced the wording found in one of the several types of Dhyana found in the Mahabharata as well as parts of Patanjali's Yogasutras.\n\nAlexander Wynne interprets Bronkhorst as stating that \"dhyana\" was a Jaina tradition, from which both Hinduism and Buddhism borrowed ideas on meditation. Wynne adds that Bronkhorst opinion \"understates the role of meditation\" in early Brahmanical tradition. Dhyana was incorporated into Buddhism from Brahmanical practices, suggests Wynne, in the Nikayas ascribed to Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. In early Brahamical yoga, the goal of meditation was considered to be a nondual state identical to unmanifest state of Brahman, where subject-object duality had been dissolved. The early Buddhist practices adapted these old yogic methods, pairing it to mindfulness and attainment of insight. Kalupahana states that the Buddha \"reverted to the meditational practices\" he had learned from Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta.\n\nIn Hinduism, state Jones and Ryan, the term first appears in the Upanishads. Techniques of concentration or meditation are a Vedic tradition, states Frits Staal, because these ideas are found in the early Upanishads as \"dhyana or abhidhyana\". In most of the later Hindu yoga traditions, which derive form Patanjali's Raja Yoga, \"dhyana\" is \"a refined meditative practice\", a \"deeper concentration of the mind\", which is taken up after preceding exercises such as mastering \"pranayama\" (breath control) and \"dharana\" (mental focus).\n\nThe term \"dhyanam\" appears in Vedic literature, such as hymn 4.36.2 of the Rigveda and verse 10.11.1 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. The term, in the sense of meditation, appears in the Upanishads. The Kaushitaki Upanishad uses it in the context of mind and meditation in verses 3.2 to 3.6, for example as follows:\n\nThe term appears in the context of \"contemplate, reflect, meditate\" in verses of chapters 1.3, 2.22, 5.1, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.26 of the Chandogya Upanishad, chapters 3.5, 4.5 and 4.6 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and verses 6.9 to 6.24 of the Maitri Upanishad. The word \"Dhyana\" refers to meditation in Chandogya Upanishad, while the Prashna Upanishad asserts that the meditation on AUM () leads to the world of Brahman (Ultimate Reality).\n\nThe development of meditation in the Vedic era paralleled the ideas of \"interiorization\", where social, external yajna fire rituals (\"Agnihotra\") were replaced with meditative, internalized rituals (\"Prana-agnihotra\"). This interiorization of Vedic fire-ritual into yogic meditation ideas from Hinduism, that are mentioned in the Samhita and Aranyaka layers of the Vedas and more clearly in chapter 5 of the Chandogya Upanishad (~800 to 600 BCE), are also found in later Buddhist texts and esoteric variations such as the \"Dighanikaya\", \"Mahavairocana-sutra\" and the \"Jyotirmnjari\", wherein the Buddhist texts describe meditation as \"inner forms of fire oblation/sacrifice\". This interiorization of fire rituals, where life is conceptualized as an unceasing sacrifice and emphasis is placed on meditation occurs in the classic Vedic world, in the early Upanishads and other texts such as the Shrauta Sutras and verse 2.18 of Vedic \"Vaikhanasa Smarta Sutra\".\n\nBeyond the early Upanishads composed before 5th-century BCE, the term \"Dhyana\" and the related terms such as \"Dhyai\" (Sanskrit: ध्यै, deeply meditate) appears in numerous Upanishads composed after the 5th-century BCE, such as: chapter 1 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, chapters 2 and 3 of Mundaka Upanishad, chapter 3 of Aitareya Upanishad, chapter 11 of Mahanarayana Upanishad, and in various verses of Kaivalya Upanishad, Chulika Upanishad, Atharvasikha Upanishad, Brahma Upanishad, Brahmabindu Upanishad, Amritabindu Upanishad, Tejobindu Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Kshuriki Upanishad, Dhyana-bindu Upanishad, Atharvasiras Upanishad, Maha Upanishad, Pranagnihotra Upanishad, Yogasikha Upanishad, Yogatattva Upanishad, Kathasruti Upanishad, Hamsa Upanishad, Atmaprabodha Upanishad and Visudeva Upanishad.\nThe Brahma-sutras, which distills the teachings of the Upanishads and is one of three foundational texts of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, states that \"Dhyana\" is not \"Prativedam\" (or, one for each Veda), and meditation belongs to all Vedic schools.\n\nAdi Shankara dedicates an extensive chapter on meditation, in his commentary on the Brahma-sutras, in \"Sadhana\" as essential to spiritual practice. His discussion there is similar to his extensive commentary on \"Dhyana\" in his Bhasya on Bhagavad Gita and the early Upanishads.\n\nThe verse 30.8 of the ancient Vasistha Dharma-sutra declares meditation as a virtue, and interiorized substitute equivalent of a fire sacrifice.\n\nThe term Dhyana, and related words with the meaning of meditation appears in many chapters of the Bhagavad Gita, such as in chapters 2, 12, 13 and 18. The chapter 6 of the Gita is titled as the \"Yoga of Meditation\".\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, one of the three key books of Vedanta school of Hinduism, states four \"Marga\" (paths) to purify one's mind and to reach the summit of spirituality – the path of Unselfish Work, the path of Knowledge, the path of Devotion and the path of Meditation (\"Dhyana\"). Huston Smith summarizes the need and value of meditation in Gita, as follows (abridged):\n\nMeditation in the Bhagavad Gita is a means to one's spiritual journey, requiring three moral values – \"Satya\" (truthfulness), \"Ahimsa\" (non-violence) and \"Aparigraha\" (non-covetousness). Dhyana in this ancient Hindu text, states Huston Smith, can be about whatever the person wants or finds spiritual, ranging from \"the manifestation of divinity in a religious symbol in a human form\", or an inspiration in nature such as \"a snow-covered mountain, a serene lake in moonlight, or a colorful horizon at sunrise or sunset\", or melodic sounds or syllables such as those that \"are intoned as mantras and rhythmically repeated\" like Om that is audibly or silent contemplated on. The direction of deep meditation, in the text, is towards detaching the mind from sensory distractions and disturbances outside of oneself, submerging it instead on the indwelling spirit and one's soul towards the state of \"Samadhi\", a state of bliss (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6: Yoga of Meditation).\n\nThe Gita presents a synthesis of the Brahmanical concept of Dharma with bhakti, the yogic ideals of liberation through jnana, and Samkhya philosophy. It is the \"locus classicus\" of the \"Hindu synthesis\" which emerged around the beginning of the Common Era, integrating Brahmanic and shramanic ideas with theistic devotion.\n\nThe \"Bhagavad Gita\" talks of four branches of yoga:\n\nThe Dhyana Yoga system is specifically described by Krishna in chapter 6 of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" to Arjuna.\n\nIn the \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\" (dated ca. 400 CE), a key text of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, \"Dhyana\" is the seventh limb of this path, following Dharana and preceding Samadhi. Dhyana is integrally related to Dharana, one leads to other. Dharana is a state of mind, Dhyana the process of mind. Dhyana is distinct from Dharana in that the meditator becomes actively engaged with its focus.\n\nPatanjali defines contemplation (\"Dhyana\") as the mind process, where the mind is fixed on something, and then there is \"a course of uniform modification of knowledge\". Bronkhorst states that Buddhist influences are noticeable in the first chapter of the Yogasutras, and confirmed by sutra 1.20 because it mentions asamprajnata samadhi is preceded by \"trust (sraddha), energy (virya), mindfulness (smriti), concentration (samadhi), and insight (prajna)\". According to Bronkhorst, \"the definition of Yoga given in the first chapter of the \"Yoga Sutra\" does not fit the descriptions contained in the same chapter,\" and this may suggest the sutra incorporated Buddhist elements as described in the four jhanas. Wynne, in contrast to Bronkhorst's theory, states that the evidence in early Buddhist texts, such as those found in \"Suttapitaka\", suggest that these foundational ideas on formless meditation and element meditation were borrowed from pre-Buddha Brahamanical sources attested in early Upanishads and ultimately the cosmological theory found in the Nasadiya-sukta of the Rigveda.\n\nAdi Shankara, in his commentary on \"Yoga Sutras\", distinguishes Dhyana from Dharana, by explaining Dhyana as the yoga state when there is only the \"stream of continuous thought about the object, uninterrupted by other thoughts of different kind for the same object\"; Dharana, states Shankara, is focussed on one object, but aware of its many aspects and ideas about the same object. Shankara gives the example of a yogin in a state of dharana on morning sun may be aware of its brilliance, color and orbit; the yogin in dhyana state contemplates on sun's orbit alone for example, without being interrupted by its color, brilliance or other related ideas.\n\nIn Patanjali's Raja Yoga, also called \"meditation yoga\", dhyana is \"a refined meditative practice\", a \"deeper concentration of the mind\", which is taken up after preceding exercises. In Hinduism, dhyāna is considered to be an instrument to gain self-knowledge. It is a part of a self-directed awareness and unifying Yoga process by which a world that by default is experienced as disjointed, comes to be experienced as Self, and an integrated oneness with Brahman. The Brahman has been variously defined in Hinduism, ranging from non-theistic non-dualistic Ultimate Reality or supreme soul, to theistic dualistic God.\n\nThe stage of meditation preceding dhyāna is called \"dharana\". Dharana, which means \"holding on\", is the focusing and holding one's awareness to one object for a long period of time. In Yogasutras, the term implies fixing one's mind on an object of meditation, which could be one's breath or the tip of one's nose or the image of one's personal deity or anything of the yogi's choice.\n\nIn the \"Jangama Dhyāna\" technique, for example, the meditator concentrates the mind to a spot between the eyebrows. According to Patañjali, this is one method of achieving the initial concentration (\"dhāraṇā\": Yoga Sutras, III: 1) necessary for the mind to become introverted in meditation (\"dhyāna\": Yoga Sutras, III: 2). In deeper practice of the technique, the mind concentrated between the eyebrows begins to automatically lose all location and focus on the watching itself. This step prepares one to begin the practice of Dhyana.\n\nThe Yogasutras in verse 3.2 and elsewhere, states Edwin Bryant, defines \"Dhyana\" as the \"continuous flow of the same thought or image of the object of meditation, without being distracted by any other thought\". Vivekananda explains \"Dhyana\" in Patanjali's Yogasutras as, \"When the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point. This state is called Dhyana\".\n\nWhile Dharana was the stage in yoga where the yogi held one's awareness to one object for a long period of time, Dhyana is concentrated meditation where he or she contemplates without interruption the object of meditation, beyond any memory of ego or anything else.\n\nIn Dhyana, the meditator is not conscious of the act of meditation (i.e. is not aware that he/she is meditating) but is only aware that he/she exists (consciousness of \"being\"), his mind and the object of meditation. Dhyana is distinct from Dharana, in that the yogi contemplates on the object of meditation and the object's aspects only, free from distractions, with his mind during Dhyana. With practice, the process of Dhyana awakens self-awareness (soul, the purusha or Atman), the fundamental level of existence and Ultimate Reality in Hinduism, the non-afflicted, conflictless and blissful state of freedom and liberation (moksha).\n\nThe \"Dhyana\" step prepares a yogi to proceed towards practicing \"Samadhi\". Swami Vivekananda describes the teachings of Yogasutras in the following way:\nMichael Washburn states that the \"Yogasutras\" text identifies stepwise stages for meditative practice progress, and that \"Patanjali distinguishes between Dharana which is effortful focusing of attention, Dhyana which is easy continuous one-pointedness, and Samadhi which is absorption, ecstasy, contemplation\". A person who begins meditation practice, usually practices \"Dharana\". With practice he is able to gain ease in which he learns how to contemplate in a sharply focussed fashion, and then \"he is able more and more easily to give uninterrupted attention to the meditation object; that is to say, he attains Dhyana\". With further practice, the yogi \"ceases being detachedly vigilant\" and enters \"a state of fusion with the meditation object\" which is Samadhi.\n\nSamadhi is oneness with the object of meditation. There is no distinction between act of meditation and the object of meditation. Samadhi is of two kinds, with and without support or an object of meditation:\n\nBoth object-centered and objectless-centered meditative practice, in Hindu texts, leads to progressively more bright, pellucid and poised state of \"powerful, pure, \"Sattvic\"\" state of blissful Self, ultimately leading to the knowledge of \"purusha\" or Atman-Brahman (soul), states Michael Washburn. This is the state, in Hindu tradition, where states Gregor Maehle, the yogi or yogini realizes \"the Atman in you is the Atman in everyone\", and leading to the realization of Self.\n\nThe practice of Dharana, Dhyana and Samādhi together is designated as Samyama (Sanskrit: संयम, holding together) in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Samyama, asserts the text, is a powerful meditative tool and can be applied to a certain object, or entire class of objects. A yogi who does \"Samyama\" on \"Pratyaya\" (notions, customs) of men, states sutra 3.19 of the text, knows the series of \"psycho-mental states of other men\". A yogi after successfully completing \"Samyama\" on \"distinction of object and idea\" realizes the \"cries of all creatures\", states sutra 3.17. A \"Samyama\" on friendliness, compassion and joy leads to these powers emerging within the yogi, states sutra 3.23. The meditation technique discussed in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali is thus, states Mircea Eliade, a means to knowledge and siddhi (yogic power).\n\nVācaspati Miśra, a scholar of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, in his bhasya on the Yogasutra's 3.30 wrote, \"Whatever the yogin desires to know, he should perform \"samyama\" in respect to that object\". Moksha (freedom, liberation) is one such practice, where the object of \"samyama\" is Sattva (pure existence), Atman (soul) and Purusha (Universal principle) or Bhagavan (God). Adi Shankara, another scholar of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, extensively commented on \"samyama\" as a means for \"Jnana-yoga\" (path of knowledge) to achieve the state of \"Jivanmukta\" (living liberation).\n\nBy the time the Yogasutras were compiled, the Hindu traditions had two broad forms of meditation, namely the ecstatic and enstatic types.\n\nAccording to Jianxin Li \"Samprajnata Samadhi\" of Hinduism may be compared to the \"rupa jhanas\" of Buddhism. This interpretation may conflict with Gombrich and Wynne, according to whom the first and second \"jhana\" represent concentration, whereas the third and fourth \"jhana\" combine concentration with mindfulness. According to Eddie Crangle, the first \"jhana\" resembles Patanjali's \"Samprajnata Samadhi\", which both share the application of \"vitarka\" and \"vicara\".\n\n\"Asamprajnata Samadhi\", states Jianxin Li, may be compared to the \"arupa jhanas\" of Buddhism, and to \"Nirodha-Samapatti\". Crangle and other scholars state that \"sabija-asamprajnata samadhi\" resembles the four formless \"jhanas\", with the fourth \"arupa jhana\" of Buddhism being analogous to Patanjali's \"objectless dhyana and samadhi\".\n\nAccording to Sarbacker and other scholars, while there are parallels between Dhyana in Hinduism and in Buddhism, the phenomenological states and the emancipation experiences are described differently. Dhyana in Buddhism is aiming towards cessation and realization of shunya (state of null), while Dhyana Hinduism is aiming towards realization of Atman (soul) and consequent union with Brahman. Nirvana (or Nibbana), the desired end through Dhyana in Buddhism, is the realization that there is no permanent self nor permanent consciousness; while Moksha, the desired end through Dhyana in Hinduism, is acceptance of Self, realization of liberating knowledge, the consciousness of Oneness with all existence and understanding the whole universe as the Self. Nirvana of Buddhism starts with the premise that \"Self is merely an illusion, there is no Self\", Moksha of Hinduism on the other hand, starts with the premise that everything is the Self, states David Loy. The soteriological emphasis in \"Dhyana\", therefore is different in Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nAncient Jaina scholars developed their own theories on Dhyana like other Indian religions, but little detail is mentioned in Jaina texts, and the Dhyana practices varied by sects within the Jaina tradition. Broadly, Jainism texts identify four types of meditation based on the nature of object. \"Arta-dhyana\", states Jaina meditation literature, occurs when one's focus is on anguish and unpleasant things. \"Raudra-dhyana\" occurs when the focus is on anger or perverse ideas or objects. \"Dharmya-dhyana\" focuses on religious ideas or virtuous objects, while \"Shukla-dhyana\" is the focus on pure ideas or bright objects. This classification of four Dhyana types may have roots, suggests Paul Dundas, in the earlier Hindu texts related to Kashmir Shaivism.\n\nDundas states that Jaina tradition emphasized Dhyana, but its meditation-related literature likely went through two stages of formulation, the early stage independent of other Indian traditions, one which concerned itself with \"cessation of mind and physical activities\" rather than their transformation as in other Indian traditions; followed by a later stage, likely post-Yogasutras, where Jaina scholars of different sects restructured the contemplative model to assimilate elements of Hindu and Buddhist techniques on Dhyana. The terminology used in some Jainism texts however, states John Cort, are different.\n\nThe premise of Atman (soul) exists, that is found in Hinduism, is also present in Jainism. The soteriological goals of Jaina spiritual meditation are similar to Hindu spiritual meditation, aimed at experiential contact with the \"ultimate self\", wherein the yogi realizes the blissful, unfettered, formless soul and siddha-hood – a totally liberated state of being.\n\nTwo concepts associated with Dhyana found in ancient and medieval Hindu texts are \"Upasana\" and \"Vidya\". Upasana means \"come near to something, some idea\" and denotes the act and state of meditation, while \"Vidya\" means knowledge and is the consequence of \"Dhyana\". The term \"Upasana\" typically appears in the context of ritual meditative practices, such as before a devotional symbol such as deity or during a yajna type practice or community oriented bhakti worship singing, and is a subtype of \"Dhyana\".\n\nThe 11th-century Vishishtadvaita Vedanta scholar Ramanuja differentiated \"Upasana\" and \"Dhyana\", stating the former to be \"adoration\" and the latter to be \"meditation\".\n\n"}

{"id": "40191243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40191243", "title": "Eternal feminine", "text": "Eternal feminine\n\nThe eternal feminine is a psychological archetype or philosophical principle that idealizes an immutable concept of \"woman\". It is one component of gender essentialism, the belief that men and women have different core \"essences\" that cannot be altered by time or environment. The conceptual ideal was particularly vivid in the 19th century, when women were often depicted as angelic, responsible for drawing men upward on a moral and spiritual path. Among those virtues variously regarded as essentially feminine are \"modesty, gracefulness, purity, delicacy, civility, compliancy, reticence, chastity, affability, [and] politeness\".\n\nThe concept of the \"eternal feminine\" () was particularly important to Goethe, who introduces it at the end of \"Faust\", Part 2. For Goethe, \"woman\" symbolized pure contemplation, in contrast to masculine action, parallel to the eastern Daoist descriptions of Yin and Yang. The feminine principle is further articulated by Nietzsche within a continuity of life and death, based in large part on his readings of ancient Greek literature, since in Greek culture both childbirth and the care of the dead were managed by women. Domesticity, and the power to redeem and serve as moral guardian, were also components of the \"eternal feminine\". The virtues of women were inherently private, while those of men were public.\n\n"}
{"id": "16006394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16006394", "title": "Food vs. fuel", "text": "Food vs. fuel\n\nFood versus fuel is the dilemma regarding the risk of diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production to the detriment of the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.\n\nBiofuel production has increased in recent years. Some commodities like maize (corn), sugar cane or vegetable oil can be used either as food, feed, or to make biofuels. For example, since 2006, a portion of land that was also formerly used to grow other crops in the United States is now used to grow corn for biofuels, and a larger share of corn is destined to ethanol production, reaching 25% in 2007. Second generation biofuels could potentially combine farming for food and fuel and moreover, electricity could be generated simultaneously, which could be beneficial for developing countries and rural areas in developed countries.\nWith global demand for biofuels on the increase due to the oil price increases taking place since 2003 and the desire to reduce oil dependency as well as reduce GHG emissions from transportation, there is also fear of the potential destruction of habitats by being converted into farmland. Environmental groups have raised concerns about this trade-off for several years, but the debate reached a global scale due to the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. On the other hand, several studies do show that biofuel production can be significantly increased without increased acreage. Therefore, stating that the crisis in hand relies on the food scarcity.\n\nBiofuels are not a new phenomenon. Before the industrialisation, horses were the primary (and humans probably the secondary) source of power for transportation and physical work, requiring food. The growing of crops for horses (typically oat) for carrying out physical work is of course comparable to the growing of crops for biofuels for engines, albeit on a smaller scale, because production since then has increased.\n\nBrazil has been considered to have the world's first sustainable biofuels economy and its government claims Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol industry has not contributed to the 2008 food crisis. A World Bank policy research working paper released in July 2008 concluded that \"...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices\", and also stated that \"Brazil's sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher\". However, a 2010 study also by the World Bank concluded that their previous study may have overestimated the contribution of biofuel production, as \"the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as large as originally thought, but that the use of commodities by financial investors (the so-called \"financialisation of commodities\") may have been partly responsible for the 2007/08 spike.\" A 2008 independent study by OECD also found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller.\n\nFrom 1974 to 2005 real food prices (adjusted for inflation) dropped by 75%. Food commodity prices were relatively stable after reaching lows in 2000 and 2001. Therefore, recent rapid food price increases are considered extraordinary. A World Bank policy research working paper published in July 2008 found that the increase in food commodities prices was led by grains, with sharp price increases in 2005 despite record crops worldwide. From January 2005 until June 2008, maize prices almost tripled, wheat increased 127 percent, and rice rose 170 percent. The increase in grain prices was followed by increases in fats and oil prices in mid-2006. On the other hand, the study found that sugar cane production has increased rapidly, and it was large enough to keep sugar price increases small except for 2005 and early 2006. The paper concluded that biofuels produced from grains have raised food prices in combination with other related factors between 70 to 75 percent, but ethanol produced from sugar cane has not contributed significantly to the recent increase in food commodities prices.\n\nAn economic assessment report published by the OECD in July 2008 found that \"...the impact of current biofuel policies on world crop prices, largely through increased demand for cereals and vegetable oils, is significant but should not be overestimated. Current biofuel support measures alone are estimated to increase average wheat prices by about 5 percent, maize by around 7 percent and vegetable oil by about 19 percent over the next 10 years.\"\n\nCorn is used to make ethanol and prices went up by a factor of three in less than 3 years (measured in US dollars). Reports in 2007 linked stories as diverse as food riots in Mexico due to rising prices of corn for tortillas, and reduced profits at Heineken the large international brewer, to the increasing use of corn (maize) grown in the US Midwest for ethanol production. (In the case of beer, the barley area was cut in order to increase corn production. Barley is not currently used to produce ethanol.) Wheat is up by almost a factor of 3 in 3 years, while soybeans are up by a factor of 2 in 2 years (both measured in US dollars).\n\nAs corn is commonly used as feed for livestock, higher corn prices lead to higher prices in animal source foods. Vegetable oil is used to make biodiesel and has about doubled in price in the last couple years. The price is roughly tracking crude oil prices. The 2007–2008 world food price crisis is blamed partly on the increased demand for biofuels. During the same period rice prices went up by a factor of 3 even though rice is not directly used in biofuels.\n\nThe USDA expects the 2008/2009 wheat season to be a record crop and 8% higher than the previous year. They also expect rice to have a record crop. Wheat prices have dropped from a high over $12/bushel in May 2008 to under $8/bushel in May. Rice has also dropped from its highs.\n\nAccording to a 2008 report from the World Bank the production of biofuel pushed food prices up. These conclusions were supported by the Union of Concerned Scientists in their September 2008 newsletter in which they remarked that the World Bank analysis \"contradicts U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schaffer's assertion that biofuels account for only a small percentage of rising food prices\".\n\nAccording to the October Consumer Price Index released Nov. 19, 2008, food prices continued to rise in October 2008 and were 6.3 percent higher than October 2007. Since July 2008 fuel costs dropped by nearly 60 percent.\n\nThe demand for ethanol fuel produced from field corn was spurred in the U.S. by the discovery that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an oxygenate additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a bushel, corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place at a time when oil prices were already significantly rising.\n\nThat food prices went up at the same time fuel prices went up is not surprising and should not be entirely blamed on biofuels. Energy costs are a significant cost for fertilizer, farming, and food distribution. Also, China and other countries have had significant increases in their imports as their economies have grown. Sugar is one of the main feedstocks for ethanol and prices are down from 2 years ago. Part of the food price increase for international food commodities measured in US dollars is due to the dollar being devalued. Protectionism is also an important contributor to price increases. 36% of world grain goes as fodder to feed animals, rather than people.\n\nOver long time periods population growth and climate change could cause food prices to go up. However, these factors have been around for many years and food prices have jumped up in the last 3 years, so their contribution to the current problem is minimal.\n\nFrance, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States governments have supported biofuels with tax breaks, mandated use, and subsidies. These policies have the unintended consequence of diverting resources from food production and leading to surging food prices and the potential destruction of natural habitats.\n\nFuel for agricultural use often does not have fuel taxes (farmers get duty-free petrol or diesel fuel). Biofuels may have subsidies and low/no retail fuel taxes. Biofuels compete with retail gasoline and diesel prices which have substantial taxes included. The net result is that it is possible for a farmer to use more than a gallon of fuel to make a gallon of biofuel and still make a profit. There have been thousands of scholarly papers analyzing how much energy goes into making ethanol from corn and how that compares to the energy in the ethanol.\n\nA World Bank policy research working paper concluded that food prices have risen by 35 to 40 percent between 2002 and 2008, of which 70 to 75 percent is attributable to biofuels. The \"month-by-month\" five-year analysis disputes that increases in global grain consumption and droughts were responsible for significant price increases, reporting that this had only a marginal impact. Instead the report argues that the EU and US drive for biofuels has had by far the biggest impact on food supply and prices, as increased production of biofuels in the US and EU were supported by subsidies and tariffs on imports, and considers that without these policies, price increases would have been smaller. This research also concluded that Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly, and recommends removing tariffs on ethanol imports by both the US and EU, to allow more efficient producers such as Brazil and other developing countries, including many African countries, to produce ethanol profitably for export to meet the mandates in the EU and the US.\n\nAn economic assessment published by the OECD in July 2008 agrees with the World Bank report recommendations regarding the negative effects of subsidies and import tariffs, but found that the estimated impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. The OECD study found that trade restrictions, mainly through import tariffs, protect the domestic industry from foreign competitors but impose a cost burden on domestic biofuel users and limits alternative suppliers. The report is also critical of limited reduction of GHG emissions achieved from biofuels based on feedstocks used in Europe and North America, finding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8% by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% compared to fossil fuels. The assessment calls for the need for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs.\n\nOil price increases since 2003 resulted in increased demand for biofuels. Transforming vegetable oil into biodiesel is not very hard or costly so there is a profitable arbitrage situation if vegetable oil is much cheaper than diesel. Diesel is also made from crude oil, so vegetable oil prices are partially linked to crude oil prices. Farmers can switch to growing vegetable oil crops if those are more profitable than food crops. So all food prices are linked to vegetable oil prices, and in turn to crude oil prices. A World Bank study concluded that oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise between January 2002 until June 2008.\n\nDemand for oil is outstripping the supply of oil and oil depletion is expected to cause crude oil prices to go up over the next 50 years. Record oil prices are inflating food prices worldwide, including those crops that have no relation to biofuels, such as rice and fish.\n\nIn Germany and Canada it is now much cheaper to heat a house by burning grain than by using fuel derived from crude oil. With oil at $120/barrel a savings of a factor of 3 on heating costs is possible. When crude oil was at $25/barrel there was no economic incentive to switch to a grain fed heater.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1973, around the time of the 1973 oil crisis, corn and wheat prices went up by a factor of 3. There was no significant biofuel usage at that time.\n\nSome argue that the US government policy of encouraging ethanol from corn is the main cause for food price increases. US Federal government ethanol subsidies total $7 billion per year, or $1.90 per gallon. Ethanol provides only 55% as much energy as gasoline per gallon, realizing about a $3.45 per gallon gasoline trade off. Corn is used to feed chickens, cows, and pigs, so higher corn prices lead to higher prices for chicken, beef, pork, milk, cheese, etc.\n\nU.S. Senators introduced the \"BioFuels Security Act\" in 2006. \"It's time for Congress to realize what farmers in America's heartland have known all along - that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel,\" said U.S. Senator for Illinois Barack Obama.\n\nTwo-thirds of U.S. oil consumption is due to the transportation sector. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 has a significant impact on U.S. Energy Policy. With the high profitability of growing corn, more and more farmers switch to growing corn until the profitability of other crops goes up to match that of corn. So the ethanol/corn subsidies drive up the prices of other farm crops.\n\nThe US - an important export country for food stocks - will convert 18% of its grain output to ethanol in 2008. Across the US, 25% of the whole corn crop went to ethanol in 2007. The percentage of corn going to biofuel is expected to go up.\n\nSince 2004 a US subsidy has been paid to companies that blend biofuel and regular fuel. The European biofuel subsidy is paid at the point of sale. Companies import biofuel to the US, blend 1% or even 0.1% regular fuel, and then ship the blended fuel to Europe, where it can get a second subsidy. These blends are called B99 or B99.9 fuel. The practice is called \"splash and dash\". The imported fuel may even come from Europe to the US, get 0.1% regular fuel, and then go back to Europe. For B99.9 fuel the US blender gets a subsidy of $0.999 per gallon. The European biodiesel producers have urged the EU to impose punitive duties on these subsidized imports. In 2007, US lawmakers were also looking at closing this loophole.\n\nThe prospects for the use of biofuels could change in a relatively dramatic way in 2014. Petroleum trade groups petitioned the EPA in August 2013 to take into consideration a reduction of renewable biofuel content in transportation fuels. On November 15, 2013 the United States EPA announced a review of the proportion of ethanol that should be required by regulation. The standards established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 could be modified significantly. The announcement allows sixty days for the submission of commentary about the proposal. Journalist George Monbiot has argued for a 5-year freeze on biofuels while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed. \n\nA 2007 UN report on biofuel also raises issues regarding food security and biofuel production. Jean Ziegler, then UN Special Rapporteur on food, concluded that while the argument for biofuels in terms of energy efficiency and climate change are legitimate, the effects for the world's hungry of transforming wheat and maize crops into biofuel are \"absolutely catastrophic\", and terms such use of arable land a \"crime against humanity\". Ziegler also calls for a 5-year moratorium on biofuel production. Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban was rejected by the U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon, who called for a comprehensive review of the policies on biofuels, and said that \"just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution\".\n\nFood surpluses exist in many developed countries. For example, the UK wheat surplus was around 2 million tonnes in 2005. This surplus alone could produce sufficient bioethanol to replace around 2.5% of the UK's petroleum consumption, without requiring any increase in wheat cultivation or reduction in food supply or exports. However, above a few percent, there would be direct competition between first generation biofuel production and food production. This is one reason why many view second generation biofuels as increasingly important.\n\nThere are different types of biofuels and different feedstocks for them, and it has been proposed that only non-food crops be used for biofuel. This avoids direct competition for commodities like corn and edible vegetable oil. However, as long as farmers are able to derive a greater profit by switching to biofuels, they will. The law of supply and demand predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise.\n\nSecond generation biofuels use lignocellulosic raw material such as forest residues (sometimes referred to as brown waste and black liquor from Kraft process or sulfite process pulp mills). Third generation biofuels (biofuel from algae) use non-edible raw materials sources that can be used for biodiesel and bioethanol. \n\nIt has long been recognized that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material commonly referred to as \"Nature's polymer\", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax \"recalcitrant\" cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of \"mechanochemistry\" has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder in the presence of a catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.\n\nSoybean oil, which only represents half of the domestic raw materials available for biodiesel production in the United States, is one of many raw materials that can be used to produce biodiesel.\n\nNon-food crops like Camelina, Jatropha, seashore mallow and mustard, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts can be used to produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. Camelina does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina and add to their profitability.\n\nJatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities:\n\nCultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees. Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too.\nNBB’s Feedstock Development program is addressing production of arid variety crops, algae, waste greases, and other feedstocks on the horizon to expand available material for biodiesel in a sustainable manner.\n\nCellulosic ethanol is a type of biofuel produced from lignocellulose, a material that comprises much of the mass of plants. Corn stover, switchgrass, miscanthus and woodchip are some of the more popular non-edible cellulosic materials for ethanol production. Commercial investment in such second-generation biofuels began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is moving forward rapidly. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.\n\nOther second generation biofuels may be commercialized in the future and compete less with food. Synthetic fuel can be made from coal or biomass and may be commercialized soon.\n\nProtein rich feed for cattle/fish/poultry can be produced from biogas/natural gas which is presently used as fuel source. Cultivation of \"Methylococcus capsulatus\" bacteria culture by consuming natural gas produces high protein rich feed with tiny land and water foot print. The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can also be put to use in cheaper production of algae oil or spirulina from algaculture which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future. With these proven technologies, abundant natural gas/ biogas availability can impart full global food security by producing highly nutrient food products with out any water pollution or green house gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nBiofuels can also be produced from the waste byproducts of food-based agriculture (such as citrus peels or used vegetable oil) to manufacture an environmentally sustainable fuel supply, and reduce waste disposal cost.\n\nA growing percentage of U.S. biodiesel production is made from waste vegetable oil (recycled restaurant oils) and greases.\n\nCollocation of a waste generator with a waste-to-ethanol plant can reduce the waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business. This innovative collocation concept is sometimes called holistic systems engineering. Collocation disposal elimination may be one of the few cost-effective, environmentally sound, biofuel strategies, but its scalability is limited by availability of appropriate waste generation sources. For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels. Due to the higher cost of transporting ethanol, it is a local partial solution, at best.\n\nSome people have claimed that ending subsidies and tariffs would enable sustainable development of a global biofuels market. Taxing biofuel imports while letting petroleum in duty-free does not fit with the goal of encouraging biofuels. Ending mandates, subsidies, and tariffs would end the distortions that current policy is causing. The US ethanol tariff and some US ethanol subsidies are currently set to expire over the next couple years. The EU is rethinking their biofuels directive due to environmental and social concerns. On January 18, 2008 the UK House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee raised similar concerns, and called for a moratorium on biofuel targets. Germany ended their subsidy of biodiesel on Jan 1 2008 and started taxing it.\n\nTo avoid overproduction and to prop up farmgate prices for agricultural commodities, the EU has for a long time have had farm subsidy programs to encourage farmers not to produce and leave productive acres fallow. The 2008 crisis prompted proposals to bring some of the reserve farmland back into use, and the used area increased actually with 0.5% but today these areas are once again out of use. According to Eurostat, 18 million hectares has been abandoned since 1990, 7,4 millions hectares are currently set aside, and the EU has recently decided to set aside another 5–7% in so called Ecological Focus Areas, corresponding to 10–12 million hectares. In spite of this reduction of used land, the EU is a net exporter of e.g. wheat.\n\nThe American Bakers Association has proposed reducing the amount of farmland held in the US Conservation Reserve Program. Currently the US has in the program.\n\nIn Europe about 8% of the farmland is in set aside programs. Farmers have proposed freeing up all of this for farming. Two-thirds of the farmers who were on these programs in the UK are not renewing when their term expires.\n\nSecond generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (such as perennial grasses), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Advances in the conversion processes will almost certainly improve the sustainability of biofuels, through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources.\n\nLord Ron Oxburgh suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several advantages:\n\nProduced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none. Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences. In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product.\nFar from creating food shortages, responsible production and distribution of biofuels represents the best opportunity for sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and impoverished Asia. Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation. Crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.\n\nAn additional policy option is to continue the current trends of government incentive for these types of crops to further evaluate the effects on food prices over a longer period of time due to the relatively recent onset of the biofuel production industry. Additionally, by virtue of the newness of the industry we can assume that like other startup industries techniques and alternatives will be cultivated quickly if there is sufficient demand for the alternative fuels and biofuels. What could result from the shock to food prices is a very quick move toward some of the non-food biofuels as are listed above amongst the other policy alternatives.\n\nDemand for fuel in rich countries is now competing against demand for food in poor countries. The increase in world grain consumption in 2006 happened due to the increase in consumption for fuel, not human consumption. The grain required to fill a fuel tank with ethanol will feed one person for a year.\n\nSeveral factors combine to make recent grain and oilseed price increases impact poor countries more:\n\n\nThe impact is not all negative. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recognizes the potential opportunities that the growing biofuel market offers to small farmers and aquaculturers around the world and has recommended small-scale financing to help farmers in poor countries produce local biofuel.\n\nOn the other hand, poor countries that do substantial farming have increased profits due to biofuels. If vegetable oil prices double, the profit margin could more than double. In the past rich countries have been dumping subsidized grains at below cost prices into poor countries and hurting the local farming industries. With biofuels using grains the rich countries no longer have grain surpluses to get rid of. Farming in poor countries is seeing healthier profit margins and expanding.\n\nInterviews with local farmers in southern Ecuador provide strong anecdotal evidence that the high price of corn is encouraging the burning of tropical forests in order to grow more. The destruction of tropical forests now account for 20% of all greenhouse gas emmisons.\n\nUS government subsidies for making ethanol from corn have been attacked as the main cause of the food vs fuel problem. To defend themselves, the National Corn Growers Association has published their views on this issue. They consider the \"food vs fuel\" argument to be a fallacy that is \"fraught with misguided logic, hyperbole and scare tactics.\"\n\nClaims made by the NCGA include:\n\n\nSince reaching record high prices in June 2008, corn prices fell 50% by October 2008, declining sharply together with other commodities, including oil. According to a Reuters article, \"Analysts, including some in the ethanol sector, say ethanol demand adds about 75 cents to $1.00 per bushel to the price of corn, as a rule of thumb. Other analysts say it adds around 20 percent, or just under 80 cents per bushel at current prices. Those estimates hint that $4 per bushel corn might be priced at only $3 without demand for ethanol fuel.\". These industry sources consider that a speculative bubble in the commodity markets holding positions in corn futures was the main driver behind the observed hike in corn prices affecting food supply.\n\nThe United States and Brazil lead the industrial world in global ethanol production, with Brazil as the world's largest exporter and biofuel industry leader. In 2006 the U.S. produced 18.4 billion liters (4.86 billion gallons), closely followed by Brazil with 16.3 billion liters (4.3 billion gallons), producing together 70% of the world's ethanol market and nearly 90% of ethanol used as fuel. These countries are followed by China with 7.5%, and India with 3.7% of the global market share.\n\nSince 2007, the concerns, criticisms and controversy surrounding the food vs biofuels issue has reached the international system, mainly heads of states, and inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), such as the United Nations and several of its agencies, particularly the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP); the International Monetary Fund; the World Bank; and agencies within the European Union.\n\nIn March 2007, \"ethanol diplomacy\" was the focus of President George W. Bush's Latin American tour, in which he and Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, were seeking to promote the production and use of sugar cane based ethanol throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The two countries also agreed to share technology and set international standards for biofuels. The Brazilian sugar cane technology transfer will permit various Central American countries, such as Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, several Caribbean countries, and various Andean Countries tariff-free trade with the U.S. thanks to existing concessionary trade agreements. Even though the U.S. imposes a USD 0.54 tariff on every gallon of imported ethanol, the Caribbean nations and countries in the Central American Free Trade Agreement are exempt from such duties if they produce ethanol from crops grown in their own countries. The expectation is that using Brazilian technology for refining sugar cane based ethanol, such countries could become exporters to the United States in the short-term. In August 2007, Brazil's President toured Mexico and several countries in Central America and the Caribbean to promote Brazilian ethanol technology.\n\nThis alliance between the U.S. and Brazil generated some negative reactions. While Bush was in São Paulo as part of the 2007 Latin American tour, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, from Buenos Aires, dismissed the ethanol plan as \"a crazy thing\" and accused the U.S. of trying \"to substitute the production of foodstuffs for animals and human beings with the production of foodstuffs for vehicles, to sustain the American way of life.\" Chavez' complaints were quickly followed by then Cuban President Fidel Castro, who wrote that \"you will see how many people among the hungry masses of our planet will no longer consume corn.\" \"Or even worse,\" he continued, \"by offering financing to poor countries to produce ethanol from corn or any other kind of food, no tree will be left to defend humanity from climate change.\"' Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's President, and one of the preferential recipients of Brazil technical aid, said that \"we reject the gibberish of those who applaud Bush's totally absurd proposal, which attacks the food security rights of Latin Americans and Africans, who are major corn consumers\", however, he voiced support for sugar cane based ethanol during Lula's visit to Nicaragua.\n\nAs a result of the international community's concerns regarding the steep increase in food prices, on April 14, 2008, Jean Ziegler, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, at the Thirtieth Regional Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Brasília, called biofuels a \"crime against humanity\", a claim he had previously made in October 2007, when he called for a 5-year ban for the conversion of land for the production of biofuels. The previous day, at their Annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group meeting at Washington, D.C., the World Bank's President, Robert Zoellick, stated that \"While many worry about filling their gas tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs. And it's getting more and more difficult every day.\"\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva gave a strong rebuttal, calling both claims \"fallacies resulting from commercial interests\", and putting the blame instead on U.S. and European agricultural subsidies, and a problem restricted to U.S. ethanol produced from maize. He also said that \"biofuels aren't the villain that threatens food security\". In the middle of this new wave of criticism, Hugo Chavez reaffirmed his opposition and said that he is concerned that \"so much U.S.-produced corn could be used to make biofuel, instead of feeding the world's poor\", calling the U.S. initiative to boost ethanol production during a world food crisis a \"crime\".\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the rise in food prices is due to poor agricultural policies and changing eating habits in developing nations, not biofuels as some critics claim. On the other hand, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for international action and said Britain had to be \"selective\" in supporting biofuels, and depending on the UK's assessment of biofuels' impact on world food prices, \"we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets\". Stavros Dimas, European Commissioner for the Environment said through a spokeswoman that \"there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels\", though he acknowledged that the EU had underestimated problems caused by biofuels.\n\nOn April 29, 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush declared during a press conference that \"85 percent of the world's food prices are caused by weather, increased demand and energy prices\", and recognized that \"15 percent has been caused by ethanol\". He added that \"the high price of gasoline is going to spur more investment in ethanol as an alternative to gasoline. And the truth of the matter is it's in our national interests that our farmers grow energy, as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us.\" Regarding the effect of agricultural subsidies on rising food prices, Bush said that \"Congress is considering a massive, bloated farm bill that would do little to solve the problem. The bill Congress is now considering would fail to eliminate subsidy payments to multi-millionaire farmers\", he continued, \"this is the right time to reform our nation's farm policies by reducing unnecessary subsidies\".\n\nJust a week before this new wave of international controversy began, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had commented that several U.N. agencies were conducting a comprehensive review of the policy on biofuels, as the world food price crisis might trigger global instability. He said \"We need to be concerned about the possibility of taking land or replacing arable land because of these biofuels\", then he added \"While I am very much conscious and aware of these problems, at the same time you need to constantly look at having creative sources of energy, including biofuels. Therefore, at this time, just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution. I would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner.\" Regarding Jean Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban, the U.N. Secretary rejected that proposal.\n\nA report released by Oxfam in June 2008 criticized biofuel policies of high-income countries as neither a solution to the climate crisis nor the oil crisis, while contributing to the food price crisis. The report concluded that from all biofuels available in the market, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is not very effective, but it is the most favorable biofuel in the world in term of cost and greenhouse gas balance. The report discusses some existing problems and potential risks, and asks the Brazilian government for caution to avoid jeopardizing its environmental and social sustainability. The report also says that: \"Rich countries spent up to $15 billion last year supporting biofuels while blocking cheaper Brazilian ethanol, which is far less damaging for global food security.\"\n\nA World Bank research report published in July 2008 found that from June 2002 to June 2008 \"biofuels and the related consequences of low grain stocks, large land use shifts, speculative activity and export bans\" pushed prices up by 70 percent to 75 percent. The study found that higher oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise. The study said that \"...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices\" and also stated that \"Brazil's sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher\". The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) published a rebuttal based on the version leaked before its formal release. The RFA critique considers that the analysis is highly subjective and that the author \"estimates the impact of global food prices from the weak dollar and the direct and indirect effect of high petroleum prices and attributes everything else to biofuels\".\n\nAn economic assessment by the OECD also published in July 2008 agrees with the World Bank report regarding the negative effects of subsidies and trade restrictions, but found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. The OECD study is also critical of the limited reduction of GHG emissions achieved from biofuels produced in Europe and North America, concluding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8 percent by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent compared to fossil fuels. The assessment calls on governments for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs. The OECD study concluded that \"...current biofuel support measures alone are estimated to increase average wheat prices by about 5 percent, maize by around 7 percent and vegetable oil by about 19 percent over the next 10 years.\"\n\nAnother World Bank research report published in July 2010 found their previous study may have overestimated the contribution of biofuel production, as the paper concluded that \"the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as large as originally thought, but that the use of commodities by financial investors (the so-called \"financialization of commodities\") may have been partly responsible for the 2007/08 spike\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2386555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2386555", "title": "Gabriel Biel", "text": "Gabriel Biel\n\nGabriel Biel, C.R.S.A. (; 1420 to 1425 – 7 December 1495), was a German scholastic philosopher and member of the Canons Regular of the Congregation of Windesheim, who were the clerical counterpart to the Brethren of the Common Life.\n\nBiel was born in Speyer and died in Einsiedel near Tübingen. In 1432 he was ordained to the priesthood and entered Heidelberg University to obtain a baccalaureate. He succeeded academically and became an instructor in the faculty of the arts for three years, until he pursued a higher degree at the University of Erfurt. His first stay was brief, lasting only until he transferred to the University of Cologne. He did not complete his degree there either, and would return to Erfurt in 1451 to finish. The curriculum at these two universities varied greatly, with Cologne stressing St. Thomas Aquinas and overall scholastic curricula heavily, and Erfurt emphasizing William of Ockham. Because of his reliance on the scholastic tradition, as well as William of Ockham's nominalist views, he is often credited as being an \"articulate spokesman of the \"via moderna\" and … a discerning user of the thought of via antiqua” (Oberman, 11).\n\nBiel's studies were pursued at Heidelberg, Erfurt and Cologne. During the early 1460s, he became a preacher in the Cathedral of Mainz, of which he was vicar. It was while at the Cathedral of Mainz that he took to the defense of Adolf von Nassau, and wrote \"Defensorium obediente apostolice\". Later, he became a superior of the canons at Butzbach, and lived in the House of the Brethren on the Rheingau until 1468. He was invited by Duke Eberhard I to become the first provost of the new Brethren House at St. Mark's, where he served for nine years, furthering the Brethren movement by bringing about a General Chapter of the Brethren on the upper Rhine in Mainz and integrating Brethren piety into the curricula of the school there. In 1479 he was appointed provost of the canonry in Urach.\n\nAt this period Biel cooperated with Duke Eberhard in the founding the University of Tübingen. Appointed in 1484 as the first professor of theology in the new faculty, he continued to be one of the most celebrated members of its faculty until his death, even serving as Rector in 1484 and 1489. There, he opposed the appointment of the Realist Johann Heynlin to the faculty.\n\nThough he was almost sixty years of age when he began to teach, Biel's work, both as professor and as writer, reflected the highest honour on the young university. His work consists in the systematic development of the views of his master, William of Ockham. In later years, he was known as the \"last of the Scholastics\".\nHe retired to the newly founded Brethren House of St. Peter's at the Einsiedel near Tübingen, where he died.\n\nBiel's first publication, on the Canon of the Mass, is of permanent interest and value. His second and most important work is a commentary on the \"Sentences\" of Peter Lombard, which would come to play a major influence on Martin Luther during the coming Reformation. In this he calls William of Ockham his master, but the last three books show him more Scotist than Nominalist. Matthias Scheeben describes him as \"one of the best of the Nominalists, clear, exact, and more positive as well as more loyal to the Church than any of the others\" (\"Dogmatik\", no. 1073). The historian Janssen declares that he was one of the few Nominalists who erected a theological system without incurring the charge of unorthodoxy. (Cf. \"Geschichte des deutschen Volkes\", I, 127, 15th ed.)\n\nBiel was neither narrow nor excessively speculative. Though a Nominalist, he was tolerant of Realism, which also flourished at Tübingen under the leadership of Konrad Summenhart. A Scholastic, he was, to quote Janssen, \"free from empty speculations and ingenious intellectual juggling, being concerned with questions and needs of actual life\" (ibid.), was interested in the social movements of his time, and maintained friendly relations with the Humanists. One of the latter, Heinrich Bebel, gave him the title of \"monarch among theologians\". His theological writings were repeatedly brought into the discussions of the Council of Trent.\n\nLiving as he did in a transition period, Biel exhibits characteristics of two intellectual eras. According to some, he was a Scholastic who expounded Aristotle rather than the Scriptures; according to others, he defended freer theological teaching.\n\nIn May 1459, a controversy arose when Diether von Isenburg was elected as Archbishop of Mainz, yet failed to pay the required annates, and so, Adolph von Nassau was given the position. When Diether began appealing to antipapal sentiments present throughout the Holy Roman Empire, escalating the conflict, Biel became involved. He campaigned unequivocally for Adolph, and was forced to flee Mainz. While in hiding, he wrote the \"Defensorium obediente apostolice\", an ecclesiastical treatise on the extent of papal authority (and the Church authority) and the role that scripture has on these. In it, he takes a position similar to Bernard of Clairvaux's \"plenitudo potestatis\". As a matter of fact, he acknowledged the primacy and supreme power of the Roman Pontiff, but, in common with many other theologians of his time, maintained the superiority of general Councils, at least to the extent that they could compel the pope's resignation. And he displayed no more theological freedom than has been claimed and exercised by some of the strictest theologians.\n\nBecause of Biel's insistence on maintaining the precarious balancing act between his scholastic and modern views of theology, it is often the case that \"His philosophical thought is not straightforwardly innovative, but has more of a synthetic nature; his generally recognized clarity of expression if often achieved by contrasting diverse positions with each other (Gracia, \"A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages)\".\n\nAmong the opinions defended by Biel concerning matters controversial in his day, the following are worthy of mention: (a) That all ecclesiastical jurisdiction, even that of bishops, is derived either immediately or mediately from the pope. In this connection it is to be noted that his defence of the episcopal claims of Adolph von Nassau won him the thanks of Pope Pius II. (b) That the power of absolving is inherent in sacerdotal orders, and that only the matter, i.e., the persons to be absolved, can be conceded or withheld by the ordinary. (c) That the minister of baptism need have no more specific intention than that of doing what the faithful, that is, the Church, intends. (d) That the State may not compel Jews, or s, or their children to receive baptism. (e) And that the \"contractum trinius\" is morally lawful. All of these opinions have since become the prevailing theological doctrine.\n\nBiel's other works include: \"Sacri canonis Missae expositio resolutissima literalis et mystica\" (Brixen, 1576); an abridgment of this work, entitled \"Epitome expositionis canonis Missae\" (Antwerp, 1565); \"Sermones\" (Brixen, 1585), on the Sundays and festivals of the Christian year, with a disquisition on the plague and a defence of the authority of the pope; \"Collectorium sive epitome in magistri sententiarum libros IV\" (Brixen, 1574); and \"Tractatus de potestate et utilitate monetarum\".\n\nThe subject on which Biel held the most progressive views is political economy. Wilhelm Roscher, who with Gustav Schmoller introduced him to modern students of economics, declares that Biel's grasp of economics enabled him not only to understand the work of his predecessors, but to advance beyond them. (Cf. \"Geschichte der Nationalökonomik in Deutschland\", 21 sqq.) According to Biel, the just price of a commodity is determined chiefly by human needs, by its scarcity, and by the difficulty of producing it.\n\nBiel's enumeration includes all the factors that govern market price, and is more complete and reasonable than any made by his predecessors. (Cf. Garnier, \"L'idée du just prix\", 77.) The same author maintains that concerning the occupation of the merchant or trader, Biel is more advanced than St. Thomas, since he attaches no stigma to it, but holds it to be good in itself, and the merchant entitled to remuneration because of his labour, risks, and expense. Biel's discussion of these subjects is contained in Book IV of his commentary on the \"Sentences\". He wrote a special work on currency, \"Ein wahrhaft goldenes Buch\", in which he stigmatizes the debasing of coinage by princes as dishonest exploitation of the people. In the same work he severely condemns those rulers who curtailed the popular rights of forest, meadow, and water, and who imposed arbitrary burdens of taxation, as well as the rich sportsmen who encroached upon the lands of the peasantry. \n\nIn Biel's \"Expositio Canonis Missae\", he had an earlier version of \"You get what you pay for\": \"Pro tali numismate tales merces\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

One of Kafka's most outstanding contributions to the realms of psychology have been his critique of fundamentals and methods, such as his criticism of behaviorism, and other articles in which he revealed new points of view based on concrete investigation.\n\nHis son Gustav Eduard Kafka (February 4, 1907, München - January 17, 1974, Graz) was a sociologist and jurist.\n\nKafka attended school in Vienna where he was born, and later joined the school that was organised by Schotten monks. He became conversant in both English and French from learning at home as a child, then entered the University of Vienna in 1902, where he studied law for one semester before shifting studies to philosophy and psychology. After a semester at G. E. Miller's laboratory in Gottingen, where he became acquainted with Geza Revesz and David Katz, Kafka enrolled at Leipzig where in 1904 he received the doctor's degree from Wundt for a thesis entitled Ueber das Ansteigen der Toner- regung. In 1905 he went to Munich to continue his studies under Theodor Lipps. Later he worked there under Erich Becher and was appointed professor at Munich in 1915. \n\nKafka participated in the first world war as an Austrian reserve soldier. Towards the end of that war, he and his friend Geza Revesz, then at the University of Budapest, were commissioned to set up a psychotechnical service for the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1923 Kafka succeeded Karl Biihler as professor of psychology, philosophy, and pedagogy at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden, but in 1935 political difficulties and ill health combined to force him to resign prematurely. Just before its close, the Second World War added to his misfortunes by the destruction of his home and all his property in an air raid. The collapse of the war led not to his academic reinstatement but at first to hunger and dire distress. In 1947, however, he received an appointment as professor of philosophy and psychology at the University of Wiirzburg, where he continued to work until his second and final retirement in the summer of 1952. In his seventieth year, on February 12, 1953, he died in his newly acquired home in Veitshochheim near Wiirzburg.\n\n\n"}

A common example of such a proposition is René Descartes' \"cogito ergo sum\" (\"I think, therefore I am\").\n\nJohnathan Harrison has argued that \"incorrigible\" may be the wrong term, since it seems to imply (by the dictionary definition) a sense that the beliefs cannot be \"changed\", which isn't actually true. In Harrison's view, the incorrigibility of a proposition actually implies something about the nature of \"believing\"—for example, that one must exist in order to believe—rather than the nature of the proposition itself.\n\nFor illustration, consider Descartes': \"I think, therefore I exist\" - \nStated in incorrigible form, this could be: \"That I believe that I exist implies that my belief is true\". Harrison argues that a belief being true is really only incidental to the matter, that really what the cogito proves is that \"belief\" implies \"existence\". One could equally well say, \"That I believe God exists implies that I exist.\" or \"That I believe I do not exist implies that my belief is false.\"—and these would have the same essential meaning as the cogito.\n\nCharles Raff draws a distinction between three types of incorrigibility:\n\n\nType-2 and type-3 incorrigibility are logical converses, and therefore logically independent. Charles Raff argues that introspection is not type-1 incorrigible, but is in fact type-2 and type-3 incorrigible.\n\nIn law, incorrigibility laws were formerly used against minors to commit them for longer periods of confinement for status offenses, similar to in re Gault's case in the 1960s,\nthan an adult would have been for committing the same crimes.\n"}
{"id": "16016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16016", "title": "Jainism", "text": "Jainism\n\nJainism (), traditionally known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion. Followers of Jainism are called \"Jains\", a word derived from the Sanskrit word \"jina\" (victor) and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths through an ethical and spiritual life Jains trace their history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as \"tirthankaras\", with the first being Rishabhanatha, who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, and twenty-fourth being the Mahāvīra around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal \"dharma\" with the \"tirthankaras\" guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology.\n\nThe main religious premises of Jainism are \"ahiṃsā\" (\"non-violence\"), \"anekāntavāda\" (\"many-sidedness\"), \"aparigraha\" (\"non-attachment\") and \"asceticism\". Devout Jains take five main vows: \"ahiṃsā\" (\"non-violence\"), \"satya\" (\"truth\"), \"asteya\" (\"not stealing\"), \"brahmacharya\" (\"celibacy or chastity\"), and \"aparigraha\" (\"non-attachment\"). These principles have impacted Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. \"Parasparopagraho Jīvānām\" (\"the function of souls is to help one another\") is the motto of Jainism. \"Ṇamōkāra mantra\" is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.\n\nJainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras; and several smaller sub-traditions that emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. Jain mendicants are found in all Jain sub-traditions, with laypersons (\"śrāvakas\") supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.\n\nJainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in India. Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in Canada, Europe, Kenya, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Suriname, Fiji, and the United States. Major Jain festivals include Paryushana and Daslakshana, Mahavir Jayanti, and Diwali.\n\nThe principle of \"ahimsa\" (\"non-violence\" or \"non-injury\") is a fundamental tenet of Jainism. It believes that one must abandon all violent activity, and without such a commitment to non-violence all religious behavior is worthless. In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and \"non-violence is one's highest religious duty\".\n\nJain texts such as \"Acaranga Sūtra\" and \"Tattvarthasūtra\" state that one must renounce all killing of living beings, whether tiny or large, movable or immovable. Its theology teaches that one must neither kill another living being, nor cause another to kill, nor consent to any killing directly or indirectly. Furthermore, Jainism emphasizes non-violence against all beings not only in action but also in speech and in thought. It states that instead of hate or violence against anyone, \"all living creatures must help each other\". Violence negatively affects and destroys one's soul, particularly when the violence is done with intent, hate or carelessness, or when one indirectly causes or consents to the killing of a human or non-human living being.\n\nThe idea of reverence for non-violence (\"ahiṃsā\") is founded in Hindu and Buddhist canonical texts, and it may have origins in more ancient Brahmanical Vedic thoughts. However, no other Indian religion has developed the non-violence doctrine and its implications on everyday life as has Jainism.\n\nThe theological basis of non-violence as the highest religious duty has been interpreted by some Jain scholars not to \"be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a duty to rescue all creatures\", but resulting from \"continual self-discipline\", a cleansing of the soul that leads to one's own spiritual development which ultimately affects one's salvation and release from rebirths. Causing injury to any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one's rebirth, future well being and suffering.\n\nLate medieval Jain scholars re-examined the \"Ahiṃsā\" doctrine when one is faced with external threat or violence. For example, they justified violence by monks to protect nuns. According to Dundas, the Jain scholar Jinadatta Suri wrote during a time of Muslim destruction of temples and persecution that \"anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody would not lose any spiritual merit but instead attain deliverance\". However, such examples in Jain texts that condone fighting and killing under certain circumstances are relatively rare.\n\nThe second main principle of Jainism is \"anekāntavāda\" or \"anekantatva\", a word derived from \"anekānta\" (\"not one ended, sided\", \"many-sidedness\" or \"manifoldness\") and \"vada\" (\"doctrine\", \"way\").\n\nThe \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is \"Naya\", explained as \"partial expression of the truth\". Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express Truth. From Truth, according to Mahāvīra, language returns and not the other way round. One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is \"syāt\", or valid \"in some respect\" but it remains a \"perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete\". In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced. Since reality is many-sided the great error, according to Jainism, is \"ekānta\" (one-sidedness) where some relative truth is treated as an absolute truth to the exclusion of others.\n\nThe \"anekāntavāda\" premise of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\". The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahāvīra's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a \"qualified yes\" (\"syāt\"). These texts identify \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Mahāvīra and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer \"it is\" or \"it is not\" to metaphysical questions. The Mahāvīra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both \"it is\", and \"it is not\", with \"perhaps\" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality. \"Syādvāda\" (predication logic) and \"nayavāda\" (perspective epistemology) of Jainism expand on the concept of \"anekāntavāda\". \"Syādvāda\" recommends the expression of \"anekānta\" by prefixing the epithet \"syād\" to every phrase or expression describing the \"permanent being\". There is no creator God in Jainism; existence has neither beginning nor end, and the permanent being is conceptualized as \"jiva\" (\"soul\") and \"ajiva\" (\"matter\") within a dualistic \"anekāntavāda\" framework.\n\nAccording to Paul Dundas, in contemporary times the \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to \"promote a universal religious tolerance\", and a teaching of \"plurality\" and \"benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions\". Dundas states this is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahāvīra's teachings. The \"many pointedness, multiple perspective\" teachings of the Mahāvīra is a doctrine about the nature of absolute reality and human existence, and it is sometimes called \"non-absolutism\" doctrine. However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, nor violence against disbelievers or any other living being as \"perhaps right\". The five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no \"perhaps\" or \"that is just one perspective\" about them. Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.\n\nThe third main principle in Jainism is \"aparigraha\" which means non-attachment to worldly possessions. For ascetics, Jainism requires a vow of complete non-possession of any property. For Jain laypersons, it recommends limited possession of property that has been honestly earned, and giving excess property to charity. According to Natubhai Shah, \"aparigraha\" applies to both the material and the psychic. Material possessions refer to various forms of property. Psychic possessions refer to emotions, likes and dislikes, and attachments of any form. Unchecked attachment to possessions is said to result in direct harm to one's personality.\n\nJainism views attachments to material or emotional possessions as what leads to passions, which in turn leads to violence. According to the \"aparigraha\" principle, a Jain monk or nun is expected to be homeless and family-less with no emotional longings or attachments. The ascetic is a wandering mendicant in the Digambara tradition, or a resident mendicant in the Śvētāmbara tradition.\n\nIn addition, Jain texts mention that \"attachment to possessions\" (\"parigraha\") is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (\"ābhyantara parigraha\"), and attachment to external possessions (\"bāhya parigraha\"). For internal possessions, Jainism identifies four key passions of the mind (\"kashaya\"): anger, pride (ego), deceitfulness, and greed. In addition to the four passions of the mind, the remaining ten internal passions are: wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, neuter sex-passion), and the six defects (laughter, like, dislike, sorrow, fear, disgust).\n\nJainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows. These are called \"anuvratas\" (\"small vows\") for Jain laypersons, and \"mahavratas\" (\"great vows\") for Jain mendicants. For both, its moral precepts preface that the Jain has access to a \"guru\" (\"teacher\", \"counsellor\"), \"deva\" (\"Jina\", \"god\"), doctrine, and that the individual is free from five offences: doubts about the faith, indecisiveness about the truths of Jainism, sincere desire for Jain teachings, recognition of fellow Jains, and admiration for their spiritual pursuits. Such a person undertakes the following Five vows of Jainism:\n\nOf all the major Indian religions, Jainism has had the strongest austerity-driven ascetic tradition, and it is an essential part of a mendicant's spiritual pursuits. Ascetic life may include nakedness symbolizing non-possession of even clothes, fasting, body mortification, penance, and other austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed in Jainism to be essential for reaching \"siddha\" and \"moksha\" (\"liberation from rebirths\", and \"salvation\").\n\nJain texts like \"Tattvartha Sūtra\" and \"Uttaradhyayana Sūtra\" discuss ascetic austerities to great lengths and formulations. Six outer and six inner practices are most common, and oft-repeated in later Jain texts. According to John Cort, outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh, and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation). Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation, and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.\n\nLists of internal and external austerities in Jainism varies with the text and tradition. Asceticism is viewed as a means to control desires, and a means to purify the \"jiva\" (\"soul\"). The \"tirthankaras\" of Jainism, such as the Mahāvīra (Vardhamana) set an example of leading an ascetic life by performing severe austerities for twelve years.\n\nThe practice of non-violence towards all living beings has led to Jain culture being vegetarian. Devout Jains practice lacto-vegetarianism, that is eat no eggs, but accept dairy products if there is no violence against animals during their production. Veganism is encouraged if there are concerns about animal welfare. Jain monks and nuns do not eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions and garlic because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up, and because a bulb or tuber's ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a higher living being.\n\nJains fast on different occasions throughout the year, particularly during festivals. This practice is called \"upavasa\", \"tapasya\" or \"vrata\". According to Singh, this takes on various forms and may be practised based on one's ability. Some examples include Digambara fasting for \"Dasa-laksana-parvan\" where a Jain layperson eats only one or two meals per day, drinking only boiled water for ten days, or fasting completely on the first and last day of the festival. With these practices the layperson mimics the practices of a Jain mendicant during the festival. A similar practice is found among Śvētāmbara Jains on eight day \"paryusana\" with \"samvatsari-pratikramana\".\n\nThe fasting practice is believed to remove karma from one's soul and allow one to gain merit (\"punya\"). A \"one day\" fast in Jain tradition lasts about 36 hours, starting at sunset before the day of the fast and ending 48 minutes after the sunrise the day after. Among laypeople, fasting is more commonly observed by women, where it is believed that this shows her piety, religious purity, gains her and her family prestige, leads to merit earning and helps ensure future well-being for her family. Some religious fasts are observed as a group where Jain women bond socially and support each other. Long fasts are celebrated by friends and families with special ceremonies.\n\nJainism considers meditation (\"dhyana\") a necessary practice, but its goals are very different from those in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, meditation is concerned more with stopping karmic attachments and activity, not as a means to transformational insights or self-realization in other Indian religions. Meditation in early Jain literature is a form of austerity and ascetic practice in Jainism, while in late medieval era the practice adopted ideas from other Indian traditions. According to Paul Dundas, this lack of meditative practices in early Jain texts may be because substantial portions of ancient Jain texts were lost.\n\nAccording to Padmanabh Jaini, \"Sāmāyika\" is a practice of \"brief periods in meditation\" in Jainism that is a part of \"siksavrata\" (\"ritual restraint\"). The goal of \"Sāmāyika\" is to achieve equanimity, and it is the second \"siksavrata\". The \"samayika\" ritual is practiced at least three times a day by mendicants, while a layperson includes it with other ritual practices such as \"Puja\" in a Jain temple and doing charity work. According to Johnson, as well as Jaini, \"samayika\" connotes more than meditation, and for a Jain householder is the voluntary ritual practice of \"assuming temporary ascetic status\".\n\nThe Digambara Jain scholar Kundakunda, in his \"Pravacanasara\" states that a Jain mendicant should meditate on \"I, the pure self\". Anyone who considers his body or possessions as \"I am this, this is mine\" is on the wrong road, while one who meditates, thinking the antithesis and \"I am not others, they are not mine, I am one knowledge\" is on the right road to meditating on the \"soul, the pure self\".\n\nThere are many rituals in Jainism's various sects. According to Dundas, the ritualistic lay path among Śvētāmbara Jains is \"heavily imbued with ascetic values\", where the rituals either revere or celebrate the ascetic life of Tirthankaras, or mendicants, or progressively get closer to psychologically and physically living ever more like an ascetic. The ultimate ritual is \"sallekhana\", a religious death through ascetic abandonment of food and drinks. The Digambara Jains follow the same theme, but the details differ from Śvētāmbaras, and according to Dundas, the life cycle and religious rituals are closer to the liturgy found among Hindu traditions. The overlap in Jain and Hindu rituals is largely in the life cycle (rites-of-passage) rituals, according to Padmanabh Jaini, and likely one that developed over time because Jains and Hindus societies overlapped, and rituals were viewed as necessary and secular ceremonies.\n\nJains do not believe in a creator god, but do ritually worship numerous deities. The Jinas are prominent and a large focus of this ritualism, but they are not the only \"deva\" in Jainism. A Jina as \"deva\" is not an avatar (incarnation) in Jainism, but the highest state of omniscience that an ascetic \"tirthankara\" achieved. Out of the 24 Tirthankaras, Jain devotional worship is predominantly addressed to four: Mahāvīra, Parshvanatha, Neminatha and Rishabhanatha. Among the non-\"tirthankara\" saints, devotional worship is common for Bahubali among the Digambaras. Some of Jaina rituals remember the five life events of the \"tirthankaras\", called the \"Panch Kalyanaka\", are rituals such as the \"Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava\", \"Panch Kalyanaka Puja\" and \"Snatrapuja\".\nThe basic worship ritual practised by Jains is \"darsana\" (\"seeing\") of \"deva\", which includes Jina, or other yaksas, gods and goddesses such as Brahmadeva, 52 Viras, Padmavati, Ambika and 16 Vidyadevis (Sarasvati, Lakshmi, others). The Terapanthi sub-tradition of Digambaras do not worship many of the deities popular among mainstream Digambaras, and they limit their ritual worship to Tirthankaras. The worship ritual is called the \"devapuja\", is found in all Jaina sub traditions, which share common features. Typically, the Jaina layperson enters the temple inner sanctum in simple clothing and bare feet, with a plate filled with offerings, bows down, says the namaskara, completes his or her litany and prayers, sometimes is assisted by the temple priest, leaves the offerings and then departs.\n\nJain practices include performing \"abhisheka\" (\"ceremonial bath\") of the images. Some Jain sects employ a \"pujari\" (also called \"upadhye\") for rituals, who may be a non-Jain (a Hindu), to perform special rituals and other priestly duties at the temple. More elaborate worship includes ritual offerings such as rice, fresh and dry fruits, flowers, coconut, sweets, and money. Some may light up a lamp with camphor and make auspicious marks with sandalwood paste. Devotees also recite Jain texts, particularly the life stories of the tirthankaras.\n\nThe traditional Jains, like Buddhists and Hindus, believe in the efficacy of mantras and that certain sounds and words are inherently auspicious, powerful and spiritual. The most famous of the mantras, broadly accepted in various sects of Jainism, is the \"five homage\" (\"panca namaskara\") mantra which is believed to be eternal and existent since the first ford-maker's time. The medieval era Jain worship practices, according to Ellen Gough, also developed tantric diagrams of the \"Rishi-mandala\" where the \"tirthankaras\" are portrayed. The Tantric traditions within Jainism use mantra and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.\n\nJains celebrate many annual festivals. Many of the major festivals in Jainism fall in and around the \"comasu\" (Sanskrit: \"chaturmasa\") period of the calendar. It is the four month monsoon period when the Jain ascetics are mandated to remain in residence at one place in the Jain tradition, rather than be traveling or going around Indian villages and towns and never staying in one place for more than a month. The \"comasu\" period allows the four orders of the Jain community to be together and participate in the festive remembrances.\n\nThe most important annual Jain festival is called the \"Paryushana\" by Svetambaras and \"Dasa lakshana parva\" by the Digambaras. It is celebrated from the 12th day of waning moon in the traditional luni-solar month of Bhadrapada in the Indian calendar. This typically falls in August or September of the Gregorian calendar. It lasts eight days for Svetambaras, and ten days among the Digambaras. It is a time when lay people fast and pray. The five vows are emphasized during this time. Svetambaras recite the \"Kalpasūtras\", while Digambaras read their own texts. The festival is an occasion where Jains make active effort to stop cruelty towards other life forms, freeing animals in captivity and preventing slaughter of animals.\nThe last day involves a focused prayer/meditation session known as \"Samvatsari\". Jains consider this as a day of atonement, granting forgiveness to others, seeking forgiveness from all living beings, physically or mentally asking for forgiveness and resolving to treat everyone in the world as friends. Forgiveness is asked by saying \"\"Micchami Dukkadam\" or \"Khamat Khamna\"\" to others. This means, \"If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your forgiveness.\" The literal meaning of \"Paryushana\" is \"abiding\" or \"coming together\".\n\nMahavir Jayanti celebrates the birth of Mahāvīra. It is celebrated on the 13th day of the luni-solar month of Chaitra in the traditional Indian calendar. This typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar. The festivities include visiting Jain temples, pilgrimages to shrines, reading Jain texts and processions of Mahāvīra by the community. At his legendary birthplace of Kundagrama in Bihar, north of Patna, special events are held by Jains.\n\nDiwali is observed by Jains as the anniversary of Mahāvīra's attainment of \"moksha\". The Hindu festival of Diwali is also celebrated on the same date (\"Kartika Amavasya\"). Jain temples, homes, offices, and shops are decorated with lights and \"diyas\" (\"small oil lamps\"). The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Sweets are often distributed. On Diwali morning, \"Nirvan Ladoo\" is offered after praying to Mahāvīra in all Jain temples across the world. The Jain new year starts right after Diwali. Some other festivals celebrated by Jains are Akshaya Tritiya and Raksha Bandhan, similar to those in the Hindu communities.\n\nJainism monastic organization is a part of Jain society called \"sangh\". A \"sangh\" has a four-fold order, or \"caturvidh, sakal sangh\". This consists of \"sadhu\" (male ascetics, \"muni\"), \"sadhvi\" (female ascetics, \"aryika\"), \"śrāvaka\" (\"laymen\"), and \"śrāvikā\" (\"laywoman\"). The latter two support the ascetics and their monastic organizations called \"gacch\" or \"samuday\", in autonomous regional Jain congregations.\n\nDigambar tradition has two main monastic orders Mula Sangh and the Kashtha Sangh, both led by Bhattarakas. Other notable monastic orders include the Digambara Terapanth which emerged in the 17th century. Śvētāmbaras have their own \"sanghs\", but unlike Digambaras which have had predominantly \"sadhu sanghs\" (male monastic organizations), they have major \"sadhu\" and \"sadhvi\" \"sanghs\" (monks and nuns).\nAccording to Śvētāmbara Jain texts, from \"Kalpasūtras\" onwards, its monastic community has had more \"sadhvis\" than \"sadhus\" (female than male mendicants). In \"Tapa Gacch\" of the modern era, the ratio of \"sadhvis\" to \"sadhus\" (nuns to monks) is about 3.5 to 1. In contrast to Śvētāmbara, the Digambara sect monastic community has been predominantly male. In the Digambara tradition, a male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve his soul's liberation from rebirths through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in the Digambara sect of Jainism. The Śvētāmbaras disagree with the Digambaras, believing that women can also achieve liberation from \"Saṃsāra\" through ascetic practices.\n\nThe Jain monastic organization shares many parallels with those found in Buddhist and Brahmanical-Hindu monasticism. They all have similar rules, hierarchical structure, practices such as not traveling during the four-month monsoon season and celibacy. According to William Johnston, this is not likely from mutual borrowing of ideas, but because these traditions emerged from the same ancient Indian monastic traditions that preceded the Buddha and the Mahāvīra. There are some differences. For example, the Jain and Hindu monastic community has been traditionally more mobile and had an itinerant lifestyle, while Buddhist monks have favored belonging to a \"sangha\" (monastery) and staying in its premises. Buddhist monastic rules forbid a monk to go outside without wearing the sangha's distinctive ruddy robe, or to use wooden bowls. In contrast, Jain monastic rules have either required no clothes (Digambara) or white (Śvētāmbara) and the use of wooden or empty gourd as the begging bowl. The Jain monastic rules have encouraged the use of mouth cover, as well as a broom to gently remove any insect that comes in their path.\n\nJainism also prescribes seven supplementary vows which include three \"guņa vratas\" (\"merit vows\") and four \"śikşā vratas\".\n\nThe \"Sallekhana\" (or \"Santhara\") vow is a \"religious death\" ritual vow observed at the end of life, historically by Jain monks and nuns, but rare in the modern age. In this vow, there is voluntary and gradual reduction of food and liquid intake to end one's life by choice and with dispassion, In Jainism this is believed to reduce negative karma that affects a soul's future rebirths.\n\nThe Jain community is divided into two major denominations, Digambara and Śvētāmbara. Monks of the Digambara (\"sky-clad\") tradition do not wear clothes. Female monastics of the Digambara sect wear unstitched plain white sarees and are referred to as \"Aryikas\". Śvētāmbara (\"white-clad\") monastics, on the other hand, wear seamless white clothes.\n\nDuring Chandragupta Maurya's reign, Jain tradition states that \"Acharya\" Bhadrabahu predicted a twelve-year-long famine and moved to Karnataka with his disciples. Sthulabhadra, a pupil of \"Acharya\" Bhadrabahu, stayed in Magadha. Later, when followers of \"Acharya\" Bhadrabahu returned, they found those who had remained at Magadha had started wearing white clothes, which was unacceptable to the others who remained naked. This is how Jains believe the Digambara and Śvētāmbara schism began, with the former being naked while the latter wore white clothes. Digambara saw this as being opposed to the Jain tenet of \"aparigraha\" which, according to them, required not even possession of clothes, i.e. complete nudity. In the 5th-century CE, the Council of Valabhi was organized by Śvētāmbara, which Digambara did not attend. At the council, the Śvētāmbara adopted the texts they had preserved as canonical scriptures, which Digambara have ever since rejected. This council solidified the historic schism between these two major traditions of Jainism. The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit \"Suttapahuda\" of Kundakunda.\nOther than rejecting or accepting different ancient Jain texts, Digambaras and Śvētāmbara differ in other significant ways such as:\n\nExcavations at Mathura revealed Jain statues from the time of the Kushan Empire (c.1st century CE). \"Tirthankara\" represented without clothes, and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm, are identified as the \"Ardhaphalaka\" (\"half-clothed\") mentioned in texts. The Yapaniyas, believed to have originated from the \"Ardhaphalaka\", followed Digambara nudity along with several Śvētāmbara beliefs.\n\nBoth of the major Jain traditions evolved into sub-traditions over time. For example, the devotional worship traditions of Śvētāmbara are referred to as \"Murti-pujakas\", those who live in and around Jain temples became \"Deravasi\" or \"Mandira-margi\". Those who avoid temples and pursue their spirituality at a designated monastic meeting place came to be known as \"Sthānakavāsī\". About the 18th century, the Śvētāmbara and Digambara traditions saw an emergence of separate Terapanthi movements. Some scholars such as Malvaniya state that these ideas entered Jainism from an influence of Islam, while others such as Dundas state that these ideas, debates and movements can be traced in more ancient texts than the start of Islam.\n\nIn the modern era, according to Flügel, new Jaina religious movements that are a \"primarily devotional form of Jainism\" have developed which resemble \"Jain Mahayana\" style devotionalism.\n\nA male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. In the Digambara traditional belief, women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation. However, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Śvētāmbara sect that believes that women too can achieve spiritual liberation from rebirths in \"Saṃsāra\". The \"Śvētāmbaras\" state the 19th \"Tirthankara\" Māllīnātha was female. However, Digambara reject this, and worship Mallinatha as a male.\n\nThe \"dravya\" in Jainism are fundamental entities, called \"astikaya\" (literally, \"collection that exists\"). They are believed to be eternal, and the ontological building blocks that constitute and explain all existence, whether perceived or not.\n\nAccording to the Śvētāmbara tradition of Jainism, there are five eternal substances in existence: Soul (\"jiva\"), Matter (\"pudgala\"), Space (\"akasha\"), motion (\"Dharma\") and rest (\"Adharma\"). To this list of five, the Digambara Jain tradition adds \"Time\" (\"kala\") as the sixth eternal substance. In both traditions, the substance of space is conceptualized as \"world space\" (\"lokakasha\") and \"non-world space\" (\"alokiakasha\"). Further, both soul and matter are considered as active ontological substances, while the rest are inactive. Another categorization found in Jain philosophy is \"jiva\" and \"ajiva\", the latter being all \"dravya\" that is not \"jiva\".\n\n\"Jiva\" means \"soul\" in Jainism, and is also called \"jivatman\". It is a core concept and the fundamental focus of the Jain theology. The soul is believed to be eternal, and a substance that undergoes constant modifications, in every life, after every rebirth of a living being. \"Jiva\" consists of pure consciousness in the Jain thought, has innate \"free will\" that causes it to act but is believed to be intangible and formless. It is the soul that experiences existence and gains knowledge, not mind nor body both believed to a heap of matter. Jain philosophy further believes that the soul is the mechanism of rebirth, and karma accumulation. It is the same size in all living beings, such as a human being, a tiny insect and a large elephant. \"Jiva\" is everywhere, filling and infused in every minuscule part of the entire \"loka\" (realm of existence), according to Jainism. The soul has the potential to reach omniscience and eternal bliss, and end the cycles of rebirth and associated suffering, which is the goal of Jain spirituality.\n\nThe \"jiva\" is believed to rely on other \"dravya\" to function. The Jain philosophy completely separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness). Souls reside in bodies and journey endlessly through \"saṃsāra\" (that is, realms of existence through cycles of rebirths and redeaths).\n\n\"Jivas\" are believed to be of two types, stationary and mobile. Illustration of the former are plants, while moving \"jivas\" include examples such as human beings, animals, gods, hell beings and insects. \"Jivas\" are further classified in Jain philosophy by assigned number of senses which range from one sensory organ to five sensory organs. Inert world such as air, fire or clod of dirt, considered non-sensate in contemporary science, are asserted in historic texts of Jainism to be living and with sensory powers.\n\n\"Ajiva\" consists of everything other than \"jiva\". Life processes such as breath, means of knowledge such as language, all emotional and biological experiences such as pleasure and pain are all believed in Jainism to be made of \"pudgala\" (\"matter\"). These interact with \"tattva\" or reality to create, bind, destroy or unbind karma particles to the soul.\n\nAccording to Dundas, \"Dharma\" as a metaphysical substance in Jain philosophy may be understood as \"that which carries\" instead of the literal sense of ordinary physical motion. Thus, \"dharma\" includes all verbal and mental activity, that contribute to karma and purification of the soul.\n\n\"Tattva\" connotes \"Reality, Truth\" in Jain philosophy, and is the framework for salvation. According to Digambara Jains, there are seven \"tattvas\", while Śvētāmbaras believe in nine \"tattvas\":\n\nThe true insight in Jain philosophy is considered as \"faith in the \"tattvas\"\". The spiritual goal in Jainism is to reach \"moksha\" for ascetics, but for most Jain laypersons and ascetics it is to accumulate good karma that leads to better rebirth and a step closer to liberation.\n\nAccording to Jainism, the existence of \"a bound and ever changing soul\" is a self-evident truth, an axiom which does not need to be proven. There are numerous souls, but every one of them has three qualities (\"Guṇa\"): consciousness (\"caitanya\", most important quality of soul), bliss (\"sukha\") and vibrational energy (\"virya\"). The vibration draws karmic particles to the soul and creates bondages, but is also what adds merit or demerit to the soul.\n\nKarma, like in other Indian religions, connotes in Jainism the universal cause and effect law. However, it is envisioned as a material substance (subtle matter) that can bind to the soul, travel with the soul substance in bound form between rebirths, and affect the suffering and happiness experienced by the \"jiva\" in the \"lokas\". Karma is also believed to obscure and obstruct the innate nature and striving of the soul, as well as its spiritual potential in the next rebirth.\n\nThe relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology. Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths. Karma is thus an efficient cause (\"nimitta\") in Jain philosophy, but not the material cause (\"upadana\"). The soul is believed to be the material cause.\n\n\"Tirthankara-nama-karma\" is a special type of karma, bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a \"tirthankara\".\nJain texts state that souls exist as \"clothed with material bodies\", where it entirely fills up the body. There are five types of bodies in the Jaina thought: earthly (e.g. most humans, animals and plants), metamorphic (e.g. gods, hell beings, fine matter, some animals and a few humans who can morph because of their perfections), transference type (e.g. good and pure substances realized by ascetics), fiery (e.g. heat that transforms or digests food), and karmic (the substrate where the karmic particles reside and which make the soul ever changing).\n\nJain philosophy further divides the earthly body by symmetry, number of sensory organs, vitalities (\"ayus\"), functional capabilities and whether one body hosts one soul or one body hosts many. Every living being has one to five senses, three \"balas\" (power of body, language and mind), respiration (inhalation and exhalation), and life-duration. All living beings, in every realm including the gods and hell beings, accrue and destroy eight types of karma according to the elaborate theories in Jain texts. Elaborate descriptions of the shape and function of the physical and metaphysical universe, and its constituents, are also provided in the Jain texts. All of these elaborate theories attempt to illustrate and consistently explain the Jain karma theory in a deeply moral framework, much like Buddhism and Hinduism but with significant differences in the details and assumptions.\n\nThe conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (\"jiva\") is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions. It is not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism. The Jaina theosophy, unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through \"Saṃsāra\". As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives. With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.\n\nSouls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through \"Saṃsāra\". Some evolve to a higher state; some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma. Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist \"Abhavya\" (\"incapable\"), or a class of souls that can never attain \"moksha\" (\"liberation\"). The \"Abhavya\" state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act. Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to \"Advaita\"-style (\"not two\") nondualism of Hinduism, or \"Advaya\"-style nondualism of Buddhism. A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond \"Saṃsāra\", is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a \"Siddha\".\n\nJain texts propound that the universe consists of many eternal \"lokas\" (\"realms of existence\"). As in Buddhism and Hinduism, Jain cosmology believes both time and the universe are eternal without beginning and end, and that the universe is transient (impermanent in attributes) at the same time. The universe, body, matter and time are considered in Jain philosophy as separate from the soul (\"jiva\" or \"jivatman\"). Their interaction explains life, living, death and rebirth.\nAccording to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into three parts, the upper, middle, and lower worlds, called respectively \"urdhva loka\", \"madhya loka\", and \"adho loka\". As with the realms of existences, \"Kāla\" (\"time\") is without beginning and eternal; the cosmic wheel of time, called \"kālachakra\", rotates ceaselessly. According to Jain texts, in this part of the universe, there are six periods of time within two aeons (\"ara\"), and in the first aeon the universe generates, and in the next it degenerates. Thus, the worldly cycle of time is divided into two parts or half-cycles, \"utsarpiṇī\" (\"ascending\") and \"avasarpiṇī\" (\"descending\"). \"Utsarpiṇī\" is a period of progressive prosperity, where happiness increases, while \"avasarpiṇī\" is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality. According to Jain cosmology, it is currently the fifth \"ara\" of \"avasarpiṇī\" (half time cycle of degeneration). The present age is one of sorrow and misery, of religious decline, where the height and shape of living beings shrink. Jain thought holds that after the sixth \"ara\", the universe will be reawakened in the new cycle and the start of \"utsarpiṇī\" \"aras\".\n\nAccording to Jain texts, sixty-three illustrious beings, called \"śalākāpuruṣas\", are born on this earth in every \"Dukhama-sukhamā\" \"ara\". The Jain universal history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons. They comprise twenty-four \"Tīrthaṅkaras\", twelve \"chakravartins\", nine \"balabhadra\", nine \"narayana\", and nine \"pratinarayana\".\n\nA \"chakravartī\" is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm. Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the vastness of the cosmos. Jain \"puranas\" give a list of twelve \"chakravartins\" (\"universal monarchs\"). They are golden in complexion. One of the \"chakravartins\" mentioned in Jain scriptures is Bharata Chakravartin. Jain texts like \"Harivamsa Purana\" and Hindu Texts like \"Vishnu Purana\" state that Indian subcontinent came to be known as \"Bharata varsha\" in his memory.\n\nThere are nine sets of \"balabhadra\", \"narayana\", and \"pratinarayana\". The \"balabhadra\" and \"narayana\" are brothers. \"Balabhadra\" are nonviolent heroes, \"narayana\" are violent heroes, and \"pratinarayana\" the villains. According to the legends, the \"narayana\" ultimately kill the \"pratinarayana\". Of the nine \"balabhadra\", eight attain liberation and the last goes to heaven. On death, the \"narayana\" go to hell because of their violent exploits, even if these were intended to uphold righteousness.\n\nJain cosmology divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts (\"avasarpiṇī\" and \"utsarpiṇī\"). According to Jain belief, in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four \"tīrthaṅkaras\" are born in the human realm to discover and teach the Jain doctrine appropriate for that era. The word \"tīrthankara\" signifies the founder of a \"tirtha\", which means a fordable passage across a sea. The \"tīrthaṅkaras\" show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths. Rishabhanatha is said to be the first \"tīrthankara\" of the present half-cycle (\"avasarpiṇī\"). Mahāvīra (6th century BC) is revered as the twenty fourth \"tīrthankara\" of \"avasarpiṇī\". Jain texts explain that Jainism has always existed and will always exist.\n\nIn Jainism, perfect souls \"with\" the body are called \"arihant\" (\"victors\") and perfect souls \"without\" the body are called \"Siddhas\" (\"liberated souls\").\n\nAccording to Jainism, the universe was never created, nor will it ever cease to exist. It is independent and self-sufficient, does not require a creator nor any superior power to govern it, nor a judge nor destroyer. In this belief, it is distinct from the monotheistic Abrahamic religions; it is similar to Buddhism. It shares premises with the non-theistic part of the spectrum of diverse beliefs found in different traditions within Hindu philosophy and distinct from theistic Hindu traditions.\n\nJain texts reject the idea of a creator, ruler or destroyer god and postulate an eternal universe. However, Jainism believes in the world of gods and hell beings who are born, and who die to be reborn like living beings in the earthly realm of existence. Those souls who live in the body of a god do so because of their positive karma. They have a metamorphic body, that is they are believed in Jain thought to be able to change their body at will. The gods live a life of happiness, fun and frolic, whose wishes are automatically fulfilled. They also possess a more transcendent knowledge about material things and can anticipate events in the human realms. However, once their past karmic merit is exhausted, the souls leave the \"god body\" and are reborn again as humans, animals or other beings.\n\nJain philosophy accepts three reliable means of knowledge (\"pramana\"). It holds that correct knowledge is based on perception (\"pratyaksa\"), inference (\"anumana\") and testimony (\"sabda\" or the word of scriptures). These ideas are elaborated in Jain texts such as \"Tattvarthasūtra\", \"Parvacanasara\", \"Nandi\" and \"Anuyogadvarini\". Some Jain texts add analogy (\"upamana\") as the fourth reliable means, in a manner similar to epistemological theories found in other Indian religions.\n\nIn Jainism, \"jnāna\" (\"knowledge\") is said to be of five kinds—\"Kevala Jnana\" (\"Omniscience\"), \"Śrutu Jñāna\" (\"Scriptural Knowledge\"), \"Mati Jñāna\" (\"Sensory Knowledge\"), \"Avadhi Jñāna\" (\"Clairvoyance\"), and \"Manah prayāya Jñāna\" (\"Telepathy\"). According to the Jain text \"Tattvartha sūtra\", the first two are indirect knowledge and the remaining three are direct knowledge.\n\nAccording to Jainism, purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels:\n\nJain texts often add \"samyak tap\" (Correct Asceticism) as the fourth jewel, thereby emphasizing their belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation (moksha). The four jewels of orthodox Jain ideology are called \"moksha marg\". According to Jain texts, the liberated pure soul (\"Siddha\") goes up to the summit of universe (\"Siddhashila\") and dwells there in eternal bliss.\n\nJain scriptures are called \"Agamas\". They are believed to have been verbally transmitted by the oral tradition from one generation to the next, much like the ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts. The Jain tradition believes that their religion is eternal, and the teachings of their first \"Tirthankara Rishabhanatha\" were their scriptures millions of years ago. The mythology states that the \"tirthankara\" taught in a divine preaching hall called \"samavasarana\", which were heard by the gods, the ascetics and laypersons. The discourse delivered is called \"Śhrut Jnāna\" and comprises eleven \"angas\" and fourteen \"purvas\". The discourse is remembered and transmitted by the \"Ganadharas\" (\"chief disciples\"), and is composed of twelve \"angas\" (\"departments\"). It is symbolically represented by a tree with twelve branches.\n\nAccording to the Jain tradition, an \"araha\" (\"worthy one\") speaks meaning that is then converted into \"sūtra\" (\"sutta\") by his disciples, and from such \"sūtras\" emerge the doctrine. The creation and transmission of the \"Agama\" is the work of disciples in Jainism. These texts, historically for Jains, have represented the truths uttered by their \"tirthankaras\", particularly the Mahāvīra. In every cycle of Jain cosmology, twenty-four \"tirthankaras\" appear and so do the Jain scriptures for that \"ara\". The spoken scriptural language is believed to be \"Ardhamagadhi\" by the Śvētāmbara Jains, and a form of sonic resonance by the Digambara Jains. These then become coded into \"duvala samgagani pidaga\" (twelve limbed baskets by disciples), but transmitted orally. In the 980th year after Mahāvīra's death (~5th century CE), the texts were written down for the first time by the Council of Valabhi.\n\nThe Śvētāmbaras believe that they have the original Jain scriptures. The Śvētāmbara belief is denied by the Digambaras, who instead believe the scriptures were lost. The Śvētāmbaras state that their collection of 45 works represent a continuous tradition, though they accept that their collection is also incomplete because of a lost Anga text and four lost Purva texts. The Digambara sect of Jainism believes that Āchārya Bhutabali was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. According to them, Digambara \"Āchāryas\" recreated the oldest-known Digambara Jain texts, including the four \"anuyoga\". According to von Glasenapp, the Digambara texts partially agree with the enumerations and works of older Śvētāmbara texts, but in many cases there are also gross differences between the texts of the two major Jain traditions.\n\nThe Śvētāmbara consider their 45 text collection as canonical. The Digambaras created a secondary canon between 600 and 900 CE, compiling it into four groups: history, cosmography, philosophy and ethics. This four-set collection is called the \"four \"Vedas\"\" by the Digambaras.\n\nThe most popular and influential texts of Jainism have been its non-canonical literature. Of these, the \"Kalpa Sūtras\" are particularly popular among Śvētāmbaras, which they attribute to Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE). This ancient scholar is revered in the Digambara tradition, and they believe he led their migration into the ancient south Karnataka region, and created their tradition. Śvētāmbaras disagree, and they believe that Bhadrabahu moved to Nepal, not into peninsular India. Both traditions, however, consider his \"Niryuktis\" and \"Samhitas\" as important texts. The earliest surviving Sanskrit text by Umaswati called the \"Tattvarthasūtra\" is considered authoritative Jain philosophy text by all traditions of Jainism. His text has the same importance in Jainism as \"Vedanta Sūtras\" and \"Yogasūtras\" have in Hinduism.\n\nIn the Digambara tradition, the texts written by Kundakunda are highly revered and have been historically influential. Other important Jain texts include: \"Samayasara\", \"Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra\", and \"Niyamasara\".\n\nParts of the Sangam literature in Tamil are attributed to Jaina authors. The authenticity and interpolations are controversial, because the Sangam literature presents Hindu ideas. Some scholars state that the Jain portions of the Sangam literature were added about or after the 8th-century CE, and they are not the ancient layer.\n\nTamil Jain texts such as the \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\" and \"Nālaṭiyār\" are credited to Digambara Jain authors. These texts have seen interpolations and revisions. For example, it is generally accepted now that the Jain nun Kanti inserted a 445-verse poem into \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\" in the 12th century. The Tamil Jain literature, according to Dundas, has been \"lovingly studied and commented upon for centuries by Hindus as well as Jains\". The themes of two of the Tamil epics, including the \"Silapadikkaram\", have an embedded influence of Jainism.\n\nJain scholars also contributed to Kannada literature. The Digambara Jain texts in Karnataka are unusual, in that they were written under the patronage of kings and regional aristocrats. These Jain texts describe warrior violence and martial valor as equivalent to a \"fully committed Jain ascetic\". They thus set aside the religious premise of absolute non-violence, possibly reflecting an effort to syncretise various doctrines and beliefs found in Hinduism and Jainism.\n\nJain manuscript libraries, called \"bhandaras\" inside Jain temples, are the oldest surviving in India. Jain libraries, including the Śvētāmbara collections at Patan, Gujarat and Jaiselmer, Rajasthan, as well as the Digambara collections in Karnataka temples, have a large number of well-preserved manuscripts. The manuscripts in the Jain libraries include Jaina literature, as well as Hindu and Buddhist texts. Almost all their texts have been dated to about, or after, the 11th century CE. The largest and most valuable libraries are found in the Thar Desert, hidden in the underground vaults of Jain temples. These collections have witnessed insect damage, and only a small portion of these manuscripts have been published and studied by scholars.\n\nJainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All of them believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates, amongst other things, the premise of \"anatta\" (\"non-self\", \"no eternal self or soul\"). Hinduism incorporates the premise of an eternal unchanging \"atman\" (\"self\", \"soul\"), while Jainism incorporates the premises of a \"jiva\" (\"self\", \"soul\") that is both eternal and changing. In Jaina thought, there are infinite eternal \"jivas\", predominantly all of which are in their cycles of rebirth, and a few who have liberated themselves through an ascetic life and become \"siddhas\" (\"a perfect one\"). In contrast to Jainism, Hindu philosophies express a spectrum of views, ranging from nondualism where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one, to dualism where souls are same and have Brahman-nature but are different from Brahman, and to other ideas. Further, in Hindu thought, Jainism-style asceticism is not emphasized, rather liberation is achievable through alternate paths such as Jnana yoga, Karma yoga and Bhakti yoga.\n\nWhile both Hinduism and Jainism believe \"soul exists\" to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and the constant (\"vibhu\") but some Hindu scholars proposed soul to be atomic. The Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and Brahman through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, the Jaina thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.\n\nSome early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the caste system in Hinduism. Later scholars, such as Gombrich state that this notion is an error for which \"mainly Western authors are responsible\". A caste system has been a historic part of Jain society. According to Vilas Adinath Sangave, \"caste system is a universal feature of the Jaina community\", and the focus of Jainism has been the spiritual liberation of the individual rather than social reforms. According to Padamnath Jaini, the 8th-century Digambara scholar Jinasena stated that Jain king Bharata, the son of first \"tirthankara\" named Rishabhanatha, invented the caste system by performing the \"ahiṃsā\" (non-violence) test, with Jain Brahmins being those who followed the non-violence precept.\n\nAll three religions share concepts and doctrines such as karma and rebirth, and have similar ritual festival grammar, mythologies and monastic traditions. They do not believe in eternal heaven or hell or judgment day. Jainism, like Buddhism and Hinduism, grants the freedom to choose beliefs such as in gods or no-gods, agree or disagree with core teachings, participate or not participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. They all consider ethical values such as non-violence to be important, and link suffering to craving, individual's actions, intents and karma, and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (\"moksha\").\n\nJainism is similar to Buddhism in epistemically rejecting the Vedas and the Hindu metaphysical concept for Reality called Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe \"soul exists\" as a self-evident truth, and in their historic theology and practice have been more similar than with Buddhism. Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried over their history, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India.\n\nJainism has contributed significantly to Indian art and architecture. Jain arts depict life legends of \"tirthankara\" or other important people, particularly with them in a seated or standing meditative posture. \"Yakshas\" and \"yakshinis\", attendant spirits who guard the \"tirthankara\", are usually shown with them. The earliest known Jain image is in the Patna museum. It is dated approximately to the 3rd century BCE. Bronze images of Pārśva can be seen in the Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai, and in the Patna museum; these are dated to the 2nd century BCE.\n\"Ayagapata\" is a type of votive tablet used in Jainism for donation and worship in the early centuries. These tablets are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as the \"stupa\", \"dharmacakra\" and \"triratna\". They present simultaneous trends or image and symbol worship. Numerous such stone tablets were discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites like Kankali Tila near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, India. The practice of donating these tablets is documented from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE.\n\n\"Samavasarana\", a preaching hall of \"tirthankaras\" with various beings concentrically placed, is an important theme of Jain art.\n\nThe Jain tower in Chittor, Rajasthan, is a good example of Jain architecture. Decorated manuscripts are preserved in Jain libraries, containing diagrams from Jain cosmology. Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as \"Panch Kalyanaka\", from the life of the \"tirthankara\". Rishabha, the first \"tirthankara\", is usually depicted in either the lotus position or \"kayotsarga\", the standing position. He is distinguished from other \"tirthankara\" by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures. In paintings, incidents from his life, like his marriage and Indra marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi. Each of the twenty-four \"tirthankara\" is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such texts as \"Tiloyapannati\", \"Kahavaali\" and \"Pravacanasaarodhara\".\n\nA Jain temple, \"Derasar\" or \"Basadi\" is a place of worship for Jains. Jain temples are built with various architectural designs, but there are mainly two type of Jain temples:\n\nThere is always a main deity also known as \"moolnayak\" in every Jain temple placed inside a sanctum called \"\"Gambhara\"\" (Garbha Griha). A \"manastambha\" (\"column of honor\") is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.\n\nThere are 26 caves, 200 stone beds, 60 inscriptions, and over 100 sculptures in and around Madurai. This is also the site where Jain ascetics wrote great epics and books on grammar in Tamil.\n\nAncient Jain monuments include the Udaigiri Hills near Bhelsa (Vidisha) in Madhya Pradesh, the Ellora in Maharashtra, the Palitana temples in Gujarat, and the Jain temples at Dilwara Temples near Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Chaumukha temple in Ranakpur is considered one of the most beautiful Jain temples and is famous for its detailed carvings. According to Jain texts, Shikharji is the place where twenty of the twenty-four Jain \"Tīrthaṅkaras\" along with many other monks attained \"moksha\" (died without being reborn, with their soul in \"Siddhashila\"). The Shikharji site in northeastern Jharkhand is therefore a revered pilgrimage site. The Palitana temples are the holiest shrine for the Śvētāmbara Murtipujaka sect. Along with Shikharji the two sites are considered the holiest of all pilgrimage sites by the Jain community.\n\nThe Jain complex, Khajuraho and Jain Narayana temple are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shravanabelagola, Saavira Kambada Basadi or \"1000 pillars\" and Brahma Jinalaya are important Jain centers in Karnataka.\n\nThe Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves dating back to the 2nd–1st century BCE are dedicated to Jainism. They are rich with carvings of Jain \"tirthanakars\" and deities with inscriptions including the \"Hathigumpha\" inscription (\"Elephant Cave\" inscription). Jain cave temples at Badami, Mangi-Tungi and the Ellora Caves are considered important.\n\nThe Sittanavasal Cave temple is regarded as one of the finest examples of Jain art. It is the oldest and most famous Jain centre in the region. It possesses both an early Jain cave shelter, and a medieval rock-cut temple with excellent fresco paintings comparable to Ajantha paintings; the steep hill contains an isolated but spacious cavern. Locally, this cavern is known as \"Eladipattam\", a name that is derived from the seven holes cut into the rock that serve as steps leading to the shelter. Within the cave there are seventeen stone beds aligned in rows; each of these has a raised portion that could have served as a pillow-loft. The largest stone bed has a distinct Tamil-Brahmi inscription assignable to the 2nd century BCE, and some inscriptions belonging to the 8th century BCE are also found on the nearby beds. The Sittannavasal cavern continued to be the Holy Sramana Abode until the 7th and 8th centuries. Inscriptions over the remaining stone beds name mendicants such as Tol kunrattu Kadavulan, Tirunilan, Tiruppuranan, Tittaicharanan, Sri Purrnacandran, Thiruchatthan, Ilangowthaman, Sri Ulagathithan, and Nityakaran Pattakali as monks.\nThe 8th century Kazhugumalai temple marks the revival of Jainism in South India.\n\nJain \"Tirtha\" (\"pilgrim\") sites are divided into the following categories:\n\nOutside contemporary India, Jain communities built temples in locations such as Nagarparkar, Sindh (Pakistan). However, according to a UNESCO tentative world heritage site application, Nagarparkar was not a \"major religious centre or a place of pilgrimage\" for Jainism, but it was once an important cultural landscape before \"the last remaining Jain community left the area in 1947 at Partition\".\n\nJain sculptures are mainly images depicting \"tīrthaṅkaras\". A sculpture could depict any of the twenty-four \"tīrthaṅkarass\" images. Parshvanatha, Rishabhanatha and Mahāvīra are among the more popular. These \"tīrthaṅkaras\" usually depicted in the lotus position or \"kayotsarga\". Sculptures of \"chaumukha\" (\"quadruple\") images are also popular in Jainism. Sculptures of Arihant, Bahubali, and protector deities like Ambika are also found. \"Tirthanakar\" idols look similar and are differentiated by the symbol belonging to each \"tirthanakar\" except Parshvanatha. Statues of Parshvanath have a snake crown on head. There are a few differences between the Digambara and the Śvētāmbara depictions of idols. Digambara images are naked without any beautification, whereas Śvētāmbara depictions are clothed and decorated with temporary ornaments.\n\nA monolithic, statue of Bahubali, referred to as \"Gommateshvara\", built in 981 CE by the Ganga minister and commander Chavundaraya, is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the Hassan district of Karnataka state. This statue was voted first in the SMS poll Seven Wonders of India conducted by \"The Times of India\". The Statue of Ahiṃsā (depicting Rishabhanatha) was erected in the Nashik district in 2015; it is tall. Idols made from \"Ashtadhatu\" (literally \"eight metals\"), Akota Bronze, brass, gold, silver, stone monoliths, rock cut, and precious stones are popular in Jainism.\n\nA large number of \"ayagapata\", votive tablets for offerings and the worship of \"tīrthankara\", were excavated from Kankali Tila, Mathura. These sculptures date from the 2nd century BCE to the 12th century CE.\n\nJain icons and arts incorporate symbols such as swastika, om, and the \"Ashtamangala\".\n\nThe swastika is an important Jain symbol. Its four arms symbolise the four realms of existence in which rebirth occurs according to Jainism: humans, heavenly beings, hellish beings and non-humans (plants and animals). This is conceptually similar to the six realms of rebirth represented by \"bhavachakra\" in Buddhism. It is usually shown with three dots on the top, which represent the three jewels mentioned in ancient texts such as \"Tattvartha sūtra\" and \"Uttaradhyayana sūtra\": correct faith, correct understanding and correct conduct. These jewels are the means believed in Jainism to lead one to the state of spiritual perfection, a state that is symbolically represented by a crescent and one dot on top representing the liberated soul.\n\nThe hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes \"ahimsā\" in Jainism with \"ahiṃsā\" written in the middle. The wheel represents the \"dharmachakra\" (\"Wheel of the Dharma\"), which stands for the resolve to halt the \"saṃsāra\" (\"wandering\") through the relentless pursuit of \"ahimsā\" (\"compassion\").\n\nIn Jainism, \"Om\" is considered a condensed form of reference to the \"Pañca-Parameṣṭhi\", by their initials \"A+A+A+U+M\" (\"\"). According to the \"Dravyasamgraha\" by Acharya Nemicandra, \"AAAUM\" (or just \"Om\") is a one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: \"\"Arihant\", \"Ashiri\", \"Acharya\", \"Upajjhaya\", \"Muni\"\". The \"Om\" symbol is also used in ancient Jain scriptures to represent the five lines of the \"Ṇamōkāra\" Mantra.\n\nIn 1974, on the 2500th anniversary of the nirvana of Mahāvīra, the Jain community chose one image as an emblem to be the main identifying symbol for Jainism. The overall shape depicts the three \"loka\" (\"realms of rebirth\") of Jain cosmology i.e., heaven, human world and hell. The semi-circular topmost portion symbolizes \"Siddhashila\", which is a zone beyond the three realms. The Jain swastika is present in the top portion, and the symbol of \"Ahiṃsā\" in the lower portion. At the bottom of the emblem is the Jain mantra, \"Parasparopagraho Jīvānām\". According to Vilas Sangave, the mantra means \"all life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence\". According to Anne Vallely, this mantra is from sūtra 5.21 of Umaswati's \"Tattvarthasūtra\", and it means \"souls render service to one another\".\n\nThe five colours of the Jain flag represent the \"Pañca-Parameṣṭhi\" and the five vows, small as well as great:\n\nThe \"Ashtamangala\" are a set of eight auspicious symbols, which are different in the Digambara and Śvētāmbar traditions.\n\nIn the Digambara tradition, the eight auspicious symbols are Chatra, \"Dhvaja\", \"Kalasha\", Chaamara, Mirror, Chair, Hand fan and Vessel. In the Śvētāmbar tradition, these are Swastika, \"Srivatsa\", \"Nandavarta\", \"Vardhmanaka\" (\"food vessel\"), \"Bhadrasana\" (\"seat\"), \"Kalasha\" (\"pot\"), \"Darpan\" (\"mirror\") and pair of fish.\n\nThe origins of Jainism are obscure. The Jains claim their religion to be eternal, and consider Rishabhanatha to be the founder in the present time-cycle, the first of 24 Jain \"tirthankaras\" in Jain belief, and someone who lived for 8,400,000 purva years. According to one hypothesis, such as one by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the first vice president of India, Jainism was in existence before the Vedas were composed. According to historians, the first 22 of the 24 \"tirthankaras\" were mythical figures. These figures were supposed to have lived more than 85,000 years ago. They were five to hundred times taller than average human beings and lived for thousands of years. The 23rd \"tirthankara\", Parshvanatha, is generally accepted to be based on an ancient historic human being of uncertain dates, possibly 8th–7th century BCE.\n\nSome confessional Jain scholars such as Parikh have argued that some images such as those of the bull in Indus Valley Civilization seal may be related to Jainism, but such claims are highly speculative and a subjective interpretation. This theory has not been accepted by most scholars because very little is known about the Indus Valley iconography and script. Jainism, like Buddhism, is one of the \"Sramana\" traditions of ancient India, those that rejected the Vedas and developed their own scriptures.\n\nThere is inscriptional evidence for the presence of Jain monks in south India by the second or first centuries BC, and archaeological evidence of Jain monks in Saurashtra in Gujarat by the second century CE. Statues of Jain \"tirthankara\" have been found dating back to second century BC.\n\nInformation regarding the political history of Jainism is uncertain and fragmentary. Jains consider the king Bimbisara (c. 558–491 BCE), Ajatashatru (c. 492–460 BCE), and Udayin (c. 460-440 BCE) of the Haryanka dynasty as a patron of Jainism.\n\nJain tradition states that Chandragupta Maurya (322–298 BCE), the founder of the Mauryan Empire and grandfather of Ashoka, became a monk and disciple of Jain ascetic Bhadrabahu during later part of his life. According to historians, Chandragupta's story appears in various versions in Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu texts. Broadly, Chandragupta was born into a humble family, abandoned, raised as a son by another family, then with the training and counsel of Chanakya of \"Arthashastra\" fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India. According to Jain history, late in his life, Chandragupta renounced the empire he built and handed over his power to his son, became a Jaina monk, and headed to meditate and pursue spirituality in the Deccan region, under the Jaina teacher Bhadrabahu at Shravanabelagola. There state Jain texts, he died by fasting, a Jaina ascetic method of ending one's life by choice (\"Sallenkana vrata\"). The 3rd century BCE emperor Ashoka, in his pillar edicts, mentions several ancient Indian religious groups including the \"Niganthas\" (Jaina).\n\nAccording to another Jain legend, King Salivahana of the late 1st century CE was a patron of Jainism, as were many others in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE. But von Glasenapp states that the historicity of these stories is difficult to establish. Archeological evidence suggests that Mathura was an important Jain centre between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE. Inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd century CE show that the schism between Digambara and Śvētāmbara had already taken place.\n\nKing Harshavardhana of the 7th century grew up in Shaivism, following his family, but he championed Jainism, Buddhism and all traditions of Hinduism. King Ama of the 8th century converted to Jainism, and the Jaina pilgrimage tradition was well established in his era. Mularaja, the founder of Chalukya dynasty, constructed a Jain temple, even though he was not a Jain.\n\nIn the second half of the 1st century CE, Hindu kings sponsored and helped build major Jaina cave temples. For example, the Hindu Rashtrakuta dynasty started the early group of Jain temples, and the Yadava dynasty built many of the middle and later Jain group of temples at the Ellora Caves between 700 and 1000 CE.\n\nMahāvīra and Buddha are generally accepted as contemporaries (circa 5th century BCE). The interaction between Jainism and Buddhism began with the Buddha. Buddhist texts refer to Mahāvīra as \"Nigantha Nataputta\".\n\nBeyond the times of the Mahāvīra and the Buddha, the two ascetic \"sramana\" (\"seeker\") religions competed for followers as well as the merchant trade networks that sustained them. Their mutual interaction, along with those of Hindu traditions, have been significant. In some cases the titles of the Buddhist and Jaina texts are the same or similar but present different doctrines.\n\nRoyal patronage has been a key factor in the growth as well as the decline of Jainism. The Pallava King Mahendravarman I (600630 CE) converted from Jainism to Shaivism under the influence of Appar. His work \"Mattavilasa Prahasana\" ridicules certain Shaiva sects and the Buddhists and also expresses contempt towards Jain ascetics. Sambandar converted the contemporary Pandya king to Shaivism. During the 11th century, Basava, a minister to the Jain Kalachuri king Bijjala, succeeded in converting numerous Jains to the Lingayat Shaivite sect. The Lingayats destroyed various temples belonging to Jains and adapted them to their use. The Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana (c.11081152 CE) became a follower of the Vaishnava sect under the influence of Ramanuja, after which Vaishnavism grew rapidly in what is now Karnataka.\nJainism and Hinduism influenced each other. Jain texts declare some of the Hindu gods as blood relatives of legendary \"tirthankara\". Neminatha, the 22nd \"tirthankara\" for example is presented as a cousin of Krishna in Jain Puranas and other texts. However, Jain scholars such as Haribhadra also wrote satires about Hindu gods, mocking them with novel outrageous stories where the gods misbehave and act unethically. The Hindu gods are presented by some Jain writers as persecuting, tempting, afraid of, or serving a legendary Jina before he gains omniscience. In other stories, one or more Jinas easily defeat the Hindu deities such as Vishnu, or Rama and Sita who come to pay respect to a Jina at a major Jain pilgrimage site such as Mount Satrunjaya.\n\nThe Jain and Hindu communities have often been very close and mutually accepting. Some Hindu temples have included a Jain \"Tirthankara\" within its premises in a place of honour. Similarly numerous temple complexes feature both Hindu and Jain monuments, with Badami cave temples and Khajuraho among some of the most well known.\nJainism faced persecution during and after the Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent. Muslims rulers, such as Mahmud Ghazni (1001), Mohammad Ghori (1175) and Ala-ud-din Muhammed Shah Khalji (1298) further oppressed the Jain community. They vandalised idols and destroyed temples or converted them into mosques. They also burned Jain books and killed Jains. There were significant exceptions, such as Emperor Akbar (15421605) whose legendary religious tolerance, out of respect for Jains, ordered the release of caged birds and banned the killing of animals on the Jain festival of Paryusan. After Akbar, Jains faced an intense period of Muslim persecution in the 17th century.\n\nThe Jain community were the traditional bankers and financiers, and this significantly impacted the Muslim rulers. However, they rarely were a part of the political power during the Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nColonial era reports and Christian missions variously viewed Jainism as either a sect of Hinduism or Buddhism, or as a distinct religion. According to Padmanath Jaini, Christian missionaries expressed extreme frustration at Jain people without pagan creator gods refusing to convert to Christianity, while colonial era Jain scholars such as Champat Rai Jain defended Jainism against criticism and misrepresentation by Christian activists. Missionaries of Christianity and Islam considered Jain traditions as idolatrous and a false religion, characterizing Jain temples and icons, such of those of Jina, as false idols and superstitious practices. These criticisms, states John Cort, were flawed and also ignored similar practices within sects of Christianity.\n\nThe British colonial government in India, as well as Indian princely states, passed laws that made monks roaming naked in streets a crime, one that led to arrest. This law particularly impacted the Digambara monks. The Akhil Bharatiya Jaina Samaj opposed this law, and argued that it interfered with the religious rights of Jains. Acharya Shantisagar entered Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1927, but was forced to cover his body. He then led an India-wide tour as the naked monk with his followers, to various Digambara sacred sites, and was welcomed by kings of the Maharashtra provinces. Shantisagar fasted to oppose the restrictions imposed on Digambara monks by the British Raj and prompted their discontinuance. The colonial era laws that banned naked monks remained effective through World War II, but they were abolished by independent India after it gained independence.\n\nFollowers of the path practised by the Jinas are known as Jains. The majority of Jains currently reside in India. With four to five million followers worldwide, Jainism is relatively small compared to major world religions. Jains form 0.37% of India's population. Most of them are concentrated in the states of Maharashtra (1.4 million in 2011, 31.46% of Indian Jains), Rajasthan (13.97%), Gujarat (13.02%) and Madhya Pradesh (12.74%). Karnataka (9.89%), Uttar Pradesh (4.79%), Delhi (3.73%) and Tamil Nadu (2.01%) also have significant Jain populations. Outside India, Jain communities can be found in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and Kenya.\n\nAccording to the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-4) conducted in 2015-16, Jains form the wealthiest community in India. Jains have the highest literacy rate (87%) in India, in the 7-years to oldest age group, according to its 2011 census. The Jaina community also has the highest number of college graduates. Excluding the retired senior citizens, Jain literacy rate in India exceeded 97%. The female to male child sex ratio in the 0-6 year age was second lowest for Jains (870 girls per 1,000 boys), higher than Sikhs in India. Further, Jain males have the highest work participation rates, while Jain females have the lowest work participation rates in India.\n\nMajor Jain communities:\n\n\nJainism has been praised for some of its practices and beliefs.\nMahatma Gandhi, who was greatly influenced by Jainism, said:\n\n"}

In his philosophical treatise \"Nyayamanjari\" and drama \"Agamadambara\", Jayanta mentions the king Shankaravarman (883 – 902 CE) as his contemporary. Also, his son Abhinanda in his \"Kadambari-kathasara\", mentioned that the great grandfather of Jayanta was a minister of King Lalitaditya of 8th century CE. So most probably Jayanta belonged to the last quarter of 9th Century CE.\n\nFrom Abhinanda’s \"Kadambari-kathasara\" (5-12), we came to know about the genealogy of Jayanta. His ancestor Shakti was a Brahmin of Bharadvaja gotra from Gauda, who settled at Darvabhisara, a place at the border of Kashmir. His son was Mitra and grandson was Shaktisvamin. Shaktisvamin, great grandfather of Jayanta was a minister of Karkota dynasty king of Kashmir Lalitaditya Muktapida (c. 724 – 761 CE). Jayanta in \"Nyayamanjari\" mentioned that his grandfather obtained a village named Gauramulaka (probably located north of Rajouri) from the king. The name of Jayanta’s father was Chandra.\n\nJayanta was born in a Brahmin family. He soon turned out to be a child prodigy. At a young age he composed a commentary to Panini’s Ashtadhyayi and earned the name \"Nava-Vrittikara\" (new commentator).\n\nJayanta wrote three known treatises on Nyaya philosophy, of which only two are extant, his magnum opus, the \"Nyayamanjari\" (A Cluster of Flowers of the Nyaya tree) and the \"Nyayakalika\" (A Bud of the Nyaya tree). His third work, \"Pallava\" (probably \"Nyayapallava\", A Twig of the Nyaya tree) though quoted in \"Syadvadaratnakara\" is not yet found.\n\nJayanta mentioned in his \"Nyayamanjari\", that he wrote this treatise during his confinement in a forest by the king. This treatise is unique in the sense that this is an independent work, not a commentary of an earlier work, which was the common practice of the day. Secondly according to Jayanta, purpose of Nyaya is to protect the authority of the Vedas, whereas earlier Nyaya scholars considered Nyaya as an \"Anvikshiki\" (scientific study) for providing the true knowledge about the real nature of the objects of cognition.\n\nHis major literary work is \"\", a Sanskrit play in four acts. The hero of his quasi-philosophical drama was a young graduate of the Mimansa school, who wanted to defeat all opponents of Vedas with reasoning.\n\nThe Clay Sanskrit Library has published a translation of \"\" by Csaba Dezső under the title of \"Much Ado about Religion\".\n"}

He currently teaches ethics at King's College London. Glover is a fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution in the United States.\n\nGlover was educated at Tonbridge School, later going on to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He was a fellow and tutor in philosophy at New College, Oxford.\n\nGlover's book \"Causing Death and Saving Lives\", first published in 1977, addresses practical moral questions about life and death decisions in the areas of abortion, infanticide, suicide, euthanasia, choices between people, capital punishment, and war. His approach is broadly consequentialist, though he gives significant weight to questions of individual autonomy, the Kantian notion that we ought to treat other people as ends in themselves rather than merely as means. He criticises the idea that mere consciousness or life itself are intrinsically valuable: these states matter, he argues, because they are pre-requisites for other things that are valuable and make for a life worth living. There is, then, no absolute sanctity of human life. He criticises the principle of double effect and the acts and omissions doctrine, the notion that there is a huge moral difference between killing someone and intentionally letting them die. In his discussion of real cases of moral decisions about killing he draws on insights from history and literature as well as philosophy. Throughout, the emphasis is on the consequences of moral choices for those affected, rather than on abstract principles applied impersonally. \n\nIn \"\", published in 1999, Glover considers the psychological factors that predispose us to commit barbaric acts, and suggests how man-made moral traditions and the cultivation of moral imagination can work to restrain us from a ruthlessly selfish treatment of others. Gaining greater understanding of the monsters within us, he argues, is part of the process of caging and containing them. He examines the various types of atrocity that were perpetrated in the 20th century, including Nazi genocide, communist mass killings under Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot, and more recent slaughter in Bosnia and Rwanda, and examines what sort of bulwarks there could be against them. He allows that religion has provided bulwarks, which are getting eroded. He identifies three types of bulwark. The two more dependable are sympathy and respect for human dignity. The less dependable third is Moral Identity: \"I belong to a kind of person who would not do that sort of thing\". This third is less dependable because notions of moral identity can themselves be warped, as was done by the Nazis.\n\nIn \"\", Sam Harris quotes Glover as saying: \"Our entanglements with people close to us erode simple self-interest. Husbands, wives, lovers, parents, children and friends all blur the boundaries of selfish concern. Francis Bacon rightly said that people with children have given hostages to fortune. Inescapably, other forms of friendship and love hold us hostage too...Narrow self-interest is destabilized.\"\n\nIn 1989, the European Commission hired Glover to head a panel on embryo research in Europe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5515510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5515510", "title": "Kantian ethics", "text": "Kantian ethics\n\nKantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maximthe principle behind itis duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. If a contradiction occurs the act violates Aristotle's \"Non-contradiction\" concept which states that just actions cannot lead to contradictions. Kant's formulation of humanity, the second section of the Categorical Imperative, states that as an end in itself humans are required never to treat others merely as a means to an end, but always, additionally, as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place.\n\nAlthough all of Kant's work develops his ethical theory, it is most clearly defined in \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\", \"Critique of Practical Reason\" and \"Metaphysics of Morals\". As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory on the belief that reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.\n\nIn his combined works, Kant constructed the basis for an ethical law by the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue can be used to achieve immoral ends (the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.\n\nFor Kant a good will is a broader conception than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances in order to keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.\n\nKant's conception of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts them to act against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty it is because the rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.\n\nApplying the categorical imperative, duties arise because failure to fulfil them would either result in a contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty because we are not obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.\n\nThe primary formulation of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, from which he derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey if we want to satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.\n\nKant's first formulation of the Categorical Imperative is that of universalizability:\n\nWhen someone acts, it is according to a rule, or maxim. For Kant, an act is only permissible if one is willing for the maxim that allows the action to be a universal law by which everyone acts. Maxims fail this test if they produce either a contradiction in conception or a contradiction in the will when universalized. A contradiction in conception happens when, if a maxim were to be universalized, it ceases to make sense because the \"...maxim would necessarily destroy itself as soon as it was made a universal law.\" For example, if the maxim 'It is permissible to break promises' was universalized, no one would trust any promises made, so the idea of a promise would become meaningless; the maxim would be self-contradictory because, when universalized, promises cease to be meaningful. The maxim is not moral because it is logically impossible to universalize—we could not conceive of a world where this maxim was universalized. A maxim can also be immoral if it creates a contradiction in the will when universalized. This does not mean a logical contradiction, but that universalizing the maxim leads to a state of affairs that no rational being would desire. For example, Driver argues that the maxim 'I will not give to charity' produces a contradiction in the will when universalized because a world where no one gives to charity would be undesirable for the person who acts by that maxim.\n\nKant believed that morality is the objective law of reason: just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall down because of gravity, for example), objective rational laws necessitate rational actions. He thus believed that a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary to do what is rationally necessary. Because humans are not perfectly rational (they partly act by instinct), Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the objective law of reason is \"a priori\", existing externally from rational being. Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, rational laws (morality) exist prior to rational beings. Therefore, according to Kant, rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.\n\nKant's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative is to treat humanity as an end in itself:\nKant argued that rational beings can never be treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to be used merely as a means to an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This does not mean that we can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.\n\nKant's Formula of Autonomy expresses the idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their rational will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated by the desire to fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.\n\nAnother formulation of Kant's Categorical Imperative is the Kingdom of Ends:\n\nThis formulation requires that actions be considered as if their maxim is to provide a law for a hypothetical Kingdom of Ends. Accordingly, people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would accept as laws. In such a community, each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every member of the community without treating any member merely as a means to an end. Although the Kingdom of Ends is an ideal—the actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions with good intentions sometimes result in harm—we are still required to act categorically, as legislators of this ideal kingdom.\n\nAmanda & Khethani 2018 has suggested four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The first is the Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but that it should be concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, \"The Social Contract\", influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.\n\nBiographer of Kant, Manfred Kuhn, suggested that the values Kant's parents held, of \"hard work, honesty, cleanliness, and independence”, set him an example and influenced him more than their Pietism did. In the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", Michael Rohlf suggests that Kant was influenced by his teacher, Martin Knutzen, himself influenced by the work of Christian Wolff and John Locke, and who introduced Kant to the work of English physicist Isaac Newton.\n\nGerman philosopher Jürgen Habermas has proposed a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action should be based on communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.\n\nHabermas argues that his ethical theory is an improvement on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, which can be sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.\n\nThe social contract theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed in his work \"A Theory of Justice\", was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior to the existence of a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as one of the goals of \"A Theory of Justice\".\n\nFrench psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian ethics in his works \"The Ethics of Psychoanalysis\" and \"Kant avec Sade\" and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria because it can be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.\n\nPhilosopher Onora O'Neill, who studied under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a contemporary Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach to issues of social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available to be used by humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.\n\nFrom this model of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that the rejection of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides a starting point for basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.\n\nIn his paper \"The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories\", philosopher Michael Stocker challenges Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) by arguing that actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting a number of reasons that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.\n\nGerman philosopher G. W. F. Hegel presented two main criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific information about what people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented a number of cases in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.\n\nGerman philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's belief that ethics should concern what ought to be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and interpret what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of what ought to be done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not the most important part of the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.\n\nPhilosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticised all contemporary moral systems, with a special focus on Christian and Kantian ethics. He argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics: first, they make a metaphysical claim about the nature of humanity, which must be accepted for the system to have any normative force; and second, the system benefits the interests of certain people, often over those of others. Although Nietzsche's primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable (he also objected to ethical theories that do not make such claims), his two main targets—Kantianism and Christianity—do make metaphysical claims, which therefore feature prominently in Nietzsche's criticism.\n\nNietzsche rejected fundamental components of Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, can be shown through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion on the use of moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.\n\nUtilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for not realizing that moral laws are justified by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong.\n\nVirtue ethics is a form of ethical theory which emphasizes the character of an agent, rather than specific acts; many of its proponents have criticised Kant's deontological approach to ethics. Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories, including Kantian ethics, for their obsession with law and obligation. As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid, Anscombe suggested that, because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver, they are irrelevant in modern secular society. In his work After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant's formulation of universalisability, arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test, such as \"Keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one\". He further challenges Kant's formulation of humanity as an end in itself by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means: the maxim \"Let everyone except me be treated as a means\", though seemingly immoral, can be universalized. Bernard Williams argues that, by abstracting persons from character, Kant misrepresents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy.\n\nRoman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers regarded Christian ethics as closer to the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as \"freedom for excellence\", which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with \"freedom of indifference\", which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.\n\nA number of philosophers, including Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all suggested that the Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.\n\nThis objection seems to rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon the \"concept\" of a rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no sense in which Kant makes ethics \"dependent\" upon anything which has not always existed. Furthermore, the sense in which our wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term \"autonomy\" into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God has no choice but to conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.\n\nKant believed that the shared ability of humans to reason should be the basis of morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, believed that all humans should have the right to common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.\n\nIn her work \"How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion\", Susan Feldman argues that abortion should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed that a woman should be treated as a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is to be used in the discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.\n\nKant viewed humans as being subject to the animalistic desires of self-preservation, species-preservation, and the preservation of enjoyment. He argued that humans have a duty to avoid maxims that harm or degrade themselves, including suicide, sexual degradation, and drunkenness. This led Kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it reduces humans to an object of pleasure. He admitted sex only within marriage, which he regarded as \"a merely animal union\". He believed that masturbation is worse than suicide, reducing a person's status to below that of an animal; he argued that rape should be punished with castration and that bestiality requires expulsion from society. Feminist philosopher Catharine MacKinnon has argued that many contemporary practices would be deemed immoral by Kant's standards because they dehumanize women. Sexual harassment, prostitution and pornography, she argues, objectify women and do not meet Kant's standard of human autonomy. Commercial sex has been criticised for turning both parties into objects (and thus using them as a means to an end); mutual consent is problematic because in consenting, people choose to objectify themselves. Alan Soble has noted that more liberal Kantian ethicists believe that, depending on other contextual factors, the consent of women can vindicate their participation in pornography and prostitution.\n\nBecause Kant viewed rationality as the basis for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.\n\nEthicist Tom Regan rejected Kant's assessment of the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely as a means to an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.\n\nHowever, Christine Korsgaard reinterpreted Kantian theory to establish that animal rights are implied by his moral principles.\n\nKant believed that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that we ought not to lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.\n\n"}

{"id": "1769039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1769039", "title": "Korean philosophy", "text": "Korean philosophy\n\nKorean philosophy focused on a totality of world view. Some aspects of Shamanism, Buddhism, and Neo-Confucianism were integrated into Korean philosophy. Traditional Korean thought has been influenced by a number of religious and philosophical thought-systems over the years. As the main influences on life in Korea, often Korean Shamanism, Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Silhak movements have shaped Korean life and thought.\n\nKorean Buddhist thinkers refined ideas originally introduced from China into a distinct form. The Three Kingdoms of Korea introduced Buddhism to Japan, from where it was popularized in the West. Korean Buddhism consists mostly of the Seon lineage, which is derivative of the Chen (Zen) Buddhism of China and precursor to Zen Buddhism known in the West through Japan.\n\nBuddhist temples can be found in most parts of Korea and many are considered national treasures.\n\nOne of the most substantial influences in Korean intellectual history was the introduction of Confucian thought as part of the cultural exchange from China. Today the legacy of Confucianism remains a fundamental part of Korean society, shaping the moral system, the way of life, social relations between old and young, and high culture, and even survived the modernization of the legal system.\n\nThis dynasty arose out of the military dictatorships and chaos of the preceding era. Transition in this era was from Buddhism to a soldierly approach to Neo-Confucianism. Much work was done, especially on commentaries, and the Chu Hsi school represented indeed the golden age of Korean religious philosophy. Metaphysical research at this time investigated the theological relations between principle (i) and material/vital force (ki), and between as well the four beginnings (sadan), and the seven feelings (ch'ilchong); with the division of the Joseon Confucianists into two leading schools: one on \"force\" and one on \"principles\". The philosopher Hwadam ( Suh Kyungduk, 1489–1546 ) moved to integrate i and ki and spoke of Great Harmony (taehwa).\n\nIn the Four–Seven Debate with Ki Daesung, Toegye ( Yi Hwang, 1501 – 70 ), while being still dualistic, broke away from Chu Hsi by espousing the reciprocal emanation (hobal) of i and ki: with the Four, ki follows i when i becomes emanant; with the Seven, when ki becomes emanant, i ‘rides’ ki. Though he was critical of Toegye's idea that ki follows i as being dualistic, Yulgok (Yi I, 1536 – 84 ) nevertheless embraced his notion that i ‘rides’ ki: only ki is emanant and i moves its emanation; i and ki are ‘neither two things nor one thing’, as evidenced by ‘wondrous fusion’ (myohap). For Yulgok, original nature (i) and physical nature (ki) coalesce into one human nature. Toegye and Yulgok, whose thoughts culminated in an irenic fusionism, constituted the crowning phase of East Asian neo-Confucianism by exhibiting dialectical dexterity in articulating the concepts of i and ki, left unclarified by the Chinese.\n\nToegye also developed the neo-Confucianist concept of single-mindedness (kyung), which was a manifestation of his unequivocal humanism, as shown by his total rejection of the Mandate of Heaven (chunmyung), which still had a hold on the Chinese, including Chu Hsi. Toegye's kyung synthesized the primeval Korean sense of supreme-efforts-come-earnest-devotion (chisung) with the Confucianist notion of holding fast to mind (jik-yung); he advocated self-efforts for creating a meaningful life. In particular, his concept of single-mindedness had a lasting influence on the Japanese neo-Confucianists of the Tokugawa period.\n\nEvery major Korean neo-Confucianist shared Toegye's preoccupation with single-mindedness, which signalled new stress on praxis in the development of Korean neo-Confucianism: the fusion of the metaphysical and the physical is better brought about through action than speculation, important as theory might be. That was the point of Yulgok's integration of sincerity (sung) with single-mindedness. In this respect Korean neo-Confucianism made a break with the Cheng-Chu school of Chinese neo-Confucianism, which was overly speculative.\n\nDuring the later Joseon period, Silhak, a form of Neo-Confucianism, emerged. One of the most prominent Silhak philosophers was Jeong Yakyong.\n\nThose who were sent to be educated in Japan, returned with limited knowledge of Western philosophy as a whole, although the German educational influence in Japan led to the beginning of interest in German idealists in Korea through indirect knowledge, with the exception of Marx, Hegel, and the dialecticians.\n\nThe strong influence of low church Christianity, through missionary schools, led to practical American YMCA-style philosophy entering into Korea from the 1890s onwards. The discussion of Korean Christianity and Korean Christian philosophy is complicated with many divisions, and discussed in articles elsewhere.\n\nPhilosophy in Korea was divided, by Western school, according to a kind of pragmatic mix of varied progressive libertarian beliefs in the south with highly variable changes from rigid authoritianism to softer and easier more pragmatic approaches from the 1990s onwards.\n\nIn the republican period, post-1945, Marxism–Leninism in the north was built on the Confucian yangban scholar-warriors of earlier times, if perhaps taken to absolutist extremes.\n\nThe main influence in North Korea has been since 1996, the notion of \"The Red Banner Spirit\". This system of belief encourages the North Korean people to build a \"kangsong taeguk\", a fortress state, based on self-reliance and absolute loyalty to the leader (suryong).

The first steps in her career were defined by the legal profession—a job in law enforcement from 1960 to 1962 and a job as a legal adviser in the Trade Company from 1962 to 1964. After moving to Akademgorodok in 1964, L. Matros’ career took a turn, from practicing lawyer to scientist. In Akademgorodok, she started as a post graduate student at the Department of Philosophy of the Novosibirsk State University, where she received a PhD in Philosophy in 1972. After that, during the years 1974-1991, she worked in the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Medical Sciences. where eventually she was promoted to the position of chair of the Philosophy Department of the Presidium of the Siberian Branch. \nDuring those years Matros published about one hundred scholarly works, including a book \"The Right to Health\" [\"Pravo na zdorovie\"], with co-author, well-known academician V. Kaznacheev, 1979.\n\nThe main publication of Matros that reflects a generalized analysis of her research, is the monograph \"Social Aspects of Health Problems\" (\"Sotsial’nye aspekty problemy zdorovya\"), which appeared in print in 1992 and became until now one of the basic publications and quotation book in the field of the science of sociology of medicine. \nMatros’ research and academic work were always combined with corresponding science-organizing activity\".\n\nIn 1992 Larisa Matros moved to the United States and turned to literary activity. Since the first years of this period of her life she became engaged in cultural and literary life of both the United States and Russia. \nThe main publications at this part of Matros’ creative career are two large sociological novels Presumption of Guilt (published in 2000) and It Is Called Life (published in 2007).\n\nIn the first novel Matros applies her former scientific experience and knowledge to fiction, in which \"alongside fictional characters act real people,\" well-known persons: politicians, academicians, public figures. It is a novel about the history of Soviet sociology, fate of Russian intelligentsia, humanities scientists, their input into social processes, their hopes, illusions, and disappointments in Khrushchev’s reforms and Gorbachev’s perestroika. In historical and fictional plots the author addresses the \"main theme of the novel [which is] the responsibility of [scientific] intelligentsia for society and the responsibility of society for intelligentsia.\"\n\nOne of the main subjects that made this book special is the historical and sociological analysis of the phenomenon of the world-famous science center in Siberia – Akademgorodok where the author spent 27 years.>\n\nShe was a winner of the Contest \"Russia-France\" in 2015 carried out by the Moscow city organization of the Union of Writers of Russia\n\nLarisa Matros audio book \" Everything Started From Love\" St. Petersburg, Writing by Pen. 2015\n\n\n"}

It was widely promulgated by Johann Jakob Wettstein to whom it is often attributed.\n\nMany scholars considered the employment of \"lectio difficilior potior\" an objective criterion that would even override other evaluative considerations. The poet and scholar A.E. Housman challenged such reactive applications in 1922, in the provocatively-titled article \"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\".\n\nOn the other hand, taken as an axiom, the principle \"lectio difficilior\" produces an eclectic text, rather than one based on a history of manuscript transmission. \"Modern eclectic praxis operates on a variant unit basis without any apparent consideration of the consequences\", Maurice A. Robinson warned. He suggested that to the principle \"should be added a corollary, difficult readings created by individual scribes do not tend to perpetuate in any significant degree within transmissional history\".\n\nA noted proponent of the superiority of the Byzantine text-type, the form of the Greek New Testament in the largest number of surviving manuscripts, Robinson would use the corollary to explain differences from the Majority Text as scribal errors that were not perpetuated because they were known to be errant or because they existed only in a small number of manuscripts \"at the time\".\n\nMost textual-critical scholars would explain the corollary by the assumption that scribes tended to \"correct\" harder readings and so cut off the stream of transmission. Thus, only earlier manuscripts would have the harder readings. Later manuscripts would not see the corollary principle as being a very important one to get closer to the original form of the text.\n\nHowever, \"lectio difficilior\" is not to be taken as an absolute rule either but as a general guideline. \"\"In general\" the more difficult reading is to be preferred\" is Bruce Metzger's reservation. \"There is truth in the maxim: \"lectio difficilior lectio potior\" ('the more difficult reading is the more probable reading')\", write Kurt and Barbara Aland.\n\nHowever, for scholars like Kurt Aland who follow a path of reasoned eclecticism that is based on evidence both internal and external to the manuscripts, \"this principle must not be taken too mechanically, with the most difficult reading (\"lectio difficillima\") adopted as original simply because of its degree of difficulty\". Also, Martin Litchfield West cautions, \"When we choose the 'more difficult reading'... we must be sure that it is in itself a plausible reading. The principle should not be used in support of dubious syntax, or phrasing that it would not have been natural for the author to use. There is an important difference between a more \"difficult\" reading and a more \"unlikely\" reading\".\n\n\n"}

Vasiliev\n\nNicolai Alexandrovich Vasiliev (), also Vasil'ev, Vassilieff, Wassilieff ( – December 31, 1940), was a Russian logician, philosopher, psychologist, poet. He was a forerunner of paraconsistent and multi-valued logics.\n\nVasiliev was born on June 29 O.S., 1880 in Kazan, Russia. His father, Professor Alexander V. Vasiliev, was a fairly well known mathematician, his grandfather was the outstanding sinologist Professor Vassily P. Vasiliev, and his great grandfather was the prominent astronomer Ivan M. Simonov, who was a close colleague of Nikolai Lobachevsky.\n\nWanting to be a psychologist, Vasiliev studied at the medical faculty and the historico-philological faculty of Kazan University (1906), where he was offered the position of privat-dozent in 1910.\n\nAs a university student, Vasiliev was enthusiastic about symbolist style poetry and published some books of verses of his own (for example,\"The longing for eternity\") and translations of the poetry of Emile Verhaeren and Algernon Charles Swinburne.\n\nAlthough Vasiliev outlined an abstract to the article on the \"logic of relatives\" by Charles Sanders Peirce as early as in 1897, it was only in 1908 that he entirely devoted himself to logic.\n\nOn May 18, 1910 Vasiliev presented a lecture (published in October that same year) \"On Partial Judgements, on the Triangle of Opposites, on the Law of Excluded Third\" in which he put forward for the first time ever the idea of (non-Aristotelian) logic, free of the laws of excluded middle and contradiction. Reasoning by analogy with the \"imaginary\" geometry of Lobachevsky, Vasiliev called his novel logic \"imaginary\", for he assumed it was valid for the worlds where the above-mentioned laws did not hold, worlds with beings having other types of sensations. He distinguished levels of logical reasoning, and introduced the notion of metalogic.\n\nVasiliev spent 1912-13 in Western Europe (mostly Germany) and published his salient works \"Logic and Metalogic\" and \"Imaginary (non-Aristotelian) logic\". Vasiliev constructed non-Aristotelian logic using the concepts, and even the manner of reasoning, common\nto Aristotelian logic. He was aware of the achievement in mathematical logic (and even carefully studied Ernst Schröder's works) but did not make an attempt to formalise \"imaginary\" logic.\n\nHis only work in a foreign language (English) - a concise abstract of his \"imaginary logic\" - was published in Naples in 1924.\n\nIn 1914, when World War I broke out, Vasiliev was drafted into the army, where he became seriously mentally ill. Nevertheless, he returned to teaching at Kazan University, but in 1922 was forcibly retired by the new Bolshevik administration. This act aggravated his ailment: Vasiliev spent most of the following 20 years in a mental hospital, thus rescued from the Stalin regime. He died on December 31, 1940. The place where he was buried is unknown.\n\nThe pioneer ideas of Vasiliev were rediscovered in the early 1960s by Vladimir Smirnov, and formed a basis mainly for paraconsistent logic. Some well-known scholars in the 1960s considered his work to be the precursor of multi-valued logic. The informal style and conceptual riches of Vasiliev's works make them especially valuable. In 2012 an international conference on Vasiliev's work was held in Moscow where a number of important modern paraconsistent logicians contributed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18634162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18634162", "title": "Ola Raknes", "text": "Ola Raknes\n\nOla Raknes (17 January 1887 – 28 January 1975) was a Norwegian psychologist, philologist and non-fiction writer. Born in Bergen, Norway, he was internationally known as a psychoanalyst in the Reichian tradition. He has been described as someone who spent his entire life working with the conveying of ideas through many languages and between different epistemological systems of reference, science and religion (Dannevig, 1975). For large portions of his life he was actively contributing to the public discourse in Norway. He has also been credited for his contributions to strengthening and enriching the Nynorsk language and its use in the public sphere.\n\nRaknes was known as a thorough philologist and a controversial therapist. Internationally he was known as one of Wilhelm Reich's closest students and defenders.\n\nOla Raknes was the son of the farmer Erik Askildson (Askjellson) Raknes (1856 – 1926) and Magdali Olsdotter (born Raknes) (1859 – 96) and grew up at the family farm of Raknes in Hamre on the island Osterøy in the Osterfjorden fjord near Bergen in a strict pietist environment. There were altogether 10 children of whom 7 grew up to become adults, and five of his siblings emigrated to the United States. He was married twice: in his first marriage in 1911 with Aslaug Vaa (1889 – 1965, the marriage was dissolved in 1938) they begot the children Magli (1912 – 1993), Anne (1914 – 2001), Tora (1916 – 1995), Erik (1919-) and Tor (1923-). The second marriage in 1941 with Gjertrud Bonde (1913 – 1975) gave him the daughter Ada (born 1952).\n\nOla Raknes attended folkeskole (primary school) on the neighbouring farm and then worked for a while on the family's farm prior to enrolling at middelskole (the next higher level in the education system of that time) in Volda. After that he graduated from the Hambros skole in Bergen in 1904. He took his examen artium as private candidate at Kristiania katedralskole in 1907. During the winter of 1907–08 he joined the elephant seal-catching vessel Solglimt to the Crozet islands in the southern Indian Ocean to collect plants and animals for the university in Kristiania. A liverwort, \"Jamesoniella raknesii\" was named after him. During the summers between 1910 and 1916 he served his military draft duty.\n\nOla Raknes took on miscellaneous teaching positions in the years between 1910 and 1914 and worked as a journalist from 1914 to 1916 in the newspaper Den 17de Mai (\"the 17th of May\") while at the same time continuing his studies. In addition he worked during this period as a hotel worker. In 1915 he took his cand. philol. linguistical-historical \"embedseksamen\" (a public exam required for most professional positions in the public sphere) with Norwegian language as major subject and English and French as minor subjects. His major thesis was about Egill Skallagrímsson. In 1916 he was headmaster at Larvik higher school for one year. In 1917 he got a position as lector in Norwegian language and Norwegian literature at Sorbonne in Paris, and he spent the four years here earnestly by studying general psychology, psychology of religion, biology, sosiology, and furthermore medieval literature, medieval philosophy and theology on the side of his teaching position. He continued these studies when, after Sorbonne, he began as lector in Norwegian at University College in London where he stayed from 1921 to 1922.\n\nOla Raknes' working capacity was widely spoken of, and during a period he worked both as secretary for Det Norske Samlaget, while at the same time working on the dictionary and preparing his doctoral thesis in psychology of religion, \"Møtet med det heilage\" (\"Encounter with the Holy\"), which was published in 1927. The dissertation which was also published as a book (and republished again in the 1970s), investigates the phenomenon of religious ecstasy in view of what was then recent findings and theories in the fields of ethnology, but particularly in psychology and psychoanalysis. In 1924 he went on to finish studies in pedagogy. Apart from this he also worked as a literary translator. Raknes studied psychoanalysis at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute from 1928 to 1929 and later at the Orgone Institute in New York City in 1946. From 1929 on he had a private practice as psychoanalyst. He published some popularized essays on psychology which he collected in the book \"Fri vokster\" which was published in 1949. This was the first book which introduced Wilhelm Reich's theories and therapeutical practice to a Norwegian audience (Dannevig, 1975).\n\nIn May 1908 Ola Raknes, then still a student, became manager and \"handyman\" for Norskt Maalkontor (literally \"Norwegian language office\"), an office dedicated to promoting the still young Nynorsk language. In this job which he had until 1910 he dealt with book sales and administrative chores for Det Norske Samlaget. He provided the momentum behind book publications as well as sales, and he brought the accounting into order, since it hadn't been attended to for the last three years. Being the first secretary of the Samlaget he made a significant contribution to the establishing of its first real administration in a time period when publishing in Nynorsk was starting to become self-sufficient (Skard, 1975). Ola Raknes joined the Studentmållaget i Oslo (A pro-Nynorsk organization among students in Oslo) which was founded in 1900, and he attained a central position, among other things he was elected chairman in 1913 but had to renounce the position. In later times he would serve as an often used speaker both in the 20s and 30s. Already as a student Ola Raknes published \"French-Norwegian Wordlist\". Having returned from London he began working on \"English-Norwegian Dictionary\", which was produced between 1922 and 1927. This as well as \"French-Norwegian Dictionary\", which was written between 1939 and 1942, were both written for the \"school book committee\" within the Samlaget, where Raknes was a board member between 1915 and 1917.\n\nOla Raknes loved poetry, and together with I. C. Grøndahl he published the first Norwegian literature history volume in English in 1923. He was an appreciated literary translator, both of scholarly as well as artistic prose. He was the philological supervisor of Henrik Rytter's ten-volume translation of Shakespeare. Sigmund Skard writes of the two dictionaries which Ola Raknes wrote (Skard, 1975), that far from being mere glossaries, they were very personal works which again reflected the quest of Ola Raknes for his identity. Skard compares this work with that of Ivar Aasen more than 50 years earlier. Aasen had made his way through the entire tributary of Norwegian folk speech and compared it with another Nordic language: Danish. Skard writes that Raknes, \"with strong power of empathy, integrated the values of two of the largest and oldest European cultural languages, procured everything that they possessed, from past to present, and confronted that with his own linguistic heritage and his personal linguistic sense. To check himself he drew in the living present-day speech in one of the richest East Norwegian rural dialects, in collaboration with his first wife, the poet Aslaug Vaa, as well as her father, the farmer Tor Vaa. Long into the future will these books be the daily benefit to everyone who works with the Norwegian language.\"\n\nBoth the school book committee and to some extent the popular writings committee of which he was also a member from 1911, acted as schools in publishing where the students had to deal with all aspects of book publishing: market evaluations, editorial reviews, recruitment of authors, practical editorial chores, deals with publishing houses or printers, distribution, marketing and economy. Ola Raknes' dictionaries were reputedly so meticulous that even the most abject taboo words were included, and they became important tools in the cultural struggle of the Nynorsk movement. From 1922 to 1930 he again worked for the Samlaget, this time as secretary to the board, however, in reality he was director of the publishing house. Raknes also translated several works of fiction as well as non-fiction into Nynorsk. He did a groundbreaking job in establishing a philological and psychological terminology for the language.(Dannevig, 1975) Raknes was deeply involved in the Nynorsk movement, which included the Høgnorsk movement, and he was a founding member of Norsk Måldyrkingslag (\"Norwegian society for language cultivation\") in 1928.\n\nAlready at a very early age Ola Raknes was intensely occupied with religion. It was particularly the thought and the fear of Hell which these ruminations centered on. Sometime between the age of seven and eleven he began to wonder about what the saved people told, that by repenting they had begot, or been allowed to take part in, a new and better life, a life which the non-repented didn't know of and could not comprehend. He had a vague sense of them being right in some way, but at the same time he felt that they also were wrong. He had an opaque reminiscence of once having experienced this life, in his own words from the time he was about 3 or 4 years old, \"when he was a church-builder\". Later he considered this to have been a child's way of expressing that he had known another life before. From about the age of ten and several years onward he attempted to come in contact with this other life. He went to edifying meetings in the village, and he often attended church, although he, just like the saved people, figured that that in particular was less important because it was a lesser likelihood that a conversion would start there. It was a constant fear of ending in Hell which spurred him, because he was certain that was where he would go if he failed in finding his way to the new life.\n\nDespite all his toils he never succeeded in attaining religious conversion. He felt that it would be dishonest of him if he stood up and testified the way some of his friends had done, that he had been graced, and he was also very ambivalent about believing whether all those who did so were totally honest. In hindsight Raknes found that partly what held him back was a fear of relinquishing.\n\nDuring Christmas break, shortly before he turned 17, he stumbled across a booklet about determinism. With the exception of some popularized scientific articles by G. H. Armauer Hansen, this was the first literary encounter he had which made him doubt the religious teachings which he had received until then. Even though he would later forget most of the content of the booklet, it made him consider the belief in eternal Hell without sense, and it also provided him with courage to trust his own thoughts and feelings a lot more than he had previously dared. When a little later he told his best friend, county school director Per Erdal, about his newly gained perspective on Hell, he was joyed to hear that his friend shared his view. The keen interest in religion would now lose its grip on Raknes for a number of years, and the interest in a life after death disappeared, never to return.\n\nIn the years both before and after he, as a twenty-year-old, got his examen artium, it was common practice among his comrades to make jokes about and with both religion, philosophy and psychology, which was deemed more or less as superstition or play with empty words. Raknes felt that such subjects were unfit for someone who had set out to do something useful with his life, which he had. When he began to study philology after secondary school, he was hoping that the goals and literature which he would study were going to show him a field where he felt that he had a particular calling. However, as absorbing as many subjects seemed at first, none offered to him the labor which would consume him fully. And he felt likewise when it came to the women: He met many whom he liked and also many which, in retrospect, he believed also were fond of him, but during this time it felt like no woman could ever love him – even though that was what he longed for more than anything else.\n\nHe was twenty-four and a half years old when he experienced his first big love affair since childhood, an event which he experienced as both a revelation and a revolution. Up until this time he had felt as if life only moved ahead in front of him, he being merely a passive spectator. From now on he felt that he lived and that he was himself a part of life, even though he still hadn't found his particular slot work-wise. Ola Raknes and Aslaug Vaa met in the Studentmållaget i Oslo. They also were colleagues as journalists for the newspaper \"Den 17de Mai\" (\"May the 17th\" a now defunct Nynorsk newspaper, at that time one of the nation's most subscribed to. The name is a reference to the date of the Norwegian Constitution Day). It was the interest for intellectual activities which brought them together, believed Aslaug's sister-in-law Thora Vaa (married to Aslaug's brother Dyre Vaa)(Fyllingsnes, page 11). The next years would be focused on more hands-on work: the philology studies, money that had to be earned, as well as an unceasingly growing family. The first daughter, Magli, was born in Oslo the year after Ola and Aslaug married. The family was constantly moving about the first years, and the second daughter, Anne, was born at the Vaa family farm in Kviteseid in Vest-Telemark. In between they had been living in Paris where Ola and also Aslaug were enrolled as students, and they also moved back to Paris in 1919. They lived in Rue Bonnard in a milieu of Norwegian artists, Henrik Sørensen and Dagfin Werenskiold being their closest neighbours, but hanging out with the artists was more to the liking of Aslaug. When Aslaug caught typhus and had to return home to Norway after two years in Paris, the two youngest of the then four children went with her while the two oldest, Magli and Anne remained in Paris together with Ola. After the stay in Paris the family lived for about a year in Kviteseid again. Then it moved to an apartment block in Johan Bruns gate at Adamstuen in Oslo which Ola Raknes had bought. There they lived for four years. Following that they moved to Lysaker (just outside Oslo's western city limits) where they remained until 1932-33. By then Ola had begun making enough money so that they once more could move back to Oslo (Fyllingsnes, p. 6).\n\nAs the 1930s went on, the marriage began to fall apart. Ola Raknes became more absorbed by psychoanalysis while Aslaug Vaa found her path in writing poetry. Her debut occurred as late as 1934. Their marriage ended on a bitter note in 1938, following years of separate living.\n\nAbout the time he turned thirty he got involved in a newspaper debate with the school man Jakob Naadland and bishop Peter Hognestad concerning reward for good deeds. The other two believed that man requires a promise of reward to be able to stay on the straight path. Ola Raknes, however, asserted, \"that it is natural for man to love and be good, those are fundamental characteristics of man and needs no other 'payment' than to have the opportunity to function freely\" (Raknes, 1959). Subsequent to this debate he started reading different books, mostly at random, about foreign religions, primitive as well as culture religions.\n\nIn the same year, 1917, Raknes commenced his four years as lector of Norwegian language and literature at Sorbonne in Paris, and he had planned his stay such that he would get the opportunity to study of his own heart a portion of the time. The first thing he wanted to study was the relationship between French and Norwegian literature in the Middle Ages. He started to read Joseph Bédier's great work about \"Les Légendes Épiques\", a work which stunned him and convinced him that if he was ever going to understand the effects of Medieval French literature and its influences, he would also have to know something about Medieval philosophy and theology. Consequently, he contacted the university's professor of these subjects, François Picavet, studied several of his books, attended his lectures, and had several talks with him. Picavet possessed the enviable quality of making compendia when he had worked on a subject, where he summed up the development up through the present time. In this fashion Raknes started to read William James' book \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\", the one book that would make the strongest impression on him above all others, and which later he would translate to Nynorsk. This was the first time that he had experienced that religion was dealt with as a natural phenomenon, and which in any case attempted to free itself from how the religions perceive themselves. He spent many weeks working his way through this book, and he walked about completely absorbed with new thoughts and feelings. Looking back, he writes that most of his friends looked upon him as if he were a loony, although a couple of artists appeared to envy him. On his last birthday, shortly before he died, Raknes described William James as the person who had had the greatest significance in his life (Dannevig). The revelation brought on him by this book was what he had been waiting for and which would show him a field of work to which he could apply himself wholly, one which in any case had importance to him, and maybe also to a lot of others.\n\nRaknes now experienced that he could understand the religions from the \"inside\", even though he himself didn't believe in any dogmatic religion. This would have to be his task, he felt; to point out what really was true and valuable in religions and at the same time how there had entered into each single religion so much that was not true, but quite the contrary, inimical to life. His yearning to obtain further information grew strong. He needed concrete knowledge, both about the various religions, about philosophies of religion, about ethnology which provides backdrop and fertile ground for the different religions, and about life in all its appearances. He started to read as much as he could in all of these fields, partly at random, and at the university he attended lectures, classes, and seminars in general psychology and psychology of religion. psychopathology and psychiatry, and in biology. Raknes read the basics of the French school of sociology, works by among others Durkheim, Mauss, and Lévy-Bruhl, and he read numerous books about mysticism. His favourite was \"Les grands mystiques\" by Henri Delacroix, who was his teacher. He also read the main works of the then fledgling psychology of religion which had its origin predominantly in America, and of ethnology he read among other things a series of books by Roman Catholic missionaries\n\nRaknes continued these studies when, after Sorbonne, he started in a position as Norwegian lector at University College in London where he stayed between 1921 and 1922.\n\nWhat Raknes intended in this manner was for him to be able to explain and demonstrate his strong conviction, which he knew he was yet unable to prove. \"I wanted to be able to explain and demonstrate my own conviction, which already from the outset I perceived to be true, even though I was aware that I wasn't able to prove it. The conviction was that the source of all true religion is an inner experiencing of life and growth and contact with something outside of one's own narrow self. In its narrowest form, you can have this experience localized in a wound healing, in its widest form, it is a sensation of communion with the entire universe. At first I meant to call this experience 'growth consciousness'.\" (Raknes, 1959)\n\nAfter three years abroad, Raknes's finances were at a low point, and all time had to be directed toward financially profitable work. He taught languages and literature in high schools and wrote his English-Norwegian dictionary. It was not until 1927, after he had turned 40, that he was able to complete the book he had begun contemplating when he was in Paris, and begun working on in London. The book was \"Møtet med det heilage\" (\"Encounter with the Holy\"), and the next year he received his doctorate based upon it.\n\nIn the later years of his life Raknes explained: \"I count myself a religious man, but I am an opponent of all dogmatic religion. The core of all religion is a certain experience both of oneself as a unit and of the unity between oneself and the universe.\" (Raknes, 1959)\n\nFrom his work with the psychology of religion, Raknes had come to the conclusion that he needed some method for investigating the subconscious if he was to go further in understanding human behaviour. That time, at the end of the 1920s, no such method existed except for psychoanalysis. In 1928, for that reason, Ola Raknes finished up his school work and moved to Berlin and began studying at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute with a grant from the Nansen fund. From this point he was lost to philology with the exception of finishing his French-Norwegian dictionary, which had contributed to make it possible for him to go to Berlin. While he attended apprentice analysis in Berlin with Karen Horney (who was later known as a \"neo-Freudian\"), he got convinced that psychoanalytic therapy was a vocation well suited to his abilities and interests. After having delivered a lecture to the Berlin chapter on \"Viewpoints on psychoanalytical psychology of religion\" in 1929, he was selected as member of the International Psychoanalytical Association. In the lecture Ola Raknes clearly stated his opposition to Freud's theories on religion. Raknes experienced progression in his new field of activity, and despite strong opposition from large parts of the medical profession, he was in the process of making a name for himself.\n\nOla Raknes was always searching for improvements of the therapeutic technique, and he was also dissatisfied with the traditional psychoanalytical explanatory models for man's basic drives, instincts, and aggression, and he was skeptical of the psychological dualism of Freud's theories of these contradictory basic drives, which at first moved between the instinct for self preservation and sexuality, and later between the life instinct (Eros) and the death instinct (Thanatos). It was during his stay in Berlin that Ola Raknes heard Wilhelm Reich's name for the first time, but there would still be some years before he read anything by Reich. He was still busy studying Freud and other \"orthodox\" psychoanalysts. It was after Reich had published his book \"Charakteranalyse\" in 1933 that Ola Raknes in earnest began moving toward Reich's teachings. Following that book Raknes absorbed himself in \"Die Funktion des Orgasmus\", then in Reich's articles in various psychoanalytical journals, and finally in Reich's own \"Zeitschrift für politische Psychologie und Sexualökonomie\". Ola Raknes found it all to be most interesting and rich in perspective, however, this did not cause him to change either his basic attitudes or his psychotherapeutical technique.\n\nOla Raknes met Wilhelm Reich for the first time at the Scandinavian psychoanalysts meeting in Oslo in the Easter of 1934. Raknes was very much impressed by this strong personality, and the succinctness of his presentations and with which he presented himself during discussions about core elements of the themes that he discussed, helped Raknes attain a clearer understanding of many things. Wilhelm Reich's starting point was the psychoanalytical theories of Freud, but as early as 1925, based on experiences gained through volunteer work at his counselling clinic in Vienna for people with sexual problems, he began developing his theory of sex economy, a work which would continue until 1938. Raknes' first choice would be to commence apprentice therapy with Reich immediately, however, he had no way of travelling to Sweden where Reich was working at that time. In any case, they met again in August that same year on the 13th psychoanalytical congress in Luzern. There Ola Raknes, together with the two other Norwegian participants, professor of psychology Harald Schjelderup and child psychiatrist Nic. Hoel (who would later change her name to Nic. Waal), vehemently protested the blackballing of Reich from the International Psychoanalytical Association (I.P.V.). The Norwegian contingent was later at the congress approved as a distinct group, and this meant they could admit Reich in their membership. Wilhelm Reich did not, however, accept the offer of becoming a member when he moved to Norway later in 1934. At that time Raknes had already started in apprentice therapy with Otto Fenichel, whom he counted as one of Reich's friends and co-workers. He had from the outset told Fenichel that he would have gone to Reich if Reich had been in Norway.\n\nShortly after Reich had arrived in Norway, he opened a seminar in character analysis. Raknes was admitted to this despite not having undergone any such analysis himself. He tried out the techniques that he learned on a couple of his patients, with fairly good results. In the fall of 1936 he asked if Wilhelm Reich would accept him for apprentice therapy, both because of personal problems and because he thought that Reich's therapeutic approach was far more efficient than the classical Freudian technique which he had applied so far. Reich was in doubt and felt that Ola Raknes was a bit old and too armored, but in the end he accepted. Ola Raknes was probably one of the first patients to whom Reich consistently applied his new technique, which he labeled characteranalytic vegetotherapy. Not surprisingly, due to Raknes' advanced age, the restructuring of his character, that is the apprentice therapy, was cumbersome and lasted for almost three years, three sessions a week. The response did not fail to appear. At times everything felt so destitute and hopeless that he doubted whether he would ever be able to do the work that he still believed he was created to do, in a way he himself would be content with – and if he couldn't manage that, there would be no reason to live even. But after a long period of time he finally began noticing that the energies started to make themselves felt; he started noticing what took place inside of his own organism, and what it would mean to be functioning freely. He was struck by the fundamental differences between characteranalytic vegetotherapy and traditional psychoanalysis. Even though he had read Reich's book on character analysis, and he had also applied the technique on his own patients, having the technique work on his own body was something altogether new. Compared to classical psychoanalysis, the technique was now extended to the interpretation of character expressions and bodily attitudes, and to working through somatical blockings through direct manipulation. (Raknes, 1959)\n\nIn his practice Raknes emphasized assisting people in working through to the living in themselves and work to release the innate propensity for development, the \"free growth\". The way of doing this was by removing the obstacles and blockages standing in the way, and this in turn would be effected when the person learned to acknowledge him- or herself, together with their thoughts, feelings and impulses. The most important part of this was to integrate body perception – to feel what one wanted, to yield to the urge if nothing of significance gainsayed it. In the article \"Life and Religion\" Raknes pointed to Wilhelm Reich's definition of life as a continuous process consisting of rhythmical shifts between mechanical tension, bioenergetic charge, bioenergetic discharge, and mechanical relaxation. In it he wrote, \"Most people are going to need a certain amount of practice in noticing their own bodily states before they can experience this life rhythm. But then they are clearly going to experience it, in particular in two guises: in the rhythmical flow that penetrates the entire body when it is able to freely go along with the breathing, and particularly intense in the state popularly called 'living together', that is in the sexual orgasm\".\n\nEven though Raknes conceded that the orgone theory of Wilhelm Reich – an expanding of Freud's libido concept to encompass a general life energy, which Reich called orgone – wasn't exhaustively proven with reference to the natural sciences' demands for proof, he felt that from his own observations and experiences it must have some merit. In the book \"Wilhelm Reich and orgonomy\" (written in English, but translated into many different languages), which he wrote a few years prior to his death, he explains in an educational and easy-to-comprehend manner the theory and its implications for various scientific disciplines, and in relation to society. How Reich was apparently able to make use of this energy in producing rain, using a so-called cloudbuster, a technical apparatus which is said to focus and project orgone energy, Raknes was himself a witness during a visit to Reich's estate \"Orgonon\" in Maine in 1953:\n\nSix times after the war Raknes traveled to the US to visit Reich, and to keep his skills and knowledge up-to-date with respect to the development of Reich's theories and methods. Then, upon his return to Norway, he would replicate as much as he could of the observations and experiments that he had witnessed in Reich's laboratory, experiments which constituted the foundation for the discovery of the bions and the orgone energy in the body.\n\nRaknes was of the opinion that what Reich had discovered was what others before him had described, but then using other names, such as animal magnetism, chi, and prana. Raknes also believed that such phenomena as telepathy and clairvoyance were real, and felt that the only thing that would cause scientists to deny their existence was narrow-mindedness and dogmatism (Gabrielsen, 1962). He believed that continued investigation and research into the orgone energy would possibly shed light on these phenomena.\n\nFactors drawing Raknes toward the orgone theory were his lifelong curiosity and interest for the origin of religions, the religious experience and how it shapes man, and he felt it could contribute in shedding light upon these areas on a scientific basis. Furthermore, he felt that it constituted an expansion of therapeutic treatment, from being a limited psychotherapy to deserving to be called a \"biotherapy\".\n\nOla Raknes had his treatment room in the basement of his home at Nordberg in Oslo, and there he also had his own \"orgone closet\" where his patients sat in order to be supplied life energy, a so-called orgone accumulator. He was sought after in many locations around the world, and as late as in his last year of living, albeit tired and marked by illness (Skard, 1975), he traveled to Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, England, and the United States, to visit friends, give lectures and receive patients in orgone therapy. He treated a total of 800 patients, and on his last working day he received five patients.\n\nOla Raknes' work as a psychotherpist is being continued by several psychologists in Norway and also branched to other countries, in particular through Gerda Boyesen and David Boadella, both students of Raknes, who later established institutions for education of therapists in London and Switzerland, respectively.\n\nIn 1972, at the age of 85, he initiated the founding of the \"Forum for karakteranalytisk vegetoterapi\" (this was also the name of a journal which was established in 1992) to assist in recruiting new vegetotherapists (being then at a low point).\n\nHis support for Wilhelm Reich when he was barred from the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1934 has already been mentioned. During Reich's residency in Norway between 1934 – 39 there were vituperative debates over his theories and practice, and Ola Raknes was one of his strongest apologists. During the so-called Reich strife in the fall of 1937 and throughout 1938 the criticism that was leveled at Reich's theories and methods, in particular from traditional psychiatry, was unusually harsh. The attacks, some of which deteriorated to mudslinging and slander, were often strongly emotional, and Ola Raknes was among those of Reich's proponents who countered the criticism, which was most forcibly promulgated by the psychiatrist Johan Scharffenberg who insinuated that Reich merely pretended to be a physician, that he performed illegal medical treatment, and that Reich had wanted to perform electrical measurements on insane patients having sexual intercourse (Stai, 1954), and later by physician Gabriel Langfeldt (Raknes, 1939). Both in conjunction with the strife surrounding Reich in Norwegian public discourse, and later, during the resistance which Ola Raknes was met with in his work being an exponent for a controversial branch of psychotherapy, what Raknes \"would represent, was founded on one ground only; his own experience and his scientific conscience. He was not someone merely parroting his great teacher. Nor was he an errand-boy; as a therapist he was in time going to speak out with professional authority. And the only thing that drove him, was what he believed to be the truth. In this respect he showed no deference, and cared not how others might judge him.\" (Skard, 1975)\n\nRaknes organized study circles and was also involved in Reich's journal projects \"Zeitschrift für Politische Psychologie und Sexualökonomie\" (published 1934 – 1938) and \"Tidsskrift for seksualøkonomi\" (Norw. \"Journal for sex economy\", one issue only published in 1939) which he was editing together with Odd Havrevold.\n\nAfter Wilhelm Reich had left Norway for the United States in 1939, few people associated with the community of Norwegian psychoanalysts where longer willing to defend his teachings. Even the American Reich supporters were according to Raknes \"disappointingly orthodox\" (Dannevig, 1975). The only people left to carry on Reich's work appeared to be Ola Raknes and Nic. Waal, and following the death of Waal in 1960, Raknes was sometimes condescendingly referred to as \"Reich's last disciple\". Nevertheless, several psychiatrists had confidence in him, and his matter-of-fact style and all-over good reputation as a therapist saw to it that the demand from would-be patients never relented, in particular from abroad. And for the last 10 – 15 years of his life Ola Raknes was met with unanimous professional acceptance and veneration. (Skard, 1975; Kile, 1989). One among many, actor Sean Connery came to Oslo in 1967 to receive treatments by Ola Raknes (Haga, 2002), something which, for the first and only time, made the popular media give attention to his work, as they created a commotion outside his practice (Kile, 1989).\n\nThe collaboration and friendship between Ola Raknes and Wilhelm Reich would last through to Reich's death in an American prison cell in 1957. Most people have assumed that the influence between the two for the most part has gone from Wilhem Reich to Raknes, but this may not be the full picture. In the preface to the book \"Det levande i muskelpanseret\" (\"The Living inside the Muscular Armor\") which was published the same year Raknes died, another Reich therapist, Einar Dannevig, writes, \"With his modest appearance and infinite loyalty toward his friend, Raknes contributed to a distorted image of himself. He is easily perceived as a loyal and grateful student of the great master even where he expressed opinions of his own which were hard fought for and well tested, Not until after he had turned 80, he wrote in the preface of his book \"Wilhelm Reich and Orgonomy\": 'Some developments of Reich's ideas are due to myself and I am unable to tell, in some cases, which ideas were first mentioned by me, and which ones by Reich'. The fact that this is mentioned this late in a small preface of the best and probably most integrated presentation of Reich's life work having been written, has made many people overlook the fact that Raknes to a higher degree than any other has been co-creating in the development of those ideas which today form the foundation for the advanced development in different disciplines that one sees as the aftergrowth after Wilhelm Reich. With his firm integrity and independence, coupled with realizations which Raknes had arrived at through his studies in psychology of religion, philosophy, and psychoanalysis \"before\" meeting Reich, Raknes becomes a true friend and associate to Wilhelm Reich. With his lacking need for prestige, he was able to satisfy Reich's unusually strong demands for outward loyalty, while at the same time acting tactfully as a correcting agent when Reich in his later years could become the victim of his usually creative, but sometimes too lively and lonely imagination. With his more thorough philosophical background and acquaintance with philosophy of science, as well as his manifested ability to systematize, Raknes has meant very much to the development of the psychotherapeutic, biological, and natural philosophical theories that are usually ascribed to Wilhelm Reich alone.\" (Dannevig, 1975)\n\nAs he took part in the shaping of society, both the Norwegian and in general, he was focusing on the forces that frustrate and impede free life expression, in the areas love and work both. He was deeply influenced in this by Reich's sex economical sociology and mass psychology. He was a member of Norwegian Democratic Group and he joined the circle of people centering on \"Orientering\" in 1953. He was a member of the Socialist People's Party also from that year, and that party's successor, the Socialist Left Party. His opinion was that the making conscious of the individual's bodily-psychological awareness, to which he could contribute through his work, had to progress hand-in-hand with societal changes – in the working place, in family life and in neighborhoods. He felt that the way society was organized created dependent individuals. Those family types and norms for child rearing which were prevalent created overwhelming sensations of angst, helplessness and feelings of littleness in the small child when its vital urges and needs – sexual or related to contact with other people, or other still – were thrashed, rejected or ignored. This in turn, Raknes felt, led, in the adult individual, to a necessity, in order for it to survive, for adaptation through one of two life strategies – either a constant, compulsive striving for power and competitive mentality, or equally compulsive attempts to ingratiate with those in power, through self-effacing submission and dutifullness. Ola Raknes thus placed the focus on the connection between current character traits in Norwegian society, such as feelings of either superiority or inferiority, competitiveness and self-effacing dutifullness, and characteristic structural traits in society itself such as concentration of power and bureaucratic control, in which the former provides fertile ground for the latter. (Grønseth, 2004)\n\nOut of all that he wrote, it was the article from 1953 whose title in English was \"The Orgonomic Concept of Health and its Social Consequences\" that Raknes himself valued most highly. It presents a comprehensive psychological and biological perspective of the term \"health\" and has garnered praise from many directions and has also been translated into many languages. Many people have nevertheless asserted \"Liv og religion\" (\"Life and Religion\") to be Raknes' best article, originally a lecture given to the 4th Nordic Psychologist Meeting in 1956 and which deals with the living, the very feeling of being alive. It has been described as \"a wise man's integrated understanding of what he has encountered in life, but also an encompassing, non-confessional \"faith\".\" (Dannevig, 1975) Characteristic of his seemingly rock solid grasp of language as a tool for the conveying of thoughts, Raknes, being a lifelong proponent of the radical Nynorsk language, presented his speech in an \"impeccable, pure in style and somewhat conservative Riksmål (a very conservative variant of the Bokmål language) in consideration of the Danes.\" (Dannevig, 1975)\n\nOla Raknes was a strong proponent of providing freedom to the child so that it could make its own experiences instead of being told by adults how to perceive things: \"Children always pick their own ideals. As soon as we put up ideals for them, they will start cheating on themselves. They are the ones who should make the choice.\" (Gabrielsen, 1962) In one of the essays in the book \"Fri Vokster\" (\"Free growth\") Raknes elaborates on how he as a psychologist sees the child's developmental dynamics being critically dependent on being given the opportunity to learn for itself to regulate such matters as going to the bathroom, what and when to eat and when and how much it wants to sleep, through experiencing and through practicing to master, without the adults spurring the child on.\n\nSuch moral rules as not to inflict harm on others or to abstain from stealing, Raknes believed children had to find out about on their own, not through admonitions or prohibitions from the parents: \"I believe that when a child lies, it is because it has been punished for telling the truth. And when it steals, it is because it feels neglected in one way or another. [...children] steal the love that isn't given to them.\" With respect to war Raknes meant for instance that it would be fine if the parents explained why people make wars against each other and to what this can lead, but they ought to leave it to the child to figure out what to make of it all. (Gabrielsen, 1962)\n\nAlthough Raknes mostly treated adult patients (Dannevig, 1975), it was the child that Ola Raknes focused on so strongly in his educational efforts to promote values and also as a therapist. The child is the center of focus in the article \"Life and Religion\", in the book \"Fri Vokster\", in his therapy and in himself the way he was – \"the child in the adult\" and the child in itself, in center and teeming with life, the child which is devoid of sentimentality and childishness. His friend and student, Rolf Grønseth said of him that Ola Raknes manifested this child himself in his eagerness and his joy in searching and in pride in himself the way it can be seen in children, but that has been lost in most all adults – but that he combined this with an unusual degree of sober attitude. He saw things simply and straightforwardly and gave them names that all could understand. He could easily be misjudged as being naïve, but in reality he held a broad view. (Grønseth, 1975) Similarly was his repulsion great when it came to use of force and repression of others (Dannevig, 1975).\n\nOla Raknes once said to his friend and student Rolf Grønseth: \"I too must be allowed to die at some time\". He died pursuant to a brief bout of pneumonia at the end of January 1975, only a few days after his 88th birthday.\n\nEinar Dannevig sums up his experience of Ola Raknes as a man of spirit: \"The clarity of thought and emotion, conveyed through many languages, the ability to simplify with a taste for the big and significant parts of it all together with a genuine modesty and complete absence of ambitions for power made it a distinctive and a big experience to meet Ola Raknes, preferably in person, but also in writing.\" (Dannevig, 1975)\n\n\n\nRaknes also wrote articles in amongst others the \"International Journal of Sex Economy and Orgone Research\" (under the pseudonym Carl Arnold), \"Orgone Energy Bulletin\", \"Orgonomic Medicine\" and \"Syn og Segn\".\n\nTranslations into Nynorsk:\n\n"}

Prayer is an integral element of the Christian faith and permeates all forms of Christian worship. Prayer in Christianity is the tradition of communicating with God, either in God's fullness or as one of the persons of the Trinity.\n\nIn the early Church worship was inseparable from doctrine as reflected in the statement: \"lex orandi, lex credendi\", i.e. the law of belief is the law of prayer. The Lord's Prayer was an essential element of the meetings of early Christians, and over time a variety of Christian prayer emerged.\n\nChristian prayers are diverse and may vary among Christian denominations. They may be public prayers (e.g. as part of liturgy) or private prayers by an individual. Prayers may be performed as petition (or intercession), thanksgiving, blessing (or benediction), praise or confession.\n\nA broad, three stage hierarchical characterization of prayer begins with vocal prayer, then moves on to a more structured form in terms of Christian meditation, and finally reaches the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Contemplative prayer follows Christian meditation and is the highest form of prayer which aims to achieve a close spiritual union with God. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings have emphasized the use of meditative prayers as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.\n\nPrayer and the reading of Scripture were important elements of Early Christianity. In the early Church worship was inseparable from doctrine as reflected in the statement: \"lex orandi, lex credendi\", i.e. the law of belief is the law of prayer. Early Christian liturgies highlight the importance of prayer.\n\nThe Lord's Prayer was an essential element in the meetings held by the very early Christians, and it was spread by them as they preached Christianity in new lands. Over time, a variety of prayers were developed as the production of early Christian literature intensified.\n\nBy the 3rd century Origen had advanced the view of \"Scripture as a sacrament\". Origen's methods of interpreting Scripture and praying on them were learned by Ambrose of Milan, who towards the end of the 4th century taught them to Saint Augustine, thereby introducing them into the monastic traditions of the Western Church thereafter.\n\nEarly models of Christian monastic life emerged in the 4th century, as the Desert Fathers began to seek God in the deserts of Palestine and Egypt. These early communities gave rise to the tradition of a Christian life of \"constant prayer\" in a monastic setting which eventually resulted in meditative practices in the Eastern Church during the Byzantine period.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the monastic traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves the repetition of the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.\nIn the Western Church, by the 6th century, Saint Benedict and Pope Gregory I had initiated the formal methods of scriptural prayer called Lectio Divina. With the motto \"Ora et labora\" (i.e. pray and work), daily life in a Benedictine monastery consisted of three elements: liturgical prayer, manual labor and Lectio Divina, a quiet prayerful reading of the Bible. This slow and thoughtful reading of Scripture, and the ensuing pondering of its meaning, was their meditation.\n\nEarly in the 12th century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux was instrumental in re-emphasizing the importance of Lectio Divina within the Cistercian order. Bernard also emphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in contemplative prayer and compared it to a kiss by the Eternal Father which allows a union with God.\n\nThe progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk who died late in the 12th century. Guigo II's book \"The Ladder of Monks\" is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition.\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, the monastic traditions of \"constant prayer\" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and Evagrius Pontikos established the practice of hesychasm and influenced John Climacus' book \"The Ladder of Divine Ascent\" by the 7th century. These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century.\nIn the Western Church, during the 15th century, reforms of the clergy and monastic settings were undertaken by the two Venetians, Lorenzo Giustiniani and Louis Barbo. Both men considered methodical prayer and meditation as essential tools for the reforms they were undertaking. Barbo, who died in 1443, wrote a treatise on prayer titled \"Forma orationis et meditionis\" otherwise known as \"Modus meditandi\". He described three types of prayer; vocal prayer, best suited for beginners; meditation, oriented towards those who are more advanced; and contemplation as the highest form of prayer, only obtainable after the meditation stage. Based on the request of Pope Eugene IV, Barbo introduced these methods to Valladolid, Spain and by the end of the 15th century they were being used at the abbey of Montserrat. These methods then influenced Garcias de Cisneros, who in turn influenced Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church has a similar three level hierarchy of prayer. The first level prayer is again vocal prayer, the second level is meditation (also called \"inward prayer\" or \"discursive prayer\") and the third level is contemplative prayer in which a much closer relationship with God is cultivated.\n\nPrayer is an integral element of the Christian faith and permeates all forms of Christian worship. Prayer in Christianity is the tradition of communicating with God, either in God's fullness or as one of the persons of the Trinity. Christian prayers are diverse and may vary among Christian denominations. They may be public prayers (e.g. as part of liturgy) or private prayers by an individual.\n\nThe most common prayer among Christians is the Lord's Prayer, which according to the gospel accounts (e.g. ) is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray. The Lord's prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.\n\nThe first centuries of Christianity witnessed an intense growth in religious literature and these often included prayers. The prayers recorded in early Christian literature can be categorized into six types: petition (including intercession), thanksgiving, blessing (or benediction), praise, confession and finally a small number of lamentations. The first five of these types have persisted throughout the centuries and been expressed in a large number of Christian prayers. However some prayers may combine some of these forms, e.g. praise and thanksgiving, etc.\n\nChristian meditation is a structured attempt to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of God. The word meditation comes from the Latin word \"meditārī\", which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study and to practice. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.\n\nIn the 20th century the practice of Lectio Divina moved out of monastic settings and reached lay Christians in the Western Church. Separately, among Roman Catholics, meditation on the Rosary remains one of the most widespread and popular spiritual practices.\n\nWhile meditation in the Western Church was being built on the foundations of Lectio Divina, a different form of meditative practice emerged within Eastern Christianity during the Byzantine period, as the practice of hesychasm gained a following, specially on Mount Athos in Greece. Hesychasm was promoted by Saint Gregory Palamas in the 14th century and remains a part of Eastern Christian spirituality.\n\nBoth Eastern and Western Christian teachings have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. It is the middle level in a broad three stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplation in Christianity.\n\nAt times there may be no clear-cut boundary between Christian meditation and Christian contemplation, and they overlap. Meditation serves as a foundation on which the contemplative life stands, the practice by which someone begins the state of contemplation.\n\nIn discursive meditation, mind and imagination and other faculties are actively employed in an effort to understand our relationship with God. In contemplative prayer, this activity is curtailed, so that contemplation has been described as \"a gaze of faith\", \"a silent love\".\n\n"}

The technique involves learning to monitor the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing each muscle group. This tension is then released, as attention is directed towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation. \n\nIt was developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson and presented first in 1908 at Harvard University. In 1929, Jacobson published the book \"Progressive Relaxation\", which included a detailed procedure for removing muscular tension. His work led to the use of the word \"relax\", in the sense of \"to become less tense, anxious or stressed, to calm down\". He continued to work on this topic throughout his life and wrote several books about it.\n\nThese learning sessions are not exercises or self-hypnosis. Training sessions are conducted in a darkened room with the learner in a reclined position and eyes closed. The instructions begin by telling the person to relax and just let go, detaching from thoughts or physical distractions or trying to solve problems. In each session the teacher reviews tensing one particular muscle group. A modification of the technique is \"biofeedback\" in which one uses external measuring devices to indicate how successful one is in relaxing and then to use those techniques to relax without the help of external measuring devices.\nProgressive muscle relaxation is suggested to be applied daily. The technique has its own top-down sequence, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.Typically, the duration of a course is eight weeks, with each weekly session each lasting an hour or so.\nProgressive muscle relaxation technique requires a high degree of personal motivation, as the effects are often seen only after prolonged sessions. Before starting a course it might be recommended to consult with a doctor in order to ensure special care and attention is paid to selected muscle groups, as well as to obtain a recommendation on the ideal course.\nJacobson's progressive relaxation has remained popular with modern physical therapists.\nAlthough many institutions and individuals offer progressive muscle relaxation training, what they teach is not standardized, and no credentialing process is available for progressive muscle relaxation technique instructors.\n\nThere are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic.\n\nNowadays, non-pharmacological treatment of insomnia has become an alternative replacement or complement to routine medical care. Progressive muscle relaxation is used as a treatment for some causes of insomnia. They are meant to reduce physical tension and interrupt the racing thought processes that affect sleep.\nA common psychological problem of cancer patients and particularly for those in pain is insomnia.\nSome studies reported benefits of the Progressive muscle relaxation technique used by cancer patients. One of them postulated: \"the significant effect for the muscle relaxation group on the sleep onset latency indicates that the subjects' self-reported insomnia was significantly improved. Total sleep time was increased as well\". \nPain is one of the most frequent symptoms in patients undergoing surgery or cancer chemotherapy and various treatments are proposed for its relief, including relaxation techniques. Progressive muscle relaxation technique is suggested to lead to an increase in blood flow which supplies more oxygen, thus enhancing local metabolism, resulting in reduced pain and muscle spasms.\nAdditionally, progressive muscle relaxation might reduce the perception of pain as well as providing pain relief by the patients after undergoing surgery. One of the recent study has been indicated \"a significant tension decrease in all the types of muscle between pre- and post-relaxation situations for patients after surgery a result of Progressive Muscle Relaxation\".\nAlso, the progressive muscle relaxation technique has been indicated to show some positive achievements in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain in women. In case of chronic pain it seems to be not possible to avoid the pain but possible to avoid the perceived threat (pain). Chronic pelvic pain often associated as results from abdominal functioning of the nervous system (often called \"neuropathic pain\"). If medications prescribed fail to be successful, women may be referred to a practice specializing in a pain management, such as progressive muscle relaxation technique. Here, the treatment aims to release tightness of the muscles in the abdomen and lower back, as well as musculoskeletal tension.\n\nSeveral studies tried to demonstrate whether there are some advantages to apply the progressive muscle relaxation technique into the sports field. Professional sports require constant tension from athletes both physically and mentally, therefore the progressive muscle relaxation technique may help athletes achieve optimal performance and optimize functioning in daily life.\nH.A. Hashim and H. Hanafi conducted an experiment with adolescent soccer players to understand the effects of progressive muscle relaxation on athletes. Results obtained in this experiment suggested reductions in the confusion, depression, fatigue, and tension subscale scores following progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nProgressive muscle relaxation technique has been used in psychiatric settings as an alternative means of coping with subjective stress and state anxiety. A few modern studies are reported a therapeutic effectiveness on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms as well as on response/remission for people with schizophrenia.There is evidence revealing a decrease in stress level after regular training, after which patients tend to feel a greater sense of wellness and well-being . Moreover, they aim to learn how to manage stressful situations, especially those related to \"self-control\", \"assuming responsibility\" and \"positive re-evaluation\". However, the application of progressive muscle relaxation technique to the patients with schizophrenia is not widely used and requires additional research. \n\nProgressive relaxation has formed the basis for natural-childbirth methods. \n\nAccording to \"Encyclopedia of medicine\" by Miller-Keane, long term effects of practicing progressive muscle relaxation include:\n\n"}

{"id": "29780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29780", "title": "Thomas Reid", "text": "Thomas Reid\n\nThomas Reid (; 7 May (O.S. 26 April) 1710 – 7 October 1796) was a religiously trained British philosopher, a contemporary of David Hume as well as \"Hume's earliest and fiercest critic\". He was the founder of the Scottish School of Common Sense and played an integral role in the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. \n\nHe was born in the manse at Strachan, Aberdeenshire, on 26 April 1710 O.S., the son of Lewis Reid (1676–1762) and his wife Margaret Gregory, first cousin to James Gregory. He was educated at Kincardine Parish School then the O'Neil Grammar School in Kincardine.\n\nHe went to the University of Aberdeen in 1723 and graduated MA in 1726 (the young age was normal at that time). He was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland in 1731, when he came of age. He began his career as a minister of the Church of Scotland but ceased to be a minister when he was given a professorship at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1752. He obtained his doctorate and wrote \"An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense\" (published in 1764). He and his colleagues founded the 'Aberdeen Philosophical Society' which was popularly known as the 'Wise Club' (a literary-philosophical association). Shortly after the publication of his first book, he was given the prestigious Professorship of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow when he was called to replace Adam Smith. He resigned from this position in 1781, after which he prepared his university lectures for publication in two books: \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man\" (1785) and \"Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind\" (1788). Reid was buried at Blackfriars Church in the grounds of Glasgow College and when the university moved to Gilmorehill in the west of Glasgow, his tombstone was inserted in the main building. See separate article on Thomas Reid's tombstone.\n\nReid believed that common sense (in a special philosophical sense of \"sensus communis\") is, or at least should be, at the foundation of all philosophical inquiry. He disagreed with Hume, who asserted that we can never know what an external world consists of as our knowledge is limited to the ideas in the mind, and George Berkeley, who asserted that the external world is merely ideas in the mind. By contrast, Reid claimed that the foundations upon which our \"sensus communis\" are built justify our belief that there is an external world.\n\nIn his day and for some years into the 19th century, he was regarded as more important than Hume. He advocated direct realism, or common sense realism, and argued strongly against the Theory of Ideas advocated by John Locke, René Descartes, and (in varying forms) nearly all Early Modern philosophers who came after them. He had a great admiration for Hume and had a mutual friend send Hume an early manuscript of Reid's \"Inquiry.\" Hume responded that the \"deeply philosophical\" work \"is wrote in a lively and entertaining matter,\" but that \"there seems to be some defect in method,\" and criticized Reid for implying the presence of innate ideas.\n\nHis theory of knowledge had a strong influence on his theory of morals. He thought epistemology was an introductory part to practical ethics: When we are confirmed in our common beliefs by philosophy, all we have to do is to act according to them, because we know what is right. His moral philosophy is reminiscent of Roman stoicism in its emphasis on the agency of the subject and self-control. He often quotes Cicero, from whom he adopted the term \"sensus communis\". Reid's answer to Hume's sceptical and naturalist arguments was to enumerate a set of principles of \"common sense\" (\"sensus communis\") which constitute the foundations of rational thought. Anyone who undertakes a philosophical argument, for example, must implicitly presuppose certain beliefs like, \"I am talking to a real person,\" and \"There is an external world whose laws do not change,\" among many other positive, substantive claims. For Reid, the belief in the truth of these principles is not rational; rather, reason itself demands these principles as prerequisites, as does the innate \"constitution\" of the human mind. It is for this reason (and possibly a mocking attitude toward Hume and Berkeley) that Reid sees belief in the principles of common sense as a litmus test for sanity. For example, in \"The Intellectual Powers of Man\" he states, \"For, before men can reason together, they must agree in first principles; and it is impossible to reason with a man who has no principles in common with you.\" One of the first principles he goes on to list is that \"qualities must necessarily be in something that is figured, coloured, hard or soft, that moves or resists. It is not to these qualities, but to that which is the subject of them, that we give the name body. If any man should think fit to deny that these things are qualities, or that they require any subject, I leave him to enjoy his opinion as a man who denies first principles, and is not fit to be reasoned with.\"\n\nReid also made positive arguments based in phenomenological insight to put forth a novel mixture of direct realism and ordinary language philosophy. In a typical passage in the \"Intellectual Powers\" he asserts that when he has a conception of a centaur, the thing he conceives is an animal, and no idea is an animal; therefore, the thing he conceives is not an idea, but a centaur. This point relies both on an account of the subjective experience of conceiving an object and also on an account of what we mean when we use words. Because Reid saw his philosophy as publicly accessible knowledge, available both through introspection and the proper understanding of how language is used, he saw it as the philosophy of common sense.\n\nReid started out with a 'common sense' based on a direct experience of an external reality but then proceeded to explore in two directions - external to the senses, and internal to human language - to find a more rational basis.\n\nIn the case of the latter, Reid saw this as based on an innate capacity pre-dating human consciousness, and acting as an instrument for that consciousness. Also, language then becomes a means of examining the original form of human cognition. Reid notes that current human language contains two distinct elements: first, the acoustic element and secondly the meanings which seem to have nothing to do with the sounds as such. This state of the language, which he calls 'artificial', cannot be the primeval one, which he terms 'natural', wherein sound was not an abstract sign, but a concrete gesture or natural sign. Reid looks to the way a child learns the language, by imitating sounds, becoming aware of them long before it understands the meaning accorded to the various groups of sounds in the artificial state of contemporary adult speech. If, says Reid, the child was to understand immediately the conceptual content of the words it hears, it would never learn to speak at all. Here Reid distinguishes between natural and artificial signs.\n\nAs regards the former, Reid was led to his critical distinction between 'sensation' and 'perception'. While we become aware of an object through the senses, the content of that perception is not identical with the sum total of the sensations caused in our consciousness. Thus, while we tend to focus on the object perceived, we pay no attention to the process leading from sensation to perception, which contains the knowledge of the thing as real. How, then, do we receive the conviction of the latter's existence? Reid's answer is, by entering into an immediate intuitive relationship with it, as a child does. In the case of the adult, the focus is on perceiving, but with the child, it is on receiving of the sensations in their living nature. For Reid, the perception of the child is different from the adult, and he states that man must become like a child to get past the artificial perception of the adult, which leads to Hume's view that what we perceive is an illusion. Also, the artist provides a key to the true content of sense experience, as he engages the 'language of nature'.\n\nThus, for Reid, common sense was based on the innate capacity of man in an earlier epoch to directly participate in nature, and one we find to some extent in the child and artist, but one that from a philosophical and scientific perspective, we must re-awaken at a higher level in the human mind above nature. Why does Reid believe that perception is the way to recognize? Well, to him “an experience is purely subjective and purely negative. It supports the validity of a proposition, only on the fact that I find that it is impossible for me not to hold it for true, to suppose it therefore not true” (Reid, 753). To understand this better, it is important to know that Reid divides his definition of perception into two categories: conception, and belief. “Conception is Reid’s way of saying to visualize an object, so then we can affirm or deny qualities about that thing. Reid believes that beliefs are our direct thoughts of an object, and what that object is” (Buras, The Functions of Sensations to Reid). So, to Reid, what we see, what we visualize, what we believe of an object, is that object’s true reality. Reid believes in direct objectivity, our senses guide us to what is right since we cannot trust our own thoughts. “The worlds of common sense and of philosophy are reciprocally the converse of each other” (Reid, 841). Reid believes that Philosophy overcomplicates the question of what is real. So, what does Common Sense actually mean then? Well, “common sense is the senses being pulled all together to form one idea” (Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid, 164). Common sense (all the senses combined) is how we truly identify the reality of an object; since all that can be perceived about an object, are all pulled into one perception. How do people reach the point of accessing common sense? That’s the trick, everyone is born with the ability to access common sense, that is why it is called common sense. “The principles of common sense are common to all of humanity,” (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid).\nCommon sense works as such: If all men observe an item and believe the same qualities about that item, then the knowledge of that item is universally true. It is common knowledge, with without explanation is held true by other people; so, what is universally seen is universally believed. “The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a community, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase of knowledge,” (Reid, 155). The combination of the same ideas, of a thing, by multiple people, is what confirms the reality of an object. Reid also believes that the philosophers of his time overexaggerated what is truly real. Where most philosophers believe that what we see is not fully what that thing is, for example, Descartes. Reid counters this argument simply by stating that this assumption “that such a hypothesis is no more likely to be true than the common-sensical belief that the world is much the way we perceive it to be,” (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid). Reality is what we make it out to be, nothing more.\n\nReid also claimed that this discovery of the link between the natural sign and the thing signified was the basis of natural philosophy and science, as pointed out by Bacon in his new method of discovery of the innate laws of nature.\n\nIt has been claimed that his reputation waned after attacks on the Scottish School of Common Sense by Immanuel Kant (although Kant, only 14 years Reid's junior, also bestowed much praise on Scottish philosophy - Kant attacked the work of Reid, but admitted he had never actually read the works of Thomas Reid) and by John Stuart Mill. But Reid's was the philosophy taught in the colleges of North America during the 19th century and was championed by Victor Cousin, a French philosopher. Justus Buchler has shown that Reid was an important influence on the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, who shared Reid's concern to revalue common sense and whose work links Reid to pragmatism. To Peirce, conceptions of truth and the real involve the notion of a community without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed), and capable of a definite increase of knowledge. Common sense is socially evolved, open to verification much like scientific method, and constantly evolving, as evidence, perception, and practice warrant, albeit with a slowness that Peirce came only in later years to see, at which point he owned his \"adhesion, under inevitable modification, to the opinion of...Thomas Reid, in the matter of Common Sense\" (Peirce called his version \"critical common-sensism\"). By contrast, on Reid's concept, the \"sensus communis\" is not a social evolutionary product but rather a precondition of the possibility that humans could reason with each other. The work of Thomas Reid influenced the work of Noah Porter and James McCosh in the 19th century United States and is based upon the claim of universal principles of objective truth, Pragmatism is not the development of the work of the Scottish \"Common Sense\" School - it is the negation of it. There are clear links between the work of the Scottish Common Sense School and the work of the Oxford Realist philosophers Harold Prichard and Sir William David Ross in the 20th century.\n\nReid's reputation has revived in the wake of the advocacy of common sense as a philosophical method or criterion by G. E. Moore early in the 20th century, and more recently because of the attention given to Reid by contemporary philosophers, in particular philosophers of religion in the school of Reformed epistemology such as William Alston, Alvin Plantinga, and Nicholas Wolterstorff, seeking to rebut charges that theistic belief is irrational where it has no doxastic foundations (that is, where that belief is not inferred from other adequately grounded beliefs).\n\nHe wrote a number of important philosophical works, including \"Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense\" (1764, Glasgow & London), \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man\" (1785) and \"Essays on the Active Powers of Man\" (1788). In 1844, Schopenhauer praised Reid for explaining that the perception of external objects does not result from the raw data that is received through the five senses:\nThough known mainly for his epistemology, Reid is also noted for his views in the theory of action and the metaphysics of personal identity. Reid held an incompatibilist or libertarian notion of freedom, holding that we are capable of free actions of which we are the cause, and for which we are morally appraisable. Regarding personal identity, he rejected Locke's account that self-consciousness in the form of memory of one's experiences was the basis of a person's being identical with their self over time. Reid held that continuity of memory was neither necessary nor sufficient to make one numerically the same person at different times.\n\n\nUntil recently the standard edition of the \"Inquiry\" and the \"Essays\" has been the sixth edition of William Hamilton (ed.), Edinburgh: Maclachlan and Stewart, 1863. A new critical edition of these titles, plus correspondence and other important material, is being brought out by Edinburgh University Press as The Edinburgh Edition of Thomas Reid. An accessible selection from Hamilton's 6th ed. is \"Thomas Reid's Inquiry and Essays\", ed. Ronald Beanblossom and Keith Lehrer, Indianapolis, In: Hackett, 1983.\n\n\n"}

It is also known as the Westcott and Hort text, after its editors Brooke Foss Westcott (1825–1901) and Fenton John Anthony Hort (1828–1892). (Textual scholars use the abbreviation \"WH\".)\nIt is a critical text, compiled from some of the oldest New Testament fragments and texts that had been discovered at the time. The two editors worked together for 28 years.\n\nWestcott and Hort state: \"[It is] our belief that even among the numerous unquestionably spurious readings of the New Testament there are no signs of deliberate falsification of the text for dogmatic purposes.\" \nThey find that without orthographic differences, doubtful textual variants exist only in one sixtieth of the whole New Testament (with most of them being comparatively trivial variations), with the substantial variations forming hardly more than one thousandth of the entire text.\nAccording to Hort, \"Knowledge of Documents should precede Final Judgments upon Readings\". The two editors favoured two manuscripts: Vaticanus and Sinaiticus. They also believed that the combination of Codex Bezae with the Old Latin and the Old Syriac represents the original form of the New Testament text, especially when it is shorter than other forms of the text, such as the majority of the Byzantine text-type. In this they followed one of the primary principles of their fledgling textual criticism, \"lectio brevior\", sometimes taken to an extreme, as in the theory of Western non-interpolations, which has since been rejected.\n\nWestcott and Hort distinguished four text types in their studies. The most recent is the Syrian, or Byzantine text-type (eastern), of which the newest example is the Textus Receptus and thus from the critical text view is less likely reliable. The Western text-type is much older, but tends to paraphrase, so according to the critical text view also lacks dependability. The Alexandrian text-type, exemplified in the Codex Ephraemi, exhibits a polished Greek style. The two scholars identified their favorite text type as \"Neutral text\", exemplified by two 4th-century manuscripts, the Codex Vaticanus (known to scholars since the 15th century), and the Codex Sinaiticus (discovered in 1859), both of which they relied on heavily (albeit not exclusively) for this edition. This text has only a few changes of the original. This edition is based on the critical works especially of Tischendorf and Tregelles. The minuscules play a minimal role in this edition.\n\nWestcott and Hort worked on their Testament from 1853 until its completion in 1881. It was followed by an \"Introduction and Appendix\" by Hort appearing in a second volume in 1882. In 1892, a revised edition was released by F. C. Burkitt.\n\nThe edition of Westcott and Hort began a new epoch in the history of textual criticism. Most critical editions published after Westcott and Hort share their preference of the Alexandrian text-type and therefore are similar to \"The New Testament in the Original Greek\". An exception is the text edited by Hermann von Soden. Soden's edition stands much closer to the text of Tischendorf than to the text of Westcott and Hort. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text WH. Aland reports that, while NA25 text shows, for example, 2,047 differences from von Soden, 1,996 from Vogels, 1,268 from Tischendorf, 1,161 from Bover, and 770 from Merk, it contains only 558 differences from WH text.\n\nAccording to Bruce M. Metzger, \"the general validity of their critical principles and procedures is widely acknowledged by scholars today.\" \nIn 1981 Metzger said:\n“The international committee that produced the \"United Bible Societies\" Greek New Testament, not only adopted the Westcott and Hort edition as its basic text, but followed their methodology in giving attention to both external and internal consideration”.\nPhilip Comfort gave this opinion:\n\nThe text produced by Westcott and Hort is still to this day, even with so many more manuscript discoveries, a very close reproduction of the primitive text of the New Testament. Of course, I think they gave too much weight to Codex Vaticanus alone, and this needs to be tempered. This criticism aside, the Westcott and Hort text is extremely reliable. (...) In many instances where I would disagree with the wording in the Nestle / UBS text in favor of a particular variant reading, I would later check with the Westcott and Hort text and realize that they had often come to the same decision. (...) Of course, the manuscript discoveries of the past one hundred years have changed things, but it is remarkable how often they have affirmed the decisions of Westcott and Hort.\n\nThe texts of Nestle-Aland, and of Bover and Merk, differ very little from the text of the Westcott-Hort.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Schipper 1986:968; literally \"yiye zhi lan\" 乙夜之覽 \"[for] perusal during the second watch [around 10 PM]\").\n\nThe title uses the common Chinese words \"yun\" 雲 \"cloud\" and \"qi\" 七 \"seven\" with the Classical Chinese terms \"ji\" 笈 \"bamboo box used for travelling (esp. to carry books); book box; satchel\" and \"qian\" 籤 \"bamboo slip; book marker; lot (used for divination); oracle\" (both made from bamboo and written with the \"bamboo radical\" ⺮).\n\nZhang's preface explains that he chose among \"yunji qibu zhi ying\" 雲笈七部之英 \"outstanding [books] from the seven components in the cloudy bookbag\". The sinologist Judith M. Boltz (2008:1203) explains that \"yunji\" is a \"well-established poetic trope for a bagful of Taoist writings\" and \"qibu\" refers to the \"sandong\"三洞 \"Three Caverns\" and \"sibu\" 四部 \"Four Supplements\" into which the Canon was organized.\n\nTranslating the opaque \"Yunji qiqian\" title into English is difficult.\n\nAn alternative name for the \"Yunji qiqian\" is \"xiao Daozang\" 小道藏 \"little Daoist Canon\".\n\nThe received \"Yunji qiqian\" has 37 \"bu\" sections, 122 \"juan\" chapters (several of which are divided into two parts), and quotes more than 700 early Daoist texts. Zhang's preface mentions 120 \"juan\"; one explanation (Lin 1995:99) for the discrepancy is if the 122-chapter Ming edition came from compiling various 120-chapter Song editions.\n\nIn Chinese bibliographic terminology, the \"Yunji qiqian\" is classified as a \"leishu\" (reference work arranged by category; encyclopedia). English descriptions of the text include anthology (Boltz), encyclopedia (Schipper), handbook (Schipper), and encyclopedic anthology (Lin).\n\nSource materials come almost exclusively from Six Dynasties (220-589) and Tang Dynasty (618-907) Daoist works. Many texts are quoted extensively, some are abridged, and others are made into new compositions (Schipper 1986:967). Lin (1995:100) suggests the text represents the \"crystallization\" of religious Daoism from the late Han to early Song periods.\n\nSchipper (1986:968) describes the \"Yunji qiqian\" as a handbook to the mystical and \"yangsheng\" 養生 \"nourishing life\" Daoism of the Tang, and the religion of the poets Li Bai, Li Shangyin, and Han Yu, which \"provides a key to the understanding of the arts and the literature of this period.\"\n\nThe (1445) Ming Dynasty edition \"Zhengtong daozang\" 正統道藏 \"Zhengtong Emperor's Daoist Canon\" contains the earliest known complete copy of the \"Yunji qiqian\", which subsequent Canon editions reproduced. This Ming edition inconsistently uses alternate Chinese characters to avoid Song Dynasty (960-1279) naming taboos, which \"suggests that the editors of the Canon drew from a combination of editions in print or manuscript form\" (Boltz 2008:1204). Such taboos were not observed in fragments of pages from the Yuan Canon of 1244.\n\nZhang Xuan 張萱 published a copy of the \"Yunji qiqian\" in 1609, and it was reproduced by the (1773-1782) \"Siku quanshu\" and (1919-1922) \"Sibu Congkan\" collections. The (1929) edition \"Sibu Congkan\" reproduced the superior copy in the Ming Canon, which was not marred by lacuna.\n\nIn the modern era, Kristofer Schipper compiled an index to the \"Yunji qiqian\" (1981), and linguistic scholars at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences produced a definitive edition (1988).\n\nKristofer Schipper (1986:967) claimed the \"Yunji qiqian\" text had four problems, all of which Fu-shih Lin (1995:98-100) dismisses. \n\nFirst, Schipper says Zhang's preface \"surprisingly mentions Manichean works among those that entered into the compilation of the \"Canon\",\" which has drawn the attentions of historians studying Manichaeism, but the present text \"contains no identifiable Manichean material.\" Lin notes the preface \"only mentioned that [Zhang] had \"received\" some Manichean scriptures when he was editing the Canon. He did not tell us whether those Manichean scriptures had been compiled into the Canon or not.\" \n\nSecond, Schipper notes that despite the title and preface, the \"Yunji qiqian\" \"is not divided into seven parts; it does not even contain the slightest trace of such an arrangement.\" Lin cites Chen Guofu 陳國符 that the titular \"qiqian\" means \"seven sections\" of the Daoist Canon and not sections of the \"Yunji qiqian\". \n\nThird, Schipper says the most remarkable problem \"is the total absence of the liturgical forms of Taoism\", which are abundant in the 1016 Daoist Canon edited by Zhang. Since the \"Yunji qiqian\" does not contain any Daoist rituals for retreats, petitions, or memorials, and \"it contains only the merest handful of talismans, charts, and diagrams\", the present text \"cannot be considered as an anthology of the Sung \"Canon\".\" Comparing contents of the text's 37 \"bu\" 部 \"sections\" with the 12 \"bu\" of the Daoist Canon, Lin concludes that except for \"weiyi\" 威儀 \"public rituals\" and \"zhangbiao\" 章表 \"petitions and memorials\", the topics of the \"Yunji qiqian\" represent all the major features of Daoist literature.\n\nFourth, Schipper concludes that the received text, despite having underdone changes such as 120 to 122 \"juan\", is probably descended from the original \"Yuynji qiqian\". \"It appears therefore impossible, at the present stage, to explain the discrepancies between the preface and the actual encyclopedia. But there are strong indications that the latter corresponds, by and large, to Chang's work.\"\n\n\n"}
