His was a nuanced vision, however, that took account of the shortcomings of human nature; like H.G. Wells, he advocated that power in society be wielded by the most enlightened among its members.\n\nŚwiętochowski was a journalist, literary critic, historian and philosopher—a founder and the leading ideologist of Polish Positivism. In 1871 he published in \"Przegląd Tygodniowy\" (The Weekly Review) a famous programmatic article of the Polish Positivists, \"My i wy\" (\"We and You\").\n\nŚwiętochowski worked with many periodicals, including (1870–78) \"Przegląd Tygodniowy\" (The Weekly Review), in 1876–78 as co-editor. In 1878–79 he edited the daily \"Nowiny\" (News); when in 1882 it was bought by financier Stanisław Kronenberg, its new owner, purportedly on Świętochowski's recommendation, entrusted the editorship to Bolesław Prus.\n\nIn 1881–1902 Świętochowski edited and published \"Prawda\" (The Truth), which he had founded.\n\nIn 1881 he lost his little son. Unable to regain his equilibrium, in mid-February 1882, on the advice of Dr. Tytus Chałubiński, he went on a journey to Italy. He would recall in his \"Pamiętnik\" (Memoirs):\n\nIn 1905 Świętochowski founded, and subsequently led, \"Stronnictwo Postępowo-Demokratyczne\" (the Progressive-Democratic Party), which after 1918 was somewhat aligned with the National Democratic Party. He worked with the National Democrats in opposing socialism, but their nationalism and racism were alien to him, and the National Democrats never regarded him as one of their own.\n\nŚwiętochowski founded and was president of \"Towarzystwo Kultury Polskiej\" (the Polish Culture Society, 1906–13) and editor and publisher of its organ, \"Kultura Polska\" (Polish Culture).\n\nFrom 1912 until his death in 1938, Świętochowski lived in Gołotczyzna, a village 67 kilometers north of Warsaw, where he established intimate intellectual and personal ties with Aleksandra Bąkowska. As early as 1909, he had inspired the creation, in Gołotczyzna, of a home-economics school for village girls, established by Bąkowska; and three years later, an agriculture school for boys, called \"Bratne\". He regarded these institutions as his greatest achievement in the realm of education.\n\nŚwiętochowski died at Gołotczyzna on 25 April 1938 and was buried in the cemetery at Sońsk, near Ciechanów.\n\nHis son Ryszard Świętochowski (Warsaw, 17 October 1882 – 1941, Auschwitz) was an engineer, journalist and politician who supported Władysław Sikorski, and published many papers in the field of physics; he died at Auschwitz Concentration Camp.\n\nAs the leading ideologist and exponent of the latter-19th-century Polish philosophical and cultural movement known as \"Polish Positivism,\" Świętochowski was an uncompromising critic of outdated traditions and obscurantism, and a spokesman for the fostering of knowledge and education.\n\nA complement to this optimistic scientism was his reflections on the limitations of human nature (\"Dumania pesymisty\" [\"Reflections of a Pessimist\"], \"Przegląd Tygodniowy\" [The Weekly Review], 1876), which led him to contrast sage leaders with egotistic societal collectives. Over the years, this concern of his would recur in a number of his plays and stories.\n\nCzesław Miłosz describes him: \"A brilliant man, a sharp, even violent, polemicist against the conservatives, accused by his adversaries of haughtiness... he edited the periodical \"Truth\" \"(Prawda)\", signing his articles 'Truth's [Apostle].'\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

She studied at the University of Graz, earning a PhD in economics and political science in 1937 and the following year married the engineer Robert Schneiter. She began to focus on Asian topics, specifically Tibetology, Buddhist philosophy and psychology, and Early Central Asian History and wrote about women in Asian societies. In 1945, Olschak fled to Salzburg, and worked as an editor at the \"Alpen-Journal\", but her husband became a prisoner of war in 1946 and died in a concentration camp. At that time, Olschak fled again, going to Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nShortly after arriving in Switzerland, Olschak published \"Das Mädchen Katharina; Miniaturen aus den Jugendjahren der grossen Kaiserin\" (1947). She became a foreign correspondent for several Austrian newspapers and traveled throughout the Far East to China, the Himalayas, Japan, Java, Korea, Mongolia and Tibet to conduct research. In 1949, she was hired by \"Encyclic Verlag\" of Zurich to create the first encyclopedia of women which had ever been published. The work was comprehensive and covered cultural, economic, political and sociological aspects of women's lives from throughout the world. In the mid-1950s, the project was looking for a publisher to extend the work to the Americas and inspired Ángela Acuña Braun to create a historical social study of \"Costa Rican Women Through Four Centuries\" which took Acuña nearly two decades to compile and publish.\n\nIn 1961, she founded an organization, \"Verein für tibetische Heimstätten in der Schweiz\", for receiving Tibetan refugees and assisting with immigration into Switzerland in conjunction with the Red Cross. Under her own initiative, she took study courses with Constantin Regamey and Geshé Thupten Wangyal, attending conferences and writing scientific papers on Tibetan culture. For her scientific studies, she was awarded the title of professor by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research in 1981 and awarded a Golden Doctorate in 1987.\n\nOlschak died on 25 June 1989 in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nAll of her early works were in German.

The term was introduced by D.N. Teller and E.Y. Pugh, Jr. in 1983, and has been sparingly used. Activity in the bridge locus neurons is postulated to be necessary and sufficient for sensory perception: if the bridge locus neurons are not active, then the sensory perception does not occur, regardless of the actual sensory input. Conversely if the bridge locus neurons are active, then sensory perception occurs, regardless of the actual sensory input. It is the highest neural level of a sensory perception. So, for example, retinal neurons are not considered a bridge locus for visual perception because stimulating visual cortex can give rise to visual percepts.\n\nNot all scholars believe in such a neural correlate of consciousness. Pessoa et al., for example, argue that there is no necessity for a bridge locus, basing their argument on the requirement of an isomorphism between neural states and conscious states. Thompson argues that there are good reasons to think that the notion of a bridge locus, which he calls a \"localizationist approach\", is misguided, questioning the premise that there has to be one particular neural stage whose activity forms the immediate substrate of perception. He argues, based upon work by Zeki & Shipp, DeYoe & Van Essen, and others, that brain regions are not independent stages or modules but have dense forward and backward projections that act reciprocally, and that visual processing is highly interactive and context-dependent. He also argues that cells in the visual cortex \"are not mere 'feature detectors, and that neuroscience has revealed that the brain in fact employs distributed networks, rather than centralized representations. He equates the notion of a bridge locus to a Cartesian theatre and suggests that as a notion it should be abandoned.\n\n"}
{"id": "16982989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16982989", "title": "Business models for open-source software", "text": "Business models for open-source software\n\n<onlyinclude>Open-source software is widely used both as independent applications and as components in non-open-source applications. Many independent software vendors (ISVs), value-added resellers (VARs), and hardware vendors (OEMs or ODMs) use open-source frameworks, modules, and libraries inside their proprietary, for-profit products and services. From a customer's perspective, the ability to use open technology under standard commercial terms and support is valuable. They are willing to pay for the legal protection (e.g., indemnification from copyright or patent infringement), \"commercial-grade QA\", and professional support/training/consulting that are typical of commercial software, while also receiving the benefits of fine-grained control and lack of lock-in that comes with open-source.</onlyinclude>\n\nMuch unlike proprietary off-the-shelf software that come with restrictive licenses, open-source software is distributed freely, through the web and in physical media. Because creators cannot require each user to pay a license fee to fund development this way, a number of alternative development funding models have emerged.\n\nAn example of those funding models is when bespoke software is developed as a consulting project for one or more customers who request it. These customers pay developers to have this software developed according to their own needs and they could also closely direct the developers' work. If both parties agree, the resulting software could then be publicly released with an open-source license in order to allow subsequent adoption by other parties. That agreement could reduce the costs paid by the clients while the original developers (or independent consultants) can then charge for training, installation, technical support, or further customization if and when more interested customers would choose to use it after the initial release.\n\nThere also exist stipends to support the development of open source software, such as Google's Summer of Code.\n\nAnother approach to funding is to provide the software freely, but sell licenses to proprietary add-ons such as data libraries. For instance, an open-source CAD program may require parts libraries which are sold on a subscription or flat-fee basis. Open-source software can also promote the sale of specialized hardware that it interoperates with, some example cases being the Asterisk telephony software developed by PC-telephony hardware manufacturer Digium and the Robot Operating System (ROS) robotics platform by Willow Garage and Stanford AI Labs. Many open source software projects have begun as research projects within universities, as personal projects of students or professors, or as tools to aid scientific research. The influence of universities and research institutions on open-source shows in the number of projects named after their host institutions, such as BSD Unix, CMU Common Lisp, or the NCSA HTTPd which evolved into Apache.\n\nCompanies may employ developers to work on open-source projects that are useful to the company's infrastructure: in this case, it is developed not as a product to be sold but as a sort of shared public utility. A local bug-fix or solution to a software problem, written by a developer either at a company's request or to make his/her own job easier, can be released as an open-source contribution without costing the company anything. A larger project such as the Linux kernel may have contributors from dozens of companies which use and depend upon it, as well as hobbyist and research developers.\n\nA new funding approach for open-source projects is crowdfunding, organized over web platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or Bountysource.\n\nOpen-source software can be sold and used in general commercially. Also, commercial open-source applications have been a part of the software industry for some time. While commercialization or funding of open-source software projects is possible, it is considered challenging.\n\nSince several open-source licenses stipulate that authors of derivative works must distribute them under an open-source (copyleft) license, ISVs and VARs have to develop new legal and technical mechanisms to foster their commercial goals, as many traditional mechanisms are not directly applicable anymore.\n\nTraditional business wisdom suggests that a company's methods, assets, and intellectual properties should remain concealed from market competitors (trade secret) as long as possible to maximize the profitable commercialization time of a new product. Open-source software development minimizes the effectiveness of this tactic; development of the product is usually performed in view of the public, allowing competing projects or clones to incorporate new features or improvements as soon as the public code repository is updated, as permitted by most open-source licenses. Also in the computer hardware domain, a hardware producer who provides free and open software drivers reveals the knowledge about hardware implementation details to competitors, who might use this knowledge to catch up.\n\nTherefore, there is considerable debate about whether vendors can make a sustainable business from an open-source strategy. In terms of a traditional software company, this is probably the wrong question to ask. Looking at the landscape of open source applications, many of the larger ones are sponsored (and largely written) by system companies such as IBM who may not have an objective of software license revenues. Other software companies, such as Oracle and Google, have sponsored or delivered significant open-source code bases. These firms' motivation tends to be more strategic, in the sense that they are trying to change the rules of a marketplace and reduce the influence of vendors such as Microsoft. Smaller vendors doing open-source work may be less concerned with immediate revenue growth than developing a large and loyal community, which may be the basis of a corporate valuation at merger time.\n\nA variety of open-source compatible business approaches have gained prominence in recent years; notable examples include dual licensing, software as a service, not charging for the software but for services, freemium, donation-based funding, crowdfunding, and crowdsourcing.\n\nThere are several different types of business models for making profit using open-source software (OSS) or funding the creation. Below are existing and legal commercial business approaches in context of open-source software and open-source licenses. The acceptance of these approaches varies; some of these approaches are recommended (like selling services), others are accepted, while still others are considered controversial or even unethical by the open-source community. The underlying objective of these business models is to harness the size and international scope of the open-source community (typically more than an order of magnitude larger than what would be achieved with closed-source models) for a sustainable commercial venture. The vast majority of commercial open-source companies experience a conversion ratio (as measured by the percentage of downloaders who buy something) well below 1%, so low-cost and highly-scalable marketing and sales functions are key to these firms' profitability.\n\nDual licensing offers the software under an open-source license but also under separate proprietary license terms. The proprietary version can be sold to finance the continued development of the free open-source version. Customers can be attracted to a no-cost and open-source edition, then be part of an up-sell to a commercial enterprise edition. Further, customers will learn of open-source software in a company's portfolio and offerings but generate business in other proprietary products and solutions, including commercial technical support contracts and services. A popular example is Oracle's MySQL database which is dual-licensed under a commercial proprietary license as also under the GPLv2. Another example is the Sleepycat License. Flask developer Armin Ronacher stated that the AGPLv3 was a \"terrible success\" as \"vehicle for dual commercial licensing\" and noted that MongoDB, RethinkDB, OpenERP, SugarCRM as well as WURFL utilizing the license for this purpose.\n\nThe financial return of costs on open-source software can also come from selling services, such as training, technical support, or consulting, rather than the software itself.\n\nAnother possibility is offering open-source software in source code form only, while providing executable binaries to paying customers only, offering the commercial service of compiling and packaging of the software. Also, providing goods like physical installation media (e.g., DVDs) can be a commercial service.\n\nOpen-source companies using this business model successfully are for instance RedHat and IBM; a more specialized example is that of Revolution Analytics.\n\nSome open-source organizations such as the Mozilla Foundation and the Wikimedia Foundation sell branded merchandise articles like t-shirts and coffee mugs. This can be also seen as an additional service provided to the user community.\n\nAnother financing approach is innovated by Moodle, an open source learning management system and community platform. The business model revolves around a network of commercial partners who are certificated and therefore authorised to use the Moodle name and logo, and in turn provide a proportion of revenue to the Moodle Trust, which funds core development.\n\nSelling subscriptions for online accounts and server access to customers is a way of making profit based on open-source software. Also, combining desktop software with a service, called software plus services. Providing cloud computing services or software as a service (SaaS) without the release of the open-source software itself, neither in binary nor in source form, conforms with most open-source licenses (with exception of the AGPL).\n\nBecause of its lack of software freedoms, Richard Stallman calls SaaS \"inherently bad\" while acknowledging its legality. The FSF called the server-side use-case without release of the source-code the \"ASP loophole in the GPLv2\" and encourage therefore the use of the Affero General Public License which plugged this hole in 2002. In 2007 the FSF contemplated including the special provision of AGPLv1 into GPLv3 but ultimately decided to keep the licenses separate.\n\nOther financial situations include partnerships with other companies. Governments, universities, companies, and non-governmental organizations may develop internally or hire a contractor for custom in-house modifications, then release that code under an open-source license. Some organizations support the development of open-source software by grants or stipends, like Google's Summer of Code initiative founded in 2005.\n\nAlso, there were experiments by Independent developers to fund development of open-source software donation-driven directly by the users, e.g., with the Illumination Software Creator in 2012. From 2011 to 2016 SourceForge allowed users to donate to hosted projects that opted to accept donations. Internet micro-payments systems like PayPal, flattr, and Bitcoin help this approach.\n\nLarger donation campaigns also exist. In 2004 the Mozilla Foundation carried out a fundraising campaign to support the launch of the Firefox 1.0 web browser. It placed a two-page ad in the December 16 edition of \"The New York Times\" listing the names of the thousands who had donated.\n\nThe users of a particular software artifact may come together and pool money into an open-source bounty for the implementation of a desired feature or functionality. Offering bounties as funding has existed for some time. For instance, Bountysource is a web platform which has offered this funding model for open source software since 2003.\n\nAnother bounty source is companies or foundations that set up bounty programs for implemented features or bugfixes in open-source software relevant to them. For instance, Mozilla has been paying and funding freelance open-source programmers for security bug hunting and fixing since 2004.\n\nA newer funding opportunity for open-source software projects is crowdfunding, which shares similarities with the pre-order or Praenumeration business model, as well as the reverse bounty model, typically organized over web platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or Bountysource (see also comparison of crowd funding services). One example is the successfully funded Indiegogo campaign in 2013 by Australian programmer Timothy Arceri, who offered to implement an OpenGL 4.3 extension for the Mesa library in two weeks for $2,500. Arceri delivered the OpenGL extension code which was promptly merged upstream, and he later continued his efforts on Mesa with successive crowdfunding campaigns. Later, he found work as an employee in this domain with Collabora and in 2017 with Valve Corporation. Another example is the June 2013 crowdfunding on Kickstarter of the open source video game which raised the payment of a full-time developer for 3.5 months. Patreon funding has also become an effective option, as the service gives the option to pay out each month to creators, many of whom intend to develop free and open-source software.\n\nCrowdsourcing is a type of participative online activity in which an individual, an institution, a nonprofit organization, or company proposes to a group of individuals of varying knowledge, heterogeneity, and number, the voluntary undertaking of a task via a flexible open call. The undertaking of the task, of variable complexity and modularity, and in which the crowd should participate, bringing their work, money, knowledge and/or experience, always entails mutual benefit. The user will receive the satisfaction of a given type of need, be it economic, social recognition, self-esteem, or the development of individual skills, while the crowdsourcer will obtain and use to their advantage that which the user has brought to the venture, whose form will depend on the type of activity undertaken. Caveats in pursuing a Crowdsourcing strategy are to induce a substantial market model or incentive, and care has to be taken that the whole thing doesn‘t end up in an open source anarchy of adware and spyware plagiates, with a lot of broken solutions, started by people who just wanted to try it out, then gave up early, and a few winners. Popular examples for Crowdsourcing are Linux, Google Android, the Pirate Party movement, and Wikipedia.\n\nIn order to commercialize FOSS (free and open-source software), many companies (including Google, Mozilla, and Canonical) have moved towards an economic model of advertising-supported software. For instance, the open-source application AdBlock Plus gets paid by Google for letting whitelisted \"Acceptable Ads\" bypassing the browser ad remover. As another example is SourceForge, an open-source project service provider, has the revenue model of advertising banner sales on their website. In 2006, SourceForge reported quarterly takings of $6.5 million and $23 million in 2009.\n\nSome companies sell proprietary but optional extensions, modules, plugins or add-ons to an open-source software product. This can be a \"license conform\" approach with many open-source licenses if done technically sufficiently carefully. For instance, mixing proprietary code and open-source licensed code in statically linked libraries or compiling all source code together in a software product might violate open-source licenses, while keeping them separated by interfaces and dynamic-link libraries might often adhere to license conform.\n\nThis approach is a variant of the freemium business model. The proprietary software may be intended to let customers get more value out of their data, infrastructure, or platform, e.g., operate their infrastructure/platform more effectively and efficiently, manage it better, or secure it better. Examples include the IBM proprietary Linux software, where IBM contributes to the Linux open-source ecosystem, but it builds and delivers (to IBM’s paying customers) database software, middleware, and other software that runs on top of the open-source core. Other examples of proprietary products built on open-source software include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Cloudera's Apache Hadoop-based software. Some companies appear to re-invest a portion of their financial profits from the sale of proprietary software back into the open source infrastructure.\n\nSome companies, such as Digium, sell proprietary but optional digital electronics hardware controlled by an open-source software product.\n\nA variant of the approach above is the keeping of required data content (for instance a video game's audio, graphic, and other art assets) of a software product proprietary while making the software's source code open-source. While this approach is completely legitimate and compatible with most open-source licenses, customers have to buy the content to have a complete and working software product. Restrictive licenses can then be applied on the content, which prevents the redistribution or re-selling of the complete software product. Examples for open-source developed software are Kot-in-Action Creative Artel video game \"Steel Storm\", engine GPLv2 licensed while the artwork is CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 licensed, and \"Frogatto & Friends\" with an own developed open-source engine and commercialization via the copyrighted game assets for iPhone, BlackBerry and MacOS.\n\nOther examples are \"Arx Fatalis\" (by Arkane Studios) and \"Catacomb 3-D\" (by Flat Rock Software) with source code opened to the public delayed after release, while copyrighted assets and binaries are still sold on gog.com as digital distribution.\n\nDoing so conforms with the FSF and Richard Stallman, who stated that for art or entertainment the software freedoms are not required or important.\n\nThe similar product bundling of an open-source software product with hardware which prevents users from running modified versions of the software is called tivoization and is legal with most open-source licenses except GPLv3, which explicitly prohibits this use-case.\n\nAnother variant of the approach above, mainly use for data-intensive, data-centric software programs, is the keeping of all versions of the software under a free and open-source software license, but refraining from providing update scripts from a \"n\" to an \"n\"+1 version. Users can still deploy and run the open source software. However, any update to the next version requires either exporting the data, reinstalling the new version, then reimporting the data to the new version, or subscribing to the proprietary update system, or studying the two versions and recreating the scripts from scratch.\n\nThis practice does not conform with the free software principles as espoused by the FSF. Richard Stallman condemns this practice and names it \"diachronically trapped software\".\n\nIf a software product uses only own software and open-source software under a permissive free software licence, a company can re-license the resulting software product under a proprietary license and sell the product without the source code or software freedoms. For instance, Apple Inc. is an avid user of this approach by using source code and software from open-source projects. For example, the BSD Unix operating system kernel (under the BSD license) was used in Apple's Mac PCs that were sold as proprietary products.\n\nAn approach to allow commercialization under some open-source licenses while still protecting crucial business secrets, intellectual property and technical know-how is obfuscation of source code. This approach was used in several cases, for instance by Nvidia in their open-source graphic card device drivers. This practice is used to get the open-source-friendly propaganda without bearing the inconveniences. There has been debate in the free-software/open-source community on whether it is illegal to skirt copyleft software licenses by releasing source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The general consensus was that while unethical, it was not considered a violation.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation is against this practice. The GNU General Public License since version 2 has defined \"source code\" as \"the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\" This is intended to prevent the release of obfuscated source code.\n\nSome companies provide the latest version available only to paying customers. A vendor forks a non-copyleft software project then adds closed-source additions to it and sells the resulting software. After a fixed time period the patches are released back upstream under the same license as the rest of the codebase. This business model is called version lagging or time delaying.\n\nFor instance, 2016 the MariaDB Corporation created for business compatible \"delayed open-sourcing\" the source-available \"Business source license\" (BSL) which automatically relicenses after three years to the FOSS GPL. This approach guarantees licensees that they have source code access (e.g. for code audits), are not locked into a closed platform, or suffer from planned obsolescence, while for the software developer a time-limited exclusive commercialization is possible. In 2017 followed version 1.1, revised with feedback also from Bruce Perens.\n\nHowever, this approach works only with own software or permissive licensed code parts, as there is no copyleft FOSS license available which allows the time delayed opening of the source code after distributing or selling of a software product.\n\nAn extreme variant of \"delayed open-sourcing\" is a business practice popularized by id Software and 3D Realms, which released several software products under a free software license after a long proprietary commercialization time period and the return of investment was achieved. The motivation of companies following this practice of releasing the source code when a software reaches the commercial end-of-life, is to prevent that their software becomes unsupported Abandonware or even get lost due to digital obsolescence. This gives the user communities the chance to continue development and support of the software product themselves as an open-source software project. Many examples from the video game domain are in the list of commercial video games with later released source code.\n\nPopular non-game software examples are the Netscape Communicator which was open-sourced in 1998 and Sun Microsystems's office suite, StarOffice, which was released in October 2000 at its commercial end of life. Both releases formed the basis of important open-source projects, namely Mozilla Firefox and OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice. However, Firefox eventually gained a more-than-self-sustaining revenue model, so Firefox was not an example of a commercial end-of-life release.\n\nAccording to Yochai Benkler, the Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, free software is the most visible part of a new economy of commons-based peer production of information, knowledge, and culture.

In order to commercialize FOSS, many companies, Google being the most successful, are moving towards an economic model of advertising-supported software. In such a model, the only way to increase revenue is to make the advertising more valuable.

The Free Software Foundation considers Apple's App Stores to be incompatible with its GPL and complained that Apple was infringing on the GPL with its iTunes terms of use.

{"id": "6193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6193", "title": "Constantin von Tischendorf", "text": "Constantin von Tischendorf\n\nLobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf (18 January 1815 – 7 December 1874) was a world-leading biblical scholar in his time. In 1844 he discovered the world's oldest and most complete Bible dating from 325, with the complete New Testament not discovered before. This Bible is called Codex Sinaiticus, after the St. Catherine's Monastery at Mt. Sinai, where Tischendorf discovered it. The codex can be seen either in the British Library in London, or as a digitalised version on the Internet. Textual disputes are resolved when the two oldest books, Codex Sinaiticus (source aleph, 4th AD) and Codex Vaticanus (source beta, 4th AD), agree with each other. Tischendorf was made an Honorary Doctor by Oxford University on 16 March 1865, and an Honorary Doctor by Cambridge University on 9 March 1865 following this find of the century. While a student gaining his academic degree in the 1840s, he earned international recognition when he deciphered the \"Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus\", a 5th-century Greek manuscript of the New Testament. \n\nThe \"Codex Sinaiticus\" contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: Codex Vaticanus in the Vatican Library and Codex Alexandrinus, currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed by some to be the most authoritative surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older document is as complete as the Codex. The content of the \"oldest Bible of the world\" (as it is more complete than Codex Alexandrinus or Codex Vaticanus) has been digitised.\n\nThroughout his life Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the Sinai Peninsula, which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).\n\nIn 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.\n\nTischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.\n\nTischendorf was born in Lengenfeld, Saxony, near Plauen, the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the University of Leipzig where he was mainly influenced by JGB Winer, and he began to take special interest in New Testament criticism. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible. In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near Leipzig.\n\nAfter a journey through southern Germany and Switzerland, and a visit to Strassburg, he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the recensions of the New Testament text — the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars — Elsevier, Georg Christian Knapp, Johann Martin Augustin Scholz, and as recent as Karl Lachmann — whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the received text as used in churches.\n\nThese early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact collations of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the Bibliothèque Nationale, eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, Firmin Didot, several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the Vulgate. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.\n\nA great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the palimpsest \"Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus\", of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the Old Testament in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of Ephrem the Syrian, had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became \"professor extraordinarius\" at Leipzig, and where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish \"Reise in den Orient\", an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845–46, translated as \"Travels in the East\" in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the \"Archimedes Palimpsest\", which he donated to Cambridge.\n\nFrom Paris, he had paid short visits to the Netherlands (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to Egypt, Sinai, and the Levant, returning via Vienna and Munich.\n\nIn 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to Saint Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt, where he found the oldest complete known Bible. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony (reigned 1836-1854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at Leipzig University, also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put 2 of the leaves on display in 2011.\nTischendorf reported in his 1865 book \"Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst\", translated to English in 1866 as \"When Were Our Gospels Written\" in the section \"The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript\" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the University of Leipzig, under the title of the \"Codex Friderico-Augustanus\", a name given in honour of his patron, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.\n\nMany have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. J. Rendel Harris referred to the story as a \"myth\". The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. \nIn 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the \"Codex Frederico-Augustanus\" or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant — the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" — a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.\n\nTischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to Tsar Alexander II of Russia, at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those ignorant of the details of his discovery of the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant monastery librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a \"Schenkungsurkunde\". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the National Russian Library the existence cannot be disputed in earnest. In 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of \"von\" Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for the Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the Rus' state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.\n\nWhen the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the British Museum in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.\n\nIn the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled \"Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis\" appeared (translated as \"Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways\"), containing canons of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:\n\nBasic rule: \"The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and fathers.\"\nThese were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, \"to clear up in this way,\" he wrote, \"the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine apostolic text which is the foundation of our faith.\"\n\nIn 1850 appeared his edition of the \"Codex Amiatinus\" (in 1854 corrected) and of the Septuagint version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the \"Codex Claromontanus\".\n\nMeanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made \"professor ordinarius\" of theology and of Biblical paleography, this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, \"Aus dem heiligen Lande\", appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.\n\nBesides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both Robert Schumann, with whom he corresponded, and Felix Mendelssohn, who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague Samuel Prideaux Tregelles wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the University of Glasgow, where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.\n\nHe died in Leipzig.\n\nHis \"magnum opus\" was the \"Critical Edition of the New Testament.\"\n\nThe great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself \"editio viii\"; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from stereotype plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869–72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the Vatican manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend Samuel Prideaux Tregelles.\n\nOf relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the \"Codex Ephraemi\", and the \"Friderico-Augustanus\", was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of Eberhard Nestle's appendix to the 6th issue (1880).\n\nBesides this may be mentioned editions of the New Testament apocrypha, \"De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu\" (1851); \"Acta Apostolorum apocrypha\" (1851); \"Evangelia apocrypha\" (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); \"Apocalypses apocryphae\" (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as \"Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?\" (\"When Were Our Gospels Written?\"; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), \"Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?\" (1873), and \"Synopsis evangelica\" (7th ed., 1898).\n\n\n\n\n\nHis Publications continued:\n\n\nCooperation\n\n\nSecond Author:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It examines the nature, function, and impact of meditation and other contemplative practices in several different religious traditions, both eastern and western, including methods for incorporating contemplative practice into education, healthcare, and other human services. Edited by Thomas G. Plante and with a foreword by Huston Smith, the book was published in the United States by Prager in 2010. The book reviews evidences for health effects and includes 14 chapters divided among three major parts that focus on well-defined systems of practice, traditions as storehouses of many alternative forms of practice, and applications. It has been reviewed in several professional journals, including \"PsycCRITIQUES,\" and the \"Journal of Psychosocial Research\".\n\nThe book contains 14 chapters written by scholars in the health and behavioral sciences and religious studies. Chapter titles and authors are listed in the table (\"below, at right\"). Huston Smith's foreword describes the book as \"ecumenically inclusive,\" \"in line\" with Smith's own work. The editor's introductory chapter notes an increasing usage of meditative practices in health and human service practice, along with an increasing evidence base. It also acknowledges \"a number of books\" available on contemplative practices, but expresses concern that\n\n\"almost all [of the existing books] focus on one particular religious or spiritual tradition... Usually, they highlight the Eastern traditions and overlook the Western ones.\".The remaining 13 chapters are divided into three major parts, beginning with \nPart One, which examines well-defined \"systems\" of contemplative practice, such as Mindfulness-based stress reduction, Passage Meditation, and Centering Prayer. Part Two describes contemplative practices in Judaism, Islam (especially Sunni Islam), Yoga, and Zen, citing a growing empirical research literature that links better health to research on Yoga, Zen, and Islamic practice. Part Three emphasizes applications.\n\nReviews have appeared in \"PsycCRITIQUES\", \n\"Practical Matters\",\nthe \"Journal of Psychosocial Research\",\n\"Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies\",\n\"Psycho-Oncology\",\nand \"\".\n\nIn \"PsycCRITIQUES\", Edward F. Bourg stated that \"in a time full of sensory and information overload, this is a welcome book.\" While mindfulness \"has entered the popular imagination as a curative factor\" for health and well-being, this book shows that many other forms of contemplative practice are also being used successfully. The book's \"twofold\" premise is that both Eastern and Western traditions have a contemplative side, and \"Doing, not saying, is what counts.\" He stated that although generally \"the various chapters are very well integrated,\" the book \"isn’t seamless,\" and some Part III chapters analyze practices, such as lamentation and fire-walking, that \"are somewhat unusual... and... would appeal to very few of us.\"\n\nIn \"Practical Matters\", Eric J. Kyle of the Claremont School of Theology wrote that the book was \"a rich source of wisdom [on] the intersection of contemplative practices and... well-being. \" providing a \"robust introduction to the breadth of contemplative approaches\" from \"various religious traditions.\", although he wondered why there was no coverage of \"native or aboriginal spiritualities.\"\n\nIn the \"Journal of Psychosocial Research\", Uma Gupta of Banaras Hindu University stated that a \"strength of this book is its comprehensive identification of issues that are relevant to reducing hypertension in the present era that values speed, productivity and multitasking.\" To Gupta, the book provides \"excellent summaries of historical roots, current research, directions for future research and general applications of the contemplative practices from Eastern and Western religious and spiritual traditions.\" She also described the book as \"capable of transforming the life of the reader in making life more meaningful, purposeful and joyful.\"\n\nIn \"Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies\", KJ Sherman wrote that she found the book \"unsatisfying,\" since \"for many traditions, the studies reported seemed to focus on religious or mental health outcomes, rather than physical health.\" She found \"no logic to the traditions included,\" since they varied greatly in their level of empirical support, and would not recommend the book to healthcare providers or researchers. However, \"the description of the practices themselves\" may be useful to \"healthcare providers whose patient populations may embrace contemplative practices in the context of multiple spiritual traditions,\" and to \"religious scholars who want to understand how other practices may be similar to those of their tradition.\"\n\nIn \"Psycho-Oncology\", JL Kristeller stated that \"Even those familiar with selected contemplative traditions should find distinctive perspectives,\" and that the book \"lays out a surprising richness of resources related to engaging spiritual well-being though a world heritage of contemplative practices.\"\n\nIn \"Choice\", G. R. Thursby of the University of Florida wrote that the book was structured into \"a meaningful whole that can serve as a tool kit for health care professionals and enable religious leaders to find positive points of contact,\". He stated that \"among the best in the book\" are the three chapters about Easwaran's Passage Meditation, Keating's Centering Prayer, and Delbecq's meditation program for Silicon Valley leaders.\n\n"}
{"id": "505176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505176", "title": "Correspondence theory of truth", "text": "Correspondence theory of truth\n\nIn epistemology, the correspondence theory of truth states that the truth or falsity of a statement is determined only by how it relates to the world and whether it accurately describes (i.e., corresponds with) that world.\n\nCorrespondence theories claim that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs. This type of theory attempts to posit a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or facts on the other.\n\nCorrespondence theory is a traditional model which goes back at least to some of the ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined solely by how it relates to a reality; that is, by whether it accurately describes that reality. As Aristotle claims in his \"Metaphysics\": \"To say that that which is, is not, and that which is not, is, is a falsehood; therefore, to say that which is, is, and that which is not, is not, is true\".\n\nA classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the medieval philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas: \"Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus\" (\"Truth is the adequation of things and intellect\"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli.\n\nCorrespondence theory was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the early modern thinkers, including René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. (However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the coherence theory of truth.) Correspondence theory has also been attributed to Thomas Reid.\n\nIn late modern philosophy, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling espoused the correspondence theory. Karl Marx also subscribed to a version of the correspondence theory.\n\nIn contemporary Continental philosophy, Edmund Husserl defended the correspondence theory. In contemporary analytic philosophy, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, and Karl Popper defended the correspondence theory.\n\nBertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein have in different ways suggested that a statement, to be true, must have some kind of structural isomorphism with the state of affairs in the world that makes it true. For example, \"A cat is on a mat\" is true if, and only if, there is in the world a cat and a mat and the cat is related to the mat by virtue of being on it. If any of the three pieces (the cat, the mat, and the relation between them which correspond respectively to the subject, object, and verb of the statement) is missing, the statement is false. Some sentences pose difficulties for this model, however. As just one example, adjectives such as \"counterfeit\", \"alleged\", or \"false\" do not have the usual simple meaning of restricting the meaning of the noun they modify: a \"tall lawyer\" is a kind of lawyer, but an \"alleged lawyer\" may not be.\n\nIn 2018, Claudio Costa has developed a full-blooded version of the correspondence theory of truth. This version of the theory incorporates coherence and extends the idea of correspondence to formal sciences..\n\nJ. L. Austin theorized that there need not be any structural parallelism between a true statement and the state of affairs that makes it true. It is only necessary that the semantics of the language in which the statement is expressed are such as to correlate whole-for-whole the statement with the state of affairs. A false statement, for Austin, is one that is correlated by the language to a state of affairs that does not exist.\n\nHistorically, most advocates of correspondence theories have been metaphysical realists; that is, they believe that there is a world external to the minds of all humans. This is in contrast to metaphysical idealists who hold that everything that exists exists as a substantial metaphysical entity independently of the individual thing of which it is predicated, and also to conceptualists who hold that everything that exists is, in the end, just an idea in some mind. However, it is not strictly necessary that a correspondence theory be married to metaphysical realism. It is possible to hold, for example, that the facts of the world determine which statements are true and to also hold that the world (and its facts) is but a collection of ideas in the mind of some supreme being.\n\nOne attack on the theory claims that the correspondence theory succeeds in its appeal to the real world only in so far as the real world is reachable by us.\n\nThe direct realist believes that we directly know objects as they are. Such a person can wholeheartedly adopt a correspondence theory of truth.\n\nThe rigorous idealist believes that there are no real objects. The correspondence theory appeals to imaginary undefined entities, so it is incoherent.\n\nOther positions hold that we have some type of awareness, perception, etc. of real-world objects which in some way falls short of direct knowledge of them. But such an indirect awareness or perception is itself an idea in one's mind, so that the correspondence theory of truth reduces to a correspondence between ideas about truth and ideas of the world, whereupon it becomes a coherence theory of truth.\n\nEither the defender of the correspondence theory of truth offers some accompanying theory of the world, or he or she does not.\n\nIf no theory of the world is offered, the argument is so vague as to be useless or even unintelligible: truth would then be supposed to be correspondence to some undefined, unknown or ineffable world.\nIt is difficult to see how a candid truth could be more certain than the world we are to judge its degree of correspondence against.\n\nOn the other hand, as soon as the defender of the correspondence theory of truth offers a theory of the world, he or she is operating in some specific ontological or scientific theory, which stands in need of justification.\nBut the only way to support the truth of this theory of the world that is allowed by the correspondence theory of truth is correspondence to the real world. Hence the argument is circular.\n\n\n"}

Much of his work in philosophy was related to phenomenology, particularly the work of Edmund Husserl, many of whose writings he translated into English for the first time. He was longtime Professor of Philosophy at The University of Southern California in Los Angeles, teaching at the school from 1965 until his death in 2013 and serving as the department chair from 1982 to 1985.\n\nWillard attended William Jewell College, and later graduated from Tennessee Temple College in 1956 with a B.A. in Psychology, and from Baylor University in 1957 with a B.A. in Philosophy and Religion. He went to graduate school at Baylor University and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, earning a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Wisconsin with a minor in the History of Science in 1964.\n\nWillard spent five years teaching at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, first as a research and teaching assistant (1960–63), then as an Advanced Knapp Fellow (63-64), and finally as an instructor in philosophy (64-65). He then moved to the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, where he taught as an assistant professor (1965–69), as an associate professor (69-84), and finally as a full professor (1984–2013). He spent a total of 48 years at USC.\n\nHe served as director of the School of Philosophy at USC from 1982 to 1985, as well as visiting appointments at UCLA (1969) and the University of Colorado (1984).\n\nHis publications in philosophy are concerned primarily with epistemology, the philosophy of mind and of logic, and with the philosophy of Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology. He translated many of Husserl's early writings from German into English, and is widely regarded as an international authority on the philosopher's works, which span from the topics of time-consciousness to intentionality and intuition in Cartesian thought.\n\n\nIn addition to teaching and writing about philosophy, Willard gave lectures and wrote books about Christianity and Christian living. His book \"The Divine Conspiracy\" was \"Christianity Today\"’s Book of the Year for 1999. Another of his books, \"Renovation of the Heart\", won \"Christianity Today\"’s 2003 Book Award for books on Spirituality and The Association of Logos Bookstores' 2003 Book Award for books on Christian Living.\n\nWillard believed passivity to be a widespread problem in the Church (loosely summed up in his phrase \"Grace is not opposed to effort {which is action}, but to earning {which is attitude}\"). He emphasized the importance of deliberately choosing to be a disciple of Jesus Christ (someone being with Jesus, learning to be like him). An important outgrowth of the choice to be identified as a disciple of Jesus is the desire to learn about activities that aid spiritual transformation into the likeness of Christ.\n\nIn this regard, being an apprentice of Jesus (someone being with Jesus, learning to be like him), involves learning about activities that might help one grow in the fruit of the spirit, namely love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). Such activities might include spiritual exercises practiced throughout the ages such as prayer, fellowship, service, study, simplicity, chastity, solitude, and fasting. Willard explains the crucial role of engaging in spiritual exercises in his book \"The Spirit of the Disciplines: Understanding How God Changes Lives\"—a book that was written after \"In Search of Guidance: Developing a Conversational Relationship with God\".\n\nWillard has a recommended reading page on his website listing specific titles by Thomas a Kempis, William Law, Frank Laubach, William Wilberforce, Richard Baxter, Charles Finney, Jan Johnson, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Jeremy Taylor, Richard Foster, E. Stanley Jones, William Penn, Brother Lawrence, Francis de Sales, James Gilchrist Lawson, and others.\n\nHe was influenced by many, including Jacques Maritain, Aquinas, Augustine, P.T. Forsyth, John Calvin and John Wesley, William Law, Andrew Murray, Richard Baxter, Teresa of Avila, Francis de Sales, Brother Lawrence, and the Rule of St. Benedict.\n\nHe served on the boards of the C.S. Lewis Foundation and of Biola University. He also served on the board of the Templeton foundation, and on multiple evaluation committees for the Western Association of Schools and colleges.\n\nWillard was born in Buffalo, Missouri on September 4, 1935, the son of Albert Willard and Maymie Lindesmith. His mother died when he was 2 years old. He married Jane Lakes of Macon, Georgia, in 1955.

Libraries, in particular public libraries, and modern digital technology such as the internet play a key role, as they provide the masses with open access to information.\n\nThe printing press was one of the early steps towards the democratization of knowledge. Another small example of this during the Industrial Revolution was the creation of libraries for miners in some Scottish villages in the 18th century.\n\nWikipedia is rapidly turning into a real-time reference tool in which public entries can be updated by anyone at any time. This phenomenon—a product of the digital age—has greatly contributed to the democratization of knowledge in the post-modern era. At the same time, it has raised a number of valid criticisms in this regard (see Reliability of Wikipedia page). For instance, one could draw a distinction between the mere spread of information and the spread of \"accurate\" or \"credible\" information. Wikipedia may thus be a more reliable source of information in certain spheres, but not necessarily in others.\n\nThe democratization of technology has played a major facilitating role. Wikipedia co-founder, Larry Sanger, states in his article, that “Professionals are no longer needed for the bare purpose of the mass distribution of information and the shaping of opinion.” Sanger’s article confronts the existence of “common knowledge” and pits it against knowledge that everyone agrees on.\n\nIn terms of democratization of knowledge, Wikipedia has played a major role. For instance, Wikipedia has attracted 400 million viewers across the globe and has communicated with them in over 270 languages.\n\nGoogle Book Search has been pointed to as an example of democratization of knowledge, but Malte Herwig in Der Spiegel raised concerns that the virtual monopoly Google has in the search market, combined with Google's hiding of the details of its search algorithms, could undermine this move towards democratization.\n\nAn article written in 2005 by the editors of \"Reference & User Services Quarterly\" calls the library the greatest force for the democratization of knowledge or information. It continues to say that public libraries in particular are inextricably linked with the history and evolution of the United States, but school library media centers, college and university libraries, and special libraries have all also been inﬂuential in their support for democracy. Libraries play an essential role in the democratization of knowledge and information by providing communities with the resources and tools to find information free of charge. Democratic access to knowledge has also been co-opted to mean providing information in a variety of formats, which essentially means electronic and digital formats for use by library patrons. Public libraries help further the democratization of information by guaranteeing freedom of access to information, by providing an unbiased variety of information sources and access to government services, as well as the promotion of democracy and an active citizenship. Dan Cohen, the founding executive director of the Digital Public Library of America, writes that the democratic access to knowledge is a profound idea that requires constant tending and revitalization. In 2004, a World Social Forum and International workshop was held entitled \"Democratization of Information: Focus on Libraries\". The focus of the forum was to bring awareness to the social, technological, and financial challenges facing libraries dealing with the democratization of information. Social challenges included globalization and the digital divide, technological challenges included information sources, and financial challenges constituted shrinking budgets and manpower. Longtime Free Library of Philadelphia director Elliot Shelkrot said that “Democracy depends on an informed population. And where can people get all the information they need? —At the Library.” \n\n"}
{"id": "36681813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36681813", "title": "Drexel 4257", "text": "Drexel 4257\n\nDrexel 4257, also known by an inscription on its first page, \"John Gamble, his booke, amen 1659\" is a music manuscript commonplace book. It is the largest collection of English songs from the first half to the middle of the 17th century, and is an important source for studying vocal music in its transition from Renaissance music to Baroque music in England. Many songs also provide commentary on contemporary political events leading up to the Restoration.\n\nBelonging to the New York Public Library, it forms part of the Music Division's Drexel Collection, located at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Following traditional library practice, its name is derived from its call number.\n\nBefore researchers took active interest in it, the field of 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian Charles Burney had a negative opinion towards British vocal music in this period. That attitude was carried through the beginning of the 20th century, where in the first edition of the \"Oxford History of Music\", Hubert Parry stated that English composers' sense of musical line was deficient.\n\nVincent Duckles thought one reason for the negative attitude might have been the lack of published sources: Between 1627 (the publication date of John Hilton's \"Ayres or Fa-las\") and 1651 (John Playford's \"Musical Banquet\"), there appeared only a single publication of British vocal music: Walter Porter's \"Madrigales and Ayres\" of 1632.\n\nScholarly work on Drexel 4257 was one of the major reasons for a change in attitude. With over 320 songs, 250 of which contain music, it is \"the largest single body of early 17th-century English songs that we know.\" \"The composers ... all belonged to the small world of court musicians that suffered disruption during the English Civil War and the Commonwealth of England. Some began their careers late in the reign of James I, most saw service in court of Charles I, and a few survived to return to their posts at the invitation of Charles II.\" For the most part, their active careers were over by 1660 or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe compiler (or compilers) was not an antiquarian: this collection of songs was intended for practical use, and represents the generation of English composers active between 1630 and1660. As such, Drexel 4257 \"stands as the record of English musical and literary taste as it developed over a period of some thirty years,\" moving from the late Jacobean era to Restoration periods. Though its musical contents may sometimes be variable, its main interest is that, as a document of its time, it reflects contemporary taste, offering comments on contemporary events and references to the past.\n\nBy virtue of its repertoire and of the period covered, Drexel 4257 is closely related to other 17th-century English music manuscripts: 2240 (British Library Deposit), Drexel 4041 (New York Public Library), Don.c.57 (Bodleian Library), Add. 29,396 (British Library), Add. 11,608 (British Library), MS B.1 (Bodleian Library), Add. 31432 (British Library), Add. 10337 (British Library), F.5.13 (Trinity College, Dublin), Egerton 2013 (British Library), Drexel 4175 (New York Public Library), Add 29381 (British Library), MS 1041 (Lambeth Palace Library), and MS 87 (Christ Church Library).\n\nThe binding of Drexel 4257 measures . It contains 227 leaves which measure (the leaves' varying length can add or subtract several millimeters to their respective measurement). \nAs the image at left indicates, the volume was rebound on December 6, 1944 by Neumann Leathers of Hoboken, New Jersey. The folios are not numbered, but each song is numbered. Using different methods of enumeration, scholars have disagreed on how many songs are contained in the manuscript. Hughes wrote that the collection contained 246 songs, 146 of which are by unidentified composers, but he was only counting songs with \"a musical setting sufficiently complete to make identification possible.\" Duckles claimed there were 325 different songs numbered 1 through 329: two songs occur twice (\"Keepe on yor vayle and hide yor Eye\" nos. 134 and 237, and \"If thou wilt loue me I'le loue thee\" nos. 174 and 215). Additionally, nos. 275 (\"Stay, stay, prate noe more\") and 324 (\"I haue reason to Fly thee\") are satirical replies to anti-Royalist lyrics not included in the manuscript. No. 206 is blank and not identified in the index, and the song \"Why sligh'stt thou her whome I aproue\" is both nos. 222 and 223. There are also two songs listed in the index for which no space was allotted. For Duckles, eighty-five of the 325 songs are lacking music and have either just titles, or titles and lyrics only. Elise Bickford Jorgens counted 327 songs, including songs listed in at least one of the two tables of contents but for which there is no music. (This article and the table below uses Jorgens' enumeration.)\n\nThe breakdown of the 97 songs by known composers is as follows: John Gamble (28), Henry Lawes (28), William Lawes (10), John Wilson (11), William Webb (8), Thomas Brewer (3), Robert Smith (2), Nicholas Lanier (2), Walter Youckney (2), Robert Johnson (1), John Withy (1), and Charles Coleman (1).\n\nFolio 1 verso contains a bawdy lyric followed by the inscription written twice, \"John Gamble his booke amen 1-6-5-9 an[n]o Domini.\" The material on Folio 2 recto is from a later date. The upper half of the page contains an engraved portrait of Gamble, printed by W. Richardson in 1795, pasted in. The lower portion contains a brief biographical inscription concerning Gamble in the hand of the former owner, Edward F. Rimbault. A note giving a brief description of the contents has been tipped in near the center of the binding.\n\nThere are two tables of contents. The first, with the heading \"The Cattalogue\" on folios 3r-5r, is a numbered list of songs from 1 through 266. Starting with song no. 201, the style of enumeration varies inconsistently: no. 201 is listed as 2001, 220 is listed as 20020. Additionally, there is a group of songs incorrectly altered to 300s. The second table, on folios 5v-8r, has no heading but is an alphabetical grouping of songs where in each letter the songs are listed sequentially. This list was apparently compiled after the manuscript was completed and includes all songs except nos. 314-317. It is written by the same hand as the enumerator of songs 177-266 in \"The Cattalogue.\"\n\nThe manuscript as currently bound (the date accompanying the binding information on the inside rear cover is stamped Dec. 6, 1944) has some songs out of sequence (nos. 331-340), surrounded by no. 311 and 312.\n\nThe date of 1659 (from Gamble's inscription on 1v) has been a source of puzzlement to those who have studied the manuscript. Willa McClung Evans, consulting Edward Heawood's study of watermarks (used to date paper), noted the watermark, a fleur-de-lis, was of undetermined origin, but was also used in Fuller's \"Holy State\" of 1652, and Denis Petau \"History of the World\" of 1659. Charles W. Hughes believed the book was begun around the turn of the 17th century - a hypothesis rejected by Jorgens who notes that it contains works by Henry Lawes, born in 1596. Hughes believed the terminal date was at least 1660, as some of the songs refer to Charles II who assumed the throne in 1660. Duckles noted that the earliest lyrics were from \"England's Helicon\" (1600) and \"Davison's Poetical Rhapsody\" (1602). Duckles felt that 1659 is close to the terminal date, noting that no songs had been added after the Commonwealth period, and no younger composers were included in the collection.\n\nThough writers disagree on details of the handwriting (see the section on handwriting below), they all agree that the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given that there is a concentration of his work in that part of the manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on 30 June 1680, in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.\n\nAfter Gamble's death in 1687, nothing is known of the manuscript for over 150 years. The first published reference to it comes in 1846, where it is mentioned in volume 19 of the Percy Society's \"Early English Poetry, Ballads, and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages\" as being in the possession of one of the editors of the series, Edward Francis Rimbault. An organist and musicologist, Rimbault took a keen interest in English music and voraciously collected rare books, scores, and valuable manuscripts. Upon his death, his extensive and valuable library was auctioned by Sotheby's over the course of five days. The Rimbault auction catalog entry for the Gamble manuscript reads:\n\nA collection of upwards of 300 songs by Wilson, Lawes, Johnson, Gamble, and other English composers, containing also the autograph inscription, \"John Gamble his book, Amen. 1659 Anno Domini\"\n\nHughes quotes a contemporaneous report of the hammer price and comment: \"Thirteen guineas, for America.\" The reference was to the Philadelphia-born financier Joseph W. Drexel who had already amassed a large music library and purchased about 300 lots from the Rimbault auction. Upon Drexel's death, he bequeathed his music library to The Lenox Library. When the Lenox Library merged with the Astor Library to become the New York Public Library, the Drexel Collection became the basis for one of its founding units, the Music Division. Today, Drexel 4257 is part of the Drexel Collection in the Music Division, now located at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.\n\nDuckles noted that there are subsidiary groups organized by composer: Henry Lawes (nos. 26-36), William Webb (nos. 160-166), Robert Smith (nos. 237-238),Thomas Brewer (nos. 244-245), Robert Johnson (nos. 108-109), and John Gamble (nos. 292-319). Similarly is the group of three songs set by John Wilson for Richard Brome's play \"The Northern Lass\" (nos. 45, 46, and 47).\n\nThe first 47 songs are love lyrics by poets of the Jacobean Court including Ben Jonson, William Shakespeare, Robert Herrick, Thomas Carew, John Suckling, Beaumont and Fletcher. After no. 47 a new spirit is suggested by song no. 48 \"You madcapps of England that merry will make,\" a lusty drinking song that indicates a political shift after 1640. Deliberate segregation is in evidence between songs nos. 48 and 80, where there are a series of 32 ballads and popular songs, in contrast to the art lyrics of the first few songs. There is a brief return to the elevated nature in songs nos. 154-76. Thereafter, popular and sophisticated songs are mixed.\n\nHughes and Duckles both believed that the manuscript was written by at least two individuals. Hughes characterized the first hand as a \"neater, older hand\" dating from either at the end of the 16th century or beginning of the 17th century (a date disputed by subsequent writers - see above). The second hand copied the newer songs (including some by Gamble) and were written in a more careless hand. Hughes believed that this evidence suggested that the manuscript was begun by an unidentified person and was continued by John Gamble himself commencing with song no. 177.\n\nFollowing Hughes's view, Duckles also believed the manuscript was written in two hands. In his view, the first hand wrote the titles for songs nos. 1-176 of the Cattalogue, and the second hand, probably that of Gamble himself, wrote of nos. 177-266 (leaving space left to accommodate future additions) as well as the alphabetical index. Duckles described the writing style of Hand 1 as favoring \"round, compact letter forms, vertical alignment, calligraphic flourishes on capitals and heavy down strokes,\" when writing with a broad pen. Duckles admits that Hand 1 has \"two forms\": \"When the hand writes with a finer quill, the letter forms are more loosely connected, the flourishes a little more pronounced, and there is a slight inclination to the right.\" Hand no. 2 has a \"pronounced slant to the right, letter forms are thin and elongated and the pen is a fine one.\" Duckles observed that hand no. 2 participated slightly in the preparation of part 1 (nos. 1-176) with only six songs, but all of the text incipits. Likes Hughes, Duckles also felt that Hand 2 is probably that of Gamble.\n\nDuckles hypothesized that the first hand might have been that of Ambrose Beeland, with whom Gamble apprenticed and is believed to have been his teacher. Lynn Hulse refutes this, saying that the handwriting does not match existing Beeland manuscripts.\n\nJorgens disagreed with both Hughes and Duckles and saw three different hands. Based on the two tables of contents, Jorgens surmised that all three copyists had access to the book at one time. She characterized the first hand as \"firm, bold but well-controlled secretary hand,\" the second hand as \"looser and somewhat lighter secretary hand\" beginning with song no. 38, and a third hand, \"rougher, slanted, inclined towards the Italian style\" that begins with song no. 46. All three roughly equal; by no. 177 the first two have dropped out. Hand Three has entered all of Gamble's songs and is probably his. It also has entered text incipits. Since these incipits do not correspond with other known songs, they are probably the work of Gamble.\n\nHulse identified the first hand of the Gamble manuscript is probably that of poet Thomas Jordan (ca. 1612–1685), the same hand as manuscript PwV18 in the University of Nottingham, as well as other Jordan manuscripts in Harvard University and Bodleian Library. Hulse showed that Jordan and Gamble were involved in the same London circle of theatre musicians and composers for many years, culminating in Jordan's preface for Gamble's \"A Defence for Musick\" published in 1659. She identifies songs nos. 4, 16, 32, 45, 47, 99, 154, 155, 169, 170, 175, 176 and the text incipit of 96 as being copied by Jordan.\n\nThe lyrics to a number of songs have references to contemporary politics and events. \"Since Itt hath bin lately inacted high Treason\" (no. 313) carries a strong suggestion of reaction to contemporary British history. One song, \"Beat on, proud billows,\" was known to have been written by Roger L'Estrange while he was imprisoned in Newgate Prison during Oliver Cromwell's rule (1645–1648).\n\nSome songs express regret for a better past. \"Listen iolly gentlemen Listen & be merry\" (no. 63) praises the reign of Charles I (indirectly criticizing the then-current regime). The lyric of \"Reioyce all England\" contrasts the 13th-century hero Guy of Warwick with current rulers. One song alludes to the marital difficulties between Charles II and his Portuguese wife, Catherine of Braganza. Another example of distrust of foreigners can be seen in the lyric \"Harke harke Ile tell you news from the Cort ... all ye french ... now are all sent back to France.\" Charles II also figures in \"God bless our noble king,\" which comically describes the king's progress from Whitehall to St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n\"You madcaps of England\" describes frivolous English soldiers at the Siege of La Rochelle, including characters named \"Wentworth\" (referring to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford) and \"Murrey\" (referring to Robert Moray). Other names mentioned include: Wilmot, Weston, George Symon, Steadlinge, Hugh Pollerd, and \"Game\" possibly John Gamble.\n\nSome songs reveal prejudice against Puritans. No. 92, \"\"Cock Lorrell inuited ye diuell his gestt,\" concerns Cock Lavorel, known as a rogue and highway robber, as friends with the devil. \"The purelings of the Citty\" (no. 70) is an exception, praising a Protestant service.\n\nDuckles took note of the bold lyrics to song no. 73:\n\n\"Ye giddy poets that purloin <br>from sea and land the greatest store <br>to deck her ffading wenches fine, <br>what would you do with such a whore?\" \n\nDuckles clarified the meaning: \"The outspoken vulgarity was not necessarily result of personal taste but a reflection of Royalist protest against Puritan morality, intended to shock the taste of Parliamentarians.\"\n\nHughes argued that, unlike a textbook compilation of exemplars, Drexel 4257 shows a variety of good and mediocre poetry. Most songs deal with love, and range from flowery rhetoric to frank accounts of love-making. A few, however, deal with topical matters. There are two songs related to Christmas: \"Beate upp a dromm\" depicts feasters in a mock battle with the cold in which the feasters win, and \"Christmas is my name ffar have I gone\" was a popular ballad which appeared in a number of 17th-century sources. In this song, the personification of Christmas comes from far away to discover that his friends and other residents have deserted the country in favor of the city. The song concludes with a lament that universal welcome is gone because the Protestants and Puritans disassociate themselves from Christmas. Similarly (with fewer political overtones), the song \"Ladies you loose yor time\" expresses preference for city life over that of the country.\n\nThe song \"Oh yt mine eyes\", a graphic meditation on the Crucifixion of Jesus, is the only song in the collection to deal with a religious subject.\n\nThe song \"Nor loue nor fate dare I\" by John Wilson bears the inscription \"composed for the comedy \"The Northern Lass\"\". Although this is the only song that the manuscript indicates is from a drama, at least 26 songs have texts from dramas or masques, attesting to Gamble's association with the theatre.\n\nThe songs composed by Gamble are best characterized as drolls. Drolls were collections of \"cavalier wit, much of it trivial, repetitious and derivative, but at the same time containing some work of genuine literary value. Their tone was seldom dignified, often frankly sexual, and characterized by a persistent undertone of anti-Puritan feeling.\" Similar examples can be found in the work of Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew and John Suckling.\n\nHughes cursorily observed that Drexel 4257 contains no naturals—sharps are used to cancel flats, and flats are used to cancel sharps. He noted that technical blunders such as parallel fifths and octaves are to be found as well as other kinds of mistakes.\n\nDuckles's dissertation explores the transition from the lute song, representing an older style of composition appropriate to the waning of Renaissance music, to the continuo song, reflecting newer Baroque music practice. It's not always an easy form of composition to assess: lutes were not always used for songs, and sometimes were used even after ascendancy of the continuo song. General characteristics of the lute song are smooth, flowing, and restrained lines, while the continuo song is more vigorous, abrupt and discontinuous. The harmonies in lute songs are an outgrowth of their melodic lines, while in continuo songs they define the structure. Lute songs tend to be loose and melismatic with frequent repetitions of verse fragments, while continuo songs are more closely tied to the rhythm of the text. Dissonance and chromaticism are used sparingly in lute songs while continuo songs show increasing use of chromaticism for more dramatic rather than pictorial underscoring. Generally, English composers were more concerned with capturing verbal rhythms than producing dramatic effects.(Hughes noted that Restoration lyrics typified Baroque figures of speech in their use of florid lyrics.) Use of these techniques in England indicate their adoption from Italy, where they were first used. Previously, it had been thought that English composers either didn't know about them, or weren't interested. But a comparison of Drexel 4257 with another of Gamble's books in the British Library, Additional 11608, where some of the songs appear in an embellished form, indicate that British composers and singers did occasionally adopt a more florid style.\n\nDuckles examined the song \"If Loue loues truth then woemen doe not loue\" by Thomas Campion which appears as no. 10 of Drexel 4257 and was also published in Campion's \"Third Book of Ayres\" from about 1617. Campion was generally a conservative composer. In the version present in Drexel 4257, the melody is slightly altered to provide greater sensitivity to the declamatory text, so that the speed of the verse accelerates naturally, an alteration which Duckles finds an improvement over the original. Many songs are recitative-like. In some of these songs, the bar is enlarged as it approaches the cadence, suggesting a ballad singer who briefly pauses to catch his breath. The hemiola a consistent practice in English music of this time.\n\nMany songs are 6/4 meter, while some suggest that they are adaptations from violin tunes. Yet, the barline does not always reflect the verbal rhythm. In comparing the song \"Ballowe my babe lye still and sleepe\", no. 46 of Drexel 4257, with the version that appears in Elizabeth Roger's Virginal Book, Duckles notes that the (earlier) virginal version is in duple meter with no trace of hemiolas, while the version in the Gamble manuscript has them, suggesting a modernization of an older song. Another example of continuo style is \"Like Hermitt poore in pensiue place obscure\" (no. 15), a lyric attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh and dating from 1591. In comparing Alfonso Ferrabosco's setting from his Ayres of 1609 to one by Nicolas Lanier in Drexel 4257, Duckles admits the possibility that Lanier's may have been inspired by that of Ferrabosco. But the musical characteristics of the Lanier setting, including simplicity of texture, distinct phrases, use of an échappée, and the suggestion of a rhythmic motif through use of a recurring pattern of eighth notes, point to contemporary text setting techniques. The song \"Drowsie sun, why dostt thou stay\" by Thomas Brewer (no. 253) shows expressive false relations and harmonic word painting, foreshadowing later developments in British sacred music. Brewer's songs are among the earliest examples of the Italian pathetic style in English music and represent the mature style of continuo song. Devices such as an octave leap look away from lute song to continuo song.\n\nNot all songs with recitative-like musical lines indicate modernism.There are dance songs that contain elements of an ostinato bass, passamezzo antico and the romanesca—all characteristics of Renaissance rather than Baroque periods. Several tunes and texts are of 16th-century origin had long been in the repertoire, among them: \"Greensleeves,\" \"O mistress mine,\" and \"Back and sides go bare.\" With these exceptions, the earliest songs date from Jacobean period. A comparison with anthologies published by John Playford in 1652, 1653 and 1659 indicates particular songs were popular. That selections were copied into the book attests to their popularity even after tastes had changed due to the Restoration. Similarly, the song \"I went from England into ffrance,\" a satirical narrative, refers to the song \"John Dory,\" indicating that song's continued popularity. (It had appeared in Thomas Ravenscroft's \"Deuteromelia\" of 1609, though probably dates earlier). \"When ye Chill Charockoe blowes\" is a song containing both declamatory and tuneful styles. It is a drinking song, whose erratic harmony suggests frequent cadences, and whose angular melody which \"moves with great vigor,\" This is in contradistinction to the lute song that emphasized continuous flow and smooth melodic motion.\n\nDuckles identifies two styles of songs of the collection: \"The declamatory air\" (reflecting modern style), and \"the tuneful air\" (reflecting the older style, a vestige of Renaissance musical practice). The tuneful air could be composed based on a preexisting tune or a tune intended to be a dance form. In examining lyric forms, Duckles identified the ballad as one type of lute song. The ballads found in Drexel 4257 are all of a sophisticated type in which satire and parody are important elements. The ballad as simple narrative or topical ballad are not represented.\n\nWarning that one must be wary of the fluid nature of musical genres, Duckles categorized the following songs from Drexel 4257 as ballads: 46, 48, 49, 51, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 70, 74, 76, 79, 92, 103, 104, 105, 116, 119, 120, 121, 123, 131, 142, 144, 145, 146, 147, 186, 214, 271, 272.\n\nDuckles identified these songs as being in the declamatory style: 4, 12, 15, 20, 22, 26, 30, 31, 33, 83, 89, 108, 132, 160, 161, 162, 164, 168, 172, 182, 188, 198, 206, 238, 239, 240, 243, 247, 249, 253, 256, 260, 261, 262, 269, 274, 277, 280, 284, 285, 292, 299, 306, 311, 315, 316, 317, 323, 326.\n\nDuckles observes that by 1651, the transition from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.\n\nIn his dissertation, Duckles summed up Gamble and his manuscript:\n\nThis table is based on the table of contents listed in Jorgens, supplemented with composer, lyricist attributions and other remarks from Duckles 1953.\n\nA facsimile of the manuscript was published as \"Drexel Ms. 4257: John Gamble, \"His booke, amen 1659\"\", in \"English Song, 1600–1675: Facsimiles of Twenty-Six Manuscripts and an Edition of the Texts\", vol. 10 (), by Garland Publishing of New York in 1987, with an introduction by Elise Bickford Jorgens.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2467608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2467608", "title": "Friday Fast", "text": "Friday Fast\n\nThe Friday Fast is a Christian practice of abstaining from animal meat on Fridays, or holding a fast on Fridays, that is found most frequently in the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Methodist traditions. According to Pope Peter of Alexandria, the Friday fast is done in commemoration of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on Good Friday. Abstinence is colloquially referred to as \"fasting\" although it does not necessarily involve a reduction in the quantity of food.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, specific regulations are passed by individual episcopates. In the United States in 1966, the USCCB passed Norms II and IV that bound all persons from age fourteen to abstain from meat on Fridays of Lent and through the year. In September 1983, Canons 1252 and 1253 expressed this same rule, and added that Bishops may permit substitution of other penitential practices, but that some form of penance shall be observed on Friday in commemoration of the day of the week of the Lord's Crucifixion.\n\nMost episcopal conferences have not allowed to substitute a different penance for Fridays of \"Lent\", though e. g. the German one has; no episcopal conference has lifted either fasting or abstinence for Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. Abstinence on all Fridays is still the preferred practice among many Catholics.\n\nCurrent practice of fast and abstinence is regulated by Canons 1250–1253 of the 1983 code. They specify that all Fridays throughout the year, and the time of Lent are penitential times throughout the entire Church. All adults (those who have attained the 'age of majority', which is 18 years in canon law) are bound by law to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday until the beginning of their sixtieth year. All persons who have completed their fourteenth year are bound by the law of abstinence on all Fridays unless they are solemnities, and again on Ash Wednesday; but in practice this requirement has been greatly reduced by the Episcopal Conferences because under Canon 1253, it is these Conferences that have the authority to set down the local norms for fasting and abstinence in their territories. (However, the precept to both fast and abstain on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday is usually not dispensed from.)\n\nAbsent any specification of the nature of \"fasting\" in the current Canon Law, the traditional definition is obviously applicable here which is that on the days of mandatory fasting, Catholics may eat only one full meal during the day. Additionally, they may eat up to two small meals or snacks, known as \"collations\". Church requirements on fasting only relate to solid food, not to drink, so Church law does not restrict the amount of water or other beverages – even alcoholic drinks – which may be consumed.\n\n\"The General Rules of the Methodist Church,\" written by the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, wrote that \"It is expected of all who desire to continue in these societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation, by attending upon all the ordinances of God, such are: the public worship of God; the ministry of the Word, either read or expounded; the Supper of the Lord; family and private prayer; searching the Scriptures; and fasting or abstinence.\" The Directions Given to Band Societies (25 December 1744) mandated fasting on all Fridays of the year, a practice that was reemphasized by Phoebe Palmer and became standard in the Methodist churches of the holiness movement. The Methodist tradition encourages its adherents to fast on Fridays, especially on those during the Lenten season.\n\nJohn Wesley required fasting on both Wednesdays (in remembrance of the Betrayal of Christ) and Fridays (in remembrance of His crucifixion and death) for those seeking holy orders.\n\nAnglican formularies, particularly the Book of Common Prayer, have generally required abstinence from meat on Fridays, though it is difficult to gauge how widely followed this practice has been among Anglicans. The wording in the 1928 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church describes \"All the Fridays in the Year, except Christmas Day and the Epiphany, or any Friday which may intervene between these Feasts\" as days \"on which the church requires such a measure of abstinence as is more especially suited to extraordinary acts and exercises of devotion\".\n\n\n"}

In 1791 he became the chief civil magistrate of Trento. In the late 18th and early 19th century Trento was successively under the rule of France, Italy and Austria. In 1799 Romagnosi was arrested in Innsbruck during fifteen months by the Austrians on account of his alleged sympathy with the French, but he was acquitted. In 1801 the French occupied Trento, and he was raised to the position of Secretary of the Higher Council. He was successively professor of law at Parma, Pavia, Pisa and Milan. After the fall of Napoleon he lost his position at the Milan university, but continued to lecture till 1817. In 1818 he was again tried for treason at Venice, and again acquitted. Carlo Cattaneo was his student and he was largely influenced by his thought.\nHe died in Milan in 1835.\n\nHis most celebrated work is \"Introduzione allo studio del diritto pubblico universale\" (2 vols., Parma, 1805).\n\nAlthough Romagnosi was not a scientist, he made some experiments with a voltaic pile and its influence on a compass. He published two accounts of his findings in 1802, in Italian newspapers. It is sometimes assumed that he found a relationship between electricity and magnetism, about two decades before Hans Christian Ørsted's 1820 discovery of electromagnetism. However, his experiments did not deal with electric currents, and only showed that an electrostatic charge from a voltaic pile could deflect a magnetic needle. \nHowever, as Joseph Hamel has pointed out, Romagnosi's discovery was documented in the book by Joseph Izarn, \"Manuel du Galvanisme\" (1805), where a galvanic current (\"courant galvanique\") is explicitly mentioned. \nIt was also mentioned on page 340 of the book by Giovanni Aldini, \"Essai théorique et expérimental sur le Galvanisme\" (1804): \"Cette nouvelle propriété du galvanisme a été constatée par d'autres observateurs, et dernièrement par M. Romanesi, physicien. de Trente, qui a reconnu que le galvanisme faisait décliner l'aiguille aimantée.\" Aldini was also communicating with Ørsted at the time, Hamel notes.\n"}

By 'middle term' I mean that which both is contained in another and contains another in itself, and which is the middle by its position also; and by 'extremes' (a) that which is contained in another, and (b) that in which another is contained. For if \"A\" is predicated of all \"B\", and \"B\" of all \"C\", \"A\" must necessarily be predicated of all \"C\". ... I call this kind of figure the First. (Aristotle, \"Prior Analytics\", 1.4)\n\nInductive reasoning consists in establishing a relation between one extreme term and the middle term by means of the other extreme; for example, if \"B\" is the middle term of \"A\" and \"C\", in proving by means of \"C\" that \"A\" applies to \"B\"; for this is how we effect inductions. (Aristotle, \"Prior Analytics\", 2.23)\nThe \"locus classicus\" for the study of abductive reasoning is found in Aristotle's \"Prior Analytics\", Book 2, Chapt. 25. It begins this way:\n\nWe have Reduction (απαγωγη, abduction):\nFor in all such cases the effect is to bring us nearer to knowledge.\nBy way of explanation, Aristotle supplies two very instructive examples, one for each of the two varieties of abductive inference steps that he has just described in the abstract:\n\nAristotle's latter variety of abductive reasoning, though it will take some explaining in the sequel, is well worth our contemplation, since it hints already at streams of inquiry that course well beyond the syllogistic source from which they spring, and into regions that Peirce will explore more broadly and deeply.\n\nIn the pragmatic philosophies of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others, inquiry is closely associated with the normative science of logic. In its inception, the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry was extracted by Peirce from its raw materials in classical logic, with a little bit of help from Kant, and refined in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic by Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce himself to address problems about the nature and conduct of scientific reasoning. Borrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in inquiry, commonly known as abductive, deductive, and inductive inference.\n\nIn rough terms, \"abduction\" is what we use to generate a likely hypothesis or an initial diagnosis in response to a phenomenon of interest or a problem of concern, while \"deduction\" is used to clarify, to derive, and to explicate the relevant consequences of the selected hypothesis, and \"induction\" is used to test the sum of the predictions against the sum of the data. It needs to be observed that the classical and pragmatic treatments of the types of reasoning, dividing the generic territory of inference as they do into three special parts, arrive at a different characterization of the environs of reason than do those accounts that count only two.\n\nThese three processes typically operate in a cyclic fashion, systematically operating to reduce the uncertainties and the difficulties that initiated the inquiry in question, and in this way, to the extent that inquiry is successful, leading to an increase in knowledge or in skills.\n\nIn the pragmatic way of thinking everything has a purpose, and the purpose of each thing is the first thing we should try to note about it. The purpose of inquiry is to reduce doubt and lead to a state of belief, which a person in that state will usually call \"knowledge\" or \"certainty\". As they contribute to the end of inquiry, we should appreciate that the three kinds of inference describe a cycle that can be understood only as a whole, and none of the three makes complete sense in isolation from the others. For instance, the purpose of abduction is to generate guesses of a kind that deduction can explicate and that induction can evaluate. This places a mild but meaningful constraint on the production of hypotheses, since it is not just any wild guess at explanation that submits itself to reason and bows out when defeated in a match with reality. In a similar fashion, each of the other types of inference realizes its purpose only in accord with its proper role in the whole cycle of inquiry. No matter how much it may be necessary to study these processes in abstraction from each other, the integrity of inquiry places strong limitations on the effective modularity of its principal components.\n\nIn \"Logic: The Theory of Inquiry\", John Dewey defined inquiry as \"the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole\" Dewey and Peirce's conception of inquiry extended beyond a system of thinking and incorporated the social nature of inquiry. These ideas are summarize in the notion Community of inquiry.\n\nFor our present purposes, the first feature to note in distinguishing the three principal modes of reasoning from each other is whether each of them is exact or approximate in character. In this light, deduction is the only one of the three types of reasoning that can be made exact, in essence, always deriving true conclusions from true premises, while abduction and induction are unavoidably approximate in their modes of operation, involving elements of fallible judgment in practice and inescapable error in their application.\n\nThe reason for this is that deduction, in the ideal limit, can be rendered a purely internal process of the reasoning agent, while the other two modes of reasoning essentially demand a constant interaction with the outside world, a source of phenomena and problems that will no doubt continue to exceed the capacities of any finite resource, human or machine, to master. Situated in this larger reality, approximations can be judged appropriate only in relation to their context of use and can be judged fitting only with regard to a purpose in view.\n\nA parallel distinction that is often made in this connection is to call deduction a \"demonstrative\" form of inference, while abduction and induction are classed as \"non-demonstrative\" forms of reasoning. Strictly speaking, the latter two modes of reasoning are not properly called inferences at all. They are more like controlled associations of words or ideas that just happen to be successful often enough to be preserved as useful heuristic strategies in the repertoire of the agent. But non-demonstrative ways of thinking are inherently subject to error, and must be constantly checked out and corrected as needed in practice.\n\nIn classical terminology, forms of judgment that require attention to the context and the purpose of the judgment are said to involve an element of \"art\", in a sense that is judged to distinguish them from \"science\", and in their renderings as expressive judgments to implicate arbiters in styles of rhetoric, as contrasted with logic.\n\nIn a figurative sense, this means that only deductive logic can be reduced to an exact theoretical science, while the practice of any empirical science will always remain to some degree an art.\n\nMany aspects of inquiry can be recognized and usefully studied in very basic logical settings, even simpler than the level of syllogism, for example, in the realm of reasoning that is variously known as \"Boolean algebra\", \"propositional calculus\", \"sentential calculus\", or \"zeroth-order logic\". By way of approaching the learning curve on the gentlest availing slope, we may well begin at the level of \"zeroth-order inquiry\", in effect, taking the syllogistic approach to inquiry only so far as the propositional or sentential aspects of the associated reasoning processes are concerned. One of the bonuses of doing this in the context of Peirce's logical work is that it provides us with doubly instructive exercises in the use of his logical graphs, taken at the level of his so-called \"alpha graphs\".\n\nIn the case of propositional calculus or sentential logic, deduction comes down to applications of the transitive law for conditional implications and the approximate forms of inference hang on the properties that derive from these. In describing the various types of inference I will employ a few old \"terms of art\" from classical logic that are still of use in treating these kinds of simple problems in reasoning.\n\nFor ease of reference, Figure 1 and the Legend beneath it\nsummarize the classical terminology for the three types\nof inference and the relationships among them.\nIn its original usage a statement of Fact has to do with a deed done or a record made, that is, a type of event that is openly observable and not riddled with speculation as to its very occurrence. In contrast, a statement of Case may refer to a hidden or a hypothetical cause, that is, a type of event that is not immediately observable to all concerned. Obviously, the distinction is a rough one and the question of which mode applies can depend on the points of view that different observers adopt over time. Finally, a statement of a Rule is called that because it states a regularity or a regulation that governs a whole class of situations, and not because of its syntactic form. So far in this discussion, all three types of constraint are expressed in the form of conditional propositions, but this is not a fixed requirement. In practice, these modes of statement are distinguished by the roles that they play within an argument, not by their style of expression. When the time comes to branch out from the syllogistic framework, we will find that propositional constraints can be discovered and represented in arbitrary syntactic forms.\n\nExamples of inquiry, that illustrate the full cycle of its abductive, deductive, and inductive phases, and yet are both concrete and simple enough to be suitable for a first (or zeroth) exposition, are somewhat rare in Peirce's writings, and so let us draw one from the work of fellow pragmatician John Dewey, analyzing it according to the model of zeroth-order inquiry that we developed above.\n\nA man is walking on a warm day. The sky was clear the last time he observed it; but presently he notes, while occupied primarily with other things, that the air is cooler. It occurs to him that it is probably going to rain; looking up, he sees a dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then quickens his steps. What, if anything, in such a situation can be called thought? Neither the act of walking nor the noting of the cold is a thought. Walking is one direction of activity; looking and noting are other modes of activity. The likelihood that it will rain is, however, something \"suggested\". The pedestrian \"feels\" the cold; he \"thinks of\" clouds and a coming shower. (John Dewey, \"How We Think\", 1910, pp. 6-7).\nLet's first give Dewey's example of inquiry in everyday life the quick once over, hitting just the high points of its analysis into Peirce's three kinds of reasoning.\n\nIn Dewey's \"Rainy Day\" or \"Sign of Rain\" story, we find our peripatetic hero presented with a surprising Fact:\n\nResponding to an intellectual reflex of puzzlement about the situation, his resource of common knowledge about the world is impelled to seize on an approximate Rule:\nThis Rule can be recognized as having a potential relevance to the situation because it matches the surprising Fact, C → A, in its consequential feature A.\n\nAll of this suggests that the present Case may be one in which it is just about to rain:\n\nThe whole mental performance, however automatic and semi-conscious it may be, that leads up from a problematic Fact and a previously settled knowledge base of Rules to the plausible suggestion of a Case description, is what we are calling an abductive inference.\n\nThe next phase of inquiry uses deductive inference to expand the implied consequences of the abductive hypothesis, with the aim of testing its truth. For this purpose, the inquirer needs to think of other things that would follow from the consequence of his precipitate explanation. Thus, he now reflects on the Case just assumed:\n\nHe looks up to scan the sky, perhaps in a random search for further information, but since the sky is a logical place to look for details of an imminent rainstorm, symbolized in our story by the letter B, we may safely suppose that our reasoner has already detached the consequence of the abduced Case, C → B, and has begun to expand on its further implications. So let us imagine that our up-looker has a more deliberate purpose in mind, and that his search for additional data is driven by the new-found, determinate Rule:\n\nContemplating the assumed Case in combination with this new Rule leads him by an immediate deduction to predict an additional Fact:\n\nThe reconstructed picture of reasoning assembled in this second phase of inquiry is true to the pattern of deductive inference.\n\nWhatever the case, our subject observes a Dark cloud, just as he would expect on the basis of the new hypothesis. The explanation of imminent rain removes the discrepancy between observations and expectations and thereby reduces the shock of surprise that made this process of inquiry necessary.\n\nFigure 4 gives a graphical illustration of Dewey's example of inquiry, isolating for the purposes of the present analysis the first two steps in the more extended proceedings that go to make up the whole inquiry.\n\nIn this analysis of the first steps of Inquiry, we have a complex or a mixed form of inference that can be seen as taking place in two steps:\n\nThis is nowhere near a complete analysis of the Rainy Day inquiry, even insofar as it might be carried out within the constraints of the syllogistic framework, and it covers only the first two steps of the relevant inquiry process, but maybe it will do for a start.\n\nOne other thing needs to be noticed here, the formal duality between this expansion phase of inquiry and the argument from analogy. This can be seen most clearly in the propositional lattice diagrams shown in Figures 3 and 4, where analogy exhibits a rough \"A\" shape and the first two steps of inquiry exhibit a rough \"V\" shape, respectively. Since we find ourselves repeatedly referring to this expansion phase of inquiry as a unit, let's give it a name that suggests its duality with analogy—\"catalogy\" will do for the moment. This usage is apt enough if one thinks of a catalogue entry for an item as a text that lists its salient features. Notice that analogy has to do with the examples of a given quality, while catalogy has to do with the qualities of a given example. Peirce noted similar forms of duality in many of his early writings, leading to the consummate treatment in his 1867 paper \"On a New List of Categories\" (CP 1.545-559, W 2, 49-59).\n\nIn order to comprehend the bearing of inductive reasoning on the closing phases of inquiry there are a couple of observations that we need to make:\n\nThroughout inquiry the reasoner makes use of rules that have to be transported across intervals of experience, from the masses of experience where they are learned to the moments of experience where they are applied. Inductive reasoning is involved in the learning and the transfer of these rules, both in accumulating a knowledge base and in carrying it through the times between acquisition and application.\n\nLet's now consider how these principles of learning, transfer, and testing apply to John Dewey's \"Sign of Rain\" example.\n\nRules in a knowledge base, as far as their effective content goes, can be obtained by any mode of inference.\n\nFor example, a rule like:\nis usually induced from a consideration of many past events, in a manner that can be rationally reconstructed as follows:\n\nHowever, the very same proposition could also be abduced as an explanation of a singular occurrence or deduced as a conclusion of a presumptive theory.\n\nWhat is it that gives a distinctively inductive character to the acquisition of a knowledge base? It is evidently the \"analogy of experience\" that underlies its useful application. Whenever we find ourselves prefacing an argument with the phrase \"If past experience is any guide...\" then we can be sure that this principle has come into play. We are invoking an analogy between past experience, considered as a totality, and present experience, considered as a point of application. What we mean in practice is this: \"If past experience is a fair sample of possible experience, then the knowledge gained in it applies to present experience\". This is the mechanism that allows a knowledge base to be carried across gulfs of experience that are indifferent to the effective contents of its rules.\n\nHere are the details of how this notion of transfer works out in the case of the \"Sign of Rain\" example:\n\nLet K(pres) be a portion of the reasoner's knowledge base that is logically equivalent to the conjunction of two rules, as follows:\n\nK(pres) is the present knowledge base, expressed in the form of a logical constraint on the present universe of discourse.\n\nIt is convenient to have the option of expressing all logical statements in terms of their logical models, that is, in terms of the primitive circumstances or the elements of experience over which they hold true.\n\nIf we think of the knowledge base K(pres) as referring to the \"regime of experience\" over which it is valid, then all of these sets of models can be compared by the simple relations of set inclusion or logical implication.\n\nFigure 5 schematizes this way of viewing the \"analogy of experience\".\n\nIn these terms, the \"analogy of experience\" proceeds by inducing a Rule about the validity of a current knowledge base and then deducing a Fact, its applicability to a current experience, as in the following sequence:\n\nInductive Phase:\n\nDeductive Phase:\n\nIf the observer looks up and does not see dark clouds, or if he runs for shelter but it does not rain, then there is fresh occasion to question the utility or the validity of his knowledge base. But we must leave our foulweather friend for now and defer the logical analysis of this testing phase to another occasion.\n\n\n"}

Elements of institutional memory may be found in corporations, professional groups, government bodies, religious groups, academic collaborations, and by extension in entire cultures. There are different ideas about how institutional memory is transferred, whether it is between people or through written sources.\n\nInstitutional memory may be encouraged to preserve an ideology or way of work in such a group. Conversely, institutional memory may be ingrained to the point that it becomes hard to challenge if something is found to contradict that which was previously thought to have been correct. Institutional memory may have influence on organizational identity, choice of individuals, and actions of the individuals interacting with the institution.\n\nInstitutional knowledge is gained by organizations translating historical data into useful knowledge and wisdom. Memory depends upon the preservation of data and also the analytical skills necessary for its effective use within the organization.\n\nReligion is one of the significant institutional forces acting on the collective memory attributed to humanity. Alternatively, the evolution of ideas in Marxist theory, is that the mechanism whereby knowledge and wisdom are passed down through the generations is subject to economic determinism. In all instances, social systems, cultures, and organizations have an interest in controlling and using institutional memories.\n\nOrganizational structure determines the training requirements and expectations of behaviour associated with various roles. This is part of the implicit institutional knowledge. Progress to higher echelons requires assimilation of this, and when outsiders enter at a high level, effectiveness tends to deteriorate if this morale is unjustly ignored.\n\n"}

During the Communist regime of Josip Broz Tito, Pučnik was one of the most outspoken Slovenian critics of dictatorship and lack of civil liberties in Yugoslavia. He was imprisoned for a total of seven years, and later forced into exile. After returning to Slovenia in the late 1980s, he became the leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, a platform of democratic parties that defeated the Communists in the first free elections in 1990 and introduced a democratic system and market economy to Slovenia. He is also considered one of the fathers of Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia.\n\nPučnik was born in the village of Črešnjevec in Slovenian Styria (now part of the municipality of Slovenska Bistrica), in what was then the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He came from a Roman Catholic peasant background. His family had supported the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People during World War II: his older brother Ivan was an anti-Nazi resistance fighter in the Yugoslav Partisan movement.\n\nAlready as a teenager, Pučnik clashed with the Communist establishment. Because of some critical thoughts published in the high school paper \"Iskanja\" (\"Quests\") he was prohibited from taking his final exam. Since he couldn't enroll in the University, he was drafted in the Yugoslav People's Army. After completing the military service, he took the final exam, passed it and enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied philosophy and comparative literature, graduating in 1958. \n\nWhile living in Ljubljana, he became involved with a group of young intellectuals, known as the Critical generation, which tried to open a space for public debate and challenged the rigid cultural policies of the Titoist regime in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. Among Pučnik's closest collaborators from that period were the literary historian Taras Kermauner, sociologist Veljko Rus, and poet Veno Taufer. Pučnik believed that the system could be changed from inside and therefore joined the Communist Party of Slovenia. At the same time, he published several articles in the \"Revija 57\" magazine, in which he openly criticised the economic policies of the Communist regime.\n\nIn 1958, Pučnik was arrested accused of \"subversion of the Socialist system\" and sentenced to 9 years in jail. At the trial, which lasted only a couple of hours, he was accused of having instigated workers to strike. Some have suggested that Pučnik's imprisonment was a deliberate attempt by the regime to silence dissident intellectuals. He was released in 1963 and immediately continued writing for the alternative journal \"Perspektive\". At this point he was already publicly stating his disapproval of the regime. In 1964, his article \"Problemi našega kmetijstva\" (\"The Problems of Our Agriculture\") was published in the journal \"Perspektive\". In it, Pučnik criticized the agricultural policy of the regime, arguing that it was inefficient using publicly available official data. He was arrested again, sentenced to another two years in prison and expelled from the Communist Party. \n\nDuring his time in prison, Pučnik became an idol for his generation. The playwright Dominik Smole dedicated him the play Antigone and Primož Kozak portrayed him in the leading role of his play \"Afera\" (\"The Affaire\"). Both plays were metaphors for the totalitarian repression in Communist Yugoslavia.\n\nPučnik was released from jail in 1966. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a job, he decided to emigrate to Germany. He settled in Hamburg, making a living from manual jobs. When he decided to enrol as a postgraduate student at the University of Hamburg, the University of Ljubljana refused to provide him with a copy of his degree. He thus enrolled again to undergraduate study of philosophy and sociology, obtaining his PhD in 1971. He worked at the universities of Hamburg and Lüneburg, where he taught sociology. During his life in Germany, Pučnik became a supporter of the German Social Democratic Party, maintaining close relations with several of its leaders. In the late 1980s, he became an open admirer of the Social Democratic leader of Lower Saxony Gerhard Schröder, later chancellor of Germany, whom he took as his main role model for his subsequent political activity.\n\nIn the academic sphere, he became influenced by the theories of Jürgen Habermas, Niklas Luhmann and his system theory, as well as by several phenomenological sociologists such as Alfred Schutz and the Slovene-born Thomas Luckmann. \n\nDuring his years of exile, he kept up a correspondence with several important critical intellectuals in Slovenia, especially Ivo Urbančič.\n\nIn the 1980s, Pučnik could again publish articles in Slovenia, this time in the alternative journal \"Nova revija\". In 1987, he co-authored the Contributions to the Slovenian National Program, published in the 57th issue of the Nova revija journal. The text was written as the response to the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts of 1986, and set the grounds for a political opposition to the Communist regime. It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. Pučnik's article was centred on issues of democratization and political plurality, and openly stressed the need for Slovenia's full sovereignty in order to secure such development.\n\nHe returned to Slovenia in 1989 at the invitation of the newly formed opposition Social Democratic Union of Slovenia. He was elected president of the party in 1989 and the following year he was chosen as the leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, a common platform of all democratic opposition parties in Slovenia. The coalition won the first democratic elections in 1990. Pučnik ran for President of Slovenia but lost to Milan Kučan, the last secretary general of the Communist Party of Slovenia. He was nevertheless elected to the Slovenian Parliament and remained the official leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, and the coalition's parliamentary leader. \n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, he was among those who led Slovenia to independence from Yugoslavia. In 1992, after the fall of Lojze Peterle's coalition government, Pučnik decided to lead his party into a coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party and briefly served as vice-president in the first government of Janez Drnovšek.\n\nIn the elections of 1992, the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia suffered a complete defeat, gaining a mere 3.4% of the vote, barely securing the entry into the Parliament. Pučnik resigned as president of the party in favour of Janez Janša. Between 1992 and 1996, Pučnik served as a member of the National Assembly of Slovenia. During this time, he led a parliamentary commission to clarify political responsibility for the summary executions perpetrated by the Communist regime in Slovenia after World War II .\n\nAfter 1996, he retired from active politics, but remained honorary president of the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia and continued to voice his opinion on matters of public interest. He remained utterly critical of the policies of Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek and President Milan Kučan. He also criticized the political transition to democracy in general, especially the insufficient implementation of the rule of law, the widespread corruption and the maintenance of the power networks from the previous regime.\n\nHe died in Germany in 2003 and was buried in his home village of Črešnjevec. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd. The eulogy was delivered by philosopher and his lifelong friend Ivo Urbančič.\n\nPučnik is considered to be one of the fathers of independent Slovenia. Some, especially in the Slovenian right wing circles, have also called him \"Father of Slovenian Democracy\".\n\nIn 2006, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinct Merits of Slovenia. In 2007, the Government of Slovenia named the main international airport in Slovenia, the Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport, after him. The decision was criticized by some, including the then President of Slovenia Janez Drnovšek who publicly expressed his respect for Pučnik, but disagreed with the renaming of the airport after him. Author and journalist Spomenka Hribar, Pučnik's former colleague, stated that Pučnik would not have agreed with such renaming, because he was a modest person who disliked public praise and rejected any \"cult of personality\". A similar statement was made by Pučnik's son Gorazd, who however did not oppose the renaming and was present at the renaming ceremony.\n\nThe Slovenian liberal conservative think tank Jože Pučnik Institute and the elementary school in his native Črešnjevec are also named after him.\n\nAt the initiative of Milan Zver, the European Parliament announced on 11 June 2018 that a conference room will bear the name of Jože Pučnik.\nThe official inauguration took place on 28 June 2018 in Brussels, where President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, Chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament Manfred Weber, President of Slovenia Borut Pahor, President of Slovenian Democratic Party Janez Janša and initiator Milan Zver were among the honorary speakers. Family of Jože Pučnik was present at the inauguration as well. \n\nJože Pučnik was the brother of Ivan Pučnik, a farmer and politician, who was initially member of the Communist Party and later also became a dissident and co-founder of the Slovenian Peasant Union in 1989. \n\nJože Pučnik was married twice. After his first release from jail in 1963, he met Irena Žerjal, a young Slovene author from Trieste, Italy, who studied Slavic philology in Ljubljana. They married the same year, when Pučnik was already imprisoned again; Pučnik was not allowed to attend his own wedding, and his brother Ivan had to represent him at the ceremony instead. His first son was born in 1964. When Pučnik was released from prison in 1966, the family moved to Germany; in 1969, however, the wife decided to return to Trieste with the son, while Pučnik decided to stay in Germany. He later married Christel Kunath. They had a daughter named Katharina. He also adopted his second wife's son, called Marcus.\n\nHis son from his first marriage, Gorazd Pučnik, is the director of the Srečko Kosovel Boarding School in Trieste, Italy. His stepson Marcus Pucnik is a journalist, based in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A logical truth is a statement which is true, and remains true under all reinterpretations of its components other than its logical constants. It is a type of analytic statement. All of philosophical logic can be thought of as providing accounts of the nature of logical truth, as well as logical consequence.\n\nLogical truths (including tautologies) are truths which are considered to be necessarily true. This is to say that they are considered to be such that they could not be untrue and no situation could arise which would cause us to reject a logical truth. It must be true in every sense of intuition, practices, and bodies of beliefs. However, it is not universally agreed that there are any statements which are \"necessarily\" true.\n\nA logical truth is considered by some philosophers to be a statement which is true in all possible worlds. This is contrasted with facts (which may also be referred to as \"contingent claims\" or \"synthetic claims\") which are true in \"this\" world, as it has historically unfolded, but which is not true in at least one possible world, as it might have unfolded. The proposition \"If p and q, then p\" and the proposition \"All married people are married\" are logical truths because they are true due to their inherent structure and not because of any facts of the world. \nLater, with the rise of formal logic a logical truth was considered to be a statement which is true under all possible interpretations.\n\nThe existence of logical truths has been put forward by rationalist philosophers as an objection to empiricism because they hold that it is impossible to account for our knowledge of logical truths on empiricist grounds. Empiricists commonly respond to this objection by arguing that logical truths (which they usually deem to be mere tautologies), are analytic and thus do not purport to describe the world.\n\nLogical truths, being analytic statements, do not contain any information about any matters of fact. Other than logical truths, there is also a second class of analytic statements, typified by \"no bachelor is married\". The characteristic of such a statement is that it can be turned into a logical truth by substituting synonyms for synonyms \"salva veritate\". \"No bachelor is married\" can be turned into \"no unmarried man is married\" by substituting \"unmarried man\" for its synonym \"bachelor\".\n\nIn his essay Two Dogmas of Empiricism, the philosopher W. V. O. Quine called into question the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. It was this second class of analytic statements that caused him to note that the concept of analyticity itself stands in need of clarification, because it seems to depend on the concept of synonymy, which stands in need of clarification. In his conclusion, Quine rejects that logical truths are necessary truths. Instead he posits that the truth-value of any statement can be changed, including logical truths, given a re-evaluation of the truth-values of every other statement in one's complete theory.\n\nConsidering different interpretations of the same statement leads to the notion of truth value. The simplest approach to truth values means that the statement may be \"true\" in one case, but \"false\" in another. In one sense of the term \"tautology\", it is any type of formula or proposition which turns out to be true under any possible interpretation of its terms (may also be called a valuation or assignment depending upon the context). This is synonymous to logical truth.\n\nHowever, the term \"tautology\" is also commonly used to refer to what could more specifically be called truth-functional tautologies. Whereas a tautology or logical truth is true solely because of the logical terms it contains in general (e.g. \"every\", \"some\", and \"is\"), a truth-functional tautology is true because of the logical terms it contains which are logical connectives (e.g. \"or\", \"and\", and \"nor\"). Not all logical truths are tautologies of such a kind.\n\nLogical constants, including logical connectives and quantifiers, can all be reduced conceptually to logical truth. For instance, two statements or more are logically incompatible \"if, and only if\" their conjunction is logically false. One statement logically implies another when it is logically incompatible with the negation of the other. A statement is logically true if, and only if its opposite is logically false. The opposite statements must contradict one another. In this way all logical connectives can be expressed in terms of preserving logical truth. The logical form of a sentence is determined by its semantic or syntactic structure and by the placement of logical constants. Logical constants determine whether a statement is a logical truth when they are combined with a language that limits its meaning. Therefore, until it is determined how to make a distinction between all logical constants regardless of their language, it is impossible to know the complete truth of a statement or argument.\n\nThe concept of logical truth is closely connected to the concept of a rule of inference.\n\nLogical positivism was a movement in the 20th century and was followed to a great extent in Europe and the United States. It is a structured method of determining how valid the knowledge is. It introduced mathematics and the natural sciences into the field of philosophy. It is also known as scientific empiricism. Logical positivism considers philosophy as an analytical inquiry. Philosophy was deciphered as an activity rather than a theory. Logical positivists worked to explain the language of science by showing that scientific theories could be broken down to logical truths along with the experience of the five senses. The concepts created in this movement are very closely followed today in the West. Logical positivism was a way to decipher whether a statement was truly a logical truth by means of relating it to a scientific theory or mathematics. It determined the validity of the statement as well as gave it the rank of a logical truth or a false truth.\n\nNon-classical logic is the name given to formal systems which differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as propositional and predicate logic. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations. The aim of these departures is to make it possible to construct different models of logical consequence and logical truth.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4994502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4994502", "title": "Merton thesis", "text": "Merton thesis\n\nThe Merton thesis is an argument about the nature of early experimental science proposed by Robert K. Merton. Similar to Max Weber's famous claim on the link between Protestant work ethic and the capitalist economy, Merton argued for a similar positive correlation between the rise of Protestant Pietism and early experimental science. The Merton thesis has resulted in continuous debates.\n\nAlthough scholars are still debating it, Merton's 1936 doctoral dissertation (and two years later his first monograph by the same title) \"Science, Technology and Society in 17th-Century England\" raised important issues on the connections between religion and the rise of modern science, became a significant work in the realm of the sociology of science and continues to be cited in new scholarship. Merton further developed this thesis in other publications.\n\nThe Merton thesis has two separate parts: firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in England in the 17th century, and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values.\n\nMerton focuses on English Puritanism and German Pietism as being responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. He explains that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science is a result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science. Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God's influence on the world and thus providing religious justification for scientific research.\n\nThe first part of Merton's thesis has been criticized for insufficient consideration of the roles of mathematics and the mechanical philosophy in the scientific revolution. The second part has been criticized for the difficulty involved in defining who counts as a Protestant of the \"right type\" without making arbitrary distinctions. It is also criticized for failing to explain why non-Protestants do science (consider the Catholics Copernicus, da Vinci, Descartes, or Galileo) and conversely why Protestants of the \"right type\" are not all interested in science.\n\nMerton, acknowledging the criticism, replied that the Puritan ethos was not necessary, although it did facilitate development of science. He also noted that when science had acquired institutional legitimacy, it no longer needed religion, eventually becoming a counterforce, leading to religious decline. Nonetheless, early on, in Merton's view religion was a major factor that allowed the scientific revolution to occur. While the Merton thesis does not explain all the causes of the scientific revolution, it does illuminate possible reasons why England was one of its driving motors and the structure of the English scientific community.\n\nIn 1958, American sociologist Gerhard Lenski's empirical inquiry into \"The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life\" in the Detroit area (Michigan) revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with regard to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported the basic hypotheses of Max Weber's work \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". According to Lenski, the \"contributions of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory.\" Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church, had observed that \"diligence and frugality\" made Methodists wealthy. \"In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress.\" However, Lenski said, asceticism was rare among modern Protestants, and the distinctive Protestant doctrine of \"the calling\" was largely forgotten. Instead, modern (white) Protestants and Jews had a high degree of \"intellectual autonomy\" that facilitated scientific and technical advance. By contrast, Lenski pointed out, Catholics developed an intellectual orientation which valued \"obedience\" to the teachings of their church above intellectual autonomy, which made them less inclined to enter scientific careers. Catholic sociologists had come to the same conclusions.\n\nLenski traced these differences back to the Reformation and the Catholic church's reaction to it. In Lenski's view, the Reformation encouraged intellectual autonomy among Protestants, in particular the Anabaptists, Puritans, Pietists, Methodists, and Presbyterians. In the Middle Ages, there had been tendencies toward intellectual autonomy, as exemplified in men like Erasmus. But after the Reformation, the Catholic leaders increasingly identified these tendencies with Protestantism and heresy and demanded that Catholics be obedient and faithful to ecclesiastical discipline. In Lenski's opinion, his study showed that these differences between Protestants and Catholics survived to the present day. As a consequence, \"none of the predominantly and devoutly Catholic nations in the modern world can be classified as a \"leading\" industrial nation. Some Catholic nations – such as France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile – are quite highly industrialized, but none of them are leaders in the technological and scientific fields, nor do they seem likely to become so. Recently [1963] some Brazilian Catholic social scientists compared their country's progress with that of the United States and concluded that the chief factor responsible for the differential rates of development is the religious heritage of the two nations.\"\n\nPuritans and Pietists both contributed to intellectual autonomy and provided intellectual tools and values important for science. As an example, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional disputation was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship. It is a part of the forces that lead to modernity.\n\nAccording to \"Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States\" by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates identified a Protestant background. Overall, 84.2% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in Chemistry, 60% in Medicine, and 58.6% in Physics between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants.\n\nAccording to \"100 Years of Nobel Prize (2005)\", a review of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000, 65.4% of Nobel Prize Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference (423 prizes). While 32% of Nobel prize winners have identified with Protestantism in its various forms (208 prizes), Protestants comprise 11.6–13% of the world's population but most of those selecting the prize winners.\n\n\n"}

The radical one, where Edvard Brandes and Georg Brandes were the most known representatives, demanded that women be free to enjoy a sexual life prior to marriage, as men were.\n\n\"Getting Married\" (collection) by August Strindberg and the legal court case that surrounded it was one of the perhaps most known incidents during the debate.

{"id": "1919340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919340", "title": "Pacem in terris", "text": "Pacem in terris\n\nPacem in terris () was a papal encyclical issued by Pope John XXIII on 11 April 1963 on the rights and obligations of individuals and of the state, as well as the proper relations between states. It emphasized human dignity and equality among all people, and made mention of issues such as the rights of women, nuclear non-proliferation, and the United Nations, all of which it endorsed. It was the last encyclical drafted by John XXIII, who had been diagnosed with cancer in September 1962 and died two months after the encyclical's completion. Biographer Peter Hebblethwaite called it Pope John's \"last will and testament\". Published on Holy Thursday, the Pope called it his \"Easter gift\".\n\nDue to her importance and popularity, \"Pacem in Terris\" is deposited at the UN archives.\n\nThe full title of the encyclical is \"On Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty\". The short title \"Pacem in terris\" is derived from the opening words of the encyclical, as is customary with papal documents:\n\n\"Pacem in terris\" was the first encyclical that a pope addressed to \"all men of good will\", rather than only to Catholics, quote of the praise to God said by the heavenly army above the manger of Bethlehem (Latin Vulgate: \"in terra pax in hominibus bonae voluntatis\", Luke ; English translation: ). Learned Hand Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, Mary Ann Glendon, interprets this to mean \"He was insisting that the responsibility for setting conditions for peace does not just belong to the great and powerful of the world—it belongs to each and every one of us.\" In theological terms, it marked a major shift in papal teaching from reliance on classical scholastic categories of natural law to a more inductive approach based on the signs of the times.\n\nIn this work, John XXIII reacted to the political situation in the middle of the Cold War. Coming just months after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, during which the Vatican served as an intermediary between the White House and the Kremlin, the document also reflected the Pope's experience of 1960 in trying to resolve difficulties arising out the four-power occupation of Berlin. The \"peace encyclical\" was issued only two years after the erection of the Berlin Wall. It also draws on Pope John's reading of Saint Augustines \"The City of God\" and Thomas Aquinas' view of Eternal Law. In this it echoes the Gospel’s core values and principles of patristic and medieval thought, while reflecting the historical period in which it was written.\n\nSociologist Monsignor Pietro Pavan and a small group of theologians helped draft it. In Pavan’s view \"Pacem in terris\" would present the teachings of Leo XIII on the eternal law, \"in light of the changing tides of history, and allow them to resonate with a much wider audience\".\n\nThe Pope explains in this encyclical that conflicts \"should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather by negotiation\". He further emphasizes the importance of respect of human rights as an essential consequence of the Christian understanding of men and nuclear disarmament. He clearly establishes \"...That every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity, and to the means which are suitable for the proper development of life...\"\n\n\"Pacem in terris\" is an extended reflection on the moral order. The document is divided into four sections.\n\n“Pacem in Terris was more than an encyclical—it was an event,\" recalls Glendon.\n\"Pacem in Terris\" was the first papal encyclical published in its entirety in the \"New York Times\". The \"Washington Post\" said, \"\"Pacem in terris\" is not just the voice of an old priest, nor just that of an ancient Church; it is the voice of the conscience of the world.” Two years later, it was the subject of a conference at the United Nations attended by over 2,000 statespersons and scholars.\n\nF. Russell Hittinger describes the encyclical \"as a kind of magna carta of the Catholic Church’s position on human rights and natural law\". Pope John XXIII's 1963 encyclical \"Pacem in terris\" (\"Peace on Earth\") radically affected Catholic social teaching not only on war and peace, but on church-state relations, women's rights, religious freedom, international relations and other major issues. Fr. J. Bryan Hehir, called \"Pacem in terris\" \"a pivotal text in [papal] encyclical history\" that played a major role in the development of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom and its Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, and on Pope John Paul II's encyclical \"Centesimus annus\" (\"The Hundredth Year\"), which marked the centennial of Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical on labor, Rerum Novarum. It also influenced the 1965 \"Declaration on Religious Freedom\" (Dignitatis humanae).\n\nIn commemoration of this encyclical, the annual \"Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom award\" was instituted in 1964, first by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport and later by the \"Quad Cities Pacem in Terris Coalition\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49952", "title": "Prudence", "text": "Prudence\n\nPrudence (, contracted from meaning \"seeing ahead, sagacity\") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of reason. It is classically considered to be a virtue, and in particular one of the four Cardinal virtues (which are, with the three theological virtues, part of the seven virtues). Prudentia is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, who is frequently depicted as a pair with Justitia, the Roman goddess of Justice.\n\nThe word derives from the 14th-century Old French word \"prudence\", which, in turn, derives from the Latin \"prudentia\" meaning \"foresight, sagacity\". It is often associated with wisdom, insight, and knowledge. In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are courageous, as opposed to reckless or cowardly, is an act of prudence, and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue.\n\nIn modern English, the word has become increasingly synonymous with cautiousness. In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but, when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness, can become the vice of cowardice.\n\nIn the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Aristotle gives a lengthy account of the virtue phronesis (), traditionally translated as \"prudence\", although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage. More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as \"practical wisdom\", \"practical judgment\" or \"rational choice\".\n\nPrudence was considered by the ancient Greeks and later on by Christian philosophers, most notably Thomas Aquinas, as the cause, measure and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the \"auriga virtutum\" or the charioteer of the virtues.\n\nIt is the cause in the sense that the virtues, which are defined to be the \"perfected ability\" of man as a spiritual person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having intelligence and free will), achieve their \"perfection\" only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live temperance when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings.\n\nIts function is to point out which course of action is to be taken in any concrete circumstances. It has nothing to do with directly willing the good it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness; mercy sinks into weakness, and temperance into fanaticism. Its office is to determine for each in practice those circumstances of time, place, manner, etc. which should be observed, and which the Scholastics comprise under the term \"medium rationis\". So it is that while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless rightly styled a moral virtue.\n\nPrudence is considered the measure of moral virtues since it provides a model of ethically good actions. \"The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence.\" (Josef Pieper) For instance, a stockbroker using his experience and all the data available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell stock A at 2PM tomorrow and buy stock B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time, and means) is the product of an act of prudence, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other virtues like fortitude (doing it in spite of fear of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of justice to his company and his family). The actual act's \"goodness\" is measured against that original decision made through prudence.\n\nIn Greek and Scholastic philosophy, \"form\" is the specific characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. With this language, prudence confers upon other virtues the form of its inner essence; that is, its specific character as a virtue. For instance, not all acts of telling the truth are considered good, considered as done with the virtue of honesty. What makes telling the truth a virtue is whether it is done with prudence.\n\nIn Christian understanding, the difference between prudence and cunning lies in the intent with which the decision of the context of an action is made. The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of God, the natural law and moral implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be martyred rather than deny their faith is considered prudent. \n\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas, judgments using reasons for evil ends or using evil means are considered to be made through \"cunning\" and \"false prudence\" and not through prudence. However \"imprudence\" was not be considered a sin since it was not voluntary.\n\nThe Ancient Greek term for prudence is synonymous with “forethought\". People, the Ancient Greeks believed, must have enough prudence to prepare for worshiping the Olympian gods. Exceptional were the foolish Bacchic cult, who lived an emotional and passionate lifestyle. Believing the antisexual Olympian traditions to be shameful, professors of the Bacchic cult celebrated the irrationality that governed their religion.\n\nPrudence is the application of universal principles to particular situations. \"Integral parts\" of virtues, in Scholastic philosophy, are the elements that must be present for any complete or perfect act of the virtue. The following are the integral parts of prudence:\n\nIn ethics, a \"prudential judgment\" is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the correct action. Generally, it applies to situations where two people could weigh the circumstances differently and \"ethically\" come to different conclusions.\n\nFor instance, in the theory of just war, the government of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the decision whether to go to war is therefore a prudential judgment.\n\nIn another case, a patient who has a terminal illness with no conventional treatment may hear of an experimental treatment. To decide whether to take it would require weighing on one hand, the cost, time, possible lack of benefit, and possible pain, disability, and hastened death, and on the other hand, the possible benefit and the benefit to others of what could be learned from his case.\n\nPhronesis, or practical wisdom, holds an important place in rhetorical theory as a central aspect of judgment and practice. Aristotle's notion of phronesis fits with his notes on rhetoric because neither, in his estimation, could be reduced to an \"episteme\" or a \"techne\", and both deal with the ability to deliberate about contingent, variable, or indeterminate matters.\n\nCicero defined \"prudentia\" as a rhetorical norm in \"De Oratore\", \"De officiis\", \"De Inventione\", and \"De re publica\". He contrasts the term with \"imprudens\", young men failing to consider the consequences before they act. The \"prudens\", or those who had prudence, knew when to speak and when to stay silent. Cicero maintained that prudence was gained only through experience, and while it was applied in everyday conversation, in public discourse it was subordinated to the broader term for wisdom, \"sapientia\".\n\nIn the contemporary era, rhetorical scholars have tried to recover a robust meaning for the term. They have maintained consistency with the ancient orators, contending that prudence is an embodied persuasive resource. Although sets of principles or rules can be constructed in a particular culture, scholars agree that prudence cannot be derived from a set of timeless principles. Instead, through gauging the situation and through reasoned deliberation, a speaker should determine the set of values and morals by which to base his or her actions. Furthermore, scholars suggest the capacity to take into account the particularities of the situation as vital to prudential practice. For example, as rhetorical scholar Lois Self explains, \"both rhetoric and phronesis are normative processes in that they involve rational principles of choice-making; both have general applicability but always require careful analysis of particulars in determining the best response to each specific situation; both ideally take into account the wholeness of human nature; and finally, both have social utility and responsibility in that both treat matter of the public good\". Robert Hariman, in his examination of Malcolm X, adds that \"aesthetic sensibility, imitation of a performative ideal, and improvisation upon conventions of presentation\" are also components of practical reasoning.\n\nSmall differences emerge between rhetorical scholars regarding definitions of the term and methods of analysis. Hans-Georg Gadamer asserted that prudence materializes through the application of principles and can be evaluated accordingly. In his analysis of Andrew Cuomo's speech to the Catholic Church of Notre Dame, James Jasinski contends that prudence cannot as it is not a \"episteme\" or \"techne\"; instead, it is judged according to embodied rhetorical performance. Thus, while Gadamer would judge prudence based on the execution of contingent principles, Jasinski would examine the artistry of communication in its cultural milieu between accommodation (compromise) and audacity (courage).\n\nIn his study of Machiavelli, examining the relationship between prudence and moderation, rhetorician Eugene Garver holds that there is a middle ground between \"an ethics of principles, in which those principles univocally dictate action\" and \"an ethics of consequences, in which the successful result is all\". His premise stems from Aristotle's theory of virtue as an \"intermediate\", in which moderation and compromise embody prudence. Yet, because valorizing moderation is not an active response, prudence entails the \"transformation of moderation\" into a fitting response, making it a flexible situational norm. Garver also asserts that prudential reasoning differs from \"algorithmic\" and \"heuristic\" reasoning because it is rooted in a political community, the context in which common problems regarding stability and innovation arise and call for prudential reasoning.\n\nEconomists describe a consumer as \"prudent\" if he or she saves more when faced with riskier future income. This additional saving is called precautionary saving. \n\nIf a risk-averse consumer has a utility function formula_1 over consumption \"x\", and if formula_1 is differentiable, then the consumer is not prudent unless the third derivative of utility is positive, that is, formula_3.\n\nThe strength of the precautionary saving motive can be measured by absolute prudence, which is defined as\nformula_4. Similarly, relative prudence is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption. These measures are closely related to the concepts of absolute and relative risk aversion developed by Kenneth Arrow and John W. Pratt.\n\nIn accounting, prudence was long considered one of the \"fundamental accounting concepts\" in its determination of the time for revenue recognition. The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have led academic critics to accuse the international standard-setting body IASB of abandoning prudence. In the British reporting standard FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a \"desirable\" quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept. Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.\n\nIn a 2011 report on the financial crisis of 2007–08, the British House of Lords bemoaned the demotion of prudence as a governing principle of accounting and audit. Their comments, however, were disputed by some leading practitioners.\n\n\n"}

From a basic verbal meaning \"to consecrate, to purify\", it could be used as an adjective meaning \"holy\", or as a substantive referring to a \"sanctuary, sacred object, sacred personnel.\"\n\nThe root is reflected as \"qdš\" (Phoenician 𐤒𐤃‬𐤔, Hebrew ) in Northwest Semitic and as \"qds\" (Arabic ) in Central and South Semitic.\nIn Akkadian texts, the verb conjugated from this root meant to \"clean, purify.\"\n\nIt was used this way in Ugaritic, as for example, in the words \"qidšu\" (meaning \"holy place\" or \"chapel\") and \"qad(i)šu\" (meaning \"consecrated gift\" or \"cultic personnel\"). \nIn some Ugaritic texts, \"qdš\" is used as a divine epithet. For example, the gods are referred to as \"the sons of holiness\" or \"the holy ones\" (\"bn qdš\"), and in the Ugaritic \"Legend of Keret\", the hero is described as \"the son of El and the offspring of the Benevolent One and \"qdš\" \".\n\nWilliam Foxwell Albright believed that \"Qudšu\" (meaning \"holiness\") was a common Canaanite appellation for the goddess Asherah, and Albright's mentee Frank Moore Cross claimed \"qdš\" was used as a divine epithet for both Asherah and the Ugaritic goddess, Athirat. \nJohanna Stucky claims she may have been a deity in her own right.\n\nDepictions of a goddess in inscriptions from Dynastic Egypt, thought to Canaanite since she is referred to as \"Qdš\" (often transliterated in English as Qedesha, Qudshu or Qetesh), show a woman in the nude, with curly hair and raised arms carrying lilies and serpents. \"Qdš\" is also depicted in the pantheon of gods at Memphis, Egypt possibly indicating worship of her as independent deity there. The word \"qdš\" also appears in the Pyrgi Tablets, a Phoenician text found in Italy that dates back to 500 BCE.\n\n\"Qudšu\" was later used in Jewish Aramaic to refer to God, and \"qudš\" is the proto-form of the Hebrew word \"qadōš\", meaning \"holy\".\n\nWords derived from the root \"qdš\" appear some 830 times in the Hebrew Bible. \nIts use in the Hebrew Bible evokes ideas of separation from the profane, and proximity to the Otherness of God, while in nonbiblical Semitic texts, recent interpretations of its meaning link it to ideas of consecration, belonging, and purification.\n\nThe Hebrew language is called \"The Holy Tongue\" ( \"Lashon HaKodesh\") in Judaism. \nIn addition, the Hebrew term for the Holy Temple in Jerusalem is \"Beit Hamikdash\" (, \"the holy house\"), and \"Ir Ha-Kodesh\" (, \"City of the Holy\"), the latter being one of the tens of Hebrew names for Jerusalem.\n\nThree theological terms that come from this root are Kiddush, which is sanctification of the Sabbath or a festival with a blessing over wine before the evening and noon meals, Kaddish, which is the sanctification prayer, and mourner's prayer, and Kedushah which is the responsive section of the reader's repetition of the Amidah.\n\n\"Kedeshah\" () is a word derived from the Q-D-Š root, which is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe a particular sort of woman. There is debate in modern scholarship over whether a \"kedeshah\" was a sacred prostitute, or whether she was some other sort of cultic functionary. While the word \"zonah\" () simply meant an ordinary prostitute or loose woman, the word \"kedeshah\" literally means \"consecrated female\".\n\nThere are two different words describing places that use this root in the Hebrew Bible. One is Kedesh, which refers to a Canaanite village first documented in Joshua 20:7 and later in 2 Kings 15:29. The other is Kadesh, a place in the south of Ancient Israel, mentioned in and . \n\nThe verb form of Q-D-S in Arabic (\"qadus\") means \"to be holy\" or \"to be pure, immaculate\". \"Quds\" can be used as a noun to denote \"paradise\" or as an adjective meaning \"purity\" or \"holiness\". The definite noun form, \"al-Quds\" (, \"the holy one\"), is the most common of seventeen Arabic Names of Jerusalem and derives from the Aramaean word for \"temple\" (\"qōdšā\"). The Turkish word for Jerusalem, , derives from the Arabic name.\nTwo other names for Jerusalem also derive from the Q-D-S root: \"Bayt al-Muqqadas\" (\"the holy house\") and \"Bayt al-Maqdis\". The wider area around Jerusalem, or the Holy Land, is referred to in Arabic and in Islamic sources as \"al ard al-muqaddasa\" (also \"Bilād al-Muqaddasa\"), as it is full of shrines and connections to prophets and saints. The Christian Bible is known in Arabic as \"al-Kitāb al-Muqaddas\". \"Muqaddas\" in Arabic means not only \"holy\" and \"sacred\", but also \"hallowed, sanctified, dedicated, consecrated.\"\n\n\"Al-Quds\" also appears in Arabic as part of a phrase to refer to the Holy Spirit, \"Rúḥu 'l-Quds\" (or \"Rūḥu 'l'Qudus\"), with \"Ruh\" meaning \"spirit\". \nThis phrase appears in the Qur'an a number of times, where it is thought to refer in some cases to the angel Gabriel.\n\nThe concept of \"Rúḥu 'l-Quds\" is also discussed at length by the Sufi mystic, ʻAbd al-Karim al-Jili, who further distinguishes between two other concepts derived from the Q-D-S root in Arabic: \"qudsi\" (\"holy one\") and \"aqdasi\" (\"most holy one\"). The \"qudsi\" is one who \"unceasingly contemplates the Divine consciousness \"sirr\" ['secret'], which is his origin\" and is \"illuminated\" by it, whereas the \"aqdasi\" (\"most holy one\") is one who is actually united with this Essence.\n\n\"Qudsi\" is also used in Arabic to refer to a Jerusalemite, or a native/resident of Jerusalem. It and its derivatives, such as Maqdisi and al-Muqaddasi are used in Arabic surnames or as appellatives assigned to those who come from or live in Jerusalem.\n\nThe religious terms \"Hadith Qudsi\" (\"holy hadith\") and \"Tafsir Qudsi\" (\"sacred commentary\") also incorporate \"qudsi\", though in this case it is used as an adjective, rather than a noun or pronoun. Tafsir Qudsi is a form of Quranic commentary, while Hadith Qudsi refers to the \"utterances of God through the Prophet\", thus enjoying a status higher than that the hadith writings in general, though lower than that of the Qur'an.\n\nOther derivatives of Q-D-S in Arabic include \"qudus\", which means \"purity\", \"sanctity\", \"saint\" or \"holy\", and \"qadas\", which is used to refer to a \"small cup or plate\", often used to put forth offerings at holy sites. \"Taqdis\" means to \"purify, sanctify, consecrate to God,\" \"taqqadus\" is to \"be purified, sanctified, consecrated,\" and \"taqâdus\" means to \"play the saint\". \"Istiqdas\" means \"to deem holy.\"\n\n\n"}

He won the Hertford scholarship, the Ireland, the Gaisford Prize for Greek verse, a Craven scholarship and the Arnold prize, but took only a second class in \"Literae Humaniores\". \n\nNettleship became fellow and tutor of his college and succeeded to the work of T.

He died on 25 August 1892, from the effects of exposure on Mont Blanc, and was buried at Chamonix.\n\nNettleship left an unfinished work on Plato, part of which was published after his death, together with his lectures on logic and some essays. His long essay \"The Theory of Education in the Republic of Plato\" was published in \"Hellenica\".\n\nHis thought was idealistic, embodying elements of Hegelianism but also, in its account of the Platonic Forms (\"eide\", \"idiai\"), markedly influenced by a particular reading of the Kantian categories.

This did not prevent the undergraduates of Balliol from a gentle parody in the 1880 Masque of Balliol : \nRoughly, so to say, you know,\nI am N-TTL-SH-P or so;\nYou are gated after Hall,\nThat's all. I mean that's nearly all.\nThe inchoateness of Nettleship's philosophical thinking is more apparent in the \"Philosophical Remains\" than in the separate volume of lectures on Plato's \"Republic\".

In the \"Iliad\", Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the \"immortal oil of the rose\" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him \"among rose blossoms\". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel \"The Golden Ass\" by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.\n\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity. Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting \"The Feast of the Rosary\" (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.\n\nThe cultivation of geometrical gardens, in which the rose has often held pride of place, has a long history in Iran and surrounding lands. In the lyric ghazal, it is the beauty of the rose that provokes the longing song of the nightingale - an image prominent, for example, in the poems of Hafez.\n\nIn turn, the imagery of lover and beloved became a type of the Sufi mystic's quest for divine love, so that Ibn Arabi, for example, aligns the rose with the beloved's blushing cheek on the one hand and, on the other, with the divine names and attributes.\n\nOther well-known examples of rose symbolism in Sufism include;\n\nCatalans on the north eastern Spain have traditionally celebrated Saint George's Day (April 23)—which commemorates Saint George (\"Sant Jordi\"), the patron saint of the Catalonia region; as the \"dia dels enamorats\" (lovers' day), on which lovers exchange blood-red roses.\n\nThe rose is the national flower of England, a usage dating back to the English civil wars of the fifteenth century (later called Wars of the Roses), in which a red rose represented the House of Lancaster, and a white rose represented the House of York. The Tudor dynasty created the Tudor rose, which united both the white and the red roses, a symbolism dramatized by Shakespeare in his play \"Richard III\". The traditional ballad \"The Rose of England\" (Child 166) recounts the seizure of the crown by Earl of Richmond (who became Henry VII of England, the founder the Tudor dynasty), using the \"red rose\" as an allegory for Henry.\n\nThe England national rugby union team and Rugby Football Union adopted the red rose as their symbol in 1871, and the rose has appeared on players' kit ever since.\n\nIn 1986, the rose was adopted as the national floral emblem of the United States.\n\nIt is the state flower of five U.S. states: \n\nPortland, Oregon has counted \"City of Roses\" among its nicknames (see roses in Portland, Oregon) since 1888, and has held an annual Rose Festival since 1905. The city is also known for its International Rose Test Garden.\n\nPasadena, California—also nicknamed the \"City of Roses\"—has held the annual Tournament of Roses Parade since 1890, and 1902 the Parade has been held in conjunction with the Rose Bowl Game (which is now played at the city's Rose Bowl stadium, built in 1922).\n\nIn April 2011, the U.S. government's space program agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), celebrated the Hubble Space Telescope's 21st anniversary by releasing an image of spiral galaxies Arp 273 positioned in a rose-like shape.\n\nThe red rose is also part of the official logo of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), being a symbol of socialism generally. \n\nIn 1930, \"Rosa acicularis\" (the wild rose or prickly rose) was adopted as the official provincial flower of the Canadian province of Alberta. The suggestion that a provincial floral emblem be adopted by first made by an Edmonton newspaper editor; \"the Women's Institutes took up the suggestion and passed it on to the Department of Education, and the province's schoolchildren made the final choice.\"\n\nThe Wildrose Party, a now-defunct Albertan political party, was named after the province's official flower.\n\nThe Mexican city of Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, is nicknamed the \"City of Roses\" (\"Ciudad de las Rosas\").\n\nThe Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives at New York University states that the rose \"has always been an important symbol with anti-authoritarian associations.\" The rose is used to show the end after the means, meaning \"lay a rose on the grave\". The rose symbol became popular among socialist and social democratic political parties in post-World War II Western Europe. The symbol of a rose in a fist is used by the Socialist International \"and many of its member parties\" such as the French Socialist Party (PS).\n\nThe British Labour Party has used a red rose as its symbol since the late 1980s; the rose replaced the party's previous symbol, the red flag.\n\nThe White Rose was a World War II non-violent resistance group in Germany.\n\n"}

Something easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label \"simplicity\" can imply beauty, purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may occur with negative connotations to suggest, a deficit or insufficiency of nuance or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required.\n\nThe concept of simplicity has been related to in the field of epistemology and philosophy of science (e.g., in Occam's razor).

In other words, simplicity is a meta-scientific criterion by which scientists evaluate competing theories.\n\nA distinction is often made between two senses of simplicity: syntactic simplicity (the number and complexity of hypotheses), and ontological simplicity (the number and complexity of things postulated). These two aspects of simplicity are often referred to as elegance and parsimony respectively.\n\nJohn von Neumann defines simplicity as important esthetic criteria of scientific models: \n\nSimplicity is a theme in the Christian religion. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, God is infinitely simple. The Roman Catholic and Anglican religious orders of Franciscans also strive for personal simplicity. Members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) practice the Testimony of Simplicity, which involves simplifying one's life to focus on what is important and disregard or avoid what is least important. Simplicity is tenet of Anabaptistism, and some Anabaptist groups like the Bruderhof, make an effort to live simply.\n\nIn the context of human lifestyle, simplicity can denote freedom from hardship, effort or confusion.\n\n\n\n"}

Koestler postulates links between modern physics, their interaction with time and paranormal phenomena. It is influenced by Carl Jung's concept of synchronicity and the seriality of Paul Kammerer.\n\nThe psychologist David Marks criticized the book for endorsing pseudoscience. Marks noted that Koestler uncritically accepted ESP experiments and ignored evidence that did not fit his hypothesis. Marks coined the term \"Koestler's Fallacy\" as the assumption that odd matches of random events cannot arise by chance. Marks illustrates the fact that such odd matches do regularly occur with examples from his own experience. John Beloff gave the book a mixed review, describing it as \"a typical Koestlerian performance\" but noting that some of his claims about psychical research were inaccurate.\n\nIn Volume 7 of Alan Moore and David Lloyd's \"V for Vendetta\", Inspector Finch is seen reading \"The Roots of Coincidence\". Koestler is referenced several times in the work, and in the movie novelization by Steve Moore.

After attending Sedbergh School, he was at fifteen articled at his own request to the John Dawson (surgeon) of Sedbergh, Yorkshire, who was a surgeon and mathematician. Garnett obtained a knowledge of chemistry and physics, and he matriculated at the university of Edinburgh in 1785 with \"exceptional scientific knowledge\". He was particularly zealous in his attendance on the lectures of Dr. Black and of Dr. John Brown, and he became a disciple of the Brunonian theory. \"He avoided,\" says his anonymous biographer, \"almost all society, and it is said he never allowed himself at this period more than four hours sleep per day. He graduated in 1788, completed his medical education in London, and, returning for a short time to his parents and wrote his treatise on optics for the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\". In 1790 he practiced in Bradford and in the following year in Knaresborough and Harrogate. He published the first scientific analysis of the Harrogate waters and several schemes for the benefit of the inhabitants of Knaresborough\".\n\nLord Rosslyn built him a house at Harrogate, but his success did not answer his expectations, and he was meditating emigration to America when he succumbed to the attractions of Catharine Grace Cleveland, whom he had received as a boarder into his house. They were married in March 1795, and as he was in Liverpool endeavouring to arrange for a passage to America a casual invitation to deliver lectures on natural philosophy changed the current of his life. The success of the course, which was repeated at Manchester and other places, brought him an invitation to become professor at Anderson's Institution at Glasgow. He obtained great success at Glasgow, both as lecturer and physician, and in 1798 undertook the tour in the highlands of which his account was published in 1800. It is too diffuse, but was a valuable work in its day, and is interesting even now as an index to subsequent changes.\n\nOn 25 Dec. 1798 his wife died giving birth to his daughter, Catherine Grace, and he never recovered from this. His depression prevented him from carrying out the important post of professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at the Royal Institution, to which he was appointed in October 1799. It is further hinted that he incurred the dislike of Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, the presiding genius of the institution. It is unnecessary, however, to seek any other cause than the inadequacy of his lectures to the demands of a popular assemblage. Those, at least, which were published after his death under the title of \"Zoonomia, or the Laws of Animal Life\" (1804), though full of knowledge and exceedingly clear in style, are too technical for a popular audience. His north-country accent was against him, and ill-health rendered his delivery inanimate. After lecturing for two seasons he resigned, and commenced medical practice in London. He was beginning to meet with success when he died, 28 June 1802, of typhus fever contracted at the Marylebone Dispensary where he worked. A subscription was raised, and his Royal Institution lectures were published for the benefit of his two infant daughters, one of whom was to be the poet Mrs. Catherine Grace Godwin.\n\nGarnett was a most amiable man, who fell a victim to the susceptibility of his character and the strength of his affections. Diffident of his own powers, he was enthusiastic for the discoveries and ideas of others. He had not the genius of discovery himself, but was observant and sagacious. A passage in his \"Highland Tour\" (i. 89) anticipates the modern theory of a quasi-intelligence in plants.\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}

He was known as a translator, philologist, and philosopher. He is best known for translations of Martin Heidegger, which caused mixed reactions among specialists. He lectured in authors' courses at the philosophy faculty of Moscow State University. Bibikhin undertook a sufficient number of translations to enable him to formulate his own theory of Europe. This theory consisted in part of a return to the past, and enlivening the most valuable achievements of the past culture.\n\nBibikhin graduated from Moscow State Linguistic University in 1967 and taught language and translation theory at both the MSLU and MGIMO University. At this time, he worked mainly on philosophy and literature and studied ancient languages under Andrey Zaliznyak. He completed his postgraduate study at the faculty of philosophy, MSU in 1977 by defending his candidate's thesis, entitled: \"Semantic Potencies of the Linguistic Sign.\" The themes included in his thesis were: \n1) interrelations between word and world, \n2) word and thought, \n3) an approach to word and thought, \n4) attempt to think of the ontological foundation of language.\nThese theories were subsequently developed in a seminar called \"Inner form of word\" and in the courses \"Language of Philosophy\" and \"L. Wittgenstein.\"\n\nHe worked as a secretary and assistant for Aleksei Losev, also recording several conversations with the philosopher. These recordings were later collected and published in the book \"Aleksei Fedorovich Losev. Sergey Sergeyevich Averintsev.\" (2004)\n\nBibikhin was employed at the Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences in 1972 and served there until his death. He spent his last years working at the Centre of Methodology and Ethics of Science of the Philosophy of Science and Technology Branch of the Institute. He was a lecturer of Philosophy and member of the faculty of MSU from 1989 onward.\n\nHe lectured in authors courses and held seminars at the Faculty of Philosophy of MSU from 1980 to 2004. He also lectured at St. Philaret's Christian Institute in Moscow and St. Thomas Institute.\n\nHe was buried at Nikolo-Archangelski cemetery in Moscow.\n\nBibikhin lectured in about twenty courses at MSU and other institutes. He wrote: 'Philosophy always went against the stream. With great risk... Philosophy is for the returning from doctrines to things; for recalling the early; for the ending of divination through words. There is a difference between philosophy and the sciences: they are building themselves, philosophy is called to reconstruct itself like a scaffolding after building the house.'\n\nBibikhin believed philosophy was not an \"intellectual activity,\" nor a \"scientific sphere\" or a \"cultural sphere,\" and the philosophers' language is not a \"construction,\" or \"information about the things\" - rather, it is a 'preparation for the possibility of forming knowledge about things based on the last, utmost foundations'. To Bibikhin, Philosophy is an 'attempt — guaranteed by nothing – to give my life, human life, back the way it used to be at the very beginning: relation to the world, not to the picture, but to an event'. It is an attempt to let an event be in disinterested word, let it be the 'place where an event is shining, becoming a phenomenon, where all that exists is let to be as it really is, not controlled or placed on a register'.\n\nHeidegger's thought was essential to Bibikhin. In his four-term course \"Early Heidegger\" (1990s) Bibikhin read Heidegger's earliest works not as immature and preliminary, but as a commentary to his later writings. The course was mostly devoted, both in lecturers and seminars, to the reading and study of Heidegger's main work \"Being and Time\" (1927). Bibikhin's last seminars at the Institute of Philosophy and his last article were also dedicated to Heidegger.\n\nVladimir Bibikhin translated texts from Spanish, Italian, Latin, Greek, French, English, and German from 1967 onward. He wrote several papers and scientific reviews, as well as commentaries on translations and articles on the theory of translation (the best of them were subsequently included in the book \"Word and Event\"). Among others, Bibikhin translated the works of Iamblichus, John Amos Comenius, García Lorca, Giuseppe Mazzini, Petrarch, Nicholas of Cusa, St. Gregory Palamas, St. Macarius of Egypt, W. Heisenberg, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Jacques Ellul, Eugène Ionesco, Antonin Artaud, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Gadamer, Wilhelm Dilthey, Hannah Arendt, and Jacques Derrida. Theological translations were published under the pseudonym V. Veneaminov.\n\nBibikhin's views on philosophy of language were controversial, and were criticized by some professional philosophers and linguists.\n\nN. V. Motroshilova claimed Bibikhin had deliberately concealed Heidegger's closeness to the Nazis and ignored empirical evidence of his loyalty to the Nazi regime. She also noted the ambiguity of his \"Being and Time\" translation: 'But his translation of \"Being and Time\" is worthy of special conversation. This translation is quite interesting and valuable as an independent phenomenon, and as Bibikhin's work. But the point is that it is the first and the only 'presence' of \"Time and Being\" in Russian philosophic culture, in Russian language for now. And, unfortunately, (I've heard it from many teachers), the translation doesn't help but significantly hampers comprehension of that classic work of XX century. So I'd recommend the above-mentioned E. Borisov's translation to those just starting their mastery of Heidegger's philosophy - it is not \"Being and Time\", but Heidegger is there more intelligible and adequate'.\n\nCritics also complained of a distortion to Heidegger's works in Bibikhin's translations. For example, Aleksandr Dugin writes: 'It appears that Bibikhin and like-minded persons are really carried away by Heidegger, but there is nothing but that zeal in presentation of Heidegger. It's totally insufferable to read them because these texts say too much about conditions, efforts and sufferings of Bibikhin and his colleagues-translators, but there is almost nothing except for accidental coincidences, they say nothing about Heidegger or give the picture making one's hair stand on end.'\n\nBoris Narumov criticizes V. Bibikhin for a lack of methodology and disregard for linguistics as a science.\n\nA. Apollonov claims deliberate distortions in Bibhikin's translations in order to support his judgments by the authority of an established philosopher, citing Bibhikin's translation of Aristotle as an example.\n\nV. Bibikhin was a supporter of Chechnya's sovereignty. According to the testimony of Konstantin Anatolyevich Krylov, a personal acquaintance of Bibikhin, during the Second Chechen War Bibikhin confronted officers of the Russian Armed Forces and asked them \"not to wage war with free people.\"\n\nIn December 2003 V. Bibikhin took part in a public debate on the case of Yukos, standing on the side of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\nV. Bibikhin was an adherent to ideas of liberalism, multiculturalism, and toleration.\n\nBibikhin won the award for his book of essays \"New Renaissance.\" He was a laureate of the literary prize \"Book of the Year\" in philosophic and humanitarian thought, for the book \"Ludwig Wittgenstein: Change of Aspect\". He was also awarded the A. Piatigorsky literature prize for the best philosophic work for his \"Diaries of Leo Tolstoy\" in 2003.\n\n\nPublished posthumously:\n\nA list of author's courses lectured by Bibikhin in 1989-2004:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "684986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=684986", "title": "Wu wei", "text": "Wu wei\n\nWu wei is a concept literally meaning \"non-action\", \"non-doing\" or \"non-forcing\". Wu wei emerged in the Spring and Autumn period to become an important concept in both Taoism and Chinese statecraft. \n\nIn the \"Tao Te Ching\", Lao Tzu explains that beings (or phenomena) that are wholly in harmony with the Tao behave in a completely natural, uncontrived way. The goal of spiritual practice for the human being is, \n\nSinologist Herrlee Creel considered Wu wei a distinguishing factor between the more \"purposive\" religious Taoism of governmental Huang-Lao, emphasizing a striving for immortality, and the philosophical Taoism of the \"Zhuangzi\", which emphasizes Wu wei in the sense of not striving, often considering the search for immortality secondary, laughable, or harmful.\n\nSinologist Herrlee Creel considers Wu wei, as found in the \"Tao Te Ching\" and \"Zhuangzi\", to denote two different things.\n\n\nThe first is quite in line with the contemplative Taoism of the Zhuangzi. Described as a source of serenity in Taoist thought, only rarely do Taoist texts suggest that ordinary people could gain political power through Wu wei. The Zhuangzi does not seem to indicate a definitive philosophical idea, simply that the sage \"does not occupy himself with the affairs of the world.\" \n\nThe second sense appears to have been imported from the earlier governmental thought of \"Legalist\" Shen Buhai (400 BC – c. 337 BC) as Taoists became more interested in the exercise of power by the ruler. Called \"rule by non-activity\" and strongly advocated by Han Fei, during the Han dynasty, up until the reign of Han Wudi rulers confined their activity \"chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials\", a plainly \"Legalist\" practice inherited from the Qin dynasty. This \"conception of the ruler's role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp\" while leaving details to ministers, has a \"deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy.\"\n\nOnly appearing three times in the first (more contemplative) half of the Zhuangzi, early Taoists may have avoided the term for its association with \"Legalism\" before ultimately co-opting its governmental sense as well, as attempted in the Zhuangzi's latter half. Thought by modern scholarship to have been written after the Zhuangzi, Wu wei becomes a major \"guiding principle for social and political pursuit\" in the more \"purposive\" Taoism of the Tao Te Ching, in which the Taoist \"seeks to use his power to control and govern the world (Creel).\"\n\nIn the Taoist texts, \"wu wei\" ( ) is often associated with water and its yielding nature. In illustration, it can assume any form or shape it inhabits.\n\n\"Wu\" may be translated as \"not have\" or \"without\"; \"Wei\" may be translated as \"do, act, serve as, govern \"or\" effort\". The literal meaning of \"wu wei\" is \"without action\", \"without effort\", or \"without control\", and is often included in the paradox wei wu wei: \"action without action\" or \"effortless doing\". The practice of \"wu wei\" and the efficacy of \"wei wu wei\" are fundamental tenets in Chinese thought and have been mostly emphasized by the Taoist school. One cannot actively pursue \"wu wei\". It manifests as a result of cultivation. The Tao is a guide.\n\nThere is another less commonly referenced sense of \"wu wei\"; \"action that does not involve struggle or excessive effort\". In this instance, \"wu\" means \"without\" and Wei means \"effort\". The concept of \"effortless action\" is a part of Taoist Internal martial arts such as T'ai chi ch'uan, Baguazhang and Xing Yi. It follows that wu wei complies with the distinguishing feature of Taoism, that of being natural.\n\nIn Zen Calligraphy, wu wei has been represented as an \"ensō\" (circle); in China, the calligraphic inscriptions of the words \"wu wei\" themselves resonate with old Taoist stories.\n\nSeveral chapters of the most important Taoist text, the \"Tao Te Ching\", attributed to Laozi, allude to \"diminishing doing\" or \"diminishing will\" as the key aspect of the sage's success. Taoist philosophy recognizes that the Universe already works harmoniously according to its own ways; as a person exerts their will against or upon the world they disrupt the harmony that already exists. This is not to say that a person should not exert agency and will. Rather, it is \"how\" one acts in relation to the natural processes already existent. The \"how\", the Tao of intention and motivation, \"that\" is key.\n\nRelated translation from the \"Tao Tê Ching\" by Priya Hemenway, Chapter II:\n\nSinologist Herrlee G. Creel believed that an important clue to the development of \"wu wei\" existed in the \"Analects\", in a saying attributed to Confucius, which reads: \"The Master said, 'Was it not Shun who did nothing and yet ruled well? What did he do? He merely corrected his person and took his proper position as ruler'\". The concept of a divine king whose \"magic power\" (virtue) \"regulates everything in the land\" (Creel) pervades early Chinese philosophy, particularly \"in the early branches of Quietism that developed in the fourth century B.C.\"\n\nHowever, no government has long been able to practice \"doing nothing\" and stay in power. Unable to find his philosopher-king, Confucius placed his hope in virtuous ministers. Apart from the Confucian ruler's \"divine essence\" (\"ling\") \"ensuring the fecundity of his people\" and fertility of the soil, Creel notes that he was also assisted by \"five servants\", who \"performed the active functions of government.\" Xun Kuang's \"Xunzi\", a Confucian adaptation to Qin \"Legalism\", defines the ruler in much the same sense, saying that the ruler \"need only correct his person\" because the \"abilities of the ruler appear in his appointment of men to office\": namely, appraising virtue and causing others to perform.\n\nMore important information lay in the recovery of the fragments of administrator (aka \"Legalist\") Shen Buhai. Shen references Yao as using Fa (administrative method) in the selection and evaluation of men. Shen used the term Wu wei to mean that the ruler, though vigilant, should not interfere with the duties of his ministers, saying \"One who has the right way of government does not perform the functions of the five (aka various) officials, and yet is the master of the government\". Though not a conclusive argument against proto-Taoist influence, Shen's Taoist terms do not show evidence of Taoist usage (Confucianism also uses terms like \"Tao\", meaning the \"Tao\", or \"Way\" of government), lacking any metaphysical connotation. The later \"Legalist\" book, the Han Feizi has a commentary on the Tao Te Ching, but references Shen Buhai rather than Laozi for this usage. \n\nSince the bulk of both the \"Tao Te Ching\" and the \"Zhuangzi\" appear to have been composed later, Creel argued that it may therefore be assumed that Shen influenced them, much of both appearing to be counter-arguments against \"Legalist\" controls. The thirteenth chapter of the Zhuangzi, \"T'ien Tao\", seems to follow Shen Buhai down to the detail, saying \"Superiors must be without action in-order to control the world; inferiors must be active in-order to be employed in the world's business...\" and to paraphrase, that foundation and principle are the responsibility of the superior, superstructure and details that of the minister, but then goes on to attack Shen's administrative details as non-essential. \n\nElsewhere the Zhuangzi references another \"Legalist\", Shen Dao, as impartial and lacking selfishness, his \"great way embracing all things\".\n\n\"Legalism\" dominated the intellectual life of the Qin and early Han together with Taoism. Early Han dynasty Emperors like Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 BCE) would be steeped in a Taoistic laissez-faire. But Shen Buhai's book would be widely studied even from the beginning of the Han era. Jia Yi's (200–168 AD) Hsin-shu, undoubtedly influenced by the \"Legalists\", describes Shen Buhai's techniques as methods of applying the Tao, or virtue, bringing together Confucian and Taoist discourses under the imagery of the Zhuangzi. Many later texts, for instance in Huang-Lao, use similar images to describe the quiescent attitude of the ruler. \n\nThe Huang-Lao \"Huainanzi\" (Western Han Dynasty 206 B.C. – 9 A.D.), arguing against Legalist centralization, would go on to include naturalist arguments in favour of rule by worthies on the basis that one needs their competence for such things as diplomacy, and defines wu-wei as follows: \"What is meant ... by wu-wei is that no personal prejudice [private or public will,] interferes with the universal Tao [the laws of things], and that no desires and obsessions lead the true course ... astray. Reason must guide action in order that power may be exercised according to the intrinsic properties and natural trends of things.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18911094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18911094", "title": "Yin yoga", "text": "Yin yoga\n\nYin yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga with postures, or \"asanas\", that are held for longer periods of time—for beginners, it may range from 45 seconds to two minutes; more advanced practitioners may stay in one \"asana\" for five minutes or more.\n\nYin yoga poses apply moderate stress to the connective tissues of the body—the tendons, fascia, and ligaments—with the aim of increasing circulation in the joints and improving flexibility. A more meditative approach to yoga, yin aims at cultivating awareness of inner silence, and bringing to light a universal, interconnecting quality.\n\nYin yoga's teaching in the Western world, beginning in the late 1970s, was founded by martial arts expert and Taoist yoga teacher Paulie Zink. Yin yoga is now being taught across North America and in Europe, due in large part to the teaching activities of Yin yoga teachers and developers Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers. Yin yoga as taught by Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers is not intended as a complete practice in itself, but rather as a complement to more active forms of yoga and exercise. However, Paulie Zink's approach includes the full range of Taoist yoga, both yin and yang, and is intended to be a complete practice in itself.\n\nThe practice of holding yoga postures or \"asanas\" for extended periods of time has always been a significant part of traditional yoga practice, both in the hatha yoga tradition of India and in the Taoist yoga tradition of the greater China area. Contemporary schools of hatha yoga have also advocated holding some poses for relatively long periods of time. For example, BKS Iyengar recommended holding the Supta Virasana asana (reclining hero pose) for 10–15 minutes. For that matter, long-held stretches have been and are commonly recommended in other physical disciplines, such as gymnastics and dance, to increase flexibility. For example, ballerinas are commonly counselled to open their hips by approximating the splits position for long periods of time.\n\nTaoist yoga practices from China also included yin-style poses in the Taoist system of \"Internal Alchemy\"—practiced for the purpose of improving health and longevity. Techniques for stretching of this type have been practiced for centuries in China and Taiwan as part of Taoist yoga, which was sometimes known as Dao Yin. Taoist priests taught long-held poses, along with breathing techniques, to Kung Fu practitioners beginning 2000 years ago, to help them fully develop their martial arts skills.\n\nThe practice of performing series of long-held floor poses one after the other was first introduced in North America in the late 1970s by Paulie Zink, a martial arts champion and Taoist yoga teacher and practitioner. Zink trained for 10 years, during the 1970s, in daily private classes with Cho Chat Ling, a Kung-Fu and Taoist yoga master from Hong Kong specializing in \"Tai shing pek kwar,\" or Monkey Kung Fu. (In Kung Fu, the movements of animals are closely studied and emulated, inspiring many of the movements taught in Kung Fu.) At the end of the decade, Zink entered the Long Beach International Karate Championships in 1981, 1982 and 1983 and won Grand Champion in the \"weapons forms\" category in all three years, and was also Grand Champion in the \"empty hands\" category in two of those years. Black Belt magazine named him Kung Fu artist of the year in 1989. Noted in the Kung Fu community for his exceptional personal flexibility, Zink also emphasized flexibility training in his martial arts classes as a method to develop agility, power and endurance.\n\nIn the late 70s, Zink began, separate from his martial arts classes, to teach a synthesis of hatha yoga with a range of disciplines from Taoist Yoga, as well as postures, movements and insights that he had developed himself. He later called this synthesis \"Yin and Yang yoga,\" or often \"Yin yoga\" for short. Paulie Zink, even more than his master, was convinced of the effectiveness of holding yoga poses for long periods of time in order to improve flexibility.\n\nIn his first years of teaching, many of Zink's students were martial artists who had developed strong but tight muscles, and he taught them only beginner level Taoist yoga, focusing on long-held yin poses to allieviate their lack of flexibility. However, as more students came he began to teach more advanced levels. He explained that in order to develop full flexibility, the student must restore his own primal nature, through several Taoist yoga practices, as follows: yin \"asanas\"— mostly sitting or lying postures; yang \"asanas\"— more active, strenuous postures; Taoist Flow yoga— both yin and yang yoga postures practiced in continuous, smooth and circular motions; \"Chi Kung\" (or Qigong)— involving simple and gentle movement and breathing techniques; and Taoist alchemy— based upon the Taoist theory of the five elements used in Chinese medicine. Taoist Alchemy is a method of embodying the energetic attributes of various animals and enlivening the five alchemical elements believed to be contained in the body's energetic field. The five transforming energies of Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire animate distinct qualities in the body such as calm, strength, fluidity, springiness and lightness, respectively.\n\nPaul Grilley, a yoga teacher who later became a major proponent of Yin yoga, first saw Paulie Zink on a public access television talk show in California in 1988, performing a demonstration of Taoist yoga practices that he used in teaching martial arts. Impressed by both his exceptional physical flexibility and his gentle, restrained manner, absent the arrogance he had observed in other martial artists, he sought Zink out and studied with him for about one year.\n\nEarlier, Grilley had formally studied anatomy for two years in his home state, Montana, under Dr. Garry Parker. He moved to California and continued studying anatomy at UCLA. There, he also regularly taught hatha yoga for several years—active forms including Ashtanga and Bikram's--and managed a yoga studio. In 1989, Grilley met Hiroshi Motoyama, a Japanese scholar and yogi, who had researched the physiology of Traditional Chinese Medicine and written on it extensively. Motoyama was especially interested in the physiology of the meridians, or subtle pathways and vessels, and the \"qi\" or subtle energy hypothesized to flow through or get stored in them. These are both fundamental concepts in Chinese medicine and acupuncture. He related these to the parallel concepts of the \"nadi\" pathways and \"chakras\" of Indian yoga, and the \"prana\" said to be carried within them.\n\nGrilley now began to teach a fusion of the Yin poses he had learned from Zink with his own knowledge of hatha yoga and anatomy, and the teachings of Motoyama. He created yin sequences with aims similar to that of an acupuncturist. Yin teacher and author Ulrica Norberg says that Grilley, based on this fusion of knowledge, \"evolved Yin yoga further.\" Bernie Clark, a leading Yin yoga author and teacher said that Grilley's synthesis of anatomy, Taoist yoga, and meridian theory \"resonated with many people who recognized the benefits of the practice and related to Paul's model of the body/mind/soul.\" \n\nOne of Grilley's students, Sarah Powers, also a yoga teacher, began teaching yoga in Grilley's style. She incorporated Buddhist psychology in her teaching of Yin yoga and put even more emphasis on targeting the meridian systems for health and enlightenment than did Grilley. Much of her book, \"Insight Yoga,\" is devoted to an explanation of Yin yoga sequences designed to enhance the flow of \"qi\" as understood in Traditional Chinese Medicine. She also emphasized a conscious and systematic approach to breathing during yin practice.\n\nGrilley at first called it Taoist yoga, in deference to the term Paulie Zink had used. Sarah Powers pointed out that the yoga she and Grilley were teaching was different from the Taoist practice being taught by Zink. She suggested they use the term Yin yoga, to differentiate it from the various forms of Taoist yoga being taught. She and Grilley adopted the name. Later, Paulie Zink also began calling his teachings Yin yoga, though as a short form for his preferred term, \"Yin and Yang Yoga.\"\n\nSarah Powers, already a renowned yoga teacher who traveled widely giving yoga workshops, now began also teaching Yin yoga in her tours. When her students asked for more information, she would refer them to Paul Grilley, who began receiving requests to travel and offer seminars. Paulie Zink continued teaching Yin yoga in his own style, combined with other elements of Taoist yoga. Powers and Grilley began offering Yin yoga teacher training courses, as did Paulie Zink. Over the next 10 years, Yin yoga became available all over North America and in Europe, through yoga classes, and via DVDs and books. In 2002, Grilley published the book, \"Yin yoga: A Quiet Practice\" (and in 2012 a revised edition titled, \"Yin yoga Principles and Practice\"). In 2006, Biff Mithoefer, a student of Grilley and Powers, published The Yin yoga Kit, which included a detailed volume of instruction as well as a DVD. In 2008, Sarah Powers published the book, \"Insight Yoga,\" which teaches Yin yoga sequences and more active (or yang) yoga sequences as a complement to yin poses. Bernie Clark, also a student of Grilley and Powers, began the website, yinyoga.com, in 2006 and published his book, \"The Complete Guide to Yin yoga\" in 2012. Both Grilley and Powers have also released instructional DVDs on Yin yoga, as has Paulie Zink.\n\nPaulie Zink's approach to Yin yoga consists of both yin and yang postures, and also incorporates movement in between postures as a yang element. In contrast, Yin yoga sessions taught by Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers consist of a series of long-held, passive floor poses—which Grilley learned from Paulie Zink —that primarily affect the lower part of the body—the hips, pelvis, inner thighs, lower spine—about 18 - 24 in number. These areas are especially rich in connective tissues, the \"loading\" of which (Yin yoga teachers avoid the word \"stretching\") is a main focus in this style of yoga. Grilley and Powers both emphasize the value of more active, yang-type poses, but do not generally mix yin and yang styles.\n\nYin yoga employs specific sequences of poses aimed at stimulating particular meridians, or subtle channels, as understood in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the far eastern counterpart of India's Ayurveda; the system of medicine claims that there are energy channels of the subtle body, called \"nadi\" (Sanskrit for \"stream\"), with the \"ida\", \"pingala\", and \"sushumna\" as the principal or most important \"nadis\".\n\nDuring the long hold times of the yin asanas, teachers usually give \"dharma talks,\" informal monologues drawing from a variety of sources, according to teachers' choice. They will often explain the physiology and anatomy of poses, including the location of the meridian lines being affected. They may tell traditional Buddhist stories, recite poetry, sing songs, or reflect on their own experience.\n\nIn keeping with its roots in Taoist yoga, Paulie Zink says that Yin yoga has a deeper purpose: to \"open the heart and invoke the primal self.\" Sarah Powers says one of the primary objectives of yin practice is the cultivation of inner stillness.\n\nYin yoga is based on the Taoist concepts of yin and yang, opposite and complementary principles in nature. Yin could be described as stable, immobile, feminine, passive, cold, and downward moving. Yang is understood to be changing, mobile, masculine, active, hot, and upward moving. The sun is considered yang, the moon yin. In the body, the relatively stiff connective tissues (tendons, ligaments, fascia) are yin, while the more mobile and pliable muscles and blood are yang. More passive asanas in yoga are considered yin, whereas the more active, dynamic asanas are yang, because they stimulate the muscles and generate heat.\n\nAlthough many Yin yoga poses or \"asanas\" closely resemble the \"asanas\" in Indian hatha yoga, they have different names, in part to alert those who are familiar with similar poses in hatha yoga not to perform them in the same way. In general, the poses of Yin yoga are performed with very little muscular exertion. For example, in the Seal pose, in which a practitioner lies face down and then raises the trunk upward, the upward movement is gradual and entirely supported by the arms, and the legs are relaxed. But in the Cobra or \"Bhujangasana\" of hatha yoga, the practitioner actively curves the spine upward in an arc using arms and lower back muscles, and reaches back with the legs strongly.\n\nMuscles account for about forty percent of the resistance against the body's flexibility, while connective tissue accounts for about fifty percent. The intensity and physical benefits of Yin yoga practice depend on two variables: duration of the asana, and the temperature of the muscle. Asanas are usually held for five minutes, but can be held for as long as twenty. Because of the long duration of asanas, it is said that patience is another of the key values cultivated by Yin yoga.\nIt is usually recommended that Yin yoga be practiced when the muscles are not yet warmed up. When the muscles are cold, they are less elastic, and more stress will be transferred to the connective tissue. However, this is a general rule and for some people, it is better to stay a bit warm while practicing. Because this style of yoga does not generate bodily heat, yin teachers recommend keeping the temperature of the room a little higher than usual. During yin asanas, muscles are relaxed to avoid tetany, or muscle spasm, which could result from engaging muscles for long periods.\n\n\n"}
