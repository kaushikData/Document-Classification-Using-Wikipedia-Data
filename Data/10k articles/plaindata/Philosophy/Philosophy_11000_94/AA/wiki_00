Luce\n\nArthur Aston Luce (21 August 1882 – 28 June 1977) was professor of philosophy at Trinity College, Dublin, and also Precentor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin (1952–1973). Luce held many clerical appointments, including Vice-Provost of Trinity from 1946 to 1952. He was widely known as an authority on the philosopher George Berkeley. His fellowship of Trinity College from 1912 to 1977 is a record.\n\nLuce was born in Gloucester on 21 August 1882. He was the fourth son of the Reverend John James Luce and Alice Luce (née Stubbs). He was educated at Lindley Lodge School and Eastbourne College. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1901. He obtained his BA in 1905, BD in 1908 and MA in 1911.\n\nLuce's earlier work focuses largely on theological matters within Christianity. His academic career was interrupted by World War I, in which he served with the 12th Royal Irish Rifles. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1917. After the war, he published \"Monophysitism Past and Present\" (1921) which deals with the nature of Jesus and his relationship to the world. The following year, he published his Donnellan Lectures on Henri Bergson where he examined issues in psychology and evolution as well as religion.\n\nFrom the 1930s, Luce became interested in the Irish philosopher George Berkeley. Luce felt many of the previous studies of Berkeley were in many ways inadequate and sometimes wrong. His unearthing of new sources on Berkeley as well as better ways of interpreting existing sources guided Luce's work in this direction. Luce stressed the role of the French monk Malebranche on influencing the thought of the young Berkeley. Prior to Luce's \"Berkeley and Malebranche\" (1934) Berkeley had been seen almost solely in the patrimony of John Locke and empiricism.\n\nBerkeley's mature philosophy was given lucid exposition by Luce in his 1945 work \"Berkeley's Immaterialism\". Along with Thomas Edmund Jessop he edited \"The Works of George Berkeley\" (in nine volumes, 1948–1957).\n\nLuce was not only a Berkeley scholar but came to be a believer in Berkelianism itself. In \"Sense without Matter\" (1954) Luce attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernising the philosophers vocabulary and putting the issues Berkeley faced in today's terms. In this work, Luce also treats of the Biblical account of matter (or rather the lack of such an account) and the psychology of perception and nature.\n\nBerkeley's personal reputation among historians and the public was also an area which Luce felt needed correcting and updating. Some studies of Berkeley had contributed to his reputation as a dreamer or a loner who often hid his real views. Luce's \"Life of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne\" (1949) takes aim at this picture of Berkeley and by careful use of (often new) sources paints a more grounded picture of the man.\n\nIn 1918, Luce married Lilian Mary Thomson with whom he had three children. Tragically, his wife and young daughter drowned in 1940. His elder son Professor John Victor Luce(1920-2011) was also a academic at Trinity and also served as Vice-Provost. His original academic work and numerous administrative and clerical appointments earned him a solid local and international reputation. He was regarded as a fine preacher and respected tutor. His hobbies were chess and particularly angling on which he wrote a book (\"Fishing and Thinking\" 1959) which is regarded highly among anglers: to his freshmen philosophy students, he would muse, \"fishing and philosophy: trout and truth!\" He died, shortly after an assault, on 28 June 1977.\n\n\n"}

These are opposed to isozymes, which are enzymes that perform the same function, but which are coded by genes located at different loci.\n\nAlloenzymes are common biological enzymes that exhibit high levels of functional evolutionary conservation throughout specific phyla and kingdoms. They are used by phylogeneticists as molecular markers to gauge evolutionary histories and relationships between different species. This can be done because allozymes do not have the same structure. They can be separated by capillary electrophoresis. However, some species are monomorphic for many of their allozymes which would make it difficult for phylogeneticists to assess the evolutionary histories of these species. In these instances, phylogeneticists would have to use another method to determine the evolutionary history of a species.\n\nThese enzymes generally perform very basic functions found commonly throughout all lifeforms, such as DNA polymerase, the enzyme that repairs and copies DNA. Significant changes in this enzyme reflect significant events in evolutionary history of organisms. As expected DNA polymerase shows relatively small differences in its amino acid sequence between phyla and even kingdoms.\n\nThe key to choosing which alloenzyme to use in a comparison between multiple species is to choose one that is as variable as possible while still being present in all the organisms. By comparing the amino acid sequence of the enzyme in the species, more amino acid similarities should be seen in species that are more closely related, and fewer between those that are more distantly related. The less well conserved the enzyme is, the more amino acid differences will be present in even closely related species.\n\n"}

Rector – for the second time – of the Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, he was a member of the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNŢCD), serving as Minister of Education in the Democratic Convention (CDR) coalition governments of Victor Ciorbea, Radu Vasile, and Mugur Isărescu (1997-2000). In January 2001, he replaced Ion Diaconescu as PNŢCD chairman, but resigned from his post in July 2001, amid political tensions in the party. He formed a new party, the Popular Christian Party later in the year. Later, he affiliated with the National Liberal Party (PNL).\n\nMarga has authored a large number of volumes on political science, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history. His work touches a variety of subjects, including the philosophical theories of Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas, the nature of positivism, and trends in contemporary philosophy. He has also lectured on specific subjects, such as the philosophic foundations of transition from communism to a market economy, and the evolution of principles guiding European integration. In later works, he approached topics pertaining to the philosophy of religion, and to the status of religion in the age of globalization. In 2005, Andrei Marga received the Herder Prize in recognition of his contributions.\n\nMarga was born in Bucharest, attended the University of Cluj and also had a one-year scholarship at the University of Freiburg (West Germany).\n\nIn 1993, he became the rector of the Babeş-Bolyai University, of Cluj-Napoca.\n\nAs minister, Andrei Marga promoted educational system reform, stressing that the communist legacy had contributed to a rise in political corruption, and indicating that Romanian education lacked staples of professionalism such as underlined purposes, standards in certification, and evaluation criteria. Marga also criticized the system for relying on \"original features\" and \"Romanian traditions\", which had been explained as a means to promote national development, but, in effect, had contributed to the gap between Romania and the Western world. He called for modernization, and defined his goals as \"increasing the links between education and the economic, administrative and cultural environment, improving the educational infrastructure, eliminating paternalism and populism from educational management, and enhancing international cooperation in education\".\n\nThe program was criticized by the political opposition, who argued that the system in place was satisfactory, and blamed the existing problems on the post-1989 political and social climate. In parallel, supporters of reform were dissatisfied with its slow pace and inadequate financing.\n\nIn early 1998, a controversy erupted in Romanian politics, after the CDR announced that it was planning to stand by the plan to set up separate universities for the Hungarian minority. The decision was in turn based on a promise made to their coalition partner, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. In this context, Marga took the middle ground, saying that he supported separate Hungarian-language sections but not separate institutions (a similar view was expressed by the CDR's other coalition partner, the Democratic Party).\n\nMarga joined the PNŢCD in 1999, and became its leader two years later. Party rules prohibited members with less than five years in the party from running for party president. During the party's congress, a few candidates resigned in support of Marga and the party's constitution was amended to allow Marga to run. Marga defeated his conservative opponents with the support of the congress in spite of opposition from the party hierarchy. He was brought in to reform the party and position it to recover from the losses of the December 2000 election. His tenure failed to bring in the rapid changes desired and opposition from prominent conservative elements in his party stifled his ideas. He resigned in July 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Marga joined the PNŢCD's former coalition partner, the National Liberal Party. From May to August 2012, Marga served as Foreign Minister in the government of Victor Ponta.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work is in the same poetic form as the majority of medieval French \"romans\", although significantly shorter than the romances of Chrétien de Troyes). The work has come down to us in 20 manuscripts, though manuscripts C and G are the ones most commonly referred to, with the Folio Classiques edition using the former, which has 958 lines, and the Livre de Poche edition using the latter of 965 verses. The oldest extant version was written in the late 13th Century, in approximately 1288, and the presumed date for the composition of the work is the first half of that century. Some critics believe that the romance (other than the ending) is a \"roman à clef\" and that elements are based on true events.\n\nThe \"Châtelaine de Vergy\" was apparently very popular in courtly circles. There exists as well a 15th-century prose version of the tale, and the plot was reused by Marguerite de Navarre in one of her \"Heptameron\" short stories (tale LXX). There are also multiple examples of the tale being portrayed in art, including various chests depicting scenes from the poem.\n\nWhether or not the text is part of the Courtly Love tradition has been widely debated, especially given Gaston de Paris and C.S. Lewis' definitions of the concept.\n\nThe \"Châtelaine de Vergy\" tells the story of an unnamed knight in the service of the Duke of Burgundy who is the lover of the Châtelaine of Vergy, the Duke's niece. The Châtelaine has accepted this knight's love on one condition: that he must keep their relationship secret from everyone, and that when he comes to visit her, he must wait for her little dog to come out to him in the garden, which signals that she is alone and the knight may come see her. \n\nWhen the Duchess of Burgundy falls in love with the knight, he is forced to spurn her advances, citing his loyalty to the Duke and his love for another. In her anger, the duchess then tells her husband that the knight is unfaithful and has tried to seduce her, and the Duke accuses the knight of treachery. To save his honor, and to avoid being exiled (and thus forced to distance himself from his mistress), the knight, once the lord has promised to keep his secret, reveals to his lord where his heart truly lies, thus violating his promise to his mistress.\n\nThe Duke reveals the truth of the knight's love to his wife, trusting her to keep the secret; but, at the feast of \"Pentecoste\", the Duchess makes a cruel inside joke to the Châtelaine about her lover and her \"well-trained dog\". The Châtelaine realizes her lover has not kept his promise and she dies in despair. The knight discovers her body and kills himself. The Duke finds both bodies, and exacts vengeance on his wife by killing her with the knight's sword, and then becomes a knight Templar.\n\n"}

It was co-founded in 1983 by Jacques Derrida, François Châtelet, Jean-Pierre Faye and Dominique Lecourt in an attempt to re-think the teaching of philosophy in France, and to liberate it from any institutional authority (most of all from the University). Its financing is mainly through public funds. Its chairs or \"directors of program\" are competitively elected for 6 years (non renewable), following an international open call for proposals (every third year). Proposals are free and directors are elected after a collegial, peer-assessment of their value for philosophy. The College recognizes that philosophy is better served by being located at \"intersections\" such as Philosophy/Science, or Philosophy/Law. Proposals must respond to this exigency of \"intersection\" as wished by Jacques Derrida. The College has few registered students, who may receive the \"Diplôme du Collège international de philosophie\", which is not a university degree but may be, in some cases, validated by French or foreign universities. Otherwise, attendance to seminars is open and free.\n\nAccording to Derrida, he was inspired by the Cerisy study center to found this new institution, in the midst of governmental threats on the teaching of philosophy in the last class of high school. Thus was created this College, \"from a non-governmental origin, with an international span, an institution which is not destined to oppose itself, but to balance, question, open, occupy margins ; where we would privilege infrequent approaches or approaches yet unlegitimized by the university, new objects, new themes, new fields; where we would treat more of intersections than of academic disciplines\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For example, consider the proposition \"all students are lazy\". \nBecause this statement makes the claim that a certain property (laziness) holds for \"all\" students, even a \"single\" example of a diligent student will prove it false.\nThus, any hard-working student is a counterexample to \"all students are lazy\".\nMore precisely, a counterexample is a specific instance of the falsity of a universal quantification (a \"for all\" statement).\n\nIn mathematics, this term is (by a slight abuse) also sometimes used for examples illustrating the necessity of the full hypothesis of a theorem, by considering a case where a part of the hypothesis is not verified, and where one can show that the conclusion does not hold.\n\nIn mathematics, counterexamples are often used to prove the boundaries of possible theorems. By using counterexamples to show that certain conjectures are false, mathematical researchers avoid going down blind alleys and learn how to modify conjectures to produce provable theorems.\n\nSuppose that a mathematician is studying geometry and shapes, and she wishes to prove certain theorems about them. She conjectures that \"All rectangles are squares\". She can either attempt to prove the truth of this statement using deductive reasoning, or if she suspects that her conjecture is false, she might attempt to find a counterexample. In this case, a counterexample would be a rectangle that is not a square, like a rectangle with two sides of length 5 and two sides of length 7. However, despite having found rectangles that were not squares, all the rectangles she did find had four sides. She then makes the new conjecture \"All rectangles have four sides\". This is weaker than her original conjecture, since every square has four sides, even though not every four-sided shape is a square.\n\nThe previous paragraph explained how a mathematician might weaken her conjecture in the face of counterexamples, but counterexamples can also be used to show that the assumptions and hypothesis are needed. Suppose that after a while the mathematician in question settled on the new conjecture \"All shapes that are rectangles and have four sides of equal length are squares\". This conjecture has two parts to the hypothesis: the shape must be 'a rectangle' and 'have four sides of equal length' and the mathematician would like to know if she can remove either assumption and still maintain the truth of her conjecture. So she needs to check the truth of the statements: (1) \"All shapes that are rectangles are squares\" and (2) \"All shapes that have four sides of equal length are squares\". A counterexample to (1) was already given, and a counterexample to (2) is a non-square rhombus. Thus the mathematician sees that both assumptions were necessary.\n\nA counterexample to the statement \"all prime numbers are odd numbers\" is the number 2, as it is a prime number but is not an odd number. Neither of the numbers 7 or 10 is a counterexample, as neither contradicts the statement. In this example, 2 is the only possible counterexample to the statement, but only a single example is needed to contradict \"\"All\" prime numbers are odd numbers\". Similarly the statement \"All natural numbers are either prime or composite\" has the number 1 as a counterexample as 1 is neither prime nor composite.\n\nEuler's sum of powers conjecture was disproved by counterexample. It asserted that at least \"n\" \"n\" powers were necessary to sum to another \"n\" power. The conjecture was disproved in 1966 with a counterexample involving \"n\" = 5; other \"n\" = 5 counterexamples are now known, as are some \"n\" = 4 counterexamples.\n\nWitsenhausen's counterexample shows that it is not always true for control problems that a quadratic loss function and a linear equation of evolution of the state variable imply optimal control laws that are linear.\n\nOther examples include the disproofs of the Seifert conjecture, the Pólya conjecture, the conjecture of Hilbert's fourteenth problem, Tait's conjecture, and the Ganea conjecture.\n\nIn philosophy, counterexamples are usually used to argue that a certain philosophical position is wrong by showing that it does not apply in certain cases. Unlike mathematicians, philosophers cannot prove their claims beyond any doubt, so other philosophers are free to disagree and try to find counterexamples in response. Of course, now the first philosopher can argue that the alleged counterexample does not really apply.\n\nAlternatively, the first philosopher can modify their claim so that the counterexample no longer applies; this is analogous to when a mathematician modifies a conjecture because of a counterexample.\n\nFor example, in Plato's \"Gorgias\", Callicles, trying to define what it means to say that some people are \"better\" than others, claims that those who are stronger are better.\n\nBut Socrates replies that, because of their strength of numbers, the class of common rabble is stronger than the propertied class of nobles, even though the masses are prima facie of worse character. Thus Socrates has proposed a counterexample to Callicles' claim, by looking in an area that Callicles perhaps did not expect — groups of people rather than individual persons.\n\nCallicles might challenge Socrates' counterexample, arguing perhaps that the common rabble really are better than the nobles, or that even in their large numbers, they still are not stronger. But if Callicles accepts the counterexample, then he must either withdraw his claim or modify it so that the counterexample no longer applies. For example, he might modify his claim to refer only to individual persons, requiring him to think of the common people as a collection of individuals rather than as a mob.\n\nAs it happens, he modifies his claim to say \"wiser\" instead of \"stronger\", arguing that no amount of numerical superiority can make people wiser.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12398202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12398202", "title": "Counterpart theory", "text": "Counterpart theory\n\nIn philosophy, specifically in the area of modal metaphysics, counterpart theory is an alternative to standard (Kripkean) possible-worlds semantics for interpreting quantified modal logic. Counterpart theory still presupposes possible worlds, but differs in certain important respects from the Kripkean view. The form of the theory most commonly cited was developed by David Lewis, first in a paper and later in his book \"On the Plurality of Worlds\".\n\nCounterpart theory (hereafter \"CT\"), as formulated by Lewis, requires that individuals exist in only one world. The standard account of possible worlds assumes that a modal statement about an individual (e.g., \"it is possible that x is y\") means that there is a possible world, W, where the individual x has the property y; in this case there is only one individual, x, at issue. On the contrary, counterpart theory supposes that this statement is really saying that there is a possible world, W, wherein exists an individual that is not x itself, but rather a distinct individual 'x' different from but nonetheless similar to x. So, when I state that I might have been a banker (rather than a philosopher) according to counterpart theory I am saying not that I exist in another possible world where I am a banker, but rather my counterpart does. Nevertheless, this statement about my counterpart is still held to ground the truth of the statement that I might have been a banker. The requirement that any individual exist in only one world is to avoid what Lewis termed the \"problem of accidental intrinsics\" which (he held) would require a single individual to both have and simultaneously not have particular properties.\n\nIn its formalization, counterpart theoretic formalization of modal discourse also departs from the standard formulation by eschewing use of modality operators (Necessarily, Possibly) in favor of quantifiers that range over worlds and 'counterparts' of individuals in those worlds. Lewis put forth a set of primitive predicates and a number of axioms governing CT and a scheme for translating standard modal claims in the language of quantified modal logic into his CT.\n\nIn addition to interpreting modal claims about objects and possible worlds, CT can also be applied to the identity of a single object at different points in time. The view that an object can retain its identity over time is often called endurantism, and it claims that objects are ‘wholly present’ at different moments (see the counterpart relation, below). An opposing view is that any object in time is made up of temporal parts or is perduring.\n\nDavid Lewis' view on possible worlds is sometimes called modal realism.\n\nThe possibilities that CT is supposed to describe are “ways a world might be” (Lewis 1986:86) or more exactly:\n\nAdd also the following “principle of recombination,” which Lewis describes this way: “patching together parts of different possible worlds yields another possible world […]. [A]nything can coexist with anything else, […] provided they occupy distinct spatiotemporal positions.” (Lewis 1986:87-88). But these possibilities should be restricted by CT.\n\nThe counterpart relation (hereafter C-relation) differs from the notion of identity. Identity is a reflexive, symmetric, and transitive relation. The counterpart relation is only a similarity relation; it needn’t be transitive or symmetric. The C-relation is also known as genidentity (Carnap 1967), I-relation (Lewis 1983), and the unity relation (Perry 1975).\n\nIf identity is shared between objects in different possible worlds then the same object can be said to exist in different possible worlds (a \"trans-world\" object, that is, a series of objects sharing a single identity).\n\nAn important part of the way Lewis’s worlds deliver possibilities is the use of the parthood relation. This gives some neat formal machinery, mereology. This is an axiomatic system that uses formal logic to describe the relationship between parts and wholes, and between parts within a whole. Especially important, and most reasonable, according to Lewis, is the strongest form that accepts the existence of mereological sums or the thesis of unrestricted mereological composition (Lewis 1986:211-213).\n\nAs a formal theory, counterpart theory can be used to translate sentences into modal quantificational logic. Sentences that seem to be quantifying over possible individuals should be translated into CT. (Explicit primitives and axioms have not yet been stated for the temporal or spatial use of CT.) Let CT be stated in quantificational logic and contain the following primitives:\n\nWe have the following axioms (taken from Lewis 1968):\n\nIt is an uncontroversial assumption to assume that the primitives and the axioms A1 through A8 make the standard counterpart system.\n\n\nCT can be applied to the relationship between identical objects in different worlds or at different times. Depending on the subject, there are different reasons for accepting CT as a description of the relation between different entities.\n\nDavid Lewis defended Modal realism. This is the view that a possible world is a concrete, maximal connected spatio-temporal region. The actual world is one of the possible worlds; it is also concrete. Because a single concrete object demands spatio-temporal connectedness, a possible concrete object can only exist in one possible world. Still, we say true things like: It is possible that Hubert Humphrey won the 1968 US presidential election. How is it true? Humphrey has a counterpart in another possible world that wins the 1968 election in that world.\n\nLewis also argues against three other alternatives that might be compatible with possibilism: overlapping individuals, trans-world individuals, and haecceity.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Peter van Inwagen (1985), see no problem with identity within a world . Lewis seems to share this attitude. He says:\n\nAn overlapping individual has a part in the actual world and a part in another world. Because identity is not problematic, we get overlapping individuals by having overlapping worlds. Two worlds overlap if they share a common part. But some properties of overlapping objects are, for Lewis, troublesome (Lewis 1986:199-210).\n\nThe problem is with an object’s accidental intrinsic properties, such as shape and weight, which supervene on its parts. Humphrey could have the property of having six fingers on his left hand. How does he do that? It can’t be true that Humphrey has both the property of having six fingers and five fingers on his left hand. What we might say is that he has five fingers \"at this\" world and six fingers \"at that\" world. But how should these modifiers be understood?\n\nAccording to McDaniel (2004), if Lewis is right, the defender of overlapping individuals has to accept genuine contradictions or defend the view that every object has all its properties essentially.\n\nHow can you be one year older than you are? One way is to say that there is a possible world where you exist. Another way is for you to have a counterpart in that possible world, who has the property of being one year older than you.\n\nTake Humphrey: if he is a trans-world individual he is the mereological sum of all of the possible Humphreys in the different worlds. He is like a road that goes through different regions. There are parts that overlap, but we can also say that there is a northern part that is connected to the southern part and that the road is the mereological sum of these parts. The same thing with Humphrey. One part of him is in one world, another part in another world.\n\nA haecceity or individual essence is a property that only a single object instantiates. Ordinary properties, if one accepts the existence of universals, can be exemplified by more than one object at a time. Another way to explain a haecceity is to distinguish between \"suchness\" and \"thisness\", where thisness has a more demonstrative character.\n\nDavid Lewis gives the following definition of a haecceitistic difference: “two worlds differ in what they represent \"de re\" concerning some individual, but do not differ qualitatively in any way.” (Lewis 1986:221.)\n\nCT does not require distinct worlds for distinct possibilities – “a single world may provide many possibilities, since many possible individuals inhabit it” (Lewis 1986:230). CT can satisfy multiple counterparts in one possible world.\n\nPerdurantism is the view that material objects are not wholly present at any single instant of time; instead, some temporal parts is said to be present. Sometimes, especially in the theory of relativity as it is expressed by Minkowski, the path traced by an object through spacetime. According to Ted Sider, “Temporal parts theory is the claim that time is like space in one particular respect, namely, with respect to parts.” Sider associates endurantism with a C-relation between temporal parts. (\"See also:\" The argument from temporary intrinsics).\n\nSider defends a revised way of counting. Instead of counting individual objects, timeline slices or the temporal parts of an object are used. Sider discusses an example of counting road segments instead of roads simpliciter. (Sider 2001:188-192). (Compare with Lewis 1993.) Sider argues that, even if we knew that some material object would go through some fission and split into two, \"we would not \"say\"\" that there are two objects located at the same spacetime region. (Sider 2001:189)\n\nHow can one predicate temporal properties of these momentary temporal parts? It is here that the C-relation comes in play. Sider proposed the sentence: \"Ted was once a boy.\" The truth condition of this sentence is that \"there exists some person stage x prior to the time of utterance, such that x is a boy, and x bears the temporal counterpart relation to Ted.\" (Sider 2001:193)\n\nKripke's three lectures on proper names and identity, (1980), raised the issues of how we should interpret statements about identity. Take the statement that the Evening Star is identical to the Morning Star. Both are the planet Venus. This seems to be an \"a posteriori\" identity statement. We discover that the names designate the same thing. The traditional view, since Kant, has been that statements or propositions that are necessarily true are a priori. But in the end of the sixties Saul Kripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus offered proof for the necessary truth of identity statements. Here is the Kripke's version (Kripke 1971):\n\nIf the proof is correct the distinction between the a priori/a posteriori and necessary/contingent becomes less clear. The same applies if identity statements are necessarily true anyway. (For some interesting comments on the proof, see Lowe 2002.) The statement that for instance “Water is identical to HO” is (then) a statement that is necessarily true but a posteriori. If CT is the correct account of modal properties we still can keep the intuition that identity statements are contingent and a priori because counterpart theory understands the modal operator in a different way than standard modal logic.\n\nThe relationship between CT and essentialism is of interest. (Essentialism, the necessity of identity, and rigid designators form an important troika of mutual interdependence.) According to David Lewis, claims about an object's essential properties can be true or false depending on context (in Chapter 4.5 in 1986 he calls against constancy, because an absolute conception of essences is constant over the logical space of possibilities). He writes:\n\nKripke interpreted proper names as rigid designators where a rigid designator picks out the same object in every possible world (Kripke 1980). For someone who accepts contingent identity statements the following semantic problem occurs (semantic because we deal with de dicto necessity) (Rea 1997:xxxvii).\n\nTake a scenario that is mentioned in the paradox of coincidence. A statue (call it “Statue”) is made by melding two pieces of clay together. Those two pieces are called “Clay”. Statue and Clay seem to be identical, they exist at the same time, and we could incinerate them at the same time. The following seems true:\n\nBut,\n\nis false, because it seems possible that Statue could have been made out of two different pieces of clay, and thus its identity to Clay is not necessary.\n\nCounterpart theory, qua-identity, and individual concepts can offer solutions to this problem.\n\nTed Sider gives roughly the following argument (Sider 2001:223). There is inconstancy if a proposition about the essence of an object is true in one context and false in another. C-relation is a similarity relation. What is similar in one dimension is not similar in another dimension. Therefore, the C-relation can have the same difference and express inconstant judgements about essences.\n\nDavid Lewis offers another argument. The paradox of coincidence can be solved if we accept inconstancy. We can then say that it is possible for a dishpan and a piece of plastic to coincide, in some context. That context can then be described using CT.\n\nSider makes the point that David Lewis feels he was forced to defend CT, due to modal realism. Sider uses CT as a solution to the paradox of material coincidence.\n\nWe assume that contingent identity is real. Then it is informative to compare CT with other theories about how to handle \"de re\" representations.\n\n\"Qua-theory\"\n\nKit Fine (1982) and Alan Gibbard (1975) (according to Rea 1997) are defences of qua-theory. According to qua-theory we can talk about some of an object's modal properties. The theory is handy if we don't think it is possible for Socrates to be identical with a piece of bread or a stone. Socrates qua person is essentially a person.\n\n\"Individual concepts\"\n\nAccording to Rudolf Carnap, in modal contexts variables refer to individual concepts instead of individuals. An individual concept is then defined as a function of individuals in different possible worlds. Basically, individual concepts deliver semantic objects or abstract functions instead of real concrete entities as in CT.\n\nKripke accepts the necessity of identity but agrees with the feeling that it still seems that it is possible that Phospherus (the Morning Star) is not identical to Hespherus (the Evening Star). For all we know, it could be that they are different. He says:\n\nSo to explain how the illusion of necessity is possible, according to Kripke, CT is an alternative. Therefore, CT forms an important part of our theory about the knowledge of modal intuitions. (For doubt about this strategy, see Della Roca, 2002. And for more about the knowledge of modal statements, see Gendler and Hawthorne, 2002.)\n\nThe most famous is Kripke's Humphrey objection. Because a counterpart is never identical to something in another possible world Kripke raised the following objection against CT:\n\nOne way to spell out the meaning of Kripke's claim is by the following imaginary dialogue: (Based on Sider MS)\n\nCT is inadequate if it can't translate all modal sentences or intuitions. Fred Feldman mentioned two sentences (Feldman 1971):\n\n\n"}

In order to directly prove a conditional statement of the form \"If \"p\", then \"q\"\", it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement \"p\" is true. Logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion. The type of logic employed is almost invariably first-order logic, employing the quantifiers \"for all\" and \"there exists\". Common proof rules used are modus ponens and universal instantiation.\n\nIn contrast, an indirect proof may begin with certain hypothetical scenarios and then proceed to eliminate the uncertainties in each of these scenarios until an inescapable conclusion is forced. For example, instead of showing directly \"p\" ⇒ \"q\", one proves its contrapositive ~\"q\" ⇒ ~\"p\" (one assumes ~\"q\" and shows that it leads to ~\"p\"). Since \"p\" ⇒ \"q\" and ~\"q\" ⇒ ~\"p\" are equivalent by the principle of transposition (see law of excluded middle), \"p\" ⇒ \"q\" is indirectly proved. Proof methods that are not direct include proof by contradiction, including proof by infinite descent. Direct proof methods include proof by exhaustion and proof by induction.\n\nA direct proof is the simplest form of proof there is. The word ‘proof’ comes from the Latin word probare, which means “to test”. The earliest use of proofs was prominent in legal proceedings. A person with authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, which means that the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony. In days gone by, mathematics and proof was often intertwined with practical questions – with populations like the Egyptians and the Greeks showing an interest in surveying land. This led to a natural curiosity with regards to geometry and trigonometry – particularly triangles and rectangles. These were the shapes which provided the most questions in terms of practical things, so early geometrical concepts were focused on these shapes, for example, the likes of buildings and pyramids used these shapes in abundance. Another shape which is crucial in the history of direct proof is the circle, which was crucial for the design of arenas and water tanks. This meant that ancient geometry (and Euclidean Geometry) discussed circles.\n\nThe earliest form of mathematics was phenomenological. For example, if someone could draw a reasonable picture, or give a convincing description, then that met all the criteria for something to be described as a mathematical “fact”. On occasion, analogical arguments took place, or even by “invoking the gods”. The idea that mathematical statements could be proven had not been developed yet, so these were the earliest forms of the concept of proof, despite not being actual proof at all.\n\nProof as we know it came about with one specific question: “what is a proof?” Traditionally, a proof is a platform which convinces someone beyond reasonable doubt that a statement is mathematically true. Naturally, one would assume that the best way to prove the truth of something like this (B) would be to draw up a comparison with something old (A) that has already been proven as true. Thus was created the concept of deriving a new result from an old result.\n\nConsider two even integers and . Since they are even, they can be written as\n\nrespectively for integers and . \nThen the sum can be written as\n\nIt follows that has 2 as a factor and therefore is even, so the sum of any two even integers is even.\n\nObserve that we have four right-angled triangles and a square packed into a large square. Each of the triangles has sides \"a\" and \"b\" and hypotenuse \"c\". The area of a square is defined as the square of the length of its sides - in this case, \"(a + b)\". However, the area of the large square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of its components. In this case, that would be the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the small square in the middle.\n\nWe know that the area of the large square is equal to \"(a + b)\".\n\nThe area of a triangle is equal to formula_5\n\nWe know that the area of the large square is also equal to the sum of the areas of the triangles, plus the area of the small square, and thus the area of the large square equals formula_6\n\nThese are equal, and so\n\nAfter some simplifying,\n\nRemoving the ab that appears on both sides gives\n\nwhich proves Pythagoras' theorem. ∎\n\nBy definition, if \"n\" is an odd integer, it can be expressed as\nfor some integer \"k\". Thus\n\nSince 2\"k\"+ 2\"k\" is an integer, \"n\" is also odd. ∎\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35910509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35910509", "title": "Hongzhou school", "text": "Hongzhou school\n\nThe Hongzhou school () was a Chinese school of Chán of the Tang period, which started with Mazu Daoyi (709–788). It became the archetypal expression of Zen during the Song Dynasty.\n\nThe An Lu-shan Rebellion (755-763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, which changed the position of Chan. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while...\nTraditionally, Mazu Daoyi (709–788) is depicted as a successor in the lineage of Hui-neng, since his teacher Nanyue Huairang is regarded as a student and successor of Huineng. This connection between Hui-neng and Nanyue Huairang is doubtful, being the product of later rewritings of Chán-history to place Mazu in the traditional lineages.\n\nMazu settled at Kung-kung Mountain by Nankang, southern Kiangsi province, where he founded a monastery and gathered scores of disciples.\n\nBaizhang Huaihai (Pai-chang)(720–814) was the dharma heir of Mazu. He is usually said to have established an early set of rules for Chan monastics, the \"Pure Rules of Baizhang\" ()., but there is no historical evidence that this text ever existed. Some version of the old Buddhist Vinaya code, modified to some extent for the Chinese situation, was practiced in Dazhi Shousheng Chan-si (Ta-chih shou-sheng ch'an-ssu; Jp. Daichijusho-zenji), founded by Baizhang. This monastery contained a monks hall for meditation and sleeping, an innovation which became typical for Chán:\nVery little is known of Huangbo Xiyun (died 850), who was a dharma heir of Baizhang Huaihai. He started his monastic career at Mount Huang-po. In 842 he took up residence at Lung-hsing Monastery ath the invitation of P'ei-hsiu (787 or 797–860). P'ei-hsiu was a lay-student of Guifeng Zongmi, fifth-generation heir of the Ho-tse line of the Southern school of Shenhui, and a great scholar. Zongmi was...\n\nPéi-hsiu, however, became interested, and in 842 invited huangbo to the Lung-hsing Monastery.\n\nLinji Yìxuán ((died 866 CE)) became the archetypal representant of Chán, as expressed in his recorded sayings. He was a student of Huangbo, who also figures in the \"Recorded sayings of Linj\". According to these records, Linji attained kensho while discussing Huángbò's teaching with the reclusive monk Dàyú (大愚). Linji then returned to Huángbò to continue his training. In 851 CE, Linji moved to the Linji temple in Hebei, where he took his name, which also became the name for the lineage of his form of Chán Buddhism.\n\nThe Hongzhou school developed \"shock techniques such as shouting, beating, and using irrational retorts to startle their students into realization\". Some of these are common today, while others are found mostly in anecdotes. It is common in many Chán traditions today for Chán teachers to have a stick with them during formal ceremonies which is a symbol of authority and which can be also used to strike on the table during a talk.\n\nA well-known story depicts Mazu practicing dhyana, but being chided by his teacher Nanyue Huairang, comparing seated meditation with polishing a tile. According to Faure, the criticism is not about dhyana as such, but \nThe criticism of seated dhyana reflects a change in the role and position of monks in Tang society, who \"undertook only pious works, reciting sacred texts and remaining seated in \"dhyana\"\". Nevertheless, seated dhyana remained an important part of the Chán tradition, also due to the influence of Guifeng Zongmi, who tried to balance dhyana and insight.\n\nFrom the \"question-and-answer format that had been developed as a means of conveying Buddhist teachings\" developed the \"yü-lü\" genre, the recorded sayings of the masters, and the encounter dialogues. The best-known example is the \"Lin-ji yü-lü\". It is part of the \"Ssu-chia yü lu\" (Jp. Shike Goruku, \"The Collection of the Four Houses\"), which contains the recorded sayings of Mazu Daoyi, Baizhang Huaihai, Huangbo Xiyun and Linji Yixuan.\n\nThese recorded sayings are not verbatim recordings of the sayings of the masters, but well-edited texts, written down up to 160 years after the supposed sayings and meetings.\n\nMazu is perhaps the most influential teaching master in the formation of Chán Buddhism in China. When Chán became the dominant school of Buddhism during the Song Dynasty, in retrospect the later Tang Dynasty and Mazu's Hongzhou school became regarded as the \"golden age\" of Chan.\n\nThe shock techniques became part of the traditional and still popular image of Chan masters displaying irrational and strange behaviour to aid their students. Part of this image was due to later misinterpretations and translation errors, such as the loud belly shout known as \"katsu\". In Chinese \"katsu\" means \"to shout\", which has traditionally been translated as \"yelled 'katsu'\" - which should mean \"yelled a yell\"\n\nThe stories about the Hongzhou school are part of the Traditional Zen Narrative which developed in China during the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Song Dynasty, from the 7th to 11th century. It became dominant during the Song Dynasty, when Chán was the dominant form of Buddhism in China, due to support from the Emperial Court.\n\nThis period is seen as the \"golden age\" of Chan, a \"romantic coloring\" discarded by McRae:\nThe Hung-chou school has been criticised for its radical subitism.\n\nGuifeng Zongmi (圭峰 宗密) (780–841), an influential teacher-scholar and patriarch of both the Chán and the Huayan school claimed that the Hung-chou tradition believed \"everything as altogether true\".\n\nAccording to Zongmi, the Hung-chou school teaching led to a radical nondualism that believed that all actions, good or bad, are expressing the essential Buddha-nature, but therefore denies the need for spiritual cultivation and moral discipline. This would be a dangerously antinomian view as it eliminated all moral distinctions and validated any actions as expressions of the essence of Buddha-nature.\n\nWhile Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its functioning in the day-to-day reality are but difference aspects of the same reality, he insisted that there is a difference. To avoid the dualism he saw in the Northern Line and the radical nondualism and antinomianism of the Hung-chou school, Zongmi’s paradigm preserved \"an ethically critical duality within a larger ontological unity\", an ontology which he claimed was lacking in Hung-chou Chan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27138739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27138739", "title": "Humanity (virtue)", "text": "Humanity (virtue)\n\nHumanity is a virtue associated with basic ethics of altruism derived from the human condition.\n\nHumanity differs from mere justice in that there is a level of altruism towards individuals included in humanity more so than the fairness found in justice. That is, humanity, and the acts of love, altruism, and social intelligence are typically individual strengths while fairness is generally expanded to all. \nPeterson & Seligman in \"\" (2004) class humanity as one of six virtues that are consistent across all cultures.\n\nThe concept goes back to the development of \"humane\" or \"humanist\" philosophy during the Renaissance (with predecessors in 13th-century scholasticism stressing a concept of basic human dignity inspired by Aristotelianism) and the concept of humanitarianism in the early modern period, and resulted in modern notions such as \"human rights\".\n\nConfucius said that humanity, or “Ren”(仁), is a “love of people” stating “if you want to make a stand, help others make a stand.” That is, the Confucian theory of humanity exemplifies the golden rule. It is so central to Confucian thought that it appears 58 times in the Analects. Similar to the Christian process of seeking God, Confucius teachers seeking Ren to a point of seemingly divine mastery until you are equal to, or better than, your teacher. The Confucian concept of Ren encompasses both love and altruism.\n\nPlato and Aristotle both wrote extensively on the subject of virtues, though neither ever wrote on humanity as a virtue, despite highly valuing love and kindness, two of the strengths of humanity. Plato and Aristotle considered \"courage, justice, temperance\" and \"generosity, wit, friendliness, truthfulness, magnificence, and greatness of soul\" to be the sole virtues, respectively.\n\nHumanity is one of Thomas Aquinas' \"Seven Heavenly Virtues.\" Beyond that, humanity was so important in some positivist Christian cultures that it was to be capitalized like God. \nKindness, altruism and love are all mentioned in the bible. Proverbs 19:22 \"states the desire of a man is his kindness.\" On the topic of altruism, emphasis is placed on helping strangers (Hebrews 13:1) and the biblical adage \"it is better to give than to receive\" (Acts 20:35).\n\nLove has many different definitions ranging from a set of purely biological and chemical processes to a religious concept. As a character strength, love is a mutual feeling between two people characterized by attachment, comfort, and generally positive feelings. It can be broken down into 3 categories: love between a child and their parents, love for your friends, and romantic love. Having love as a strength is not about the capacity to love, as such, it is about being involved in a loving relationship.\n\nLove, in the psychological sense, is most often studied in terms of attachment to others. A degree of controversy surrounds defining and researching love in this way, as it takes away the “mystery of love.” Because love is mysterious, to an extent, it is most often studied in terms of attachment theory, because it can be studied in the way across ages. In infants, attachment is studied through the Strange Situation Test. Attachment to an individual, usually the mother, is determined by how distressed the infant becomes when the mother is taken out of the experimental setting. There are several models of adult attachment including the Adult Attachment Interviews (Kaplan & Main), Adult Attachment Prototypes (Hazan & Shaver) and more. Generally adult attachment models focus on the mental representation of the visible signs of attachment seen in infants.\n\nEvidence in support of the benefits of love are seen in the negative affect states that result from lacking love. Orphaned children have been targeted in studies about negative attributes resulting from lack of attachment. Smyke \"et al.\" found that children raised in an environment that didn’t allow children to become attached to their preferred caregivers experienced attachment disorders. Additionally, individuals who develop securely attached have a lower likelihood of depression, high-self esteem, and less likelihood of divorce.\n\nThe strength kindness encompasses most related terms that evoke feelings of altruism, generosity, helpfulness and a general desire to help people. That is, a disposition for helping humanity. The following statements are from the Values in Action (VIA) psychological assessment, aimed at determining people's strengths in kindness: others are just as important to me, giving is more important than receiving, I care for the ungrateful as well as the grateful. Kindness, as a part of humanity, is deeply rooted in philosophical and religious traditions, each having words for the altruistic love aspect of kindness, such as \"agape\" in Greek, \"chesed\" in Hebrew, and the Latin word \"philantropia\", the root of the word \"philanthropy.\" Kindness is so valued as a strength beyond religious and theoretical concepts that it is advocated through school community service programs and national programs like AmeriCorps. Additionally, while gender differences in kindness are statistically significant, they are minimal, and the methods of testing used may not always have construct validity.\n\nKindness is most often measured on a case by case measure and not usually as a trait. The Self-Report Altruism Scale and the Altruism Facet Scale for Agreeableness Measure of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) psychological assessment are often used to ask people how often they engage in altruistic behaviors and gauge their concern for others. The former, however, only asks about 20 specific altruistic acts, leaving out a wide range of altruistic behaviors.\n\nThere are numerous benefits from kindness and altruism on both sides of the action. For some, the motivation to be kind comes from a place of egoistic motivation, and thus the benefit to them is the positive affect state they receive from the action. Another study found that the process of being kind develops pro-social skills in children, which positively effects their attachments and relationships. Additionally, volunteerism in the elderly has shown to lead to decreased risk of early death, and mental health benefits. One thing to note is the difference between altruism as a trait and as an act.\n\nSocial intelligence is the most modern of the three strengths associated with humanity. The Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV) psychological assessment defines social intelligence as the ability to understand “relationships with other people, including the social relationships involved in intimacy and trust, persuasion, group membership, and political power.”\n\nIntelligence has many psychological definitions from Weschler’s intelligence to the various theories of multiple intelligence. The CSV divides intelligence into hot and cold, hot intelligence being those intelligences related to active emotional processes. (338) Individuals with high social intelligence are very self-aware, and effective organizers and leaders. Additionally, it combines elements of the other two hot intelligences, personal and emotional intelligence. Personal intelligence being the internal counterpart to social intelligence and emotional intelligence being the capacity to understand emotions. The CSV highlights three social intelligence measurement scales: Factor Based Social Intelligence Tasks, Psychological Mindedness Assessment Procedure, and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional intelligence Test.\n\nSocial Intelligence research is limited, however, there is much literature on the characteristics associated with social intelligence. Zaccaro \"et al.\" found social intelligence and perceptiveness to be integral to effective leadership; that is, good leaders are “social experts.” Emotional intelligence, too, plays a role in leadership. Another study found that emotional intelligence enables leaders to better understand their followers, thereby enhancing their ability to influence them.\n\nAlthough only a relatively new field of inquiry for psychological researchers, \"character strengths\" and \"virtues\" have been consistently measured in psychometric surveys and have been shown to be positively associated with psychological and subjective wellbeing. What is more, even among those who endorse a spiritual/theistic worldview, these salutary associations appear to be better explained by humanity/civility rather than endorsing a faith in a supernatural being.\n\n"}

Cixous is best known for her article <nowiki>\"The Laugh of the Medusa\"</nowiki>, which established her as one of the early thinkers in poststructuralist feminist theory. She founded the first centre of feminist studies at a European university at the Centre universitaire de Vincennes of the University of Paris (today's University of Paris VIII).\n\nShe holds honorary degrees from Queen's University and the University of Alberta in Canada; University College Dublin in Ireland; the University of York and University College London in the UK; and Georgetown University, Northwestern University, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the USA. In 2008 she was appointed as A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University until June 2014.\n\nCixous earned her agrégation in English in 1959 and her \"Doctorat ès lettres\" in 1968. Her main focus, at this time, was English literature and the works of James Joyce. Cixous became \"assistante\" at the University of Bordeaux in 1962, served as \"maître assistante\" at the Sorbonne from 1965-1967, and was appointed \"maître de conférence\" at Paris Nanterre University in 1967. \n\nIn 1968, following the French student riots, Cixous was charged with founding the University of Paris VIII, \"created to serve as an alternative to the traditional French academic environment.\" Cixous would, in 1974, found the University's center for women's studies, the first in Europe. Cixous is a professor at the University of Paris VIII and at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. \n\nIn 1968, Cixous published her doctoral dissertation \"L'Exil de James Joyce ou l'Art du remplacement\" (\"The Exile of James Joyce, or the Art of Displacement\") and the following year she published her first novel, \"Dedans\" (\"Inside\"), a semi-autobiographical work that won the Prix Médicis. \n\nShe has published widely, including twenty-three volumes of poems, six books of essays, five plays, and numerous influential articles. She published \"Voiles\" (\"Veils\") with Jacques Derrida and her work is often considered deconstructive. In introducing her Wellek Lecture, subsequently published as \"Three Steps on the Ladder of Writing\", Derrida referred to her as the greatest living writer in his language (French). Cixous wrote a book on Derrida titled \"Portrait de Jacques Derrida en jeune saint juif\" (\"Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint\"). Her reading of Derrida finds additional layers of meaning at a phonemic rather than strictly lexical level. In addition to Derrida and Joyce, she has written monographs on the work of the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, on Maurice Blanchot, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Michel de Montaigne, Ingeborg Bachmann, Thomas Bernhard, and the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva.\nAlong with Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, Cixous is considered one of the mothers of poststructuralist feminist theory.\nIn the 1970s, Cixous began writing about the relationship between sexuality and language. Like other poststructuralist feminist theorists, Cixous believes that our sexuality is directly tied to how we communicate in society. In 1975, Cixous published her most influential article \"Le rire de la méduse\" (\"The Laugh of the Medusa\"), which was revised by her, translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen, and released in English in 1976. She has published over 70 works; her fiction, dramatic writing and poetry, however, are not often read in English.\n\nIn 2000, a collection in Cixous' name was created at the Bibliothèque nationale de France after Cixous donated the entirety of her manuscripts to date. They then featured in the exhibit \"Brouillons d'écrivains\" held there in 2001.\n\nIn 2003, the Bibliothèque held the conference \"Genèses Généalogies Genres: Autour de l'oeuvre d'Hélène Cixous.\" Among the speakers were Mireille Calle-Gruber, Marie Odile Germain, Jacques Derrida, Annie Leclerc, Ariane Mnouchkine, Ginette Michaud, and Hélène Cixous herself.\n\nCixous was born in Oran, French Algeria to Jewish parents, Eve Cixous, née Klein (b. 1910) and Georges Cixous (1909–1948). Georges Cixous, a physician who had written his dissertation on tuberculosis, died of the disease in 1948. Eve Cixous became a midwife following his death, \"until her expulsion with the last French doctors and midwives in 1971.\" Cixous' brother, Pierre, \"a medical student and a supporter of Algerian independence\" was condemned to death in 1961 by the Organisation Armée Secrète, and would join Cixous in Bordeaux. Her mother and brother would return to Algeria following the country's independence in 1962. They would be arrested, and Cixous \"obtained their release with the help of Ahmed Ben Bella’s lawyer.\"\n\nCixous married Guy Berger in 1955, with whom she had three children, Anne-Emmanuelle (b. 1958), Stéphane (1960-1961), and Pierre-François (b. 1961). Cixous and Berger divorced in 1964.\n\nSome of the most notable influences on her writings have been Jacques Derrida, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan and Arthur Rimbaud. \n\nPsychoanalyst Sigmund Freud established the initial theories which would serve as a basis for some of Cixous' arguments in developmental psychology. Freud's analysis of gender roles and sexual identity concluded with separate paths for boys and girls through the Oedipus complex, theories of which Cixous was particularly critical.\n\nContemporaries, lifelong friends, and intellectuals, Jacques Derrida and Cixous both grew up as French Jews in Algeria and share a \"belonging constituted of exclusion and nonbelonging\"—not Algerian, rejected by France, their Jewishness concealed or acculturated. In Derrida's family \"one never said 'circumcision' but 'baptism,' not 'Bar Mitzvah' but 'communion.'\" Judaism cloaked in Catholicism is one example of the undecidability of identity that influenced the thinker whom Cixous calls a \"Jewish Saint.\" Her book \"Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint\" addresses these matters.\n\nThrough deconstruction, Derrida employed the term \"logocentrism\" (which was not his coinage). This is the concept that explains how language relies on a hierarchical system that values the spoken word over the written word in Western culture. The idea of binary opposition is essential to Cixous' position on language. \n\nCixous and Luce Irigaray combined Derrida's logocentric idea and Lacan's symbol for desire, creating the term \"phallogocentrism\". This term focuses on Derrida's social structure of speech and binary opposition as the center of reference for language, with the phallic being privileged and how women are only defined by what they lack; not A vs. B, but, rather A vs. ¬A (not-A).\n\nIn a dialogue between Derrida and Cixous, Derrida said about Cixous: \"Helene's texts are translated across the world, but they remain untranslatable. We are two French writers who cultivate a strange relationship, or a strangely familiar relationship with the French language -- at once more translated and more untranslatable than many a French author. We are more rooted in the French language than those with ancestral roots in this culture and this land.\"\n\nCixous' critical feminist essay \"The Laugh of the Medusa,\" originally written in French as \"Le Rire de la Méduse\" in 1975, was (after she revised it) translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen in 1976. In the essay, Cixous issues an ultimatum: that women can either read and choose to stay trapped in their own bodies by a language that does not allow them to express themselves, or they can use the body as a way to communicate. She describes a writing style, \"Écriture feminine\", that she says attempts to move outside of the conversational rules found in patriarchal systems. She argues that \"Écriture feminine\" allows women to address their needs by building strong self-narratives and identity. This text is situated in a history of feminist conversations that separated women in terms of their gender and women in terms of authorship. The \"Laugh of the Medusa\" addresses this rhetoric, writing on individuality and commanding women to use writing and the body as sources of power and inspiration. Cixous uses the term the \"Logic of Antilove\" to describe her understanding of the systematic oppression of women by patriarchal figures. She defines the Logic of Antilove as the self-hatred women have, \"they have made for women an antinarcissism! A narcissism which loves itself only to be loved by what women haven’t got,\" this idea persecutes women by defining them by what misogynistic tradition believes makes the female sex inferior. Cixous commands women to focus on individuality, particularly the individuality of the body and to write to redefine self-identity in the context of her history and narrative. The essay includes the argument that writing is a tool women must use to advocate for themselves in order to acquire the freedom women have historically been denied.\n\n\"The Laugh of the Medusa\" is an exhortation and call for a \"feminine mode\" of writing which Cixous calls \"white ink\" and \"écriture féminine.\" Cixous builds the text using the elements of this mode and fills it with literary allusions. She instructs women to use writing as a means of authority. Cixous explores how the female body is closely connected to female authorship. She conveys this message by employing a conversational dialogue in which she instructs her audience directly. She urges her audience to write using many direct conversational statements such as \"Writing is for you, you are for you; your body is yours, take it.\" Cixous' repetition in her message that women must write for themselves and claim their bodies bridges the gap between the physicality of the female body and their authorship. In doing so she challenges the distinctions between theory and practice expanding on the feminist rhetorical tradition. \"The Laugh of the Medusa\" is successful in its creation of a writing style that allows women to claim authority because it was created on the foundation of the woman’s claim to herself and her body, therefore eliminating the oppressive effects of patriarchal control of rhetoric. This text is also a critique of logocentrism and phallogocentrism, because it de-prioritizes the masculine form of reason traditionally associated with rhetoric, having much in common with Jacques Derrida's earlier thought. The essay also calls for an acknowledgment of universal bisexuality or polymorphous perversity, a precursor of queer theory's later emphases, and swiftly rejects many kinds of essentialism which were still common in Anglo-American feminism at the time.\n\nIn homage to French theorists of the feminine, \"Laughing with Medusa\" was published by Oxford University Press in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His adherence to functionalism in the study of the social differs from that of Durkheim and his followers in his holding that knowledge and ideas must be presented as causal variables.

{"id": "630478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=630478", "title": "Infinitary logic", "text": "Infinitary logic\n\nAn infinitary logic is a logic that allows infinitely long statements and/or infinitely long proofs. Some infinitary logics may have different properties from those of standard first-order logic. In particular, infinitary logics may fail to be compact or complete. Notions of compactness and completeness that are equivalent in finitary logic sometimes are not so in infinitary logics. Therefore for infinitary logics, notions of strong compactness and strong completeness are defined. This article addresses Hilbert-type infinitary logics, as these have been extensively studied and constitute the most straightforward extensions of finitary logic. These are not, however, the only infinitary logics that have been formulated or studied.\n\nConsidering whether a certain infinitary logic named Ω-logic is complete promises to throw light on the continuum hypothesis.\n\nAs a language with infinitely long formulae is being presented, it is not possible to write such formulae down explicitly. To get around this problem a number of notational conveniences, which, strictly speaking, are not part of the formal language, are used. formula_1 is used to point out an expression that is infinitely long. Where it is unclear, the length of the sequence is noted afterwards. Where this notation becomes ambiguous or confusing, suffixes such as formula_2 are used to indicate an infinite disjunction over a set of formulae of cardinality formula_3. The same notation may be applied to quantifiers for example formula_4. This is meant to represent an infinite sequence of quantifiers for each formula_5 where formula_6.\n\nAll usage of suffixes and formula_1 are not part of formal infinitary languages.\n\nThe axiom of choice is assumed (as is often done when discussing infinitary logic) as this is necessary to have sensible distributivity laws.\n\nA first-order infinitary logic \"L\", α regular, β = 0 or ω ≤ β ≤ α, has the same set of symbols as a finitary logic and may use all the rules for formation of formulae of a finitary logic together with some additional ones:\n\nThe concepts of free and bound variables apply in the same manner to infinite formulae. Just as in finitary logic, a formula all of whose variables are bound is referred to as a \"sentence\".\n\nA theory T in infinitary logic formula_17 is a set of sentences in the logic. A proof in infinitary logic from a theory T is a sequence of statements of length formula_18 which obeys the following conditions: Each statement is either a logical axiom, an element of T, or is deduced from previous statements using a rule of inference. As before, all rules of inference in finitary logic can be used, together with an additional one:\n\n\nThe logical axiom schemata specific to infinitary logic are presented below. Global schemata variables: formula_3 and formula_18 such that formula_23.\nThe last two axiom schemata require the axiom of choice because certain sets must be well orderable. The last axiom schema is strictly speaking unnecessary as Chang's distributivity laws imply it, however it is included as a natural way to allow natural weakenings to the logic.\n\nA theory is any set of statements. The truth of statements in models are defined by recursion and will agree with the definition for finitary logic where both are defined. Given a theory T a statement is said to be valid for the theory T if it is true in all models of T.\n\nA logic formula_17 is complete if for every sentence S valid in every model there exists a proof of S. It is strongly complete if for any theory T for every sentence S valid in T there is a proof of S from T. An infinitary logic can be complete without being strongly complete.\n\nA cardinal formula_37 is weakly compact when for every theory T in formula_38 containing at most formula_39 many formulas, if every S formula_40 T of cardinality less than formula_39 has a model, then T has a model. A cardinal formula_37 is strongly compact when for every theory T in formula_38, without restriction on size, if every S formula_40 T of cardinality less than formula_39 has a model, then T has a model.\n\nIn the language of set theory the following statement expresses foundation:\n\nUnlike the axiom of foundation, this statement admits no non-standard interpretations. The concept of well foundedness can only be expressed in a logic which allows infinitely many quantifiers in an individual statement. As a consequence many theories, including Peano arithmetic, which cannot be properly axiomatised in finitary logic, can be in a suitable infinitary logic. Other examples include the theories of non-archimedean fields and torsion-free groups. These three theories can be defined without the use of infinite quantification; only infinite junctions are needed.\n\nTwo infinitary logics stand out in their completeness. These are formula_47 and formula_48. The former is standard finitary first-order logic and the latter is an infinitary logic that only allows statements of countable size.\n\nformula_47 is also strongly complete, compact and strongly compact.\n\nformula_50 fails to be compact, but it is complete (under the axioms given above). Moreover, it satisfies a variant of the Craig interpolation property.\n\nIf formula_51 is strongly complete (under the axioms given above) then formula_52 is strongly compact (because proofs in these logics cannot use formula_52 or more of the given axioms).\n\n"}

{"id": "103256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103256", "title": "John Ralston Saul", "text": "John Ralston Saul\n\nJohn Ralston Saul, (born June 19, 1947) is a Canadian writer, political philosopher, and public intellectual. Saul is most widely known for his writings on the nature of individualism, citizenship and the public good; the failures of manager-led societies; the confusion between leadership and managerialism; military strategy, in particular irregular warfare; the role of freedom of speech and culture; and critiques of the modern economic situation. He is a champion of freedom of expression and was the International President of PEN International, an association of writers. Saul is the co-founder and co-chair of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, a national charity promoting the inclusion of new citizens.\n\nHis work is known for being thought-provoking and ahead of its time, leading him to be called a \"prophet\" by \"Time\" and to be included in \"Utne Reader\"'s list of the world's leading thinkers and visionaries. His works have been translated into 25 languages in 36 countries.\n\nSaul is the son of William Saul, an army officer, and a British mother whose family had a long tradition of military service. His life, from the beginning, took place in a national context. Born in Ottawa, and christened in Calgary, he spent his infancy in Alberta and much of his childhood in Manitoba, but graduated from high school in Oakville, Ontario. At a young age he became fluent in both national languages, French and English. By the time he started university at McGill University, Montreal, his father was in Paris and Brussels, working as a military adviser to the Canadian ambassador to NATO.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate Saul was accepted into the foreign service, but the death of his father in 1968 changed Saul's career plans. He left the foreign service to attend King's College London, where he wrote his thesis on the modernization of France under Charles de Gaulle, and earned his PhD in 1972. His doctoral thesis, \"The Evolution of Civil-Military Relations in France after the Algerian War\", led him to France for research. There he began to write his first novel, \"Mort d'un général\", a romanticized version of his thesis on de Gaulle's Chief of staff. He supported himself by running the French subsidiary of a British investment company.\n\nAfter helping to set up the national oil company Petro-Canada in 1976, as assistant to its first chair, Maurice F. Strong, Saul published his first novel, \"The Birds of Prey\", in 1977. Strong described Saul as \"an invaluable, though unconventional, member of my personal staff.\"\n\nThrough the late 1970s into the 1980s, Saul travelled extensively and regularly spent time with guerrilla armies, spending a great deal of time in North Africa and South East Asia. Out of this time came his novels, \"The Field Trilogy\". It was during those extended periods in Northwest Africa and Southeast Asia where he witnessed fellow writers there suffering government suppression of freedom of expression, which caused him to become interested in the work of PEN International. Between the years of 1990 and 1992, Saul acted as the President of the Canadian centre of PEN International and in 2009 he was elected president of PEN and re-elected for a second and last term in 2012, remaining International President until October 2015.\n\n\"The Birds of Prey\" (1977) is a political novel based in Gaullist France. Between 1983 and 1988 Saul then published \"The Field Trilogy\", which deals with the crisis of modern power and its clash with the individual. It includes \"Baraka, or The Lives, Fortunes and Sacred Honor of Anthony Smith\" (1983), \"The Next Best Thing\" (1986), and \"The Paradise Eater\" (1988), which won the \"Premio Letterario Internazionale\" in Italy.\n\n\"De si bons Américains\" (1994) is a picaresque novel in which he observes the lives of America's \"nouveaux riches\". A vastly reworked and expanded version was published in 2012 as \"Dark Diversions\", Saul's first novel in over fifteen years.\n\nSaul's non-fiction began with the trilogy comprising the bestseller \"Voltaire's Bastards: The Dictatorship of Reason in the West\"(1992), the polemic philosophical dictionary \"The Doubter's Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense\" (1994), and the book that grew out of his 1995 Massey Lectures, \"The Unconscious Civilization\" (1995). The last won the 1996 Governor General's Award for Non-Fiction Literature.\n\nThese books deal with themes such as the dictatorship of reason unbalanced by other human qualities, how it can be used for any ends especially in a directionless state that rewards the pursuit of power for power's sake. He argues that this leads to deformations of thought such as ideology promoted as truth; the rational but anti-democratic structures of corporatism, by which he means the worship of small groups; and the use of language and expertise to mask a practical understanding of the harm caused by this, and what else our society might do. He argues that the rise of individualism with no regard for the role of society has not created greater individual autonomy and self-determination, as was once hoped, but isolation and alienation. He calls for a pursuit of a more humanist ideal in which reason is balanced with other human mental capacities such as common sense, ethics, intuition, creativity, and memory, for the sake of the common good, and he discusses the importance of unfettered language and practical democracy. These attributes are elaborated upon in his 2001 book \"On Equilibrium\".\n\nHe expanded on these themes as they relate to Canada and its history and culture in \"Reflections of a Siamese Twin\" (1998). In this book, he proposed the idea of Canada being a \"soft\" country, meaning not that the nation is weak, but that it has a flexible and complex identity, as opposed to the unyielding or monolithic identities of other states.\n\nHe argues that Canada's complex national identity is made up of the \"triangular reality\" of the three nations that compose it: First Peoples, francophones, and anglophones. He emphasizes the willingness of these Canadian nations to compromise with one another, as opposed to resorting to open confrontations. In the same vein, he criticizes both those in the Quebec separatist Montreal School for emphasizing the conflicts in Canadian history and the Orange Order and the Clear Grits traditionally seeking clear definitions of Canadian-ness and loyalty.\n\nSaul's next book, \"On Equilibrium\" (2001), is effectively a fourth, concluding volume to his philosophical quartet. He identifies six qualities as common to all people: common sense, ethics, imagination, intuition, memory, and reason. He describes how these inner forces can be used to balance each other, and what happens when they are unbalanced, for example in the case of a \"Dictatorship of Reason\".\n\nIn an article written for \"Harper's\" magazine's March 2004 issue, titled \"The Collapse of Globalism and the Rebirth of Nationalism\", he argued that the globalist ideology was under attack by counter-movements. Saul rethought and developed this argument in \"The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World\" (2005). Far from being an inevitable force, Saul argued that globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their national interests in both positive and destructive ways. Following the economic collapse he had predicted, \"The Collapse of Globalism\" was re-issued in 2009 with a new epilogue that addressed the current crisis.\n\n\"A Fair Country\" (2008) is Saul's second major work on Canada. It is organized into four subsections.\n\n\n\n\nSaul's contribution to Penguin Canada's \"Extraordinary Canadians\" series, of which he serves as general editor, is a double biography of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin. In it, he argues that Canada did not begin in 1867, but that in fact its foundations were laid by LaFontaine and Baldwin much earlier. The two leaders of Lower and Upper Canada, respectively, worked together after the 1841 Union to lead a reformist movement for responsible government run by elected citizens instead of a colonial governor. But it was during the \"Great Ministry\" of 1848—51 that the two politicians implemented laws that Saul argues created a more equitable country. They revamped judicial institutions, created a public education system, made bilingualism official, designed a network of public roads, began a public postal system, and reformed municipal governance. Faced with opposition, and even violence, Saul contends that the two men united behind a set of principles and programs that formed modern Canada.\n\nHis most recent work, \"The Comeback: How Aboriginals Are Reclaiming Power and Influence\" (2014) was a shortlisted nominee for the 2015 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing. The \"comeback\" that Saul identifies in this new book emphasizes the strides that Aboriginal people have made in reversing years of population decline and \"cultural oppression\". As recently as seventy years ago it was widely assumed that Indians were disappearing, the victims of disease, starvation and their own ineptitude for modern civilization. Canada's Aboriginal population is growing in numbers and its cultural and political self-confidence seems boundless. In Saul's view, this observation, while obvious to anyone who studies the history, nonetheless needs hammering home. We are far more used to hearing about the dismal lives of Aboriginal people—their family dysfunction, their crime rates, their impoverished communities—than we are to being told they are a success story. Today's Aboriginal population, for all the problems that afflict it, has overcome incredible disadvantages to achieve what Saul calls \"a position of power, influence and civilizational creativity\" in Canadian society.\n\nSaul is co-chair of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, which encourages new Canadians to become active citizens. He is patron and former president of the Canadian Centre of PEN International. He is also founder and honorary chair of French for the Future, which encourages bilingual French-English education, chair of the advisory board for the LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium lecture series, and a patron of Planned Lifetime Advocacy Network. From 1999 until 2006, his wife Adrienne Clarkson was Governor General of Canada, making him Canada's viceregal consort. During this period he devoted much of his time to issues of freedom of expression, poverty, public education and bilingualism.\n\nSaul was elected as the international president of PEN International for a three-year term at its Annual Congress in Linz, Austria in October 2009. He was the first Canadian to be elected to that position, which had previously been held by John Galsworthy, Arthur Miller, Heinrich Böll, Mario Vargas Llosa and Homero Aridjis. He campaigned on the need to pay attention to smaller and endangered languages and cultures, arguing that the ultimate removal of freedom of expression was the loss of a language. He put a specific emphasis on endangered indigenous languages. He called for a further decentralization of PEN, which has 144 centres in 102 countries. He argues that literature and freedom of expression are the same thing; that you cannot have one without the other. Saul has testified before the European Parliament Human Rights Commission on the loss of freedom of expression in Tunisia, has spoken before European Council on Refugees in Exile, and has published an essay on writers in exile, which has been translated into several languages.\n\nSaul founded, and currently co-chairs, the Institute for Canadian Citizenship (ICC) with Adrienne Clarkson. The ICC is a national, non-profit charity that helps accelerate new citizens’ integration into Canadian life through original programs, collaborations and unique volunteer opportunities. While its focus is on encouraging new citizens to take their rightful place in Canada, the ICC aims to encourage all citizens – new or not – to embrace active citizenship in their daily life.\n\nIn addition to his selection as the 1995 Massey lecturer, Saul has delivered other notable lectures. He gave the Harold Innis Lecture in 1994. In 2000 he gave the inaugural LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium\nLecture. Saul delivered the J.D. Young Memorial Lecture \"A New Era of Irregular Warfare?\" at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario on February 4, 2004. He gave the 2005 IDEAS lecture in Brisbane, Australia, the 2007 Captive Mind Lecture in Kraków, Poland, and in 2008 gave the 33rd Sir Winston Scott Memorial Lecture in Barbados. He also delivered the 2009 McGill Law Journal's Annual Lecture at the McGill Faculty of Law in Montreal on February 3, 2009. Saul also spoke at the Sydney Opera House on August 26, 2012 on the subject \"It's Broke: How do we fix it?\"\n\nSaul was named a companion to the Order of Canada in 1999. He is also chevalier in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France (1996). His 18 honorary degrees range from McGill University and the University of Ottawa to Herzen University in Saint Petersburg, Russia. On October 17, 2014, he received his latest honorary degree from the University of Winnipeg.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also was elected several times to the town council of Madrid. During the same period, he was a university professor of philosophy and logic, and dean of the department at the University of Madrid.\n\nBorn in Madrid, he was educated in the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, and studied in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the University of Madrid, as well as at the Sorbonne in 1896, the Universities of Munich, Berlin and Leipzig in 1909-1910. In 1908, he joined the Partido Radical (Radical Party) established by Alejandro Lerroux.\n\nHe became a member of the \"Agrupación Socialista Madrileña\" (the socialist circle in Madrid) in 1912. That year he was offered the Chair of Fundamental Logic in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the University of Madrid. Soon after, Besteiro became a member of Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade union, and of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). In 1913 he married Dolores Cebrián, a professor of physics and natural science at the teachers' training college in Toledo.\n\nIn 1917, after the general strike, Besteiro was among many members of the strike committee tried in Madrid; he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Following his release under the amnesty campaign, he was elected as a member of the town council of Madrid.\n\nThe following year, Besteiro was elected to the Cortes (the Spanish Parliament) as member of the Congress of Deputies for Madrid.\n\nDuring the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Besteiro favored collaboration by the socialists with the leader. Primo de Rivera offered UGT participation in governing the country. To a certain extent, the arrangement in the mid-1920s appeared to be a success. Opinion within the PSOE turned against Besteiro as the Primo de Rivera regime became more unpopular during the economic downturn as part of the Great Depression.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, Besteiro became politically isolated in his opinions on collaboration. This was opposed by the republican front established by the Pact of San Sebastián. Bestiero had also opposed the participation of UGT in the 15 December 1930 general strike. At a joint meeting of the PSOE and UGT in February 1931, Besteiro resigned as President of both the party and the union. (Note: Paul Preston writes that Besteiro resigned as president of the union in 1934.)\n\nIn 1931 he was elected a councillor of the Madrid town council.\n\nStill serving in the Cortes Generales after the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, Besteiro was elected Speaker of the Constituent Cortes, empowered to draft a new constitution. The Cabinet offered him first the job of state delegate to CAMPSA, the state petrol monopoly, and then the post of Ambassador to France, both of which he rejected. During his period as President of the Cortes, he seemed to become more conservative in his political views. In January 1934, he resigned as President of the UGT.\n\nOpposing the radicalization of the Socialist movement, he disapproved the socialists' taking part in the armed uprising of October 1934. In February 1936, Besteiro won the highest number of votes of any candidate in Madrid in the Popular Front elections.\n\nThroughout this period, Besteiro had continued to work in the University of Madrid as a Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, as well as to carry out his duties as a parliamentary deputy and councillor of the town council in Madrid. After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, and against the urgings of friends, he refused to leave Madrid and seek exile.\n\nManuel Azaña, the Spanish Republican President, chose Besteiro as the representative to the coronation of the new British King George VI in London on 12 May 1937. Besteiro believed it was to be a peace mission. There he met with Sir Anthony Eden to seek British aid in ending the war, which had attracted German and Russian support of the opposing sides, but no significant results followed. After the failure of his mission in London, Besteiro returned to work on the town council of Madrid but withdrew from other official public life. He stopped attending the \"Agrupación Socialista Madrileña\" and the parliamentary group meetings.\n\nWith the news of the fall of Barcelona on 26 January 1939 and Azaña's resignation as President of the Republic, Besteiro decided to work to achieve peace and stop the resistance. He contacted Colonel Segismundo Casado. On 5 March Besteiros announced the creation of the National Defence Council (\"Consejo Nacional de Defensa\"). The uprising against the government of Juan Negrín and its Communist Party of Spain allies succeeded, at the cost of nearly 2,000 lives. (See Beevor (2006), Chapter 34, \"passim,\" \"The Battle for Spain\".)\n\nAfter the fall of Madrid to the Nationalists on 28 March 1939, Besteiro was arrested by Francoist forces. On 8 July he faced a court martial and was sentenced to thirty years. He was imprisoned first in the Trappist monastery in Dueñas, Palencia, until the end of August 1939. He was transferred to the prison of Carmona. He died in prison the following year.\n\nBesteiro was buried in the Cementerio Civil of Madrid.\n\n"}

{"id": "4675536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4675536", "title": "Master–slave morality", "text": "Master–slave morality\n\nMaster–slave morality is a central theme of Friedrich Nietzsche's works, in particular the first essay of \"On the Genealogy of Morality\". Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of morality: \"master morality\" and \"slave morality\". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, consequentialism), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of good or evil intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, Kantian deontology).\n\nFor Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see valuation).\n\nNietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state \"the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences\" but ultimately \"[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena.\" For strong-willed men, the \"good\" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the \"bad\" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. \n\nThe essence of master morality is \"nobility\". Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the \"noble man\", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. \"The noble type of man experiences \"itself\" as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, \"what is harmful to me is harmful in itself\"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is \"value-creating\".\" In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that \"oneself\" is the measure of all moral truths. Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of self-actualization through the will to power.\n\nAccording to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on re-sentiment—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as \"good\". \n\nSlave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is \"utility\": The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the will to power) are \"evil\", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. Biblical principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. \"The \"democratic\" movement is the heir to Christianity\"—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.\n\nThis struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The Homeric hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes \"men of a noble culture\", giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. \n\nThe essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the \"collective degeneration of man\". He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak. Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This ressentiment Nietzsche calls \"priestly vindictiveness\", which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by \"the most intelligent revenge\" of the weak. Nietzsche saw democracy and Christianity as the same emasculating impulse which sought to make everyone equal by making everyone a slave.\n\nNietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the \"be-all, end-all\" behavior. He thought that the revaluation of morals would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. Walter Kaufmann disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his project \"Poietic Generator\" and for having introduced the concept of \"Digital Perspective\" in the fields of network theory, art and digital humanities.\n\nOlivier Auber was born in 1960 in Sainte-Adresse in Normandy, France. He lives and works in Paris and Brussels.\n\nHe holds an engineering degree and a Master of Design from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers. His engineering thesis focused on nonlinear optical elements (holograms) for avionics (head-up display). This initial specialization in optics has earned him early in his career as a research engineer, first in the avionics division of Thomson Csf (now Thales Group) and at CERN in Geneva.\n\nIn 1984, he takes the status of independent consulting engineer for the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (Paris), then under construction, to work first on the development of exhibits, then quickly as project manager responsible for the design and development of several permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, between 1984 and 1996, he designed the scenario and led the implementation of several highly technological exhibitions and media on science issues as diverse as: the sun, mathematics, electricity, symmetry in the arts and science, non-verbal human behavior, etc. In this period, he also developed some exhibition projects for other cultural institutions, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Institut du Monde Arabe, the Palais de la Découverte. The creation for the \"Expressions et behaviours\" exhibition inaugurated in early 1987, marked a milestone in his career, leading him from a predominantly scientific and technical culture to another more artistic and open to all components of the humanities.\n\nEnd of 1987, while working with Tod Machover (MIT Medialab) and Catherine Ikam (artist) for the staging of VALIS, a contemporary music opera based on the work of Philip K. Dick, he designed what would become his best known work, the \"Poietic Generator\", a free social artwork for all that can be played in real time over a network. In 1988, this work became the central concept of a monumental, architectural and technological project, one of the seven laureates of the international competition for the creation of the \"France-Japan Monument\" on Awaji Island in the Bay of Kobe, launched under the aegis of François Mitterrand. This Monument never saw the daylight, but its various implementations were exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou (exhibition \"Communication et Monumentalité\", 1989), the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (exhibition \"Machines à communiquer\", 1994) and in various galleries and art events including ARSLAB in 1995, where Olivier Auber was awarded the prize \"art and science\" by the city of Turin, Italy. The exhibition \"ARSLAB - The senses of virtuality\", sponsored by the City of Turin - Promoter of Fine Arts, was organized by Ars Technica and Extramuseum and was curated by Claude Faure, Maria Grazia Mattei and Franco Torriani \n\nIn 1995 still, he was invited to the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (now Télécom ParisTech) to develop his project, not just on the web, but on an experimental network foreshadowing the future shape of the Internet (Mbone) which allowed him to perform what is considered as the first experience of real-time collective interaction over the Internet without the intermediary of any center.\n\nIn 1996, he developed a version of Poietic Generator for the web in order to let every one access to it. Several experiments followed through electronic art festivals and academic research: Ljubljana (1998), X-00 (2000), Human-Computer Interaction Conference IHM-UTC(2002, L3D Lab, University of Colorado at Boulder in (2002), and so on.\n\nIn 1997 he co-founded the A+H Culture Laboratory, with Bernd Hoge (architect and urban planner), Emmanuel Mâa Berriet (developer of virtual reality) and Philippe Braunstein (film producer), in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. One of the first is the creation of the in Worms Germany. One of the pieces in the museum, the virtual reality installation \"The treasure of the Nibelungs\", inspired by the Poietic Generator, was also exhibited in numerous festivals, including ISEA 2000 (Paris) and Boston CyberArts 2001.\n\nIn 2002, he co-founded with Nils Aziosmanoff and Etienne Krieger the company Navidis which brings innovative solutions to the Smart City users.\n\nIn 2004, he co-founded with visual artist Yann Le Guennec the research group Anoptique that developed dataviz experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects in partnership with the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&D and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, he contributed to the creation of a transdisciplinary Research Chair at Telecom ParisTech devoted to \"modeling imaginary\" with the help of Dassault Systèmes, Ubisoft, Orange Lab, Peugeot-Citroen, Alcatel Lucent, BNP Paribas, Datar and Minatec.\n\nSince 2012, Olivier Auber divides his time between consultancy, design of cultural and art projects, and research and development on the Poietic Generator. He also contributes to many working groups, as a research associate of the transdisciplinary research group \"Evolution, Complexity and Cognition\" and the Global Brain Institute directed by Francis Heylighen, and as an active member of the P2P Foundation.\n\nFrom 1986, Olivier Auber theorized the Poietic Generator as an experience of two new kinds of perspectives, analogous to the spatial perspective of the Renaissance: the \"temporal perspective\" and the \"digital perspective\", on which he wrote several papers whose terms were continued in the works of many philosophers and historians of art and science, including Anne Cauquelin, Don Foresta, , Mario Costa, Caterina Davinio, Jean-Paul Fourmentraux, Louis-José Lestocart, Elisa Giaccardi, and Norbert Hillaire, Jean-Michel Cornu, Franco Torriani, etc..\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most often it is used in the context of people by many organizations and governments, for very formal and state occasions, especially where diplomats are present. It can also be used in the context of decorations, medals and awards. Historically, the order of precedence had a more widespread use, especially in court and aristocratic life.\n\nA person's position in an order of precedence is not necessarily an indication of functional importance, but rather an indication of ceremonial or historical relevance; for instance, it may dictate where dignitaries are seated at formal dinners. The term is occasionally used to mean the order of succession—to determine who replaces the head of state in the event he or she is removed from office or incapacitated—as they are often identical, at least near the top.\n\nWhat follows are the general orders of precedence for different countries for state purposes, such as diplomatic dinners, and are made under the assumption that such functions are held in the capital. When they are held in another city or region, local officials such as governors would be much higher up the order. There may also be more specific and local orders of precedence, for particular occasions or within particular institutions. Universities and the professions often have their own rules of precedence applying locally, based (for example) on university or professional rank, each rank then being ordered within itself on the basis of seniority (i.e. date of attaining that rank). Within an institution the officials of that institution are likely to rank much higher in the order than in a general order of precedence—the chancellor or president of a university may well precede anyone except a head of state for example. The same might be true for a mayor in his or her own city.\n\n\n\n"}

He is mainly remembered for his book \"The Theory of Human Progression\" of 1850 which sets out his philosophy that land should be in common ownership, with the \"economic rent\" on the land taking the place of other taxes, an idea generally known as Georgism.\n\nPatrick Dove came from a family of distinguished clergymen and landowners. He was descended from Sir William Dove of Upton, near Peterborough (son of Bishop Thomas Dove). His branch of the family had connections with the Royal Navy going back to 1716 when they moved to Devon where the family still live. His father, Lieutenant Henry Dove RN, retired from active service with the Navy at the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815, taking up an appointment at Deal, Kent connected with the Cinque Ports. Edward was educated in England and in France, where he was expelled from the Academy for leading a rebellion against the master. He greatly desired a career in the navy, but his father would not allow this and in 1830 Edward was sent to Scotland to learn farming. Following this he spent time in Paris, in Spain and in London, where he impressed a friend by his \"enormous energy, both physical and mental\".\n\nIn 1841 he took the \"Craig\" estate near Ballantrae, Ayrshire, and lived the quiet life of a country gentleman. He was a first-rate horseman, took up fly-fishing and sailing, was an excellent shot and showed mechanical abilities, contributing the article on gunmaking to the 8th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica. As well as becoming an agricultural adviser to neighbouring farmers, during the potato famine he put his energies into providing work for his starving neighbours. Since he disapproved of the game laws, he had no gamekeeper on his estate to stop poaching. \n\nAn unfortunate investment led to him losing most of his fortune in 1848, then in 1849 he married Ann Forrester, daughter of an Edinburgh solicitor. They spent the next year in Darmstadt, Germany, where he continued his interest in philosophy; studying, lecturing and writing.\n\nWhile Dove was still in Darmstadt, his book \"The Theory of Human Progression, and Natural Probability of a Reign of Justice\" was published anonymously in 1850 as a limited edition, both in London and Edinburgh. This was to be the first part of a treatise on \"a Science of politics\", defining science as \"nature seen by the reason, and not merely by the senses. Science exists in the mind, and in the mind alone.\" In it he set out his thesis that \"the land produces, according to the law of the Creator, more than the value of the labor expended upon it, and on this account men are willing to pay a rent for the land\", this rent being \"the profit that God had graciously been pleased to accord to human industry employed in the cultivation of the soil\". He saw the land as a gift of the Creator to all men, which should therefore be common rather than private property, but dividing the land into equal shares would be impractical, so the rent should be shared in common, effectively replacing all other taxes.\n\nThe book was praised by Thomas Carlyle as the voice of a new revolution in education and economics, and the philosopher Sir William Hamilton spoke of it rallying mankind to great reforms. Charles Sumner had copies made and circulated them in the United States, subsequently persuading Dove to write an article opposing slavery titled \"The Elder and Younger Brother\" which appeared in the \"Boston Commonwealth\" on 21 September 1853. Despite such praise the book was not a popular success, however some scholarly interest continued. In 1884 Henry George praised the book at a public meeting in Glasgow, and Dove is now seen as a forerunner of the idea known as Georgism.\n\nThe index and heading to page 476 uses the words \"Intelligence – intelligent design\", and this is now seen as one of the first uses of the term intelligent design which has lately been revived by an anti-evolution movement. However Dove does not discuss biological evolution, though \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" had brought ideas of transmutation of species to public attention in 1844, and uses the term \"evolution\" to refer to the development of \"a genuine natural theology\". He reasons that intuitive perception of a \"primordial force\" in the works of nature, if only matter is thought to be \"objective\", leads to pantheism, \"the theological credence of a large portion of the scientific men on the continent\". This appears to refer to the ideas of natural laws put forward by writers such as Auguste Comte which had influenced the inception of Darwin's theory, a theory which would not be made public until 1858. Dove contends that to achieve a \"scientific exit\" from pantheism the \"primordial force\" must be perceived as an intelligent agent, then notes that the adaption of matter for the achievement of ends has been called \"design\", a reference to the natural theology of the day.\n\nDove moved from Germany back to Edinburgh, where he gave lectures at the \"Philosophical Institution\", the subject in 1853 being \"Heroes of the Commonwealth\". In succeeding years he lectured on \"The Wild Sports of Scotland\" and \"The Crusades\". In April 1853 he became captain of the \"Midlothian Rifle Club\", and in 1854 as well as editing the \"Witness\" during the illness of a friend, he published the second volume of his treatise, \"Elements of Political Science\". This was followed by \"Romanism, Rationalism and Protestant\" in defence of Protestantism. He then wrote the concluding third volume of his treatise which remained unpublished and has been lost.\n\nHe published \"The Logic of the Christian Faith\", then in 1858 \"The Revolver\" which suggests ideas for rifle clubs and defence of the country as well as lamenting the Highland clearances. That year he moved to Glasgow and edited the \"Commonwealth\" newspaper as well as the \"Imperial Dictionary of Biography\" and jointly edited the \"Imperial Journal of the Arts and Sciences\". He also wrote the Encyclopædia Britannica article on \"Government\" and devised a rifled cannon with advantages in range and accuracy, but was unable to afford further testing which the ordnance committee requested. He took command of the 91st Lanarkshire rifle volunteers in 1859 and in the next year won several prizes at the first meeting of the National Rifle Association at Wimbledon Common, but then suffered a stroke causing paralysis. In May 1862 he went to convalesce in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, returning the following April, then died a year later. By this time slavery in the United States had been abolished.\n"}
{"id": "8428553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8428553", "title": "Professional courtesy", "text": "Professional courtesy\n\nProfessional courtesy generally refers to a philosophy of particular professional behavior or etiquette which is extended between members of the same profession. The concept of professional courtesy is believed to have originated within the ancient practice of medicine by where physicians provided services to other physicians without charge. However, the philosophy does not necessarily involve the same courtesy across all professions. Nor is professional courtesy a mandated privilege, but is freely given at the discretion of the party extending the courtesy.\n\nWhile the etiquette is not limited to physicians, the medical profession is likely the oldest and most well known for having such a long-standing tradition of professional courtesy among its professionals. Some other well known groups who have some form of professional courtesy also include attorneys, performing arts, and law enforcement. The phrase may also be applied in a literal form, such as the required ethical behavior of lawyers towards each other.\n\nIn 1803, Thomas Percival wrote his classic essay on medical ethics which endorsed complimentary professional care to “All members of the profession, including apothecaries as well as physicians and surgeons, together with their wives and children, should be attended gratuitously.” In 1847, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics similarly endorsed withholding charges for services to other physicians and their families, known as professional courtesy. This is likely the first modern day documentation of the philosophy.\n\nAmong physicians, it has been historically traditional to provide medical care at no or reduced cost to physician colleagues and their immediate family members. The original purpose of this was to discourage physicians from treating themselves and members of their own family. The custom dates back to Hippocrates, well before physicians reached middle-class income levels. However, physicians regularly providing free or reduced rate services as professional courtesy must remain mindful in the age of copays, insurance only billing, and referrals, the practice can run afoul of the law under certain circumstances.\n\nIn 1994, the American Medical Association issued a Code of Medical Ethics Opinion advising free of charge and reduced rate services was not an ethical requirement, and physicians should use their own judgment in deciding to extend such professional courtesy.\n\nThe term has been used to refer to the practice by law enforcement officers allowing other officers to engage in traffic violations and some crimes without being reported or arrested. There are three tools that law enforcement officers use to implement \"professional courtesy\":\n\nFirst, some states (such as California) issue \"confidential plates\" to employees in law enforcement, and other public officials. The plates keep identities and addresses anonymous, allowing employees the inadvertent ability to travel on toll-ways without charge. Even serious offences such as drunk driving are subject to professional courtesy \"discretion\", and federal law assists in the process by exempting police officers and firefighters from a federal law that requires truck drivers to be blood-tested after an accident.\n\nThird, there is a web site offering law enforcement employees the purchase of a \"family card\" they can give to friends and family to produce at, for example, a traffic stop to identify them to the officer as a family member. Anti-police groups and people wary of the ethical actions of police officers purport that where an ordinary member of the public would get a ticket this notification card will cause the officer to overlook any violations of the law the person may have made and tell them to go on their way. The vendor of this card is explicit about the intention behind these cards.\n\nUntil the 1960s it was customary for theater managements to permit members of Actors Equity and other members of the profession into Broadway shows for free. This practice continues in the Off-Off-Broadway world where members of Equity must be admitted free of charge to any Showcase production in which there is a member of the union in the cast if there are seats left at curtain time. This applies as well to \"bona fide\" producers, directors and casting directors, who do not have to wait until showtime to be seated.\n"}

{"id": "307371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307371", "title": "Samkhya", "text": "Samkhya\n\nSamkhya or Sankhya (, IAST: ') is one of the six āstika schools of Hindu philosophy. It is most related to the Yoga school of Hinduism, and it was influential on other schools of Indian philosophy. Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose epistemology accepts three of six pramanas (proofs) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These include \"pratyakṣa\" (perception), \"anumāṇa\" (inference) and \"śabda\" (\"āptavacana\", word/testimony of reliable sources). Sometimes described as one of the rationalist schools of Indian philosophy, this ancient school's reliance on reason was exclusive but strong.\n\nSamkhya is strongly dualist. Sāmkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities, puruṣa (consciousness) and prakṛti (matter). Jiva (a living being) is that state in which puruṣa is bonded to prakṛti in some form. This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of \"buddhi\" (\"intellect\") and \"ahaṅkāra\" (ego consciousness). The universe is described by this school as one created by purusa-prakṛti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind. During the state of imbalance, one of more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage, particularly of the mind. The end of this imbalance, bondage is called liberation, or kaivalya, by the Samkhya school.\n\nThe existence of God or supreme being is not directly asserted, nor considered relevant by the Samkhya philosophers. Sāṃkhya denies the final cause of Ishvara (God). While the Samkhya school considers the Vedas as a reliable source of knowledge, it is an atheistic philosophy according to Paul Deussen and other scholars. A key difference between Samkhya and Yoga schools, state scholars, is that Yoga school accepts a \"personal, yet essentially inactive, deity\" or \"personal god\". However, Radhanath Phukan, in the introduction to his translation of the \"Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna\" has argued that commentators who see the unmanifested as non-conscious make the mistake of regarding Samkhya as atheistic, though Samkhya is as much as theistic as Yoga is.\n\nSamkhya is known for its theory of guṇas (qualities, innate tendencies). Guṇa, it states, are of three types: \"sattva\" being goodness, compassion, illumination, and positivity; \"rajas\" being activity, chaos, passion, and impulsivity, potentially good or bad; and \"tamas\" being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destruction, lethargy, negativity. All matter (\"prakṛti\"), states Samkhya, has these three guṇas, but in different proportions. The interplay of these guṇas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life. The Samkhya theory of guṇas was widely discussed, developed and refined by various schools of Indian philosophies. Samkhya's philosophical treatises also influenced the development of various theories of Hindu ethics.\n\n\"Samkhya\" (सांख्य), also referred to as \"Sankhya\", \"Sāṃkhya\", or \"Sāṅkhya\", is a Sanskrit word that, depending on the context, means \"to reckon, count, enumerate, calculate, deliberate, reason, reasoning by numeric enumeration, relating to number, rational.\" In the context of ancient Indian philosophies, \"Samkhya\" refers to the philosophical school in Hinduism based on systematic enumeration and rational examination.\n\nThe word \"samkhya\" means \"empirical\" or \"relating to numbers\". Although the term had been used in the general sense of \"metaphysical knowledge\" before, in technical usage it refers to the Samkhya school of thought that evolved into a cohesive philosophical system in early centuries CE. The Samkhya system is called so because \"it 'enumerates' twenty five \"Tattvas\" or true principles; and its chief object is to effect the final emancipation of the twenty-fifth Tattva, i.e. the puruṣa or soul.\"\n\nSome 19th and 20th century scholars suggested that Samkhya may have non-Vedic origins. Richard Garbe stated in 1898, \"The origin of the Sankhya system appears in the proper light only when we understand that in those regions of India which were little influenced by Brahmanism the first attempt had been made to solve the riddles of the world and of our existence merely by means of reason. For the Sankhya philosophy is, in its essence, not only atheistic but also inimical to the Veda.\" Dandekar, similarly wrote in 1968, \"The origin of the Sankhya is to be traced to the pre-Vedic non-Aryan thought complex\".\n\nSome scholars disagreed with this view. Surendranath Dasgupta, for example in 1922, stated, Samkhya can be traced to Upanishads such as Katha, Shvetashvatara and Maitrayani, and the \"extant Samkhya\" is a system that unites the doctrine of permanence of the Upanishads with the doctrine of momentariness of Buddhism and the doctrine of relativism of Jainism.\n\nArthur Keith in 1925 stated, \"Samkhya owes its origin to the Vedic-Upanisadic-epic heritage is quite evident,\" and \"Samkhya is most naturally derived out of the speculations in the Vedas, Brahmanas and the Upanishads.\"\n\nJohnston in 1937, analyzed then available Hindu and Buddhist texts for the origins of Samkhya, then wrote \"the origin lay in the analysis of the individual undertaken in the Brahmanas and earliest Upanishads, at first with a view to assuring the efficacy of the sacrificial rites and later in order to discover the meaning of salvation in the religious sense and the methods of attaining it. Here – in Kaushitaki Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad – the germ are to be found (of) two of the main ideas of classical Samkhya.\"\n\nChandradhar Sharma in 1960 affirmed that Samkhya in the beginning was based on the theistic absolute of Upanishads, but later on under the influence of Jaina and Buddhist thought it rejected theistic monism and was content with spiritualistic pluralism and atheistic realism. This also explains why some of the later Samkhyas, e.g. Vijnanabhiksu in the sixteenth century, tried to revive the earlier theism in Samkhya.\n\nMore recent scholarship offers another perspective. Ruzsa in 2006, for example, states, \"Sāṅkhya has a very long history. Its roots go deeper than textual traditions allow us to see. The ancient Buddhist Aśvaghoṣa (in his Buddha-Carita) describes Arāḍa Kālāma, the teacher of the young Buddha (ca. 420 B.C.E.) as following an archaic form of Sāṅkhya.\"\n\nAnthony Warder in 2009, summarizes that Samkhya and Mīmāṃsā schools appear to have been established before Sramana traditions in India (~500 BCE), and he traces Samkhya origins to be Vedic. Samkhya, writes Warder, \"has indeed been suggested to be non-Brahmanical and even anti-Vedic in origin, but there is no tangible evidence for that except that it is very different than most Vedic speculation – but that is (itself) quite inconclusive. Speculations in the direction of the Samkhya can be found in the early Upanishads.\"\n\nMikel Burley in 2012, writes Richard Garbe's 19th century view on Samkhya's origin are weak and implausible. Burley states that India's religio-cultural heritage is complicated, and likely experienced a non-linear development. Samkhya is not necessarily non-Vedic nor pre-Vedic, nor a \"reaction to Brahmanic hegemony\", states Burley. It is most plausibly, in its origins a lineage that grew and evolved from a combination of ascetic traditions and Vedic \"\"guru\" (teacher) and disciples\". Burley suggests the link between Samkhya and Yoga as likely root of this evolutionary origin during the Vedic era of India.\n\nBetween 1938 and 1967, two previously unknown manuscript editions of \"Yuktidipika\" (ca. 600-700 CE) were discovered and published. \"Yuktidipika\" is an ancient review by an unknown author and has emerged as the most important commentary on \"Samkhyakarika\" – itself an ancient key text of the Samkhya school. This commentary, the reconstruction of pre-\"Karika\" epistemology, and of \"Samkhya\" emanation text (containing cosmology-ontology) from the earliest Puranas and \"Mokshadharma\", suggest that \"Samkhya\" as a technical philosophical system existed from about the last century BCE through the early centuries of common era. \"Yuktidipika\" suggests that many more ancient scholars contributed to the origins of \"Samkhya\" in ancient India, than were previously known, and that \"Samkhya\" was a polemical philosophical system. However, almost nothing is preserved about the centuries when these ancient \"Samkhya\" scholars lived. Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter state that the shift of \"Samkhya\" from speculations to the normative conceptualization hints, but does not conclusively prove, that \"Samkhya\" may be the oldest of the Indian technical philosophical schools (\"Nyaya\", \"Vaisheshika\", Budhhist ontology), one that evolved over time and influenced the technical aspects of Buddhism and Jainism. These scholars trace the earliest references to \"Samkhya\" ideas (designated as proto-\"Samkhya\" environments) to the composition of Chandogya Upanishad (~800 BCE to ~600 BCE). \"Samkhya\" philosophy proper begins with the pre-\"karika-Samkhya\" (ca. 100 BCE - 200 CE).\n\nSage Kapila is traditionally credited as a founder of the Samkhya school. However, it is unclear in which century of 1st millennium BCE Kapila lived. Kapila appears in Rigveda, but context suggests that the word means \"reddish-brown color\". Both Kapila as a \"seer\" and the term \"Samkhya\" appear in hymns of section 5.2 in Shvetashvatara Upanishad (~300 BCE), suggesting Kapila's and Samkhya philosophy's origins may predate it. Numerous other ancient Indian texts mention Kapila; for example, Baudhayana Grhyasutra in chapter IV.16.1 describes a system of rules for ascetic life credited to Kapila, called \"Kapila Sannyasa Vidha\". A 6th century CE Chinese translation and other texts consistently state Kapila as an ascetic and the founder of the school, mention Asuri as the inheritor of the teaching, and a much later scholar named Pancasikha as the scholar who systematized it and then helped widely disseminate its ideas. Isvarakrsna is identified in these texts as the one who summarized and simplified Samkhya theories of Pancasikha, many centuries later (roughly 4th or 5th century CE), in the form that was then translated into Chinese by Paramartha in the 6th century CE.\n\nThe early texts of the Vedic period, contain references to elements of Samkhya philosophy. However, the Samkhya ideas had not distilled and congealed into a distinct, complete philosophy. The early, proto-Samkhya phase was followed by early Upanishads, about 800 to 700 BCE, wherein ascetic spirituality and monastic (\"sramana\" and \"yati\") traditions came in vogue in India. It is in this period, state Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter, that ancient scholars combined proto-Samkhya ideas with a systematic methodology of reasoning (epistemology) and began distilling concepts of spiritual knowledge (\"vidya, jnana, viveka\"), making Samkhya a more emerging, comprehensive philosophy. These developing ideas are found in texts such as the Chandogya Upanishad.\n\nSometime about the 5th century BCE, Samkhya thought from various sources started coalescing into a distinct, complete philosophy. Philosophical texts such as the Katha Upanishad in verses 3.10–13 and 6.7–11 describe a well defined concept of puruṣa and other concepts of Samkhya, The \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" in chapter 6.13 describes Samkhya with Yoga philosophy, and Bhagavad Gita in book 2 provides axiological implications of Samkhya, therewith providing textual evidence of Samkhyan terminology and concepts. Katha Upanishad conceives the Purusha (cosmic spirit, consciousness) as same as the individual soul (Ātman, Self).\n\nThe \"Mokshadharma\" chapter of Shanti Parva (Book of Peace) in the Mahabharata epic, composed between 400 BCE to 400 CE, explains Samkhya ideas along with other extant philosophies, and then lists numerous scholars in recognition of their philosophical contributions to various Indian traditions, and therein at least three Samkhya scholars can be recognized – Kapila, Asuri and Pancasikha. The 12th chapter of the Buddhist text \"Buddhacarita\" suggests Samkhya philosophical tools of reliable reasoning were well formed by about 5th century BCE.\n\nSamkhya and Yoga are mentioned together for first time in chapter 6.13 of the Shvetashvatra Upanishad, as \"samkhya-yoga-adhigamya\" (literally, \"to be understood by proper reasoning and spiritual discipline\"). Bhagavad Gita identifies Samkhya with understanding or knowledge. The three gunas are also mentioned in the Gita, though they are not used in the same sense as in classical Samkhya. The Gita integrates Samkhya thought with the devotion (bhakti) of theistic schools and the impersonal Brahman of Vedanta.\n\nAccording to Ruzsa, about 2,000 years ago \"Sāṅkhya became the representative philosophy of Hindu thought in Hindu circles\", influencing all strands of the Hindu tradition and Hindu texts.\n\nThe ideas that were developed and assimilated into the classical Samkhya text, the \"Sāṅkhyakārikā\", are visible in earlier Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas, the Upanishads and the \"Bhagavad Gita\". The earliest mention of dualism is in the \"Rigveda\", a text that was compiled in the second millennium BCE., in various chapters.\nAt a mythical level, dualism is found in the Indra–Vritra myth of chapter 1.32 of the Rigveda. Enumeration, the etymological root of the word Samkhya, is found in numerous chapters of the Rigveda, such as 1.164, 10.90 and 10.129. Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter state that the likely roots of philosophical premises, spirit-matter dualism, meditative themes and religious cosmology in Samkhya philosophy are in the hymns of 1.164 (Riddle Hymns) and 10.129 (Nasadiya Hymns). However these hymns present only the outline of ideas, not specific Samkhya theories and these theories developed in a much later period.\n\nThe Riddle hymns of the Rigveda, famous for their numerous enumerations, structural language symmetry within the verses and the chapter, enigmatic word play with anagrams that symbolically portray parallelism in rituals and the cosmos, nature and the inner life of man. This hymn includes enumeration (counting) as well as a series of dual concepts cited by early Upanishads . For example, the hymns 1.164.2 - 1.164-3 mention \"seven\" multiple times, which in the context of other chapters of Rigveda have been interpreted as referring to both seven priests at a ritual and seven constellations in the sky, the entire hymn is a riddle that paints a ritual as well as the sun, moon, earth, three seasons, the transitory nature of living beings, the passage of time and spirit.\n\nThe chapter 1.164 asks a number of metaphysical questions, such as \"what is the One in the form of the Unborn that created the six realms of the world?\". Dualistic philosophical speculations then follow in chapter 1.164 of the Rigveda, particularly in the well studied \"allegory of two birds\" hymn (1.164.20 - 1.164.22), a hymn that is referred to in the Mundaka Upanishad and other texts . The two birds in this hymn have been interpreted to mean various forms of dualism: \"the sun and the moon\", the \"two seekers of different kinds of knowledge\", and \"the body and the atman\".\nThe emphasis of duality between existence (sat) and non-existence (asat) in the Nasadiya Sukta of the \"Rigveda\" is similar to the vyakta–avyakta (manifest–unmanifest) polarity in Samkhya. The hymns about Puruṣa may also have influenced Samkhya. The Samkhya notion of buddhi or mahat is similar to the notion of hiranyagarbha, which appears in both the \"Rigveda\" and the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\".\n\nThe oldest of the major Upanishads (c. 900–600 BCE) contain speculations along the lines of classical Samkhya philosophy. The concept of ahamkara in Samkhya can be traced back to the notion of ahamkara in chapters 1.2 and 1.4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and chapter 7.25 of the \"Chāndogya Upaniṣad\". Satkaryavada, the theory of causation in Samkhya, can be traced to the verses in sixth chapter which emphasize the primacy of sat (being) and describe creation from it. The idea that the three gunas or attributes influence creation is found in both Chandogya and Shvetashvatara Upanishads. Upanishadic sages Yajnavalkya and Uddalaka Aruni developed the idea that pure consciousness was the innermost essence of a human being. The purusha of Samkhya could have evolved from this idea. The enumeration of tattvas in Samkhya is also found in Taittiriya Upanishad, Aitareya Upanishad and Yajnavalkya–Maitri dialogue in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.\n\nBuddhism and Jainism had developed in eastern India by the 5th century BCE. It is probable that these schools of thought and the earliest schools of Samkhya influenced each other. A prominent similarity between Buddhism and Samkhya is the greater emphasis on suffering (dukkha) as the foundation for their respective soteriological theories, than other Indian philosophies. However, suffering appears central to Samkhya in its later literature, which suggests a likely Buddhism influence. Elaide, however, presents the alternate theory that Samkhya and Buddhism developed their soteriological theories over time, benefitting from their mutual influence.\n\nLikewise, the Jain doctrine of plurality of individual souls (jiva) could have influenced the concept of multiple purushas in Samkhya. However Hermann Jacobi, an Indologist, thinks that there is little reason to assume that Samkhya notion of Purushas was solely dependent on the notion of jiva in Jainism. It is more likely, that Samkhya was moulded by many ancient theories of soul in various Vedic and non-Vedic schools.\nLarson, Bhattacharya and Potter state it to be likely that early Samkhya doctrines found in oldest Upanishads (~700-800 BCE) provided the contextual foundations and influenced Buddhist and Jaina doctrines, and these became contemporaneous, sibling intellectual movements with Samkhya and other schools of Hindu philosophy. This is evidenced, for example, by the references to Samkhya in ancient and medieval era Jaina literature.\n\nThe earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the \"Samkhya Karika\" (c. 200 CE or 350–450 CE) of Īśvarakṛṣṇa. There were probably other texts in early centuries CE, however none of them are available today. Iśvarakṛṣṇa in his \"Kārikā\" describes a succession of the disciples from Kapila, through \"Āsuri and \"Pañcaśikha to himself. The text also refers to an earlier work of Samkhya philosophy called Ṣaṣṭitantra (science of sixty topics) which is now lost. The text was imported and translated into Chinese about the middle of the 6th century CE. The records of Al Biruni, the Persian visitor to India in the early 11th century, suggests Samkhyakarika was an established and definitive text in India in his times.\n\n\"Samkhyakarika\" includes distilled statements on epistemology, metaphysics and soteriology of the Samkhya school. For example, the fourth to sixth verses of the text states it epistemic premises,\n\nThe most popular commentary on the Samkhyakarika was the Gauḍapāda Bhāṣya attributed to Gauḍapāda, the proponent of Advaita Vedanta school of philosophy. Richard King, Professor of Religious Studies, thinks it is unlikely that Gauḍapāda could have authored both texts, given the differences between the two philosophies. Other important commentaries on the karika were \"Yuktidīpīka\" (c. 6th century CE) and \"Vācaspati\"’s \"Sāṁkhyatattvakaumudī\" (c. 10th century CE).\n\nThe \"Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra\" (c. 14th century CE) renewed interest in Samkhya in the medieval era. It is considered the second most important work of Samkhya after the karika. Commentaries on this text were written by Anirruddha (\"Sāṁkhyasūtravṛtti\", c. 15th century CE), Vijñānabhikṣu (\"Sāṁkhyapravacanabhāṣya\", c. 16th century CE), Mahādeva (vṛttisāra, c. 17th century CE) and Nāgeśa (\"Laghusāṁkhyasūtravṛtti\"). According to Surendranath Dasgupta, scholar of Indian philosophy, Charaka Samhita, an ancient Indian medical treatise, also contains thoughts from an early Samkhya school.\n\nThe 13th century text \"Sarvadarsanasangraha\" contains 16 chapters, each devoted to a separate school of Indian philosophy. The 13th chapter in this book contains a description of the Samkhya philosophy.\n\nIn his \"Studies in Samkhya Philosophy\", K.C. Bhattacharya writes: \n\nSamkhya considered \"Pratyakṣa\" or \"Dṛṣṭam\" (direct sense perception), \"Anumāna\" (inference), and \"Śabda\" or \"Āptavacana\" (verbal testimony of the sages or shāstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or \"pramana\". Unlike some other schools, Samkhya did not consider the following three \"pramanas\" to be epistemically proper: \"Upamāṇa\" (comparison and analogy), \"Arthāpatti\" (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or \"Anupalabdi\" (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) .\n\n\nWhile Western philosophical traditions, as exemplified by Descartes, equate mind with the conscious self and theorize on consciousness on the basis of mind/body dualism; Samkhya provides an alternate viewpoint, intimately related to substance dualism, by drawing a metaphysical line between consciousness and matter—where matter includes both body and mind.\n\nThe Samkhya system espouses dualism between consciousness and matter by postulating two \"irreducible, innate and independent realities: puruṣa and prakṛti. While the prakṛti is a single entity, the Samkhya admits a plurality of the puruṣas in this world. Unintelligent, unmanifest, uncaused, ever-active, imperceptible and eternal prakṛti is alone the final source of the world of objects which is implicitly and potentially contained in its bosom. The puruṣa is considered as the conscious principle, a passive enjoyer (\"bhokta\") and the prakṛti is the enjoyed (\"bhogya\"). Samkhya believes that the puruṣa cannot be regarded as the source of inanimate world, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unconscious world. It is a pluralistic spiritualism, atheistic realism and uncompromising dualism.\n\nPuruṣa is the transcendental self or pure consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable through other agencies, above any experience by mind or senses and beyond any words or explanations. It remains pure, \"nonattributive consciousness\". Puruṣa is neither produced nor does it produce. It is held that unlike Advaita Vedanta and like Purva-Mīmāṃsā, Samkhya believes in plurality of the puruṣas.\n\nPrakṛti is the first cause of the manifest material universe—of everything except the puruṣa. Prakṛti accounts for whatever is physical, both mind and matter-cum-energy or force. Since it is the first principle (\"tattva\") of the universe, it is called the \"pradhāna\", but, as it is the unconscious and unintelligent principle, it is also called the \"jaDa\". It is composed of three essential characteristics (\"triguna\"s). These are:\n\nAll physical events are considered to be manifestations of the evolution of \"prakṛti,\" or primal nature (from which all physical bodies are derived). Each sentient being or Jiva is a fusion of puruṣa and prakṛti, whose soul/puruṣa is limitless and unrestricted by its physical body. \"Samsāra\" or bondage arises when the puruṣa does not have the discriminate knowledge and so is misled as to its own identity, confusing itself with the Ego/ahamkāra, which is actually an attribute of \"prakṛti\". The spirit is liberated when the discriminate knowledge of the difference between conscious puruṣa and unconscious prakṛti is realized by the puruṣa.\n\nThe unconscious primordial materiality, prakṛti, contains 23 components including intellect (buddhi,mahat), ego (ahamkara) and mind (manas); the intellect, mind and ego are all seen as forms of unconscious matter. Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from Purusha. In Samkhya, consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or 'shapes' assumed by the mind. So intellect, after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness, creates thought structures that appear to be conscious. Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them. But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates.\n\nBy including mind in the realm of matter, Samkhya avoids one of the most serious pitfalls of Cartesian dualism, the violation of physical conservation laws. Because mind is an evolute of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy and are therefore able to initiate bodily motions.\n\nThe idea of evolution in Samkhya revolves around the interaction of prakṛti and Purusha. Prakṛti remains unmanifested as long as the three gunas are in equilibrium. This equilibrium of the gunas is disturbed when prakṛti comes into proximity with consciousness or Purusha. The disequilibrium of the gunas triggers an evolution that leads to the manifestation of the world from an unmanifested prakṛti. The metaphor of movement of iron in the proximity of a magnet is used to describe this process.\n\nSome evolutes of prakṛti can cause further evolution and are labelled evolvents. For example, intellect while itself created out of prakṛti causes the evolution of ego-sense or ahamkara and is therefore an evolvent. While, other evolutes like the five elements do not cause further evolution. It is important to note that an evolvent is defined as a principle which behaves as the material cause for the evolution of another principle. So, in definition, while the five elements are the material cause of all living beings, they cannot be called evolvents because living beings are not separate from the five elements in essence.\n\nThe intellect is the first evolute of prakṛti and is called mahat or the great one. It causes the evolution of ego-sense or self-consciousness. Evolution from self-consciousness is affected by the dominance of gunas. So dominance of sattva causes the evolution of the five organs of perception, five organs of action and the mind. Dominance of tamas triggers the evolution of five subtle elements– sound, touch, sight, taste, smell from self-consciousness. These five subtle elements are themselves evolvents and cause the creation of the five gross elements space, air, fire, water and earth. Rajas is cause of action in the evolutes. Purusha is pure consciousness absolute, eternal and subject to no change. It is neither a product of evolution, nor the cause of any evolute.\n\nEvolution in Samkhya is thought to be purposeful. The two primary purposes of evolution of prakṛti are the enjoyment and the liberation of Purusha. The 23 evolutes of prakṛti are categorized as follows:\n\nSamkhya school considers moksha as a natural quest of every soul. The Samkhyakarika states,\nSamkhya regards ignorance (avidyā) as the root cause of suffering and bondage (\"Samsara\"). Samkhya states that the way out of this suffering is through knowledge (viveka). Mokṣa (liberation), states Samkhya school, results from knowing the difference between prakṛti (avyakta-vyakta) and puruṣa (jña).\n\nPuruṣa, the eternal pure consciousness, due to ignorance, identifies itself with products of prakṛti such as intellect (buddhi) and ego (ahamkara). This results in endless transmigration and suffering. However, once the realization arises that puruṣa is distinct from prakṛti, is more than empirical ego, and that puruṣa is deepest conscious self within, the Self gains isolation (\"kaivalya\") and freedom (\"moksha\").\n\nOther forms of Samkhya teach that Mokṣa is attained by one's own development of the higher faculties of discrimination achieved by meditation and other yogic practices. Moksha is described by Samkhya scholars as a state of liberation, where \"Sattva\" guna predominates.\n\nThe Samkhya system is based on Sat-kārya-vāda or the theory of causation. According to Satkāryavāda, the effect is pre-existent in the cause. There is only an apparent or illusory change in the makeup of the cause and not a material one, when it becomes effect. Since, effects cannot come from nothing, the original cause or ground of everything is seen as prakṛti.\n\nMore specifically, Samkhya system follows the \"prakṛti-Parināma Vāda\". \"Parināma\" denotes that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. The cause under consideration here is prakṛti or more precisely Moola-prakṛti (Primordial Matter). The Samkhya system is therefore an exponent of an evolutionary theory of matter beginning with primordial matter. In evolution, prakṛti is transformed and differentiated into multiplicity of objects. Evolution is followed by dissolution. In dissolution the physical existence, all the worldly objects mingle back into prakṛti, which now remains as the undifferentiated, primordial substance. This is how the cycles of evolution and dissolution follow each other. But this theory is very different from the modern theories of science in the sense that prakṛti evolves for each Jiva separately, giving individual bodies and minds to each and after liberation these elements of prakṛti merges into the Moola prakṛti. Another uniqueness of Sāmkhya is that not only physical entities but even mind, ego and intelligence are regarded as forms of Unconsciousness, quite distinct from pure consciousness.\n\nSamkhya theorizes that prakṛti is the source of the perceived world of becoming. It is pure potentiality that evolves itself successively into twenty four tattvas or principles. The evolution itself is possible because prakṛti is always in a state of tension among its constituent strands or gunas – Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. In a state of equilibrium of three gunas, when the three together are one, \"unmanifest\" prakṛti which is unknowable. A guna is an entity that can change, either increase or decrease, therefore, pure consciousness is called nirguna or without any modification.\n\nThe evolution obeys causality relationships, with primal Nature itself being the material cause of all physical creation. The cause and effect theory of Samkhya is called \"Satkārya-vāda\" (theory of existent causes), and holds that nothing can really be created from or destroyed into nothingness – all evolution is simply the transformation of primal Nature from one form to another.\n\nSamkhya cosmology describes how life emerges in the universe; the relationship between Purusha and prakṛti is crucial to Patanjali's yoga system. The strands of Samkhya thought can be traced back to the Vedic speculation of creation. It is also frequently mentioned in the Mahabharata and Yogavasishta.\n\nSamkhya accepts the notion of higher selves or perfected beings but rejects the notion of God. Classical Samkhya argues against the existence of God on metaphysical grounds. Samkhya theorists argue that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever-changing world and that God was only a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances. The Sutras of Samkhya have no explicit role for a separate God distinct from the puruṣa. Such a distinct God is inconceivable and self-contradictory and some commentaries speak plainly on this subject.\n\nAccording to Sinha, the following arguments were given by the Samkhya philosophers against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:\nTherefore, Samkhya maintained that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God.\n\nThe \"Sankhya-tattva-kaumudi\" commenting on Karika 57 argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world (for Himself) and if God's motive is kindness (for others), Samkhya questions whether it is reasonable to call into existence beings who while non-existent had no suffering.\n\nThe \"\" in verse no. 1.92 directly states that existence of \"Ishvara (God) is unproved\". Hence there is no philosophical place for a creationist God in this system. It is also argued by commentators of this text that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist.\n\nThese commentaries of Samkhya postulate that a benevolent deity ought to create only happy creatures, not a mixed world like the real world. A majority of modern academic scholars are of view that the concept of Ishvara was incorporated into the \"nirishvara\" (atheistic) Samkhya viewpoint only after it became associated with the Yoga, the Pasupata and the Bhagavata schools of philosophy. This theistic Samkhya philosophy is described in the Mahabharata, the Puranas and the Bhagavad Gita\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara called \"Samkhya\" as the 'principal opponent' (\"pradhana-malla\") of the Vedanta. He criticized the \"Samkhya\" view that the cause of the universe is the unintelligent \"Prakruti\" (\"Pradhan\"). According to Shankara, the Intelligent Brahman only can be such a cause. He considered \"Samkhya\" philosophy as propounded in Samkhyakarika to be inconsistent with the teachings in the Vedas, and considered the dualism in Samkhya to be non-Vedic. In contrast, ancient Samkhya philosophers in India claimed Vedic authority for their views.\n\nWith the publication of previously unknown editions of \"Yuktidipika\" about mid 20th century, scholars have suggested what they call as \"a tempting hypothesis\", but uncertain, that Samkhya tradition may be the oldest of the Indian technical philosophical schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika). The Vaisheshika atomism, Nyaya epistemology may all have roots in the early Samkhya school of thought; but these schools likely developed in parallel with an evolving Samkhya tradition, as sibling intellectual movements.\n\nThe Yoga school derives its ontology and epistemology from Samkhya and adds to it the concept of Isvara. However, scholarly opinion on the actual relationship between Yoga and Samkhya is divided. While Jakob Wilhelm Hauer and Georg Feuerstein believe that Yoga was a tradition common to many Indian schools and its association with Samkhya was artificially foisted upon it by commentators such as Vyasa. Johannes Bronkhorst and Eric Frauwallner think that Yoga never had a philosophical system separate from Samkhya. Bronkhorst further adds that the first mention of Yoga as a separate school of thought is no earlier than Śankara's (c. 788–820 CE) Brahmasūtrabhaśya.\n\nThe dualistic metaphysics of various Tantric traditions illustrates the strong influence of Samkhya on Tantra. Shaiva Siddhanta was identical to Samkhya in its philosophical approach, barring the addition of a transcendent theistic reality. Knut A. Jacobsen, Professor of Religious Studies, notes the influence of Samkhya on Srivaishnavism. According to him, this Tantric system borrows the abstract dualism of Samkhya and modifies it into a personified male–female dualism of Vishnu and Sri Lakshmi. Dasgupta speculates that the Tantric image of a wild Kali standing on a slumbering Shiva was inspired from the Samkhyan conception of prakṛti as a dynamic agent and Purusha as a passive witness. However, Samkhya and Tantra differed in their view on liberation. While Tantra sought to unite the male and female ontological realities, Samkhya held a withdrawal of consciousness from matter as the ultimate goal.\n\nAccording to Bagchi, the Samkhya Karika (in karika 70) identifies Sāmkhya as a Tantra, and its philosophy was one of the main influences both on the rise of the Tantras as a body of literature, as well as Tantra sadhana.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an urban pop art movement in South Florida that combines super bright colors and ultra flat images. The subject matters are very diverse. It is an outcrop of the Japanese Superflat movement, founded by the artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nThese artists emphasize outlines and flat areas of color. What is important is the feeling of flatness. Many of the artists involved in SoFlo Superflat art believe that the culture in SoFlo is not three-dimensional; therefore, it can be better interpreted in very flat brightly colored two-dimensional images. SoFlo Superflat was born out of the compression of genres which is shown through the pop-inflected work of younger artists. The artists in this genre have very specific styles that can be best described as a consistent pictorial language. Repetition of images and pattern is used create a signature look. For example, Britto's \"squiggle lines\" and geometric patterns are consistent themes in his work. Artists whose work is regarded as \"SoFlo Superflat\" include: Britto, Caron Bowman, Raul Cremata, Ceron, Ed King, Jose Alvares. \n\nThis new generation of artist does not think about what is art or what is illustration or what is graffiti. Faced with a level of economic uncertainty, SoFlo Superflat artists create their own version of popular culture to draw attention to the dominance of the media, entertainment and consumption. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3450546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3450546", "title": "Sufi metaphysics", "text": "Sufi metaphysics\n\nMajor ideas in Sufi metaphysics have surrounded the concept of \"weḥdah\" () meaning \"unity\", or in Arabic \"tawhid\". Two main Sufi philosophies prevail on this topic. \"waḥdat al-wujūd\" literally means the \"Unity of Existence\" or \"Unity of Being\" but better translation would be Monotheism of Existence. Wujud (i.e. existence) here refers to Allah's Wujud - implication is Wahdat/Tawheed Of Wujud Of Allah. On the other hand, \"waḥdat ash-shuhūd\", meaning \"Apparentism\" or \"Monotheism of Witness\", holds that God and his creation are entirely separate.\n\nSome Islamic reformers have claimed that the difference between the two philosophies differ only in semantics and that the entire debate is merely a collection of \"verbal controversies\" which have come about because of ambiguous language. However, the concept of the relationship between God and the universe is still actively debated both among Sufis and between Sufis and non-Sufi Muslims.\n\nThe philosophy of Wahdat al-Wujud was first ever prevailed by Husayn ibn Ali in his book Mirat-ul-Arifeen which he wrote in response to the question of his son Zayn al-Abidin about the explanation of Surah Al-Fatiha. In this book, he interpreted the ideology of Wahdat al-wujud for the first time in the most comprehensive way. After that, the mystical thinker and theologian Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi discussed this concept in his book called Tohfa Mursala. An Andalusian Sufi saint Ibn Sabin is also known to employ this term in his writings. But the Sufi saint who is most characterized in discussing the ideology of Sufi metaphysics in deepest details is Ibn Arabi. He employs the term wujud to refer to God as the Necessary Being. He also attributes the term to everything other than God, but he insists that wujud does not belong to the things found in the cosmos in any real sense. Rather, the things borrow wujud from God, much as the earth borrow light from the sun. The issue is how wujūd can rightfully be attributed to the things, also called \"entities\" (aʿyān). From the perspective of tanzih, Ibn Arabi declares that wujūd belongs to God alone, and, in his famous phrase, the things \"have never smelt a whiff of wujud.\" From the point of view of tasbih, he affirms that all things are wujūd's self-disclosure (tajalli) or self-manifestation (ẓohur). In sum, all things are \"He/not He\" (howa/lāhowa), which is to say that they are both God and other than God, both wujud and other than wujud. In his book Fasus –al-Hikam, Ibn-e-Arabi states that \" wujūd is the unknowable and inaccessible ground of everything that exists. God alone is true wujūd, while all things dwell in nonexistence, so also wujūd alone is nondelimited (muṭlaq), while everything else is constrained, confined, and constricted. Wujūd is the absolute, infinite, nondelimited reality of God, while all others remain relative, finite, and delimited\".\n\nIbn Arabi’s doctrine of wahdat ul wujud focuses on the esoteric (batin) reality of creatures instead of exoteric (zahir) dimension of reality. Therefore he interprets that wujud is one and unique reality from which all reality derives. The external world of sensible objects is but a fleeting shadow of the Real (al- Haq), God . God alone is the all embracing and eternal reality. Whatever exists is the shadow(tajalli) of the Real and is not independent of God. This is summed up in Ibn Arabi’s own words.\n\" Glory to Him who created all things, being Himself their very essence(ainuha)\"\n\nTo call wujud or Real Being \"one\" is to speak of the unity of the Essence. In other terms, it is to say that Being—Light in itself—is nondelimited (mutlaq), that is, infinite and absolute, undefined and indefinable, indistinct and indistinguishable. In contrast, everything other than Being—every existent thing (mawjûd)—is distinct, defined, and limited(muqayyad). The Real is incomparable and transcendent, but it discloses itself (tajallî) in all things, so it is also similar and immanent. It possesses such utter nondelimitation that it is not delimited by nondelimitation. \"God possesses Nondelimited Being, but no delimitation prevents Him from delimitation. On the contrary, He possesses all delimitations, so He is nondelimited delimitation\" \nOn the highest level, wujūd is the absolute and nondelimited reality of God, the \"Necessary Being\" (wājib al-wujūd) that cannot not exist. In this sense, wujūd designates the Essence of God or of the Real (dhāt al-ḥaqq), the only reality that is real in every respect. On lower levels, wujūd is the underlying substance of \"everything other than God\" (māsiwāAllāh)—which is how Ibn Arabi and others define the \"cosmos\" or \"universe\" (al-ʿālam). Hence, in a secondary meaning, the term wujūd is used as shorthand to refer to the whole cosmos, to everything that exists. It can also be employed to refer to the existence of each and every thing that is found in the universe.\n\nGod's 'names' or 'attributes', on the other hand, are the relationships which can be discerned between the Essence and the cosmos. They are known to God because he knows every object of knowledge, but they are not existent entities or ontological qualities, for this would imply plurality in the godhead.\nIbn 'Arabî used the term \"effusion\" (fayd) to denote the act of creation. His writings contain expressions which show different stages of creation, a distinction merely logical and not actual. The following gives details about his vision of creation in three stages: the Most Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-aqdas), the Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-muqaddas) and the Perpetual Effusion (al-fayd al-mustamirr).\nWaḥdat al-wujūd spread through the teachings of the Sufis like Qunyawi, Jandi, Tilimsani, Qayshari, Jami etc.\n\nThe noted scholar Muhibullah Allahabadi strongly supported the doctrine.\n\nSachal Sarmast and Bulleh Shah two Sufi poets from India, were also ardent followers of Waḥdat al-wujūd.\nIt is also associated with the \"Hamah Ust\" (Persian meaning \"He is the only one\") philosophy in South Asia.\n\nTashkīk or gradation is closely associated with Sadrian interpretation of waḥdat al-wujūd. According to this school, the reality and existence are identical which means existence is one but graded in intensity. This methodology was given a name of tashkik al-wujud and it thus explains that there is gradation of existence that stand in a vast hierarchical chain of being (marāṭib al-wujūd) from floor (farsh) to divine throne (ʿarsh), but the wujūd of each existent \"māhīyya\" is nothing but a grade of the single reality of wujūd whose source is God, the absolute being (al-wujūd al-mutlaq). What differentiates the wujūd of different existents is nothing but wujūd in different degrees of strength and weakness. The universe is nothing but different degrees of strengths and weaknesses of wujūd, ranging from intense degree of wujūd of arch-angelic realities, to the dim wujūd of lowly dust from which Adam was made.\n\nSufi metaphysics has been a subject to criticism by most non-Sufis; in Al-Andalus, where most of the Muslim scholars were either Zahirites or Malikites preferring the Ash'arite creed, Sufi metaphysics was considered blasphemy and its practitioners blacklisted. Followers of the Ash'arite creed in the east were often suspicious of Sufism as well, most often citing Sufi metaphysics as well.\n\nSome Sufis, such as Ahmad Sirhindi, have criticised wahdat-al-wujud. Ahmad Sirhindi wrote about the sayings that universe has no existence of its own and is a shadow of the existence of the necessary being. He also wrote that one should discern the existence of universe from the absolute and that the absolute does not exist because of existence but because of his essence.\n\nPir Meher Ali Shah and Syed Waheed Ashraf have countered that the two concepts differ in that wahdat-al-wujud states that God and the universe aren't identical. They hold real existence to be for God only and the universe to have no existence on its own.\n\nWaḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd (or \"wah-dat-ul-shuhud\", \"wahdat-ul-shuhud,\" or \"wahdatulshuhud\") has often been translated into English as Apparentism. In Arabic it literally means \"unity of witness\", \"unity of perception\", \"unity of appearance\" or \"oneness of manifestation\".\n\nOut of those who opposed the doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd, there were those who substituted the pole of subject for the object, formulating the doctrine of Waḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd. This school was formulated by ʿAlāʾ ad-DawlahSimnānī, was to attract many followers in India, including Ahmed Sirhindi who provided some of the most widely accepted formulations of this doctrine in the Indian sub-continent.\n\nAccording to Ahmed Sirhindi's doctrine, any experience of unity between God and the created world is purely subjective and occurs only in the mind of the believer; it has no objective counterpart in the real world. The former position, Shaykh Ahmad felt, led to pantheism, which was contrary to the tenets of Sunni Islam. He held that God and creation are not identical; rather, the latter is a shadow or reflection of the Divines Name and Attributes when they are reflected in the mirrors of their opposite non-beings (aʿdām al-mutaqābilah).Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi and Abd-al-karim Jili were also proponents of apparent-ism.\n\nShah Waliullah Dehlawi tried to reconcile the two (apparently) contradictory doctrines of waḥdat al-wujūd (unity of being) of Ibn Arabi and waḥdat ash-shuhūd (unity in conscience) of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi. Shah Waliullah neatly resolved the conflict, calling these differences 'verbal controversies' which have come about because of ambiguous language. If we leave, he says, all the metaphors and similes used for the expression of ideas aside, the apparently opposite views of the two metaphysicians will agree. The positive result of Shah Wali Allah's reconciliatory efforts was twofold: it brought about harmony between the two opposing groups of meta-physicians, and it also legitimized the doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd among the mutakallimun (theologians), who previously had not been ready to accept it.\n\nIn his books Lamahat and Sata'at, he discusses stages of being, the perceptive faculty, the relation of the abstract with the universe, the universal soul and the souls of man, after death, essence, miracles, the scope of man, the soul of the perfect, universal order, source of manifestation, and the transformation of mystics from quality to quality. He also demonstrated that the long-standing assumption that Sufi doctrine was divided between Apparentism and Unity of Being was a difference of expression alone, the latter doctrine being seen as merely a less-advanced stage of projection.\n\nIn his opinion this whole universe has also self (nafs) as an individual person has a self, which is called the Universal Soul (an-nafs al-kullīyyah). The multiplicity of the whole universe has originated from it. When Ibn Arabi says that everything is God, he thereby means the Universal Soul. This Universal Soul, or the Self-unfolding Being (al-wujūd-al-munbasiṭ), subsists by itself. This existence pervades the whole universe, both the substance and the accident, and accepts the form of everything. It is both immanent and transcendental. Beyond this existence (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ : Universal Soul) towards the original existence (God) none has access to. In other words, man's progress ends with the Universal Soul or the Self-unfolding Being. He cannot move a step further. The Universal Soul and God are so intermingled that the former is often taken for the latter.\"\n\nAs for the question of the relation that this existence (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ) has with the essence of God itself. This relation is, however, known only in its reality (anniyyah : I-ness); its quality is unknown and can never be known. Thus when Ibn Arabi says that the realities of the existing things are the names and the attributes of the Universal Soul (Self-unfolding Being) in the stage of knowledge (fīmarṭabat al-ʿilm, in the Divine Consciousness) or when Imam Rabbani asserts that the realities of existing objects are sheer nothingness on which the lights of the names and attributes of the Universal Soul (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ) are reflected is exactly the same thing. The difference in their language is so little that it needs no consideration.\n\nSultan Bahoo first introduced the concept of 'waḥdat al-maqṣūd,' the 'intention of Unity' or the 'necessity of unity.' Sultan Bahoo did not sufficiently elaborate on this idea, focusing his interest and attention towards the concept of 'fanāʾ fi-llāh, baqāʾbillāh' (Annihilation in God, Lasting with God). He was the only Sufi scholar to establish the concept of lasting forever with Allah by ceasing, or annihilating one's self in Allah.\n\n\n"}

The theory asserts that the decline of low-income black residents and their replacement by wealthier whites from outside of Washington, D.C. is intentional through the calculated use of gentrification and urban renewal. The Plan is generally regarded as false within Washington, D.C., while some believe it has quiet but considerable support among black residents and influences local elections.\n\nIt appears that Lillian Wiggins, a columnist for the \"Washington Afro American\" newspaper, was the first to \"articulate\" the conspiracy theory. In 1979, she wrote: \"Many residents believe that the Marion Barry era may be the last time Washington will have a black mayor. If negative programming and characterization of black leadership are allowed to continue in the city of Washington and especially the black community, there is a strong possibility of the 'master plan' which I have so often spoken about maturing in the 1980s.\" Believers note that the Federal City Council, an organized group of civic and corporate leaders, mostly white, meets in secret and uses its power to influence the city's direction.\n\nAnti-theorists note that instead of an organized conspiracy, there are market forces, demographics, and gentrification—which is happening quickly in the District of Columbia—at work. Black residents have left the District, just as many whites moved to the suburbs beginning in the 1950s. Both groups left a decaying city, its crime, and its failing schools seeking \"a better, safer life. . . . One could argue that middle-class blacks abandoned the city. Was that part of 'the plan'?\" Others counter that the existence of the theory reflects \"the fears of a black community that already feels under attack in a city whose rising cost of living makes hanging on difficult . . . . if such paranoia seems laughable, it reflects a reality that's easily illustrated in bright colors\", although the theory has been around longer than the city's changing demographics.\n\nCensus figures show that between 2000 and 2010, the District lost about 39,000 black residents while over 50,000 whites moved in. The black population declined by 11.1%, while the white population saw a 31.4% increase. \"The District, once 'Chocolate City', is becoming, as the saying goes, 'Vanilla Village'.\" Currently, the city is about 51% black and 39% white—compared to 61%–34% in 2000. The black population peaked in 1970 at 71%. If trends continue, the city would get a white majority any time from 2014 to 2020. This has been attributed to The Plan. In 2013, the black population of Washington D.C. dropped below 50% to 49.5%.\n\nEfforts to improve the District of Columbia Public Schools have been linked to the purported conspiracy, as the improvements have tended to increase enrollment of white children. Although shifting demographics are broadening school demand, these are seen as either the effectuation or the result of The Plan. Similarly, rising real estate values, increased business, more abundant night life and other factors which \"would otherwise be viewed as a positive becomes evidence\" of the scheme, even to those who benefit from the improvements. One commentator opined \"Don't ask [Mayor] Fenty or [Schools Chancellor] Rhee whom this world-class school system will serve if low-income black residents are being evicted from his world-class city in droves\" and went on to claim \"The scheme was odious: re-create a more sophisticated version of the plantation-style, federally appointed three-member commission that ruled the city for more than a century until 1967.\"\n\nThe Plan, and related fears, are said to have contributed to the defeat of incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty in the 2010 primary election. One observer noted: \"A vote for [challenger Vincent] Gray, admirers of the D.C. Council chairman imply, stops The Plan dead, putting all those whiny newcomers in their place.\"\n\n"}

Durkheim suggests two central theses, without which sociology would not be a science:\n\n\nThis book was one of the defining books for the new science of sociology. Durkheim's argument that social sciences should be approached with the same rigorous scientific method as used in natural sciences was seen as revolutionary for the time.\n\n\"The Rules\" is seen as an important text in sociology and is a popular book on sociological theory courses. The book's meaning is still being debated by sociologists.\n\nDurkheim's concern is to establish sociology as a science. Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences, he wrote, \"Sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science.\" To give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology. He argued, \"There is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from those studied by the other natural sciences.\"\n\nWith regards to social facts, Durkheim defined them as follows:\nOne of the book's challenges is in showing how individual and seemingly chaotic decisions are in fact a result of a larger, more structured system, the pattern being held together by \"social facts\".\n\nThe definition of social facts illustrates the holistic paradigm in which Durkheim's social facts are defined by two main features: they are external to and coercive to individuals. They not only represent behaviour but also the rules that govern behaviour and give it meaning. Social facts have been not only accepted by, but have been adopted by society as rules to which they choose to follow. Law, language, morality and marriage are all examples of ideals formed through individual thought that have manifested into these concrete institutions which we must now abide by. Social facts can be constraining: if individuals do not do act as they dictate, they may face social penalties. The binding nature of social facts is often implicit, because the rules of society are internalized by individuals in the process of education and socialization.\n\nDurkheim distinguished two types of social facts: normal social facts – which, within a society, occur regularly and most often – and pathological social facts – which are much less common.\n\nAccording to Durkheim, sociologists, without preconceptions and prejudices, must study social facts as real, objective phenomena. Durkheim wrote, \"The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things.\" This implies that sociology must respect and apply a recognized objective, scientific method, bringing it as close as possible to the other exact sciences. This method must at all cost avoid prejudice and subjective judgment.\n\nFurthermore Durkheim talks about social phenomena and how they must be studied. Durkheim wrote: \n\n\n"}

Kneale was also known as a philosopher of science and the author of a book on probability and induction. Educated at the Liverpool Institute High School for boys, he later became a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and in 1960 succeeded to the White's Professor of Moral Philosophy previously occupied by the linguistic philosopher J. L. Austin. He retired in 1966.\n\nKneale's interest in the history of logic began in the 1940s. The focus of much of Kneale's early work was the legacy of the work of the 19th century logician George Boole. His first major publication in the history of logic was his paper \"Boole and the Revival of Logic,\" published in the philosophy journal Mind in 1948. He was also the author of a number of papers in Philosophical logic, particularly on the nature of truth for natural languages, and the role that linguistic concepts play in the treatment of logical paradoxes.\n\nKneale worked on his great history of logic from 1947 to 1957 together with his wife Martha (who was responsible for the chapters on the ancient Greeks). The result was the 800-page \"The Development of Logic\", first published in 1962, which went through five impressions before going into a second, paperback, edition in 1984.\n\nThe 'History' is commonly referred to in the academic world simply as \"Kneale and Kneale\". It was the only major history of logic available in English in the mid-twentieth century, and the first major history of logic in English since \"The Development of Symbolic Logic\" published in 1906 by A.T. Shearman. The treatise has been a standard work in the history of logic for decades.\n\nIn 1938 he married Martha Hurst; they had two children, George (born 1942) and Jane (married name Heal); born 1946).\n\n"}

Stegmüller studied economics and philosophy at the University of Innsbruck. In 1944 he graduated as \"Diplom-Volkswirt\" and one year later he obtained a PhD in economics. Also at the University of Innsbruck he obtained in 1947 a PhD in philosophy. In 1949 he habilitated with the thesis \"Sein, Wahrheit und Wert in der heutigen Philosophie\".\n\nAfter a stay of one year at the University of Oxford in 1954 he returned to the University of Innsbruck where he was appointed as associate professor for philosophy in 1956. After stays as visiting professor at the Universities of Kiel and Bonn he received a call from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Here in 1958 he was appointed professor for philosophy, logic, and philosophy of sciences and became director of the \"Seminar II\". Except for two stays at as a visiting professor in 1962/63 and 1964 at the University of Pennsylvania he remained in Munich and ran there a center for analytical philosophy until his retirement in 1990. From 1977 to 1979 he also was dean of the faculty for philosophy, philosophy of science, and statistics.\n\nStegmüller was from 1966 on a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and from 1967 on a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. 1972 he became a member of the French Institut International de Philosophie, located in Paris. He also was a member of the International Academy of Science, Munich founded in 1980. In 1989 W. Stegmüller was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Innsbruck. After his retirement he was elected as honorary president of the Gesellschaft für Analytische Philosophie (Society for Analytical Philosophy).\n\nStegmüller can be credited with essential contributions to the dissemination of ideas of analytical philosophy and philosophy of science in the German-speaking world. In his inaugural lecture at the University of Innsbruck, he outlined the four problems in epistemology, which he focussed on in his later work:\n\n\nIn his books \"Das Wahrheitsproblem und die Idee der Semantik\" (\"The Problem of Truth and the idea of Semantics\", 1957), and \"Unvollständigkeit und Unentscheidbarkeit\" (\"Incompleteness and Undecidability\", 1959) Stegmüller disseminated the ideas of Alfred Tarski and Rudolf Carnap on semantics and logics as well as those of Kurt Gödel on mathematical logic. Later similar works are on \"Die Antinomien und ihre Behandlung\" (\"Antinomies and Their Treatment\", 1955) as well as \"Strukturtypen der Logik\" (\"Types of Structures of Logic\", 1961).\n\nOne of the most influential books of Stegmüller is \"Metaphysik, Skepsis, Wissenschaft\" (1954). In this work, he discusses the epistemological foundations of metaphysics, scepticism, and science. He demonstrates that any search for epistemological fundamentals will necessarily lead to the problem of the evidence — which Stegmüller does not regard as solvable. He also refuses the potential solution that universal skepticism is self-refuting. Even if it was self-refuting, universal skepticism can be stated if the skeptic does not try to justify it. In consequence, explicit conditions (\"Evidenzvoraussetzungen\") are necessary in metaphysics as well as in science. This means that neither can be fundamentally justified but do presuppose a decision.\n\nA further focus of Stegmüller's work was phenomenalism. In \"Der Phänomenalismus und seine Schwierigkeiten\" (1958), he describes the extreme problems, which hinder a stringent implementation of the phenomentalist program.\n\nStegmüller is regarded as one of the leading philosophers of science of the second half of the 20th century. Deeply influenced by Thomas S. Kuhn and Joseph D. Sneed, he and several co-workers expanded upon the ideas of Sneed in order to overcome the prevalent rationality crisis of the science that was often regarded as a consequence of Kuhn's works. Furthermore, this led him to a new answer to the problems of theoretical concepts. This line of investigations is today known as the \"\"structural theory of the empirical sciences\".\n\n\n"}

His published work often combined two of these disciplines in considering the historical development of a social movement or entity (such as a 'church'), particularly examining the influence of the founders' psychological character. His books concerning the foundation and moral standing of Mormonism and Christian Science made him a focus of controversy. Most of his career was spent as a professor of Philosophy at Vassar College.\n\nRiley was born in New York City. He graduated from Yale University in 1892, and took the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. there in 1898 and 1902 respectively. He cited the noted and decorated Philosopher, Psychologist, and Congregational minister George Trumbull Ladd (Clarke Professor of Metaphysics and Moral Philosophy at Yale University) as his first Philosophy teacher. From 1903, Riley was associate editor of the \"Psychological Bulletin\". He was Johnston research scholar at Johns Hopkins University from 1904–07, during which period he was already \"for some time\" a professor at the University of New Brunswick. In 1908, Riley became professor of philosophy at Vassar, and by 1920 was simultaneously a Lecturer at the Sorbonne.\n\nRiley's Ph.D. thesis at Yale was \"The Founder of Mormonism: A Psychological Study of Joseph Smith\", published in 1902. It was positively reviewed in psychology journals. Riley suspected that Joseph Smith acquired his visions from epileptic seizures. He wrote that the \"psychiatric definition of the epileptic fits the prophet to a dot.\" He associated Smith's dictation of the \"Book of Mormon\" with the phenomenon of automatic writing.\n\nHe is known for his book \"The Faith, the Falsity and the Failure of Christian Science\" (1925), co-authored with physician Charles Edward Humiston and lawyer Frederick William Peabody. The book argues that Christian Science has no scientific legitimacy, it also records many cases of death caused by its practitioners due to lack of medical treatment.\n\nRiley argued that Mary Baker Eddy plagiarized her ideas from Franz Mesmer, Phineas Quimby and the Shakers.\n\nBooks\n\n\nPapers\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n"}

He was detained for 682 days in relation to the Odatv case of the Ergenekon trials (released in December 2012). In August 2013 he was sentenced to 22 years and six months, later to be released on 12/12/13.\n\nKüçük was born in Iskenderun. His father's ancestry is Turkoman while his mother's is Caucasian. He went to the Kabataş High School, followed by Ankara University. He graduated in 1960 with a degree in political science.\n\nHis first job was in the State Planning Board, where he eventually oversaw the Long Term Planning department. In 1966 he found a position at the Middle East Technical University. He was fired after the 1971 coup.\nBefore the coup he wrote calling for a \"Socialist Revolution\" and a socialist administration in Turkey in the leftist publications \"Yön\", \"Emek\", \"Ant\". He is also well known for his bitter criticisms of another strategy called \"National Democratic Revolution\" ().\nIn 1973, he became a reserve officer at the Polatlı Artillery school (military service is compulsory in Turkey). Afterward he ran the economy department of the establishment newspaper, \"Cumhuriyet\". He also ran the economy bulletin of the Anka news agency.\n\nHe soon devoted himself to leftist causes, such as editing the newspaper \"Yürüyüş\" and relaunching of the Workers Party of Turkey (). The party kicked him and some others out in 1978; so, they launched a magazine called \"Socialist Power\" () the next year.\n\nIn 1979 he joined Ankara University but was again dismissed after the next coup, in 1980. He returned to academia at Gazi University, and retired in 1987.\n\nIn his retirement he continued to write for \"Social Deliverance\" () and \"Always Forward\" (). In 1993 he interviewed the leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, Abdullah Öcalan in Syria's Bekaa Valley. Numerous photographs were leaked depicting Öcalan providing Küçük with a tour of the camp, and dining with him.\n\nKüçük's photographs with Abdullah Öcalan were in fact published in his own books and journals edited by Küçük himself in the 1990s during his contact with PKK. He asserted on various TV channels and in interviews that these photographs were neither secret nor a cause for shame. As a social scientist and a socialist he analyzed what he claimed was the most powerful insurgency against the Turkish state. Kurdish political organizations other than the PKK claimed that Küçük \"Kemalized\" Öcalan by persuading him to turn his back on separatism.\n\nHe left for Paris in 1993 as a protest against president Süleyman Demirel and the fact that a brothel owner, Matild Manukyan, was the highest taxpayer, but returned after the 1997 \"post-modern\" coup. However, he was sentenced to two years in prison for spreading separatist propaganda (his interviews with Öcalan). He briefly had a show on Sky Türk called \"Pens and Swords\" () but it got pulled allegedly after complaints from the government and the former chief of general staff, Yaşar Büyükanıt.\n\nHis houses in Karakusunlar, Ankara and Balat, Istanbul were searched in January 2009 in the context of the ongoing Ergenekon investigation. His lawyer, Dursun Ermiş, arrived at Küçük's home in Ankara to field journalists' questions. The search warrant was issued by the Ninth Heavy Penal Court in İstanbul. The police were searching for documents pertaining to the Ergenekon network. He was later detained for 682 days in relation to the Odatv case of the Ergenekon trials (released in December 2012), and remains under indictment.\n\nKüçük is a prolific writer:\n"}
