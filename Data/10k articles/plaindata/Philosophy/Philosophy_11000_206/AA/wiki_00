In 1335, he was already very old (Samuel of Marseilles, in \"Écrivains Juifs,\" p. 562, according to which the note in \"Rev. Ét. Juives,\" ix. 59, must be corrected). Of the many writings of Abba Mari, who, according to his contemporary, Isaac de Lattes, wrote commentaries on the Pentateuch, Job, parts of the Talmud, and Pirḳe de-Rabbi Eliezer, as well as works on physics, logic, and metaphysics, merely fragments are extant, and these in manuscript only. His commentary on Job is found in several European libraries; it is not a commentary in an exegetical or historical sense, but is full of philosophical disquisitions upon the Biblical theodicy.\n\nThe existence of Job is doubted by Abba Mari, as by some of the Talmudic rabbis. He says that, at any rate, the book bearing his name was not written by Job, as some authorities in the Talmud admit, but by Moses. Job's four friends represent in their personalities four different views of evil in the world. Eliphaz, representative of tradition, denies altogether the reality of evil, in agreement with Deut. xxxii. 4. Bildad, on the other hand, does not deny its reality, but holds, as-if he had been the loyal disciple of the old rabbis and Motazilites, that God allows the just to suffer here in order to reward them the more in the future life. Zophar, too, considers evil a reality; with the Ascharites, with whom many rabbis agree, he insists on man's ignorance of the divine will, which finite man ought not to investigate. Elihu is of the same opinion as Eliphaz, but with the difference that what Eliphaz accepts as a matter of faith, Elihu demonstrates philosophically. It can thus be seen that Abba Mari was a loyal student of Maimonides, and that, like him, he considered revelation and true philosophy as identical. Whether a philosophical and allegorical commentary on the Song of Songs, in manuscript in the Cambridge and Oxford libraries and ascribed to him, is really his, or should be credited to Moses of Narbonne, with whom Abba Mari is elsewhere confounded, is uncertain. The same doubt holds concerning the Hebrew translation of Gazzali's \"Tendencies of Philosophers,\" which is ascribed to Abba Mari, but possibly also belongs to the aforesaid Moses. But there is no reason for Steinschneider's doubt concerning a Munich manuscript, containing the introduction to the first book of Euclid, with the superscription, \"Written by Abba Mari, philosopher and teacher of truth.\"; it certainly belongs to our Abba Mari, and the words Abba Mari are not to be translated \"My Lord and Father,\" for these two words would otherwise have their proper place at the beginning and not at the end of the sentence. Abba Mari also wrote \"Refutations,\" in which he assailed Joseph Caspi's \"Book of Secrets.\" This book, with the exception of a few quotations from it in other writers, has disappeared.\n"}

Its original name was \"Die Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie\", which in English may be translated as \"the society for empirical philosophy\". Together with the Vienna Circle, they published the journal \"Erkenntnis\" (\"Knowledge\") edited by Rudolf Carnap and Reichenbach, and organized several congresses and colloquia concerning the philosophy of science, the first of which was held in Prague in 1929.\n\nThe Berlin Circle had much in common with the Vienna Circle, but the philosophies of the circles differed on a few subjects, such as probability and conventionalism. Reichenbach insisted on calling his philosophy logical empiricism, to distinguish it from the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Few people today make the distinction, and the words are often used interchangeably.\n\nMembers of the Berlin Circle were particularly active in analyzing the philosophical and logical consequences of the advances in contemporary physics, especially the theory of relativity. Apart from that, they denied the soundness of metaphysics and traditional philosophy and asserted that many philosophical problems are indeed meaningless.\n\nAfter the rise of Nazism, several of the group's members emigrated to other countries, including Reichenbach, who moved to Turkey in 1933 and later to the United States in 1938; Dubislav emigrated in 1936; Hempel moved to Belgium in 1934 and later to the United States in 1939; and Grelling was killed in a concentration camp. A younger member of the Berlin Circle or Berlin School to leave Germany was Olaf Helmer who joined the RAND Corporation and played an important role in the development of the Delphi method used for predicting future trends, and other early forms of social technology.\n\nAfter emigrating to various countries the group effectively came to an end, but not without influencing a wide range of philosophers of the 20th century, its method having been especially influential on analytic philosophy and futurology.\n"}

{"id": "2305875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305875", "title": "Charles Gore", "text": "Charles Gore\n\nCharles Gore (1853–1932) was the Bishop of Oxford. He was one of the most influential Anglican theologians of the 19th century, helping reconcile the church to some aspects of biblical criticism and scientific discovery, while remaining Catholic in his interpretation of the faith and sacraments. Also known for his social action, Gore became an Anglican bishop and founded the priestly Community of the Resurrection as well as co-founded the Christian Social Union. He was the chaplain to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII.\n\nCharles Gore was born on 22 January 1853 into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family as the third son of Hon. Charles Alexander Gore (1811-1897), son of Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, and Lady Augusta Lavinia Priscilla, a daughter of John William Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough. His brother Spencer was the first winner of the Wimbledon Championships.\n\nGore was raised in a low-church Anglican family and was confirmed by the church at the age of eight years. He was attracted to the high-church sacramental tradition and ritualism of Anglo-Catholicism at a young age, later writing \"I have since my childhood been what I may call a Catholic by mental constitution\". Around the age of nine years, he read Grace Kennedy's anti-Catholic novel \"Father Clement\". The book served as his introduction to the high-church tradition and, instead of having his Protestantism reinforced as the author had intended, he found himself entranced by the Catholic tradition. He would later write of it:\nIn his evidence given before the Ecclesiastical Discipline Commission in 1905 he said:\nIn his adolescence, he began attending churches \"that offered a richer sacramental ceremonial.\"\n\nGore's parents sent him to Harrow School, London, in 1866, where he excelled academically. He then went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1871, where he supported the trade-union movement. He graduated from Oxford in 1875 with a first-class degree in \"literae humaniores\".\n\nIn 1875, Gore was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and he lectured there from 1876 to 1880. Gore was ordained to the Anglican diaconate in December 1876 and to the priesthood in December 1878. From 1880 to 1883, he served as vice-principal of Cuddesdon Theological College. He received Honorary Doctor of Divinity from various universities, including University of Athens, University of Birmingham, University of Oxford, Durham University, and University of Edinburgh. \n\nWhen, in 1884, Pusey House was founded at Oxford as a home for Pusey's library and a centre for the propagation of his principles, Gore was appointed as principal, a position he held until 1893. As Principal of Pusey House, he exercised wide influence over undergraduates and the younger clergy and it was largely under this influence that the Oxford Movement underwent a change which to surviving Tractarians seemed to involve a break with its basic principles. Puseyism had been in the highest degree conservative, basing itself on authority and tradition and repudiating compromise with the modern critical and liberalising spirit. Gore, starting from the same basis of faith and authority, found from experience in dealing with the doubts and difficulties of the younger generation that this uncompromising attitude was untenable and set himself the task of reconciling the principle of authority in religion with that of scientific authority, by attempting to define the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence. To him the divine authority of the Catholic Church was an axiom.\n\nIn 1889, he published two works, the larger of which, \"The Church and the Ministry\", is a learned vindication of the principle of apostolic succession in the episcopate against the Presbyterians and other Reformed church bodies, while the second, \"Roman Catholic Claims\", is a defence, in more popular form, of Anglicanism and Anglican ordinations and sacraments against the criticisms of Roman Catholic authorities.\n\nSo far Gore's published views had been in consonance with those of the older Tractarians, but in 1890 a stir was created by the publication, under his editorship, of \"Lux Mundi\", a series of essays by different writers attempting to bring the Christian creed into a harmonious relation to the modern growth of knowledge, scientific, historic, critical, and to modern problems of politics and ethics. Gore himself contributed an essay on \"The Holy Spirit and Inspiration\" and, from the tenth edition, one of Gore's sermons, \"On the Christian Doctrine of Sin\", was included as an appendix. The book, which ran through twelve editions in little over a year, met with a mixed reception. Traditional clerics, both Evangelicals and Tractarians, were alarmed by views on the incarnate nature of Christ which seemed to them to impugn his divinity and, by concessions to the higher criticism in the matter of the inspiration of scripture, appeared to them to convert the \"impregnable rock\" (as Gladstone had called it) into a foundation of sand. Sceptics, however, were not impressed by a system of defence which seemed to draw an artificial line beyond which criticism was not to advance. The book nonetheless produced a profound effect far beyond the borders of the Anglican churches and it is largely due to its influence, and to that of the school it represents, that the Anglican high church movement developed on Modernist rather than Tractarian lines from then on.\n\nIn 1891 Gore was chosen to deliver the Bampton Lectures, and he took for his subject the \"Incarnation of Christ\". In these published lectures, Gore developed the theology of \"Lux Mundi\", attempting to explain how Christ, though incarnate God, could err (for example, in his citations from the Old Testament). The orthodox explanation had been based on the religious principle of accommodation. This, however, had not solved the difficulty that if Christ on earth was not subject to human limitations, especially of knowledge, he was not as other men, not subject to their trials and temptations. Gore addressed this through revisiting the Kenotic Theory of the Incarnation. Theologians had attempted to explain what Paul the Apostle meant when he wrote of Christ (Philippians 2:7) that he emptied himself (\"kenosis\") and took upon him the form of a servant. According to Gore this means that Christ on his incarnation, although sinless, became subject to all human limitations and stripped himself of all attributes of Godhead, including omniscience, the divine nature being hidden under the human.\n\nThe Bampton Lectures led to a tense situation, which Gore relieved in 1893 by resigning his principalship of Pusey House and accepting the position of vicar of Radley parish near Oxford.\n\nIn 1894 Gore became a canon of Westminster Abbey. Here he gained commanding influence as a preacher and in 1898 was appointed one of the court chaplains. In July 1901 he was appointed a Chaplain-in-Ordinary to King Edward VII, though he resigned as such on elevation as bishop in January 1902.\n\nIn 1892, while Principal of Pusey House, Gore founded a clerical fraternity, known as the Society of the Resurrection. The society became a religious community and he became its first superior, only resigning when appointed as Bishop of Worcester in 1902. Its members were Anglican priests bound by the obligation of celibacy, living under a common Benedictine rule and with a common purse. Their work was pastoral, evangelistic, literary and educational. The community followed Gore to Radley in 1893, most of them remaining there when he moved to London in 1894. In 1898 the House of the Resurrection in Mirfield, near Huddersfield, became the centre of the community.\n\nAlthough the community followed a liturgical day familiar to Roman Catholic monks, Gore and the other founders wanted it to engage in social action. Five of the six founding members belonged to the Christian Social Union, hence the decision to settle in the industrial north, between Wakefield and Huddersfield.\n\nIn 1903 a college for training candidates for the Anglican priesthood, the College of the Resurrection, was established in Mirfield and, in the same year, a branch house for missionary work was set up in Johannesburg in South Africa.\n\nIn November 1901 Gore was nominated to succeed J. J. S. Perowne as Bishop of Worcester. The appointment caused some controversy, due to his teachings and relationship to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury (he was a cousin of Lord Salisbury's daughter-in-law). The Church Association and the Liverpool Laymen's League were among societies lodging formal protests before his confirmation. After subsequent legal hearings, Gore was consecrated as Bishop at Lambeth Palace on 23 February 1902, and enthroned at Worcester Cathedral two days later on 25 February.\nHe received the degree Doctor of Divinity from the University of Oxford in December 1901, and was elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in May 1902.\n\nIn 1905 Gore was installed as the first Bishop of Birmingham, a new see, which he had helped to create by dividing his see of Worcester. The second parish church of Birmingham, St Philip, became the cathedral. While adhering to his views on the divine institution of episcopacy as essential to the Christian Church, Gore from the first cultivated friendly relations with the ministers of other Christian denominations and advocated co-operation with them in all matters when agreement was possible.\n\nIn social questions Gore became a leader of the group of high Anglicans known loosely as Christian socialists. In 1889 at Pusey House Gore had helped found the Christian Social Union. He worked actively against the sweating system, pleaded for European intervention in Macedonia, and was a keen supporter of the Licensing Bill.\n\nIn 1911 he succeeded Francis Paget as Bishop of Oxford and Chancellor of the Order of the Garter.\n\nOn 28 September 1917 Gore licensed 21 women as lay readers called the \"Diocesan Band of Women Messengers\". These were possibly the first female lay readers in the Church of England. The last one, Bessie Bangay, died in 1987 aged 98.\n\nGore resigned in 1919 and retired to London, where he lived at 6 Margaret Street as a tenant of the parochial authorities of All Saints, Margaret Street. There he remained for several years, celebrating regularly in the church and in the sisters' chapel close by, and taking his usual keen interest in the affairs of the church and parish. At the same time Gore attached himself to Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, and was licensed to the Rector of St George's, Hanover Square, in whose parish that chapel stands, thus becoming for the first time in his life a licensed curate.\n\nGore was a bundle of contradictions, an Anglo-Catholic in the Church of England whose questioning of the Old Testament produced in the 1890s a crisis for many believers. In the judgment of his biographer, Gore was a loner who thought he had a vocation to community life. He chose to be buried at Mirfield, in the church of the Community of the Resurrection, though he had never managed to be more than a visitor there.\n\nIn 1929-1930, he delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures on the topic \"The Philosophy of the Good Life\" at the University of St Andrews.\n\nGore died on 17 January 1932 in Kensington, London. He left instructions for his body to be cremated, a practice seen by some at the time as unacceptable for a Christian. Nearly three decades earlier, in a letter read at the 1903 opening ceremony of the Birmingham Crematorium, Gore had written:\n\nGore's wishes provoked the Anglo-Catholic leader and politician Lord Halifax to exclaim, belatedly, \"I could shake the life out of him with my own hands.\" The ashes were taken to Mirfield in Yorkshire for burial. His cope and mitre remain at the Grosvenor Chapel.\n\n\n\"Belief in God\", \"Belief in Christ\" and \"The Holy Spirit and the Church\" were reissued in a single volume as \"The Reconstruction of Belief\" in 1926.\n\n"}

It does not offer a grand unifying theory but \"refers to a family of theoretical perspectives that address the dynamic relationships between consumer actions, the marketplace, and cultural meanings\". Reflective of a post-modernist society, it views cultural meanings as being numerous and fragmented and hence views culture as an amalgamation of different groups and shared meanings, rather than a homogeneous construct (such as the American culture). Consumer culture is viewed as \"social arrangement in which the relations between lived culture and social resources, between meaningful ways of life and the symbolic and material resources on which they depend, are mediated through markets\" and consumers as part of an interconnected system of commercially produced products and images which they use to construct their identity and orient their relationships with others.\n\nThere is a widely held misperception by people outside CCT researchers that this field is oriented toward the study of consumption contexts. Memorable study contexts, such as the Harley-Davidson subculture or the Burning Man festival probably fueled this perspective, which is far from the theory development aim of this school of thought.\n\nWhile CCT is often associated with qualitative methodologies, such as interviews, case studies, ethnographic, as well as 'netnographic' methods which are well adapted to study the experiential, sociological and cultural aspects of consumption, these are not a prerequisite to CCT contribution (Arnould & Thompson 2005).\n\nArnould & Thompson identifies four research programs in CCT: \n"}

It was first discovered amongst 52 other Gnostic Christian texts spread over 13 codices by an Arab peasant, Mohammad Ali al-Samman, in the Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi late in December 1945. Another copy has more recently been found in the Codex Tchacos, where it is merely titled 'James'. Those texts were in the Coptic language. In 2017, the first Greek copy was found (the work was originally written in Greek) amongst unpublished Oxyrhynchus Papyri housed at Oxford University.\n\nThe Nag Hammadi Coptic manuscript is remarkably well preserved for its age; it was reported that the cache of texts called the \"Nag Hammadi library\", when originally found, were sealed within a large terra cotta vessel. They were secreted during the fourth century, in an effort to hide the texts from destruction by others.\n\nThe form of the text is primarily that of a Revelation Dialogue/Discourse between James the brother of Jesus (James the Just) and Jesus, with a rather fragmentary account of the departure (possibly meaning martyrdom) of James appended to the bottom of the manuscript, connected to the remainder by an oblique reference to crucifixion. The first portion of the text describes James' understandable concern about being crucified, whereas the latter portion describes secret \"passwords\" given to James so that he can ascend to the highest heaven (out of 72) after dying, without being blocked by evil \"powers\" of the demiurge. In the text, Jesus tells James, \"you are not my brother materially.\"\n\nSome of the framing background details about James given in the text are thought by academics to reflect early traditions; according to the text:\n\nThe first-known Greek copy of the text was discovered in 2017 at Oxford University by Geoffrey Smith and Brent Landau, religious studies scholars at the University of Texas at Austin. The fragments date from the fifth or sixth century and were probably a teacher’s model used to help students learn to read and write. The fragments will be published in the Oxyrhynchus compilation \"The Greco-Roman Memoirs\".\n\nOne of the most curious features of the First Apocalypse of James is that the range of dating of its original text, assigned to it by scholars, requires that it was written after the \"Second Apocalypse of James\".\n\n"}

He presents it as an alternative to the current global economic order. Under the scheme, nations would pay a dividend (tax) on any resources that they use or sell, resulting in a sort of \"tax on consumption\" Pogge's scheme is motivated by the positive duty to alleviate poverty, but also on the negative responsibility of the rich not to use institutions that perpetuate economic inequality. Pogge estimates that a dividend of just 1% could raise $300 billion each year; this would equal $250 for each individual in the worlds poorest quintile.\n\nImplementing some version of the GRD entails not only discussions about practicality, but presumably, an affirmation of what is right. As Pogge puts it \"Our task as philosophers requires that we try to imagine new, better political structures and different, better moral sentiments. We must be realistic, but not to the point of presenting to the parties in the original position the essentials of the status quo as unalterable facts.\"\n\nPogge's main justification is that, even if the idea of GRD would be refined over time, and would be difficult to implement, it is nevertheless the right of those who are the worst off. The 1% dividend tax is not seen as a donation, but a responsibility.\n\nPogge believes that the idea of the GRD may be a natural extension of John Rawls' theory of justice, although Rawls himself has express disagreement with this. To Pogge, the world order currently violates the first principle of justice (equal opportunity), as well as the second principle (equal access to offices, but also the idea that inequalities should favour the poorest individuals).\n\nRawls thought that certain individuals may be permitted to various non-liberal views, provided they harmonize with a liberal government. Similarly, Pogge says that we may permit certain nations to operate according to hierarchical, non-liberal systems; but on a global scale, only systems that harmonize with a grander liberal philosophy can be tolerated. Liberals cannot avoid taking sides completely; they must reject totalitarianism, for instance. This has implications for the validity of actions that might be taken to promote a GRD.\n\nUnder the scheme of a GRD, states do not have full property rights in the resources within their sovereign territory. Although the GRD allows states to use resources as they see fit, the scheme implies that the global poor have an 'inalienable stake in all scarce resources' (see implementation, below). Pogge argues that national borders are morally arbitrary in the first place, and are born from a history of coercion and violence. He sets these issues aside, however, and focuses on the following claim: any conception of global justice (even if we accept existing national borders as they are) must acknowledge international inequalities. Pogge thinks it becomes difficult to justify why a person born to rich parents in Canada should be entitled to so much more than one who is born to poor family in Sierra Leone. Equally difficult to justify might be the assumption that every person has a right to absolute control over the resources they happen to have within their borders.\n\nEach nation or \"peoples\" would be given full freedom of what to do with their own resources. They would not be required to extract them, or allow others to extract them. If people decide to use a natural resource, they would pay a dividend. This includes oil, but also the various uses of reusable resources (e.g. polluting water). The dividend results in higher costs for natural resources, and thus amounts to a \"tax on consumption\".\n\nThe funds garnered from the GRD would be spent by an international organization; a world government is not \"necessary\". The organization would follow rules established by lawyers, economists, and other professionals from around the world. GRD payments would be used to provide basic rights to developing nations. Governments who collect the funds and invest them in luxuries for their elite would be completely or partially forbidden from receiving them. In such cases, funding NGOs may still be an important way of using the GRD to help the poor.\nThe lowest level of the dividend (1%) is still likely to have a big impact on international development goals (e.g. the Millennium Development Goals). Supporters of the Global Resources Dividend argue that it would also have an environmental benefit by reducing demand for non-renewable energy sources.\n\nPogge imagines that there may be dissent between and within nations. Again, he does not think a world government is necessary. Those countries that fail to pay their required GRD could be taxed by all the other countries doing trade with it. If a majority of countries are paying their GRD, these taxes would help deter dissenters. The idea is that there would be added pressure on each country to enforce the gathering of GRD funds within its borders.\n\nPrimary products or 'raw materials' are often refined into more expensive secondary products. As such it can be argued that the GRD is applied too early in the manufacturing process and does not take account of the environmental costs of manufacturing products beyond the extraction of raw materials. As the GRD evolves over time, this could be one of many improvements.\n\nRichard Reichel states that it is unlikely that a Global resources dividend will work. He argues that increased financial flows could hurt an under developed economy and that an internal distribution with GRD is not resolved.\n\nTim Hayward argues multiple reasons against the Global resources dividend. For one he uses Joseph Heath's argument that the distributive effects could harm the poor nations that are not resource rich. Hayward states that because Pogge does not include the cultivation of basic commodities because poor people would be under economic pressure to produce cash crops instead of food crops.\n\n"}

During his high school days, he organized a local section of the Young Communist League of Yugoslavia at his school, and was a member of the League until the Hitler-Stalin Pact. On one occasion, he secretly smuggled a briefcase to a man in Vienna he later found to be Josip Broz Tito. After finishing grammar school in Zagreb in 1934, he continued pursuing his education in Vienna for a brief period, then moved to Zuerich studying mathematics, physics, biology and philosophy. Increasingly interested in quantum physics and its philosophical consequences, he moved to Leipzig where in 1940 he obtained his PhD in physics under Werner Heisenberg. He worked on problems of superconductivity, but ultimately his doctoral dissertation was on electrical conductivity in metals in low temperatures. In March 1941 he was arrested by the Gestapo for being involved in antifascist activity and held in prison for many months. His professors, Heisenberg, Hund and von Weizsäcker intervened to release him from prison. Immediately after being released, instead of returning to Leipzig, he went back to Independent State of Croatia and joined the communist antifascist movement. He would not return to physics research again, focusing on his philosophical and literary work.\n\nSupek was a proponent of total and unconditional nuclear disarmament, having already in 1944, fourteen months before the bombing of Hiroshima warned on the danger of misuse of atomic energy.\n\nIn 1946 he became a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Zagreb. His main contribution to physics was the discovery of the differential equation for electrical conductivity at low temperatures. In 1950 he advocated the construction of the Ruđer Bošković institute in Zagreb and became one of its founders. He was excluded from it in 1958 due to his disagreement with the Yugoslav Federal Commission for Nuclear Energy and his unwillingness to participate in a project for building the atomic bomb (an idea Josip Broz Tito himself did not like much, and which was subsequently abandoned). After that, he stopped active research in theoretical physics and continued researching philosophy and literature.\n\nIn 1960 he was accepted into the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (since 1991 the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) of which he was president from 1991 to 1997, and in 1968 he became the rector of the University of Zagreb, serving two terms until 1972, during the turbulent times of the Croatian Spring. In 1960 he founded the Institute for the Philosophy of Science and Peace, as a section of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. The Institute was also a center of the nuclear disarmament movement, the Pugwash Conference for Yugoslavia, of which he was one of the founders and a member of its Permanent Committee. In 1970 he initiated the establishing of the Interuniversity Centre in Dubrovnik (IUC). He was also one of the founders of the international organization World without the Bomb. After numerous disputes and arguments with the government he was interrupted in his public activity in 1971. Among other incidents, he was put on a \"black list\" because of his involvement in the Croatian Spring movement.\n\nIn 1976 he signed the Dubrovnik-Philadelphia Statement, with Philip Noel-Baker, Ava Helen Pauling, Linus Pauling, Aurelio Peccei and Sophia Wadai. He participated at the Philadelphia Congress of World Unity in 1976. He formulated his famous ten humanistic principles, which were more or less repeated at every later peace summit and event. He also established the International League of Humanists.\n\nSupek visited and lectured at numerous foreign universities. He retired in 1985, but ever since continued his humanist work. He founded a citizen association, \"Alijansa za treću Hrvatsku\" (Alliance for the third Croatia). He was a critic of globalisation and a proponent of the global justice movement. In 2002 he was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSupek died on 5 March 2007, in his home in Zagreb, after a long illness.\n\nIn 2007, shortly after his death, the \"X. gimnazija\" (10th Gymnasium) grammar school in Croatia's capital Zagreb was renamed in his honor to \"X. Gimnazija \"Ivan Supek\"\". He is among 24 famous Croats to be inducted in the Croatian Walk Of Fame.\n\nIn one of his last interviews in March 2006 Supek spoke about the famous and controversial meeting between Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr in Copenhagen in September 1941. According to Supek, he was informed in confidence by Bohr's wife Margrethe about the meeting. In his interview, Supek claimed that the main figure of the meeting was neither Heisenberg nor Bohr but Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. \"Heisenberg and von Weizsäcker came to Bohr in German army uniforms. Von Weizsäcker's idea, probably originating from his father who was Ribbentrop's deputy, was to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Great Britain and Germany.\"\n\nAlthough Margrethe allegedly thought Supek will never bring these details into public, Supek felt it was \"his duty to announce these facts so that future generations can know the truth about the Heisenberg – Bohr meeting\".\n\nSupek had many disputes with the first president of independent Croatia, Franjo Tuđman. In a 1997 \"open letter\" which he also read on the national television and published in all the major dailies, president Tuđman accused Supek, then President of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, of supporting forces that allegedly plotted his assassination after Supek made public statements critical of presidential policies: he called for Tuđman to submit to public scrutiny his financial assets before and after the war. Supek had been a critic of Tuđman's political \"faux pas\" since Tuđman took office in 1990. Following the publication of the letter, Supek and his family suffered numerous death threats.\n\nBeside his scientific and humanist work, Supek wrote numerous novels and plays, with themes spanning from philosophy, science fiction to politics. His novel \"\" (translated to \"The Process of the Century\") is about the process against the physicist Robert Oppenheimer. A list of his works can be found on the Academy homepage. In 1966 he started a journal, \"Encyclopedia moderna\".\n\nIn his numerous works, Supek developed a worldview in which the values of the freedom, responsibility, and democracy are integrated with his philosophical-scientific reflections.\n\n\n"}

His work revolves mainly around three topics: animal ethics, reproductive ethics and embryo research, and genetics.\n\nDeckers has published numerous articles in animal ethics, mainly on the ethical issues associated with the human consumption of animal products. This topic has been approached from various angles, including its connections with the causation of harm to animals, environmental degradation, climate change, and the emergence and spread of zoonoses. Early work also considered the relevance of the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead for animal ethics, where Deckers's work has been reviewed critically by other Whiteheadian scholars. More recent work has also considered the ethics of in-vitro flesh and the idea of creating animals with decreased pain sensitivity, where Deckers chaired a conference on these themes, funded by the Wellcome Trust.\n\nAs a speciesist, Deckers argues that human health is paramount to address whether and when animal products ought to be consumed. The book Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned? defends 'qualified moral veganism', which is associated with a political goal: the vegan project.\n\nThe book is critical of positions adopted by other scholars, including Alasdair Cochrane, Gary Francione, Martha Nussbaum, and Peter Singer, and has more in common with the positions of scholars such as Alice Crary, Melanie Joy, and Marti Kheel. \n\nMany charges have been pressed against vegan diets, for example that they alienate human beings from nature (Michael Pollan) or that they increase human food security and other sustainability concerns relative to other diets (Simon Fairlie). Deckers addresses these challenges. The book’s appendix also considers whether vegan diets might be nutritionally adequate or even superior compared to other diets.\n\nThe book has been described as ‘an innovative defense of veganism’ because of its concern with maximising positive global health impacts, and its primary focus on safeguarding the health of moral agents.\n\nDeckers has analysed debate in Westminster Parliament around the use of embryos for stem cell research and cloning as well as the law on abortion in Great Britain, and argued for legal reform.\nIn the debate on abortion, Deckers has engaged with Judith Jarvis Thomson's thought experiment of the violinist. In an article with the title 'The right to life and abortion legislation in England and Wales: A proposal for change’, Deckers argues for a radical overhaul of the law on abortion in England and Wales. His work in this area has been the subject of significant academic critique.\n\nIn his article ‘Are scientists right and non-scientists wrong? Reflections on discussions of GM’ Deckers analyses the views of scientists and non-scientists on genetic engineering. In a comprehensive overview of the literature between 1975 and 2008, the article was identified as a key paper in the debate on the ethics of GM crops.\nMore recent work reflects on the meaning and the moral significance or otherwise of the (un)natural, where Deckers argues, inspired by Alfred North Whitehead’s teleological understanding of natural entities, that the concept of the unnatural carries both meaning and moral significance in discussions of genetic engineering. At the same time, his (ontological) understanding of the world is critical of Whitehead's thought by rejecting the view that the universe as a whole is a teleological entity.\nDeckers also developed a contextualised case in human genetics as a teaching resource for the Higher Education Academy.\n\nIn a book chapter on 'Fairness in Newcastle: Theory and Practice’, Deckers engages with a report of the Newcastle Fairness Commission, published in 2012, which set out to define some principles of fairness to improve decision-making and guide the work of Newcastle City Council and other organisations in the city. Deckers has also written on the ethics of marriage.\n\nDeckers received the Honourable Mention 2004 Mark S. Ehrenreich Prize for Healthcare Ethics Research of the International Association of Bioethics and the Pacific Center for Health Policy and Ethics at the University of Southern California for the paper 'UK Legislation on Embryo Research, Justified or Not?', presented at the 7th World Congress of Bioethics, Sydney, November 2004. He is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry. He is also an expert for 'Bioethics Beyond Borders', The Division of Ethics of Science and Technology, Sector for Social and Human Sciences, UNESCO. In 2014 Deckers was awarded a 'Society and Ethics' grant from the Wellcome Trust to convene a conference on 'An ethical discussion of in-vitro meat and the production of flesh from animals with enhanced properties.'\n\nDeckers has presented at numerous academic conferences, including keynote presentations at the 'Choose a Life, Choose Your Life, Choose Life? Bioethical Issues at the Beginning, Middle, and End of Life' conference at St Anne’s College, Oxford (2006), and the ‘Living Ethics: From Stem Cells to Life Extension’ conference at McGill University, Montréal (2005). He has also been a visiting scholar at the Centre for Values, Ethics and the Law in Medicine, University of Sydney (2012), where he presented at the ‘Public health, ethics and non-communicable diseases’ and the ‘Living with(out) animals: nonhuman ethics for the 21st century’ conferences.\n\nHe has also contributed to the popular literature and media.\n\n"}

His major works include \"Genesis and Structure of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit\" and \"Studies on Marx and Hegel\".\n\nHyppolite was born in Jonzac. He was a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) at roughly the same time as Jean-Paul Sartre. After graduation he embarked on a serious study of Hegel, teaching himself German in order to read \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" in the original. In 1939 he came out with his own translation and his commentary would later form the basis of the book \"Genesis and Structure of the Phenomenology of Spirit\" (published in 1947). After the Second World War, Hyppolite became a professor at the University of Strasbourg, before moving to the Sorbonne in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, Hyppolite published \"Logique et existence\", a work that may have had a seminal effect on what was to become known as post-structuralism. This book tries to correlate Hegel's \"Phenomenology\" to his \"Logics\" (longer and shorter). In doing so, it raises the questions of language, being, and difference that were to become the hallmarks of new French philosophy at the end of the 20th century. The book was reviewed by the philosopher Gilles Deleuze. The translators of the English language edition of the text (SUNY Press, 1997) included Deleuze's review at the end of the volume.\n\nIn 1954, he became the director of the ENS and in 1955 produced a study of Karl Marx's earlier, more Hegelian period, at a time when the French interest in Hegel was at its apogee. In 1963 he was elected to the Collège de France and given a chair in \"The History of Philosophical Thought\".\n\nWhile philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre were known for producing new works influenced by German philosophy, Hyppolite is remembered as an expositor, teacher, and translator. He influenced a number of thinkers, including Deleuze, who studied Hegel under him at the Lycée Henri-IV, and Michel Foucault, as well as Jacques Derrida, Gérard Granel and Étienne Balibar (at the ENS).\n\nHyppolite died in Paris.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4555481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4555481", "title": "John Dumbleton", "text": "John Dumbleton\n\nJohn of Dumbleton (Latin \"Ioannes De Dumbleton\"; c. 1310 – c. 1349) was a member of the Dumbleton village community in Gloucestershire, a southwestern county in England. Although obscure, he is considered a significant English fourteenth-century philosopher for his contributions to logic, natural philosophy, and physics. Dumbleton’s masterwork is his \"Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis\" (Summary of Logic and Natural Philosophy), likely to have been composed just before the time of his death.\n\nJohn of Dumbleton is recorded to have become a fellow at Merton College, Oxford (\"ca.\" 1338–9) and to have studied with the likes of William Heytesbury, Thomas Bradwardine, and Richard Swineshead. These four medieval scholastics held a common bond in that their study interests were in a similar field, but the method of study which brought these fellows into the same sphere of learning was of a more esoteric bent than modern university methods. They were interested in mathematics and logical analysis for the purposes of natural philosophy, theology, and an \"a priori\" type of mathematical physics (not to be confused with modern, empirical, experimental physics). Thus, the physics postulations and conjectures made by Dumbleton and his Oxford contemporaries were primarily done without any application of physical experimentation. Dumbleton, along with the other three Merton philosophers, received the moniker 'Calculators' for their adherence to mathematics and logical disputation when solving philosophical and theological problems. After being named a fellow at The Queen's College, Oxford (1340) and making a return to Merton College (1344–45) Dumbleton is recorded to have studied theology in Paris (ca. 1345–47) for a brief period before returning to finish his studies at Merton College (1347–1348). The fact that no extant copy of Dumbleton's \"Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis\" is complete (nor edited) leads one to wonder if his death (\"ca.\" 1349) abruptly terminated the possibility of its completion.\n\nThough there was a considerable reverence for Platonism in Oxford during the fourteenth century, the rebirth of Aristotelianism held sway in the higher Parisian learning circuits. Dumbleton, who studied in Paris for a brief time, was not immune to this spell. In fact, his compendium \"Summa Logica et Philosophiae Naturalis\", has an overview of many principles found in Aristotle's \"Physics\". The \"Summa\" is broken into ten different sections. The ninth section is uncompleted in all extant manuscripts. The tenth section, which, according to Dumbleton, was supposed to examine \"universals and signification,\" shows no evidence of ever being worked on. Although this is the case, the other sections of Dumbleton's \"Summa\" are filled with medieval philosophical gems. A couple emphasized topics to be found in the first section are \"certitude and the psychology of logic.\" It includes a medieval examination of epistemological issues; such as the certainty of knowledge. A strong Aristotelian appreciation is felt in the remaining sections, since the majority of the work is dedicated to commenting on the first eight chapters of Aristotle's \"Physics\", and his treatises \"On Generation and Corruption\" & \"On the Soul\". In those sections of the \"Summa\" will be found discussions and commentary on such topics as: alteration, change (i.e., the measure of motion), properties of natural bodies and their forms (parts II and III); questions dealing with classification (e.g., \"whether light belongs to some element\"; motions and changes of bodies/forms (parts IV – VI); and in the final sections an examination of the intellect and matters of the soul (parts VII – IX). It is difficult to assess why Dumbleton's \"Summa\" did not have a significant following, but it may have been because it was never completed or that it was not circulated well enough.\n\nThe four Merton ‘Calculators’ were not only well versed in the current issues of philosophy during the fourteenth century; they actually initiated new groundbreaking scientific postulations. John of Dumbleton was no exception. Because he concurred with many of the positions held by William Ockham (1288–1348)—especially the idea that is commonly referred to as Ockham’s razor, which states that the most simplistic explanations are ideal—he may have learned how to succinctly formulate his scientific conjectures.\n\nOf Dumbleton’s many scientific theories there is one in particular that is worth mentioning here. By making the assumption that bodies are finite, Dumbleton was able to conjecture that contraction or expansion, as in cases of condensation or rarefaction, does not eliminate any parts of a body; rather, a “denumerable number of parts” always exists. Though the idea of molecules was not theorized at this time, Dumbleton’s speculation helped to tame the view that bodies have infinitely divisible parts.\n\nDumbleton was one of the first to express functional relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the mean speed theorem stating that \"the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint\" and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination, stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the Inverse-square law, which was postponed nearly 250 years until its discovery by Johannes Kepler in 1604.\n\nIt is difficult to determine what methodology the Oxford 'Calculators' used when they were conjecturing and postulating theorems by way of abstraction (i.e., without empirical investigation). This criticism is not expressly made toward Dumbleton's conjectures but more broadly aimed at the methodology of the whole group of Mertonian physicists. One suggestion is that they may have been trying to create a mathematical picture of the Aristotelian world-view. If this were true, it would show why empirical investigation was not their \"modus operandi\". In other words, the Oxford Calculators' works show respect for quantitative reasoning; opposed to \"a posteriori\" evaluations. Regardless of whether they opted against empirical investigation for theological reasons or simply because the debut of the scientific method was not ready to be revealed, one ought to regard John of Dumbleton and his contemporaries as exemplary pioneers in mathematics, physics, and logical discourse.\n\n\n\n"}

Hazard\n\nJohn Newbold Hazard (1909–1995) was a leading American scholar of Soviet law and public administration. Hazard was one of the pioneers in the field of Sovietology, particularly in Soviet law, administration and politics.\n\nJohn Newbold Hazard was born in Syracuse, N.Y., Jan. 5, 1909. He earned the A.B. from Yale in 1930, the LL.B. from Harvard in 1934 and the J.S.D. (Doctor of Juristic Science) from the University of Chicago in 1939.\n\nHis career as an American Sovietologist began shortly after the United States recognized the government of the USSR in 1933.\n\nUpon his graduation from Harvard Law School in 1934, he was sent by the Institute of Current World Affairs as the first American to study Soviet law at the Moscow Juridical Institute, later the Institute of State and Law. Only a handful of scholars were concerned with Russian diplomacy and business then, and scholarship on Russia was limited principally to historical studies. He approached the field of Soviet law as a pioneer and received the certificate of the Juridical Institute in 1937.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, Hazard joined the U.S. government and was assigned to the Soviet desk in the Division of Defense Aid Reports.\n\nHe helped negotiate the conditions under which the Soviet Union joined the Lend-Lease program as its major recipient. He became deputy director of the Soviet branch of the Lend-Lease Administration, through which the United States furnished food, machinery and services to its allies.\n\nAs an expert on the USSR, Hazard accompanied Vice President Henry Wallace on his secret mission to China in May, 1944.\n\nThe following year he was chosen as an expert on Soviet law to assist Justice Robert Jackson in preparing the prosecution of Nazi leaders to be brought before an international tribunal for war crimes.\n\nWith his return to civilian life in 1946, he joined the Columbia faculty. Along with four other scholars, Hazard was a founder of the Russian Institute at Columbia University, now the Harriman Institute, the first academic center in America dedicated to Russian-Soviet studies. He also was a founder of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, the first American professional organization in the field.\n\nHe was appointed professor of public law at the same time, beginning a teaching career that spanned two generations. He became the Nash Professor of Law in the Columbia Law School, received emeritus status in 1977 and continued to teach each semester until 1994.\n\nHe was associated with the Parker School of Foreign and Comparative Law at Columbia and helped shape its programs in Russian and East European law. He was the editor in chief of the Parker School Journal of East European Law, the leading journal in the field.\nThe John N. Hazard Memorial Fellowship at Columbia's Harriman Institute exists to fund scholars researching Soviet and Russian law.\n\nJohn N. Hazard was the mentor of famous Sovietologist Harold J. Berman.\n\nHazard's books cover both political science and law. His textbook, \"The Soviet System of Government\", first published by University of Chicago Press in 1957, has been republished in five editions and several languages. Other books include \"Soviet Housing Law\" (1939), \"Law and Social Change in the USSR\" (1953), \"Settling Disputes in Soviet Society\" (1960), \"The Soviet System of Government\" (1957), \"Communists and Their Law\" (1969), \"Managing Change in the USSR\" (1983), and \"Recollections of a Pioneer Sovietologist\" (1983).

{"id": "631130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=631130", "title": "Latria", "text": "Latria\n\nLatria is a theological term (Latin \"Latrīa\", from the Greek λατρεία, \"latreia\") used in Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic theology to mean adoration, a reverence directed only to the Holy Trinity. Latria carries an emphasis on the internal form of worship, rather than external ceremonies.\n\nLatria also applies to the Eucharist and Eucharistic adoration. In the 16th century, the Council of Trent made specific affirmations of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist and the theological basis for Eucharistic adoration and stated:\n\"The only-begotten Son of God is to be adored in the Holy\nSacrament of the Eucharist with the worship of \"latria\", including\nexternal worship.\nPope Paul VI's 1965 encyclical \"Mysterium fidei\": also affirmed this belief and in items 56 stated:\"The Catholic Church has always displayed and still displays this latria that ought to be paid to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, both during Mass and outside of it\".\n\n\"Latria\" is sacrificial in character, and may be offered only to God. Catholic and Orthodox Christians offer other degrees of reverence to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to the Saints; these non-sacrificial types of reverence are called \"hyperdulia\" and \"dulia\", respectively. In English, dulia is also called \"veneration\". Hyperdulia is essentially a heightened degree of dulia provided only to the Blessed Virgin.\n\nThis distinction, written about as early as Augustine of Hippo and St Jerome, was detailed more explicitly by Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae, A.D. 1270: \"Reverence is due to God on account of His Excellence, which is communicated to certain creatures not in equal measure, but according to a measure of proportion; and so the reverence which we pay to God, and which belongs to latria, differs from the reverence which we pay to certain excellent creatures; this belongs to dulia, and we shall speak of it further on (103)\"; in this next article St. Thomas Aquinas writes: \"Wherefore dulia, which pays due service to a human lord, is a distinct virtue from latria, which pays due service to the Lordship of God. It is, moreover, a species of observance, because by observance we honor all those who excel in dignity, while dulia properly speaking is the reverence of servants for their master, dulia being the Greek for servitude\".\n\nGenerally, in English, the word \"adoration\" is reserved for God alone and therefore it aptly translates \"latria\". The word \"worship\" is derived from the West Saxon dialect noun \"weorðscipe\" 'condition of being worthy', which is from \"weorð\" 'worthy' + \"-scipe\" '-ship'. The word \"worship\" is used in a strong sense in relation to God (\"latria\"), but also in a weak sense in relation to man: for instance, \"His Worship the Mayor\", or \"Your Worship\" (when addressing a magistrate in Court), or the worship of the saints (\"dulia\") as distinct to the adoration of God (\"latria\"). \"Adoration\" provides a clear and unequivocal, and therefore better, translation of \"latria\" and expression of the absolute sacrificial reverence due to God alone.\n\n\"This worship called forth by God, and given exclusively to Him as God, is designated by the Greek name \"latreia\" (Latinized, \"latria\"), for which the best translation that our language affords is the word \"Adoration\". Adoration is different from other acts of worship, such as supplication, confession of sin, etc., inasmuch as it formally consists in self-abasement before the Infinite, and in devout recognition of His transcendent excellence.\"\n\nRoman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians especially adore with \"latria\" during their religious service, the Mass or Divine Liturgy. Protestant Christians do not have a Eucharistic sacrifice \"per se\"; while Catholics consider themselves to literally participate in the sacrifice at the foot of Calvary, that what Christ offered once \"participates in the divine eternity\".\n\n"}

He became a cardinal in 1911 and resigned from that status in 1927, the only person to do so in the twentieth century.\n\nLouis Billot, sometimes identified as Ludovic Billot, studied at the seminaries in Metz, Bordeaux, and Blois. Ordained a priest on 22 May 1869, he entered the Society of Jesus on 25 November in Angers. Billot did pastoral work in Paris from 1875 to 1878 and in Laval until 1879.\n\nHe taught at the Catholic University of Angers from 1879 to 1882 and made his final vows as a Jesuit on 2 February 1883, while teaching at the Jesuit Scholasticate on Jersey. In 1885, Billot became a professor of dogmatic theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. In addition his academic post, he was named a consultor to the Holy Office on 19 June 1909.\n\nA keen proponent of Thomistic scholasticism, Billot became a leading figure in metaphysical and speculative theology. He produced numerous published works and attracted many students. He was instrumental in drafting Pope Pius X's 1907 encyclical \"Pascendi dominici gregis\" and was a close friend of Fr. Henri Le Floch, rector of the French Seminary in Rome.\n\nPius X created him Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Via Lata in the consistory of 27 November 1911. Billot was one of the cardinal electors in the conclave of 1914, and participated in conclave of 1922 as well. He was also one of the three Cardinal-Presidents of the Pontifical Academy \"S. Tommaso\" in Rome, together with Benedetto Lorenzelli and Michele Lega. He was appointed a member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission on 6 February 1923.\n\nBillot's support for the deeply conservative movement Action Française eventually created tension between him and the Holy See. Pope Pius XI believed that the movement used Catholicism for its own political ends and placed the movement's newspaper on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum which meant that it was banned from all Catholic homes. Billot expressed strong disagreement with the decision, saying that the political activities of monarchist Catholics ought not to be censured by Rome.\n\nOn 13 September 1927, in a meeting with Pope Pius XI, Billot submitted a letter asking to be allowed to resign as cardinal. The Pope had a document drafted for his signature and accepted the resignation eight days later on 21 September. The Pope announced Billot's change in status to the College of Cardinals at the consistory on 19 December, saying: \"The autograph letter with which he tendered his resignation adduced such high spiritual motives, and in such grave circumstances, that after much thought and prayer we decided to accept them.\" Billot had asked to be allowed to resign several times before.\n\nAction Française suggested that the papal action against the newspaper had provoked Billot's action. The Vatican said his meeting with the Pope was amicable and attributed his resignation to his age, which was 81. It said he had only an academic interest in Action Française.\n\nHe was the only cardinal to resign that rank during the twentieth century, though others relinquished the rights and privileges of the office while retaining the title.\n\nBillot died at the Jesuit Novitiate of Galloro, near Ariccia, outside Rome, at the age of 85. He is buried in the Jesuit chapel of the Campo Verano cemetery.\n\n"}

{"id": "658808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=658808", "title": "Material conditional", "text": "Material conditional\n\nThe material conditional (also known as material implication, material consequence, or simply implication, implies, or conditional) is a logical connective (or a binary operator) that is often symbolized by a forward arrow \"→\". The material conditional is used to form statements of the form \"p\" → \"q\" (termed a \"conditional statement\") which is read as \"if \"p\" then \"q\"\". Unlike the English construction \"if... then...\", the material conditional statement \"p\" → \"q\" does not specify a causal relationship between \"p\" and \"q\". It is merely to be understood to mean \"if \"p\" is true, then \"q\" is also true\" such that the statement \"p\" → \"q\" is false only when \"p\" is true and \"q\" is false.  The material conditional only states that \"q\" is true when (but not necessarily only when) \"p\" is true, and makes no claim that \"p\" causes \"q\".\n\nThe material conditional is also symbolized using:\n\nWith respect to the material conditionals above:\n\nConditional statements may be nested such that either or both of the antecedent or the consequent may themselves be conditional statements. In the example , meaning \"if the truth of \"p\" implies the truth of \"q\", then the truth of \"r\" implies the truth of \"s\"), both the antecedent and the consequent are conditional statements.\n\nIn classical logic formula_1 is logically equivalent to formula_2 and by De Morgan's Law logically equivalent to formula_3. Whereas, in minimal logic (and therefore also intuitionistic logic) formula_1 only logically entails formula_2; and in intuitionistic logic (but not minimal logic) formula_3 entails formula_1.\n\nLogicians have many different views on the nature of material implication and approaches to explain its sense.\n\nIn classical logic, the compound is logically equivalent to the negative compound: not both \"p\" and not \"q\". Thus the compound is \"false\" if and only if both \"p\" is true and \"q\" is false. By the same stroke, is \"true\" if and only if either \"p\" is false or \"q\" is true (or both). Thus → is a function from pairs of truth values of the components \"p\", \"q\" to truth values of the compound , whose truth value is entirely a function of the truth values of the components. Hence, this interpretation is called \"truth-functional\". The compound is logically equivalent also to (either not \"p\", or \"q\" (or both)), and to (if not \"q\" then not \"p\"). But it is not equivalent to , which is equivalent to .\n\nThe truth table associated with the material conditional is identical to that of . It is as follows:\n\nIt may also be useful to note that in Boolean algebra, true and false can be denoted as 1 and 0 respectively with an equivalent table.\n\nThe material conditional can be considered as a symbol of a formal theory, taken as a set of sentences, satisfying all the classical inferences involving →, in particular the following characteristic rules:\n\n\nUnlike the truth-functional one, this approach to logical connectives permits the examination of structurally identical propositional forms in various logical systems, where somewhat different properties may be demonstrated. For example, in intuitionistic logic which rejects proofs by contraposition as valid rules of inference, is not a propositional theorem, but the material conditional is used to define negation.\n\nWhen studying logic formally, the material conditional is distinguished from the semantic consequence relation formula_8. We say formula_9 if every interpretation that makes \"A\" true also makes \"B\" true. However, there is a close relationship between the two in most logics, including classical logic. For example, the following principles hold:\n\n\nThese principles do not hold in all logics, however. Obviously they do not hold in non-monotonic logics, nor do they hold in relevance logics.\n\nOther properties of implication (the following expressions are always true, for any logical values of variables):\n\n\nNote that formula_24 is logically equivalent to formula_25; this property is sometimes called un/currying. Because of these properties, it is convenient to adopt a right-associative notation for → where formula_26 denotes formula_24.\n\nComparison of Boolean truth tables shows that formula_28 is equivalent to formula_29, and one is an equivalent replacement for the other in classical logic. See material implication (rule of inference).\n\nOutside of mathematics, it is a matter of some controversy as to whether the truth function for material implication provides an adequate treatment of conditional statements in a natural language such as English, i.e., indicative conditionals and counterfactual conditionals. An indicative conditional is a sentence in the indicative mood with a conditional clause attached. A counterfactual conditional is a false-to-fact sentence in the subjunctive mood. That is to say, critics argue that in some non-mathematical cases, the truth value of a compound statement, \"if \"p\" then \"q\"\", is not adequately determined by the truth values of \"p\" and \"q\". Examples of non-truth-functional statements include: \"\"q\" because \"p\", \"p\" before \"q\"\" and \"it is possible that \"p\"\".\n\n\"[Of] the sixteen possible truth-functions of \"A\" and \"B\", material implication is the only serious candidate. First, it is uncontroversial that when \"A\" is true and \"B\" is false, \"If \"A\", \"B\"\" is false. A basic rule of inference is modus ponens: from \"If \"A\", \"B\"\" and \"A\", we can infer \"B\". If it were possible to have \"A\" true, \"B\" false and \"If \"A\", \"B\"\" true, this inference would be invalid. Second, it is uncontroversial that \"If \"A\", \"B\"\" is sometimes true when \"A\" and \"B\" are respectively (true, true), or (false, true), or (false, false)… Non-truth-functional accounts agree that \"If \"A\", \"B\"\" is false when \"A\" is true and \"B\" is false; and they agree that the conditional is sometimes true for the other three combinations of truth-values for the components; but they deny that the conditional is always true in each of these three cases. Some agree with the truth-functionalist that when \"A\" and \"B\" are both true, \"If \"A\", \"B\"\" must be true. Some do not, demanding a further relation between the facts that \"A\" and that \"B\".\"\n\nThe meaning of the material conditional can sometimes be used in the English \"if \"condition\" then \"consequence\"\" construction (a kind of conditional sentence), where \"condition\" and \"consequence\" are to be filled with English sentences. However, this construction also implies a \"reasonable\" connection between the condition (protasis) and consequence (apodosis) (see Connexive logic).\n\nThe material conditional can yield some unexpected truths when expressed in natural language. For example, any material conditional statement with a false antecedent is true (see vacuous truth). So the statement \"if 2 is odd then 2 is even\" is true. Similarly, any material conditional with a true consequent is true. So the statement \"if I have a penny in my pocket then Paris is in France\" is always true, regardless of whether or not there is a penny in my pocket. These problems are known as the paradoxes of material implication, though they are not really paradoxes in the strict sense; that is, they do not elicit logical contradictions. These unexpected truths arise because speakers of English (and other natural languages) are tempted to equivocate between the material conditional and the indicative conditional, or other conditional statements, like the counterfactual conditional and the material biconditional.\n\nIt is not surprising that a rigorously defined truth-functional operator does not correspond exactly to all notions of implication or otherwise expressed by 'if ... then ...' sentences in natural languages. For an overview of some of the various analyses, formal and informal, of conditionals, see the \"References\" section below. Relevance logic attempts to capture these alternate concepts of implication that material implication glosses over.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He says: \"God is Life, he is the essence of Life, or, if one prefers, the essence of Life is God. Saying this we already know what God is, we know it not through the effect of some knowledge or learning, we do not know it through thought, against the background of the truth of the world. Rather we know it, and can know it, only in and through Life itself. We can know the essence of God only in God.\"\n\nThis Life is not biological life defined by objective and exterior properties, nor an abstract and empty philosophical concept, but the absolute phenomenological life, a radically immanent life which possesses in it the power of showing itself in itself without distance, a life which reveals permanently itself. A manifestation of oneself and a self-revelation which doesn’t consist in the fact of seeing outside oneself or of perceiving the exterior world, but in the fact of feeling and of feeling oneself, of experiencing in oneself its own inner and affective reality.\n\nAs Michel Henry says also in this same book, \"God is that pure Revelation that reveals nothing other than itself. God reveals Himself. The Revelation of God is his self-revelation\". God is in himself revelation, he is the primordial Revelation that tears everything from nothingness, a revelation which is the pathetic self-revelation and the absolute self-enjoyment of Life. As John says, God is love, because Life loves itself in an infinite and eternal love.\n\nMichel Henry opposes to the notion of creation, which is the creation of the world, the notion of generation of Life. The creation of the world consists in the opening of this exteriority horizon where every thing becomes visible. Whereas Life never stops to generate itself and to generate all the livings in its radical immanence, in its absolute phenomenological interiority that is without gap nor distance.\n\nAs we are living and by consequence generated continually by the infinite Life of God, as he never stops to give us life, and as we never cease of being born into the eternal present of life by the action in us of this absolute Life, God is for Christianity our Father and we are its beloved Sons, the Sons of the living God. This doesn’t only mean that he has created us at the time of our conception or at the beginning of the world, but that he never stops to generate us permanently into Life, that he is always at work in us in the least of our subjective impressions.\n\n\n\n"}

Little is known of his life, and knowledge of his doctrines is mainly derived from Anselm and Abelard.\n\nHe studied at Soissons and Reims, was afterwards attached to the cathedral of Chartres and became canon of Compiègne. As a monk of Compiègne, he was teaching as early as 1087. He had contact with Lanfranc, Anselm and St. Ivo of Chartres.\n\nIt seems most probable that Roscellinus was not strictly the first to promulgate nominalistic doctrines; but in his exposition they received more definite expression, and being applied to the dogma of the Trinity, attracted universal attention.\n\nRoscellinus maintained that it is merely a habit of speech which prevents our speaking of the three persons as three substances or three Gods. If it were otherwise, and the three persons were really one substance or thing (\"una res\"), we should be forced to admit that the Father and the Holy Spirit became incarnate along with the Son. Roscellinus seems to have put forward this doctrine in perfect good faith, and to have claimed for it at first the authority of Lanfranc and Anselm.\n\nIn 1092/1093, however, a council convoked at Soissons by the archbishop of Reims condemned his interpretation, and Roscellinus, who was accused of tritheism, recanted the doctrines attributed to him, but only out of fear of excommunication and even stoning to death by the orthodox populace, for later he returned to his early theories. He fled to England, but having made himself unpopular by an attack on the doctrines of Anselm, he left the country and repaired to Rome, where he was well received and became reconciled to the Catholic Church. He then returned to France, taught at Tours and Loc-menach (Loches) in France (where he had Abelard as a pupil), and finally became canon of Besançon. He is heard of as late as 1121, when he came forward to oppose Abelard's views on the Trinity. He was also sent a letter by Theobald of Étampes for having denigrated wrongfully the sons of priests.\n\nOf his writings there exists only a letter addressed to Abelard on the Trinity, in which Roscellinus \"belittles Abélard and makes merry over his castration.\" Hauréau brings forward his name in connection with a text: \"Sententia de universalibus secundum magistrum R.\" (\"Notices et extr. de quelques manuscr. lat.\", V, Paris, 1892, 224), but this is a conjecture. We have as evidences of his doctrine texts of Anselm, Abelard, John of Salisbury, and an anonymous epigram. His share in the history of ideas and especially his nominalism have been exaggerated, his celebrity being far more due to his theological tritheism.\n\nAccording to Otto of Freisingen Roscelin \"primus nostris temporibus sententiam vocum instituit\" (\"Gesta Friderici imp\". in \"\", XX, 376) (Literally: \"was the first in our times to institute the opinion/theory of words\"), but the chronicler of the \"Historia Francia\" (cf. Bouquet, \"Recueil des hist. des Gaules et de la France\", XII, Paris, 1781, 3, b, c) mentions before him a \"magister Johannes\", whose personality is much discussed and who has not yet been definitively identified. What constitutes the \"sententia vocum\"? To judge of it we have besides the texts mentioned above which bear directly on Roscelin an exposition of the treatise \"De generibus et speciebus\" (thirteenth century), wrongly attributed to Abelard by Victor Cousin. The \"sententia vocum\" was one of the anti-Realist solutions of the problem of universals accepted by the early Middle Ages. Resuming Porphyry's alternative (\"mox de generibus et speciebus illud quidem sive subsistent sive in nudis intellectibus posita sint\") the first medieval philosophers regarded genera and species (substance, corporeity, animality, humanity) either as things or as having no existence, and applying to this alternative a terminology of Boethius, they derived thence either res (things) or voces (words). To the nominalists universals were \"voces\" 'voices', which means: (1) above all that universals are not \"res\", that is that only the individual exists: \"nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum ...\" (De gener. et spec., 524). Nominalism was essentially anti-Realist. (2) that universals are merely words, flatus vocis, e.g., the word \"homo\", divisible into syllables, consonants and vowels. \"Fuit autem, nemini magistri nostri Roscellini tam insana sententia ut nullam rem partibus constare vellet, sed sicut solis vocibus species, ita et partes ascridebat\" (Abelard, \"Liber divisionum\", ed. Cousin, 471); \"[...] \"Illi utique dialectici, qui non nisi flatum vocis putant universalis esse substantias, et qui colorem non aliud queunt intellegere quam corpus, nec sapientiam hominis aliud quam animam, prorsus a spiritualium quaestionum disputatione sunt exsufflandi.\" (Anselm, \"De Incarnatione Verbi\", p. 285. Opera Omnia, vol. 1. Ed. F.S. Schmitt, 1938); \"Alius ergo consistit in vocibus, licet haec opinio cum Roscelino suo fere omnino evanuerit\" (John of Salisbury, \"Metalog.\", II, 17). The universal is reduced to an emission of sound (\"flatus vocis\"), in conformity with Boethius' definition: \"Nihil enim aliud est prolatio (vocis) quam aeris plectro linguae percussio\". Roscelin's universal corresponds to what is now called the \"universale in voce\" in opposition to \"universale in re\" and \"universale in intellectu\".\n\nBut this theory of Roscelin's had no connection with the abstract concept of genus and species. He did not touch on this question. It is certain that he did not deny the existence or possibility of these concepts, and he was therefore not a nominalist in the fashion of Taine or in the sense in which nominalism is now understood. That is why, in reference to the modern sense of the word, some call it a pseudo-nominalism. John of Salisbury, speaking of \"nominalis secta\" (Metalog., II, 10), gives it quite another meaning. So Roscelin's rudimentary, even childish, solution does not compromise the value of universal concepts and may be called a stage in the development of moderate realism. However, because of his position as the first medieval philosopher to challenge medieval Realism, he has been invoked as a forefather of modernity.\n\nRoscelin was also taken to task by Anselm and Abelard for the less clear idea which he gave of the whole and of composite substance. According to Anselm he maintained that colour does not exist independently of the horse which serves as its support and that the wisdom of the soul is not outside of the soul which is wise (De fide trinit., 2). He denies to the whole, such as house, man, real existence of its parts. The word alone had parts, \"ita divinam paginam pervertit, ut eo loco quo Dominus partem piscis assi comedisse partem hujus vocis, quae est piscis assi, non partem rei intelligere cogatur\" (Cousin, P. Abaelardi opera, II. 151).\n\nRoscelin was not without his supporters; among them was his contemporary Raimbert of Lille, and what the monk Hériman relates of his doctrine agrees with the statements of the master of Compiègne. Universal substances, says Hériman, are but a breath, which means \"eos de sapientium numero merito esse exsufflandos\". He merely comments on the saying of Anselm characterized by the same jesting tone: a spiritualium quaestionum disputatione sunt exsufflandi\" (\"P.L.\", 256a), and says that to understand the windy loquacity of Raimbert of Lille one has but to breathe into his hand (\"manuque ori admota exsufflans\" \"Mon. Germ. Hist.\", XIV, 275).\n\nRoscelin considered the three Divine Persons as three independent beings, like three angels; if usage permitted, he added, it might truly be said that there are three Gods. Otherwise, he continued, God the Father and God the Holy Ghost would have become incarnate with God the Son. To retain the appearance of dogma he admitted that the three Divine Persons had but one will and power [\"Audio ... quod Roscelinus clericus dicit in tres personas esse tres res ab invicem separatas, sicut sunt tres angeli, ita tamen ut una sit voluntas et potestas aut Patrem et Spiritum sanctum esse incarnatum; et tres deos vere posse dici si usus admitteret\" (letter of Anselm to Foulques)].\n\nThis characteristic tritheism, which Anselm and Abelard agreed in refuting even after its author's conversion, seems an indisputable application of Roscelin's anti-Realism. He even argues that if the three Divine Persons form but one God, all three have become incarnate.

He was the Guru of Nath teachers Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, Sri Ranjit Maharaj, and Sri Kadsiddheshwar Maharaj.\n\nSiddharameshwar was born in 1888 in the village Pathri, Solapur, India. Since his childhood he was very intelligent and had very sharp imbibe abilities. In 1906 he was initiated by his guru 'Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj' in Inchagiri in Karnataka India, who taught mantra meditation as the way to reach Final Reality. He was one of the contemporaries of Sri Ramana Maharshi.\n\nIn 1920 Siddharameshwar started to set out on \"the Bird's Path\", the fast way to attain realization, six years after Bhauhaseb maharaj had died. His fellow-students opposed, but eventually he succeeded by himself.\n\nSiddharameshwar died on November 9, 1936 (Ekadashi, 11th day in the later half Ashwin), at the age of 48, giving his understanding to his disciples. It is said that dozens of his disciples became self-realized through his clear and lucid teaching. His samadhi shrine today is located at Banganga, Walkeshwar in Mumbai.\n\n\"Atma Vidya\" (Self-Knowledge\") is the central theme in Siddharameshwar Maharaj's teachings. In \"Master Key to Self-Realization\" he describes how the teaching of Vedanta is transmitted to a student. It starts with the meeting with a guru, who tells about the teachings. Thereafter a mantra is being used by the student to meditate and make the mind more receptive. Then the guru explains the teaching further, which has to be realized experientially by the student.\n\nThe student has to turn away his mind from external objects and the gross body, and \"turn within\". By realizing that objects have only a temporary appearance, it becomes possible to develop detachment and to clear one's mental attitude from pride. This is a necessary step to develop Self-Knowledge, and the renunciation of the impermanent, and the acceptance of the permanent.\n\nTo realize this Self-Knowledge, an investigation of the four bodies has to be made to discover whence the notion of \"I\" comes. Siddharameshwar Maharaj discerns four bodies:\n\nBy subsequently identifying with the three lower bodies, investigating them, and discarding identification with them when it has become clear that they are not the \"I\", the sense of \"I am\" beyond knowledge and Ignorance becomes clearly established.\n\nThe teachings of Siddharameshwar have been called \"Vihangam Marg\", \"the Bird's Way\", the direct path to Self-discovery, in contrast to Bhausaheb Maharaj's teachings, which have been called \"Pipilika Marg \", \"the Ant's way\", the way of meditation:\nSiddharameshwar Maharaje used four books to give sermons on:\n\nSiddharameshwar Maharaj's preachings were further spread around the globe by his most revered disciples:\n\n\n\"Golden Day\" is a 10-page publication by Siddharameshwar Maharaj from 1925.\n\nThe most well known book in India containing Siddharameshwar Maharaj's teachings is \"Adhyatma Jnanachi Gurukilli\". It was transcribed by Shri Dattatray Dharmayya Poredi, a distinguished disciple of Shri Siddharameshwar Maharajs, from Siddharameshwar's teachings as spoken in the Marathi language. It was originally published by Shri Ganapatrao Maharaj of Kannur.\n\nShri Ranjit Maharaj received verbal permission from Shri Ganapatrao Maharaj to have the text translated into English. Ranjit Maharaj entrusted the translation responsibilities to Dr. Mrs. Damyanti Dungaji. The completed English translation was then proofread and subsequently published by Shri Siddharameshwar Adhyatma Kendra, Mumbai under the name \"Master Key to Self-Realization\". When all of the copies of that original English text were sold, the text was incorporated into another book of Siddharameshwar Maharaj's talks entitled \"Amrut Laya\", also published by Shri Siddharameshwar Adhyatma Kendra, Mumbai). It was republished by Sadguru Publications in 2008, and also included within \"Master of Self-Realization\" and \"Amrut Laya: The Stateless State\".\n\n\"Adhyatmadnyanacha Yogeshwar\" Vol I & II consists of 130 talks of Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj. They were transcribed, edited and published by Nisargadatta Maharaj in 1961-1962 in Marathi language, who also wrote the preface to the book. It was translated in English and published as \"Master of Self-Realization: An Ultimate Understanding\".\n\nVolume 1 of Amrut Laya is composed of transcribed notes from 50 talks given by Siddharameshwar Maharaj on various themes from Dasbodh. Volume 2 of Amrut Laya consists of notes taken from 88 talks of Siddharameshwar Maharaj where he elaborates on various spiritual principles from three main classic texts, namely Dasbodh, Yogavasishtha and Eknathi Bhagawat.\n\n\n\n"}

Bears had powerful shamanic connotations among the people of the Northwest Coast.\nSoulcatchers were decorated with a sisiutl-like animal: a land-otter or bear head at both ends of the tube, and an anthropomorphic face in the middle. This form may have represented the ability to shift shapes, or the mythological land-otter canoe, implying the ability to travel between the three realms: air/god realm \"(kijek)\", earth/human/animal realm \"(takijek)\", and water/spirit realm \"(tekijek)\".

Once the errant soul was located, the shaman would \"suck\" the soul into the soulcatcher, and return to the patient.

Chesterton's final collection of detective stories, published after his death in 1936. Of the eight mysteries, seven were first printed in the \"Storyteller\" magazine. \"The Unmentionable Man\" was unique to the book.\n\nThe stories revolve around a civil servant named Mr. Pond (we are not told his first name). He is described as a very ordinary and fish-like man who has a habit of startling those who meet him with outrageous paradoxical statements. He seems unaware of the oddness of his remarks, and his friend Sir Hubert Wotton explains: \"he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss... but he's really had very extraordinary experiences. He doesn't talk about them; he doesn't want to talk about them... but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually \"done\" – well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contradictory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life.\"\n\nChesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings, but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Pond's:\n\nIn four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, \"Pond the Pantaloon\", Wotton tells the story. In two more, \"The Crime of Captain Gahagan\" and \"The Terrible Troubadour\", Pond's keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In \"Ring of Lovers\" Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it.\n\nThese stories written at the end of Chesterton's career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story \"The Crime of Captain Gahagan\" Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that \"Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midnight.\"\n\nThe main characters in the book are Mr. Pond, his friend Captain Peter Gahagan, a romantic and impulsive Irishman, and a well-known government official, Sir Hubert Wotton. Also mentioned in more than one chapter are Violet Varney, an actress, and her sister Joan, to whom Gahagan proposes after being suspected of having an affair with Lord Crome's wife in \"Ring of Lovers\". Joan, now married to Gahagan, appears in the framing sequence of \"A Tall Story\".\n\nThe paradox is introduced when a casual discussion turns to matters of European politics, and Pond recalls an episode during a war between the Prussians and the Polish. The fact, insists Pond, to Wotton's dismay, is that the Prussian soldiers were \"too\" obedient. Marshal Von Grock failed in his attempt to execute the influential Polish poet and singer Paul Petrowski because two of his soldiers did precisely what he asked.\n\nThe chapter begins with Pond being interviewed by a garrulous American journalist who cannot finish a sentence without interrupting herself. This supplies a clue to Pond when a lawyer accuses Pond's acquaintance Captain Gahagan of murdering his client, the husband of a woman Gahagan had been spending much time with. After hearing the lawyer's story of what Gahagan said when leaving the Varney house, Pond introduces the paradox: Gahagan said exactly the same thing to all three witnesses, despite their conflicting reports.\n\nThe paradox, simply put, is that two doctors once agreed so thoroughly that one naturally murdered the other. In the framing sequence mention is made of an agreement between the Poles and the Lithuanians about Wilno, and Pond mentions Tweedledum and Tweedledee (who \"agreed\" to have a battle) and tells the story of a protracted argument over morality which came to an abrupt conclusion.\n\nPond introduces the paradox—that the pencil was relatively red, which was why it made such black marks—but Gahagan must go to Wotton for the explanation. Wotton tells the story of how Pond saved England and was shot at five times in a railway station waiting room, all because of the \"pencil\" which made the \"black marks\".\n\nDuring a discussion of deportation, Pond mentions a man who was so well-regarded that officials longed to deport him – but could not. In the capital of a European republic with an oppressive government and an active revolutionary movement, Mr Louis sits in the central square and entertains all and sundry. His identity is a well-kept secret, but Pond guesses it.\n\nThis story centres on Captain Gahagan, described by Mr. Pond as \"a very truthful man... [who] tells wanton and unnecessary lies\". The captain tells a (true) story of a dreadful dinner party which ended in death, and explains how it induced him to propose to the woman he loves.\n\nThe paradox, \"In Nature you must go very low to find things that go so high\", in this case is not Mr. Pond's, but his friend Dr. Paul Green's. Green introduces the Vicar of Hanging Burgess, who accuses Captain Gahagan of having, many years ago, shot a rival in love, dumped the body and then run away to the war. From the Vicar's eyewitness description of the incident, Pond divines the truth.\n\nMr Pond, Sir Henry Wotton, Captain Gahagan and his new wife Joan are discussing the treatment of Jews in Germany, and Pond recalls an incident in the last war when a Jew who had adopted a German name was suspected of being a spy. He describes the persecution of officials by \"spy-maniacs\" who reported all sorts of \"suspicious behaviour\", while the real spies passed unnoticed—including the spy who was \"too tall to be seen\".\n\n5 of the 8 stories (1,2,4,6,7 of the list above) were produced as 15 minute radio stories for BBC Radio 4 Extra, read by Martin Jarvis.

Its six books are called \"The Sofa\", \"The Timepiece\", \"The Garden\", \"The Winter Evening\", \"The Winter Morning Walk\" and \"The Winter Walk at Noon\". Beginning with a mock-Miltonic passage on the origins of the sofa, it develops into a discursive meditation on the blessings of nature, the retired life and religious faith, with attacks on slavery, blood sports, fashionable frivolity, lukewarm clergy and French despotism among other things. Cowper's subjects are those that occur to him naturally in the course of his reflections rather than being suggested by poetic convention, and the diction throughout is, for an 18th-century poem, unusually conversational and unartificial. As the poet himself writes,\n\n<poem>\n...my raptures are not conjured up\nTo serve occasions of poetic pomp,\nBut genuine...</poem>\n\nCowper prefaced \"The Task\" with an account of its genesis:\n\nA lady, fond of blank verse, demanded a poem of that kind from the Author, and gave him the S for a subject. He obeyed; and, having much leisure, connected another subject with it; and, pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of mind led him, brought forth at length, instead of the trifle which he at first intended, a serious affair – a Volume.\n\nLady Austen, a friend of Cowper's in the early 1780s, made this suggestion in the early summer of 1783, and he took the idea up, continuing in spite of sporadic returns of the depressive illness from which he suffered so much. On its completion the following year the poem was sent to Cowper's publisher Joseph Johnson, who had previously issued Cowper's \"Poems\" (1782). It was decided to add three shorter poems, \"An Epistle to Joseph Hill\", \"Tirocinium\" and \"The Diverting History of John Gilpin\", but, because of delays on Johnson’s part, the book did not appear until 1785. The venture was successful, and was soon followed by a second edition of the \"Poems\" in two volumes, \"The Task\" and its three attendants forming the second volume. Further editions were called for at short intervals for the next 40 years, for \"The Task\" had so caught the Evangelical spirit of the age that, according to one critic, \"As \"Paradise Lost\" is to militant Puritanism, so is \"The Task\" to the religious movement of its author's time.\"\n\nIn a letter Robert Burns wrote,\nIs not \"The Task\" a glorious poem? The religion of \"The Task\", bating a few scraps of Calvinistic divinity, is the religion of God and Nature: the religion that exalts, that ennobles man.\nHe is said to have loved the poem enough to have habitually walked about with a copy in his pocket. The poem is extensively quoted in the novels of Jane Austen, and has been seen as deeply influential on her. The conversational diction of the Lake Poets' works can be seen as stemming directly from \"The Task\". Certainly the young Coleridge wrote of Cowper's \"divine Chit chat\", and in later years praised \"The Task\"'s \"chastity of diction\" and \"harmony of blank verse\". In a 1796 letter Charles Lamb testified to Coleridge's thorough relish for Cowper, and on his own account wrote of Cowper as an old favourite and of \"reading the \"Task\" with fresh delight\". Wordsworth borrowed a copy while still a schoolboy, and the poem's influence on his \"Tintern Abbey\" and \"The Prelude\" is widely recognised.\n\n\"The Task\" has been published as part of the Oxford Standard Authors \"Poetical Works of Cowper\", edited by H. S. Milford (1905), revised by Norma Russell (1967); also by the Longman's Annotated Texts series in an edition by James Sambrook (1994).\n\nFull-text online editions\n\nCriticism\n"}

A theoretical definition is a proposed way of thinking about potentially related events. Theoretical definitions contain \"built-in\" theories; they cannot be simply reduced to describing a set of observations. The definition may contain implicit inductions and deductive consequences that are part of the theory. A theoretical definition of a term can change, over time, based on the methods in the field that created it.\n\nWithout a falsifiable operational definition, conceptual definitions assume both knowledge and acceptance of the theories that it depends on. A hypothetical construct may serve as a theoretical definition, as can a stipulative definition.\n\nThe term scientific theory is reserved for concepts that are widely accepted. A scientific law often refers to regularities that can be expressed by a mathematical statement. However, there is no consensus about the distinction between these terms. Every scientific concept must have an operational definition, however the operational definition can use both direct observations and latent variables.\n\nIn the natural sciences, a concept is an abstract conclusion drawn from observations.\n\nSocial and health sciences interact with non-empirical fields and use both observation based and pre-existing concepts such as intelligence, race, and gender.\n\n\nMost interdisciplinary fields are designed to address specific real world concerns and theoretical definitions in interdisciplinary fields is still evolving.\n\nThe definitions of substances as various configurations of atoms are theoretical definitions, as are definitions of colors as specific wavelengths of reflected light.\n\nThe first postulate of special relativity theory that the speed of light in vacuum is the same to all inertial observers (i.e. it is a constant, and therefore a good measure of length). Of interest, this theoretical concept is the basis of an operational definition for the length of a metre is \"the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second\". Thus we have defined 'metre' according to other ideas contained in modern scientific theory. Rejection of the theory underlying a theoretical definition leaves the definition invalid for use in argument with those who reject it — neither side will advance its position by using terms the others do not accept .\n\nHeat explains a collection of various laws of nature and that predict certain results.\n\nIn psychology, the concept of intelligence is meant to explain correlations in performance on certain cognitive tasks. Recent models suggest several cognitive processes may be involved in tasks that have been associated with intelligence. However, overall the \"g\" or general intelligence factor is relatively supported by research, though there are challenges.\n\nDiffering theoretical definitions of \"thinking\" have caused conflict amongst artificial intelligence philosophers, illustrated for example by the different responses to the Chinese room experiment. Some philosophers might call \"thought\" merely \"having the ability to convince another person that you can think\". An operational definition corresponding to this theoretical definition could be a simple conversation test (e.g. Turing test). Others believe that better theoretical and operational definitions are required.\n\n"}
{"id": "14934822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14934822", "title": "Type–token distinction", "text": "Type–token distinction\n\nThe type–token distinction is used in disciplines such as logic, linguistics, metalogic, typography, and computer programming to clarify what words mean.\n\nThe sentence \"they drive the same car\" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same \"type\" of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).\n\nFor example: \"bicycle\" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas \"my bicycle\" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence \"the bicycle is becoming more popular\" the word \"bicycle\" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence \"the bicycle is in the garage\" the word \"bicycle\" represents a token: a particular object.\n\nThe words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is \"thorny\", \"flowering\" and \"bushy\". You might say a rose bush \"instantiates\" these three types, or \"embodies\" these three concepts, or \"exhibits\" these three properties, or \"possesses\" these three qualities, features or attributes.\n\nProperty types (e.g \"height in metres\" or \"thorny\") are often understood ontologically as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.\n\nSome say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible physical objects. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type \"bicycle\", as in \"\"the bicycle\" is popular.\". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.\n\nSome say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as \"thought\", \"tennis match\", \"government\" and \"act of kindness\".\n\nThere is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an occurrence of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: \"A rose is a rose is a rose\". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: \"rose\", \"is\" and \"a\". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.\n\nThe need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them. Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of numerals is often helpful.\n\nIn typography, the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by movable type:\n\nThe word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having \"type–token ambiguity\". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in 1906 using terminology that he established.\n\nThe letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.\n\nPeirce's type–token distinction, also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or concatenation theory. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar, namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.\n\nSome logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.\n\nThe word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.\n\nPeirce's original words are the following.\n\"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice ... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. ... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies.\" – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.\n\nThese distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.\n\n\n"}

Akimov at www.humans.ru had published a critical article entitled \"Leibin, Freud and Russia. \"Non-Russianness\" of psychoanalysis\". In this article the author accuses Valery Leibin of having caused enormous damage to Russia by \"taking up the promotion of contentious teachings of Freud\", by “doing everything for the ideology of Freudianism to become the official ideology of Russia\" and by \"being a brilliant propagandist; Hitler would have remained satisfied with his work\". Akimov believes psychoanalysis harmful and dangerous, calls Sigmund Freud \"the father of shamanism of the 20th century\", a clever adventurer\". One of the author's claims against Valery Leibin is that he introduced the concept of \"Russianness\", widely used by Russian nationalists now. Also O.E. Akimov, while calling Valery Leibin \"a prominent figure in the psychoanalytic world”, \"the greatest expert in the field of theory, practice and history of psychoanalysis”, \"the leading psychotherapist”, accuses the latter in causing psychological trauma to his students.\n\n"}
{"id": "32172794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32172794", "title": "Visual space", "text": "Visual space\n\nVisual space is the perceptual space housing the visual world being experienced by an aware observer; it is the subjective counterpart of the space of physical objects before an observer's eyes.\n\nIn object space the location and shape of physical targets can be accurately described with the tools of geometry. For practical purposes it is Euclidean. It is three-dimensional and various co-ordinate systems like the Cartesian x,y,z (with a defined origin in relation to an observer's head or eyes), or bipolar with angles of elevation, azimuth and binocular parallax (based on the separation of the two eyes) are interchangeable. No elaborate mathematics are needed.\n\nPercepts, the counterparts in the aware observer's conscious experience of objects in physical space, constitute an ordered ensemble or, as Ernst Cassirer explained, the perceptual world has a structure and is not an aggregate of scattered sensations. This visual space can be accessed by introspection, by interrogation, or by suitable experimental procedures which allow relative location as well as some structural properties to be assessed, even quantitatively.\n\nAn example illustrates the relationship between the concepts of object and visual space:\nTwo straight lines are presented to an observer who is asked to set them so that they appear parallel. When this has been done, the lines \"are\" parallel in visual space and now a comparison is feasible with the physical lines' setting in object space. Good precision can be achieved using psychophysical procedures in human observers or behavioral ones in trained animals. The reciprocal experiment is easier to perform but does not yield a numerical read-out as readily: show objectively parallel lines and make a determination of their inclination in the observer's perception.\n\nConsidering how it arises (see below), visual space seems, as an immediate, unmediated experience, to provide a remarkably true and unproblematic representation of a real world of objects.\n\nThe distinction is mandatory between what the eye professions call \"visual field\", the area or extent of physical space that is available to the eye or that is being imaged on the retina, and the virtual, perceptual \"visual space\" in which visual percepts are located, the subject of this entry.\nConfusion is caused by the use of \"\" in the German literature for both. There is no doubt that Ewald Hering and his followers meant visual space in their disquisitions.\n\nThe fundamental distinction was made by Rudolf Carnap between three kinds of space which he called \"formal\", \"physical\" and \"perceptual.\" Mathematicians, for example, deal with ordered structures, ensembles of elements for which rules of logico-deductive relationships hold, limited solely by being not self-contradictory. These are the \"formal\" spaces. According to Carnap, studying \"physical\" space means examining the relationship between empirically determined objects. Finally, there is the realm of what students of Kant know as \",\" immediate sensory experiences, often awkwardly translated as \"apperceptions,\" which belong to \"perceptual spaces.\"\n\nGeometry is the discipline devoted to the study of space and the rules relating the elements to each other. For example, in Euclidean space there is the Pythagorean theorem for distances. In a two-dimensional space of constant curvature, like the surface of a sphere, the rule is somewhat more complex but applies everywhere. On the two-dimensional surface of a football, the rule is more complex still and has different values depending on location. In well-behaved spaces such rules used for measurement and called \"Metrics,\" are classically handled by the mathematics invented by Riemann. Object space belongs to that class.\n\nTo the extent that it is reachable by scientifically acceptable probes, visual space as defined is also a candidate for such considerations. The first and remarkably prescient analysis was published by Ernst Mach in 1901. Under the heading \"On Physiological as Distinguished from Geometrical Space\" Mach states that \"Both spaces are threefold manifoldnesses\" but the former is \"...neither constituted everywhere and in all directions alike, nor infinite in extent, nor unbounded.\" A notable attempt at a rigorous formulation was made in 1947 by the highly talented mathematician Rudolf Luneburg, who preceded his essay by a profound analysis of the underlying principles. When features are sufficiently singular and distinct, there is no problem about a correspondence between an individual item \"A\" in object space and its correlate \"A' \" in visual space. Questions can be asked and answered such as \"If visual percepts \"A',B',C' \" are correlates of physical objects \"A,B,C,\" and if \"C\" lies between \"A\" and \"B\", does \"C' \" lie between \"A' \" and \"B' \"?\" In this manner, the possibility of visual space being metrical can be approached. If the exercise is successful, a great deal can be said about the nature of the mapping of the physical space on the visual space.\n\nOn the basis of fragmentary psychophysical data of previous generations, Luneburg concluded that visual space was hyperbolic with constant curvature, meaning that elements can be moved throughout the space without changing shape. One of Luneburg's major arguments is that, in accord with a common observation, the transformation involving hyperbolic space renders infinity into a dome (the sky). The Luneburg proposition gave rise to discussions and attempts at corroborating experiments, which on the whole did not favor it.\n\nBasic to the problem, and underestimated by Luneburg the mathematician, is the likely success of a mathematically viable formulation of the relationship between objects in physical space and percepts in visual space. Any scientific investigation of visual space is colored by the kind of access we have to it, and the precision, repeatability and generality of measurements. Insightful questions can be asked about the mapping of visual space to object space but answers are mostly limited in the range of their validity. If the physical setting that satisfies the criterion of, say, apparent parallelism varies from observer to observer, or from day to day, or from context to context, so does the geometrical nature of, and hence mathematical formulation for, visual space.\n\nAll these arguments notwithstanding, there is a major concordance between the locations of items in object space and their correlates in visual space. It is adequately veridical for us to navigate very effectively in the world, deviations from such a situation are sufficiently notable to warrant special consideration. visual space agnosia is a recognized neurological condition, and the many common distortions, called geometrical-optical illusions, are widely demonstrated but of minor consequence.\n\nIts founder, Gustav Theodor Fechner defined the mission of the discipline of psychophysics as the functional relationship between the mental and material worlds—in this particular case, the visual and object spaces—but he acknowledged an intermediate step, which has since blossomed into the major enterprise of modern neuroscience. In distinguishing between \"inner\" and \"outer\" psychophysics, Fechner recognized that a physical stimulus generates a percept by way of an effect on the organism's sensory and nervous systems. Hence, without denying that its essence is the arc between object and percept, the inquiry can concern itself with the neural substrate of visual space.\n\nTwo major concepts dating back to the middle of the 19th century set the parameters of the discussion here. Johannes Müller emphasized that what matters in a neural path is the connection it makes, and Hermann Lotze, from psychological considerations, enunciated the principle of local sign. Put together in modern neuroanatomical terms they mean that a nerve fiber from a fixed retinal location instructs its target neurons in the brain about the presence of a stimulus in the location in the eye's visual field that is imaged there. The orderly array of retinal locations is preserved in the passage from the retina to the brain, and provides what is aptly called a \"retinotopic\" mapping in the primary visual cortex. Thus in the first instance brain activity retains the relative spatial ordering of the objects and lays the foundations for a neural substrate of visual space. Unfortunately, as is so common in brain studies, simplicity and transparency ends here. Right at the outset, visual signals are analyzed not only for their position, but also, separately in parallel channels, for many other attributes such as brightness, color, orientation, depth. No single neuron or even neuronal center or circuit represents both the nature of a target feature and its accurate location. The unitary mapping of object space into the coherent visual space without internal contradictions or inconsistencies that we as observer automatically experience, demands concepts of conjoint activity in several parts of the nervous system that is at present beyond the reach of neurophysiological research.\n\nThough the details of the process by which the experience of visual space emerges remain opaque, a startling finding gives hope for future insights. Neural units have been demonstrated in the brain structure called hippocampus that show activity only when the animal is in a specific place in its environment.\n\nOnly on an astronomical scale are physical space and its contents interdependent, This major proposition of the general theory of relativity is of no concern in vision. For us, distances in object space are independent of the nature of the objects.\n\nBut this is not so simple in visual space. At a minim an observer judges the relative location of a few light points in an otherwise dark visual field, a simplistic extension from object space that enabled Luneburg to make some statements about the geometry of visual space. In a more richly textured visual world, the various visual percepts carry with them prior perceptual associations which often affect their relative spatial disposition. Identical separations in physical space can look quite different (\"are quite different\" in visual space) depending on the features that demarcate them. This is particularly so in the depth dimension because the apparatus by which values in the third visual dimension are assigned is fundamentally different from that for the height and width of objects.\n\nEven in monocular vision, which physiologically has only two dimensions, cues of size, perspective, relative motion etc. are used to assign depth differences to percepts. Looked at as a mathematical/geometrical problem, expanding a 2-dimensional object manifold into a 3-dimensional visual world is \"ill-posed,\" i.e., not capable of a rational solution, but is accomplished quite effectively by the human observer.\n\nThe problem becomes less ill-posed when binocular vision allows actual determination of relative depth by stereoscopy, but its linkage to the evaluation of distance in the other two dimensions is uncertain (see: stereoscopic depth rendition). Hence, the uncomplicated three-dimensional visual space of every-day experience is the product of many perceptual and cognitive layers superimposed on the physiological representation of the physical world of objects.\n"}

Ruth Montgomery popularized the concept in her 1979 book, \"Strangers Among Us\".\n\nBelievers maintain that it is possible for the original soul of a human to leave a person's body and for another soul to \"walk in\". Souls are said to \"walk-in\" during a period of intense personal problems on the part of the departing soul, or during or because of an accident or trauma. The individual retains the memories of the original personality, but their personality and abilities change and become oriented towards helping humanity. Incarnating into a fully grown body allows the more advanced soul to carry out its mission without having to go through the two decades of maturation that humans need to reach adulthood.\n\nThe film \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" and the 1978 remake \"Heaven Can Wait\" portrays one soul replacing a recently deceased man's soul and reviving and inhabiting his body. \n\nThe \"Hawkgirl\" comics, the \"K-PAX\" series of books and film, and the \"Twilight Zone\" episode \"The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank\" have all featured situations similar or identical to walk-in experiences, although the term \"walk-in\" is not used.\n\nIn the \"Death of Superman\" story cycle, a handful of new superheroes appeared, among them John Henry Irons, who called himself the \"Man of Steel\". He never claimed to be the real Superman, but Lois Lane speculated that if Superman were really dead, perhaps his soul had moved into Irons' body as a walk-in, and she used that word.\n\n\"The X-Files\" episode \"Red Museum\" discusses walk-ins, described by Mulder as enlightened spirits who have taken possession of the bodies of people who have lost hope and who want to leave their life. The concept is returned to in the episode \"Closure\". \n\nIn the TV series \"Ghost Whisperer\", the season 4 episode \"Threshold\" used the term \"step-in\" when the soul of one of the series' main characters, who had died in the previous episode, enters the body of a man who dies in an unrelated accident.\n\nStephen King speaks of \"walk-ins\" several times in books 6 and 7 of \"The Dark Tower\" novels, but King's walk-ins are usually physical travellers, or - when they possess another's body - are more guests, sharing the body with the original mind as strangers. John Callum mentions them in \"\". The term is also used in the CODA section of this book.\n\n"}

The function that this gift is given varies. Some Christians see in this gift a prophetic-like function. Others see in the word of wisdom a teaching function. This gift is closely related with the gift of the word of knowledge.\n\nCommentators have often placed this gift within the larger context of the biblical wisdom tradition, especially references to God’s secret wisdom in 1 Corinthians 2:6-10 and elsewhere in the letter. The secret wisdom pertains to the Gospel that Paul preached. This wisdom relates to that which God had previously hidden and destined for the glory of believers. It is a wisdom that speaks of those things that God has prepared for those who love him. These emphases from the broader context of the Corinthian letter could imply that the word of wisdom involves insight into God's plan of salvation and the proclamation of Christ crucified.\n\nCommentators have noted both a prophetic and a teaching character to the word of wisdom. Among Pentecostals and charismatics, the gift is often defined as a revelation of the Holy Spirit that applies scriptural wisdom to a specific situation that a Christian community faces. According to Pentecostal theologian Donald Gee, \"One is deeply conscious that the supremely right thing has been said and the true course of action indicated. No further appeal is desired because the heart rests in a calm satisfaction that the will of God has been revealed\". \n\nSome commentators translate the term as \"teaching of wisdom\" and prefer to focus on the gift's function in teaching the truths of scripture. \"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" defines it as \"the grace of propounding the Faith effectively, of bringing home to the minds and hearts of the listener with Divine persuasiveness, the hidden mysteries and the moral precepts of Christianity\".
