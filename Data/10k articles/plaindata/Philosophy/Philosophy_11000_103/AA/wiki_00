The programs' aims are to \"improve drinking water quality through innovative research, knowledge transfer, open source engineering and design of sustainable, replicable water treatment systems.\" AguaClara plants are unique among municipal-scale facilities in that they have no electrical or complex mechanical components and instead operate through hydraulic processes driven by gravity.\n\nThe AguaClara program provides undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to enhance their education through hands-on experience working on projects with real applications. In 2012, the National Academy of Engineering showcased AguaClara as one of the 29 engineering program at US colleges that effectively incorporates real world experiences in their curriculum.\n\nAguaClara is partnered with Agua para el Pueblo (Water for People), a NGO working in Honduras who manages the construction and technical support for AguaClara plants.\n\nAguaClara was formed in 2005 by Cornell University professor Monroe Weber-Shirk, who volunteered in Central American refugee camps during the 1980s. Weber-Shirk used the connections he developed through his volunteer work to partner with Jacabo Nuñez, the director of Agua para el Pueblo to find the answer to a crucial question: What can we do to treat the dirty water that we are providing to rural communities?\n\nIn 2005, he founded the AguaClara program to address the need for sustainable municipal scale water treatment in resource poor communities. The first AguaClara plant was built in 2006 in Ojojona to serve a population of 2000 people. Currently, there are 8 AguaClara designed plants throughout Honduras serving over 30,000 people.\n\nAguaClara has developed an automated design tool that allows interested parties to input basic design parameters such as flow rate into a simple frontend and receive customized designs via email in five minutes or less. The user frontend communicates with the AguaClara server to populate MathCad scripts that calculate design parameters for input into AutoCAD scripts, which produce the final design. The design algorithms can be continuously improved and any changes will be immediately implemented the next time a design is requested.\n\nThe AguaClara design tool applies an economy of scale to water treatment design, in that there are almost no marginal costs to produce an additional design. This is significant considering that the World Health Organization estimates the global unmet demand for improved water at approximately 844 million people, including 100 million using surface water sources that would be viable for treatment with AguaClara technology. From the AguaClara website:\n\nAguaClara designs gravity-powered water treatment plants that require no electricity and are constructed by its implementation partners. The plants use hydraulic flocculators and high-flow vertical-flow sedimentation tanks to remove turbidity from surface waters.\n\nLa 34, or \"La treinta y quatro,\" once a numbered plantation run by United Fruit, is the first site of an AguaClara plant. Construction on the La 34 plant began in December 2004 and was inaugurated in August 2005. The plant serves a population of 2000 with a design flow of 285 LPM.\n\nMarcala The Marcala plant began in the Fall of 2007 and was completed in June 2008. The plant was upgraded in May 2011 to a flow rate of 3200 LPM.\n\nCuatro Comunidades In the Fall of 2008, the AguaClara team designed a water treatment plant with shallower tanks that doesn't need an elevated platform for the plant operator. The full scale pilot facility for this new design was built for the four communities of Los Bayos, Rio Frio, Aldea Bonito and Las Jaguas. Construction was completed in March 2009.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jacob Vernes wrote a History of Geneva, which remained in manuscript form.\nHe published several books on Christianity and Deism.\n\nRoustan exchanged many letters with Rousseau between 1757 and 1767.\nIn his first letter of March 1757 he compared Rousseau to Socrates. Rousseau praised him in return, but, although polite about the poetry he had sent, advised him against seeking a career as a man of letters.\nRoustan wrote to Rousseau after reading \"Julie, or the New Heloise\" (1761) saying that although he found the novel delightful, he was concerned that it was immoral in describing adulterous love so vividly and in describing hope as the only reason to believe in Christianity.\nHe visited Rousseau in Môtiers in 1762 and welcomed in him in London in 1766, but retained his views on the compatibility between Christianity and patriotism.\n\nFour of his works — \"Défense du christianisme considéré du côté politique\", wherein he refuted some of Rousseau's arguments from \"On the Social Contract\"; \"Discours sur les moyens de réformer les mœurs\"; \"Examen des quatre beaux siècles de Voltaire\"; and \"Dialogue entre Brutus et César aux Champs Élysées\" — were collected and published in 1764 under the title \"Offrande aux autels et à la patrie\".\nThe rebuttal in \"Défense du Christianisme ou réfutation du chapitre VIII du Contrat Social\" is friendly, and in fact Rousseau approved of his work and helped him with finding a publisher. In it Roustan implied that Rousseau may not himself have believed in his stated view that the scriptures preach servitude and resignation, and went on to say that doing good works was an integral part of the religion, including fighting for freedom and against tyranny. He therefore felt that Christianity and Republicanism or patriotism were fully compatible.\n\nIn 1776 Roustan published a rebuttal to Rousseau's \"Profession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar\" in \"\".\nHis \"Examen critique de la seconde partie de la \"profession de foi du Vicaire Savoyard\"\" was one of the main reasons that Rousseau was mocked by Voltaire in Voltaire's \"Remontrances des pasteurs du Gévaudan\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49246", "title": "Biological determinism", "text": "Biological determinism\n\nBiological determinism, also known as genetic determinism or genetic reductionism, is the belief that human behaviour is controlled by an individual's genes or some component of their physiology, generally at the expense of the role of the environment, whether in embryonic development or in learning. It has been associated with movements in science and society including eugenics, scientific racism, the debate around the heritability of IQ, the biological basis for gender roles, and the sociobiology debate.\n\nIn 1892 August Weismann proposed in his germ plasm theory that heritable information is transmitted only via germ cells, which he thought contained determinants (genes). Francis Galton, supposing that undesirable traits such as club foot and criminality were inherited, advocated eugenics, aiming to prevent supposedly defective people from breeding. Samuel George Morton and Paul Broca attempted to relate the cranial capacity (internal skull volume) to skin colour, intending to show that white people were superior. Other workers such as H. H. Goddard, and Robert Yerkes attempted to measure people's intelligence and to show that the resulting scores were heritable, again to demonstrate the supposed superiority of people with white skin.\n\nGalton popularized the phrase nature and nurture, later often used to characterize the heated debate over whether genes or the environment determined human behavior. Scientists such as ecologists and behavioural geneticists now see it as obvious that both factors are essential, and that they are intertwined.\n\nLate in the 20th century, the determinism of gender roles was debated by geneticists and others. Biologists such as John Money and Anke Ehrhardt attempted to describe femininity and homosexuality according to then-current social standards; against this, the evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin and others argued that clothing and other preferences vary in different societies. The biologist E. O. Wilson founded the discipline of sociobiology, founded on observations of animals such as social insects, controversially suggesting that its explanations of social behaviour might apply to humans.\n\nBiological determinism is the belief that a human’s behavior is controlled by an person’s genes and inherited traits. It dates back to the 1800s. Stephen Jay Gould has spent his career tracing the roots of this “western” thought because it is more involved than anyone could have assumed. Gould suggests that the main theories of biological determinism are based on bad biology and bad use of the scientific method. When a scientist says they used the scientific method to gather their data, the readers automatically assume that the information given must be correct. \nGould presents three key ideas that have influenced biological determinism. The first is that measurement and quantification have changed science over the past century and without context, these measurements are useless. If something is assigned a number, then it must be real, true, and scientific. If these numbers and measurements are given without context, then the data can be given many different meanings. The second is that reinfication, the idea that certain qualities (intelligence, race) are valid because we put a name on it. One could separate a group into different components and give a name to these divided groups and have it be true, but actually, there is nothing scientific about intelligence being used as a unitary quality. The third problem is that the main thought behind biological determinism is that traits are inherited. Scientists have traced certain traits through families lines and found that some are inherited. Gould suggests that these studies merely restate the original assumption. Gould points out that various theories of biological determinism have no evidence or science to back them up, and even though these ideas are very flawed, people still widely accept them. \nHowever, Gould is thought to be flawed in his own way because readers believe he is simply disregarding certain aspects of science. Gould questions that since the scientific aspects of the works themselves are so flawed that why is it so widespread accepted. Gould suggests that there could be some social, political, and economic forces which could explain why these biological determinism theories are so widely accepted, but he fails to go further deep into the topic. Gould shows that these biological determinism theories have many consequences for human life and scientists in the future can see these and use his book to continue trying to show the people that biological determinism, is in fact, false. \nIn this review of Gould’s essay by Garland E. Allen, Allen writes that Gould has helped future scientists examine social, economic, and political values of this time regarding biological determinism. Biological determinism is still prominent in scientific works, past and present, that have been regarded by the public as true and believable. Gould wants his readers to understand that biological determinism has roots all throughout science, even though it has been proven false. .\n\nIn 1892, the Austrian biologist August Weismann proposed that multicellular organisms consist of two separate types of cell: somatic cells, which carry out the body's ordinary functions, and germ cells, which transmit heritable information. He called the material that carried the information, now identified as DNA, the germ plasm, and individual components of it, now called genes, determinants. Weismann argued that there is a one-way transfer of information from the germ cells to somatic cells, so that nothing acquired by the body during an organism's life can affect the germ plasm and the next generation. This effectively denied that Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics) was a possible mechanism of evolution. The modern equivalent of the theory, expressed at molecular rather than cellular level, is the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nEarly ideas of biological determinism centred on the inheritance of undesirable traits, whether physical such as club foot or cleft palate, or psychological such as alcoholism, bipolar disorder and criminality. The belief that such traits were inherited led to the desire to solve the problem with the eugenics movement, led by a follower of Darwin, Francis Galton (1822–1911), by forcibly reducing breeding by supposedly defective people. By the 1920s, many U.S. states brought in laws permitting the compulsory sterilization of people considered genetically unfit, including inmates of prisons and psychiatric hospitals. This was followed by similar laws in Germany, and throughout the Western world, in the 1930s.\n\nUnder the influence of determinist beliefs, the American craniologist Samuel George Morton (1799–1851), and later the French anthropologist Paul Broca (1824–1880), attempted to measure the cranial capacities (internal skull volumes) of people of different skin colours, intending to show that whites were superior to the rest, with larger brains. All the supposed proofs from such studies were invalidated by methodological flaws. The results were used to justify slavery, and to oppose women's suffrage.\n\nAlfred Binet (1857–1911) designed tests specifically to measure performance, not innate ability. From the late 19th century, the American school, led by researchers such as H. H. Goddard (1866–1957), Lewis Terman (1877–1956), and Robert Yerkes (1876–1956), transformed these tests into tools for measuring inherited mental ability. They attempted to measure people's intelligence with IQ tests, to demonstrate that the resulting scores were heritable, and so to conclude that people with white skin were superior to the rest. It proved impossible to design culture-independent tests and to carry out testing in a fair way given that people came from different backgrounds, or were newly arrived immigrants, or were illiterate. The results were used to oppose immigration of people from southern and eastern Europe to America.\n\nLynda Birke argues in her 1992 book \"In Pursuit of Difference\" that biology explains sexual differences by the mechanisms of chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance. However, hormonal differences are not absolute, and people can be born with intersex characteristics, for example as a genetic mosaic. Homosexuality can be attributed to both biological and social causes. Dean Hamer has studied the so-called \"gay gene\". The neuroscientist Simon LeVay in 1991 studied the difference in hypothalamic structures between homosexual and heterosexual men, finding that the INAH-3 suggested a partial cause for homosexuality.\nRichard Lewontin, Steven Rose, and Leon Kamin's book \"Not in Our Genes\" discussed a study of girls who were relatively \"masculinized\". The biologists John Money and Anke Ehrhardt looked for ways to describe femininity that fitted their own social standards, such as clothing preference or using makeup. The experiment, in Lewontin's words, \"ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves.\" Gender differences in work are becoming less pronounced, suggesting that these are imposed by society. In contrast, the standard model of sex and gender indicates a clear-cut dichotomy between males and females, with no overlap, a cultural model followed by professionals such as doctors when they deal with gender assignment.\n\n<div>Sociobiology emerged with E. O. Wilson's 1975 book \"\". The existence of a putative altruism gene is debated. The evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton proposed \"genes underlying altruism\" in 1964. The biologist Graham J. Thompson and colleagues identified the genes OXTR, CD38, COMT, DRD4, DRD5, IGF2, GABRB2 as candidates \"affecting altruism\". The geneticist Steve Jones argues that altruistic behaviour like \"loving our neighbour\" is built into the human genome, with the proviso that neighbour means member of \"our tribe\", someone who shares many genes with the altruist, and that the behaviour can thus be explained by kin selection. Evolutionary biologists such as Jones have argued that genes that did not lead to selfish behaviour would die out compared to genes that did, because the selfish genes would favour themselves. However, the mathematician George Constable and colleagues have argued that altruism can be an evolutionarily stable strategy, making organisms better able to survive random catastrophes.\n\nThe belief in biological determinism has been matched by a blank slate denial of any possible influence of genes on human behavior, leading to a long and heated debate about \"nature and nurture\". By the 21st century, many scientists had come to feel that the dichotomy made no sense. They noted that genes were expressed within an environment, in particular that of prenatal development, and that genes were continuously controlled by the environment through mechanisms such as epigenetics.\n"}

{"id": "633037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=633037", "title": "Conceptualism", "text": "Conceptualism\n\nIn metaphysics, conceptualism is a theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind. Intermediate between nominalism and realism, the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them. Conceptualism is anti-realist about abstract objects, just like immanent realism is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).\n\nThe evolution of late scholastic terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective universality was distinctly defined as conceptualism.\n\nPeter Abélard was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things. William of Ockham was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no \"fundamentum\" outside the mind.\n\nIn the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the Jesuits: Hurtado de Mendoza, Rodrigo de Arriaga and Francisco Oviedo are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of Francisco Suárez, the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the early modern philosophy.\n\nConceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the early modern thinkers, including René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, George Berkeley, and David Hume – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.\n\nSometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of Immanuel Kant, who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our \"a priori\" mental structures and functions.\n\nIn late modern philosophy, conceptualist views were held by G. W. F. Hegel.\n\nEdmund Husserl's philosophy of mathematics has been construed as a form of conceptualism.\n\nConceptualist realism (a view put forward by David Wiggins in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.\n\nThough separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of \"Mind and World\" by John McDowell in 1994. McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that Wilfrid Sellars provided for what he called the \"Myth of the Given\"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data. Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for perceptual conceptualism, according to which perceptual content is conceptual \"from the ground up\", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's philosophy of justification is considered a form of foundationalism: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.\n\nA clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:\n\nI have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.\n\nMcDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not \"given\" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.\n\nThe application of the term \"perceptual conceptualism\" to Kant's philosophy of perception is debatable. Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed perceptual non-conceptualism.\n\n"}
{"id": "12782915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12782915", "title": "Deity yoga", "text": "Deity yoga\n\nDeity yoga (Tibetan: \"lha'i rnal 'byor\"; Sanskrit: \"Devata-yoga\") is a practice of Vajrayana Buddhism involving identification with a chosen deity through visualisations and rituals, and the realisation of emptiness. According to the Tibetan scholar Tsongkhapa, deity yoga is what separates Buddhist Tantra practice from the practice of other Buddhist schools.\n\nDeity yoga involves two stages, the generation stage and the completion stage. In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one's chosen deity (yidam), its mandala and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality. In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization of sunyata or emptiness. Completion stage practices can also include subtle body energy practices.\n\nThe purpose of Deity yoga is to bring the meditator to the realization that the yidam or meditation deity and the practitioner are in essence the same, that they are non-dual (\"advaya\"). According to John Powers. \"Deity yoga is a technique for becoming progressively more familiar with the thoughts and deeds of a buddha, until the state of buddhahood is actualized through repeated practice.\" \n\nAccording to Gyatrul Rinpoche, the point of this practice is to \"understand your buddha nature, which is the very essence of your being\" and is \"intrinsically present\" in all beings. The fact that the deity is a reflection of qualities already inherent in the practitioner is what makes this practice different than mere deluded or wishful thinking. \n\nThe yidam generally appears in a mandala and the practitioner visualizes himself or herself and their environment as the yidam and mandala of their Deity Yoga practice. This visualization method undermines a habitual belief that views of reality and self are solid and fixed, enabling the practitioner to purify spiritual obscurations (Sanskrit: \"klesha\") and to practice compassion and wisdom simultaneously:\nRepresentations of the deity, such as a statues, paintings (Tibetan: \"thangka\"), or mandalas, are often employed as an aid to visualization in both the Generation Stage (Tibetan: \"Kye-rim\") and the Completion Stage (Tibetan: \"Dzog-rim\") of Anuttarayoga Tantra. The mandalas are symbolic representations of sacred enclosures, sacred architecture that house and contain the uncontainable essence of a yidam. In the book, \"The World of Tibetan Buddhism\", the Dalai Lama describes a mandala: “This is the celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity.”\n\nIn the Vajrayāna Buddhism of Tibet and East Asia, which follow the Nālandā Tradition of India-Tibet-China, there are fifteen major tantric \"sādhanās\", each connected with a specific yidam:\n\n\nAll of these are available in Tibetan form, many are available in Chinese, and some are still extant in ancient Sanskrit manuscripts.\n\nMandalas are used as an aid in realizing the inner ground:\nIn Tantric Buddhism, the generation stage (T:\"kye rim, Wyl., bskyed rim\"; S:\"utpatti-krama\") is the first phase of Deity yoga. It is associated with the 'Father Tantra' (Wylie: \"pha-rgyud\"; \"pa-rgyud\") class of \"anuttara-yoga-tantras\" of the Sarmapa or associated with what is known as Mahayoga Tantras by the Nyingmapa. An example of a 'Father Tantra' is the \"Guhyasamāja Tantra\".\n\nThe generation stage engages creative imagination or visualization as an \"upaya\" or skillful means of personal transformation through which the practitioner (sadhaka) either visualizes a meditational deity (\"yidam\") or refuge tree before themselves in \"front generation\", or as themselves in \"self generation\", to engender an alteration to their perception and/or experience of the appearance aspect of reality. One practices oneself in the identification with the meditational Buddha or deity (\"yidam\") by visualisations, until one can meditate single-pointedly on \"being\" the deity.\n\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, throughout the various stages of visualization one is to maintain the cognition of emptiness and \"one trains in [causing] everything to appear as like illusions\". Reginald Ray writes that during the process of yidam visualization, the deity is to be imaged as not solid or tangible, as \"empty yet apparent\", with the character of a mirage or a rainbow.\n\nIn the \"generation stage\" of Deity Yoga, the practitioner visualizes the \"Four Purities\" (Tibetan: \"yongs su dag pa bzhi\"; \"yongs dag bzhi\") which define the principal Tantric methodology of Deity Yoga that distinguishes it from the rest of Buddhism:\n\nFront generation is a form of meditative visualization employed in Tantric Buddhism in which the \"yidam\" is visualized as being present in the sky facing the practitioner as opposed to the self-identification that occurs in self generation. According to the Vajrayana tradition, this approach is considered less advanced, hence safer for the \"sadhaka\", and is engaged more for the rites of propitiation and worship.\n\nSelf generation is a form of meditative visualization employed in Tantric Buddhism in which the \"yidam\" is invoked and then merged with the \"sadhaka\" as an \"upaya\" of self-transformation. This is as opposed to the method of front generation. According to the Vajrayana tradition, self generation is held to be more advanced and accompanied by a degree of spiritual risk from the \"siddhi\" it may rapidly yield.\n\nAn important element of this is \"divine pride\", which is \"the thought that one is oneself the deity being visualized.\" According to John Powers, \"divine pride is different from ordinary, afflicted pride because it is motivated by compassion for others and is based on an understanding of emptiness. The deity and oneself are both known to be empty, all appearances are viewed as manifestations of the luminous and empty nature of mind, and so the divine pride of deity yoga does not lead to attachment, greed, and other afflictions.\"\n\nThe completion stage (Tibetan:\"dzok-rim, (Wyl: rdzogs rim)\"; Sanskrit:\"saṃpanna-krama\") is the second stage of deity yoga. Completion stage may also be translated as \"perfection stage\" or \"fulfillment mode.\" In the completion stage one engages in practices associated with the subtle body energies and dissolves the deity into \"sunyata\".\n\nThe practitioner can use either the \"path of method (thabs lam)\" or the \"path of liberation ('grol lam)\". At the path of method the practitioner engages in subtle body energy practices. These involve the subtle energy system of energy channels (\"rtsa\"), winds or currents (\"rlung\"), and drops or charged particles (\"thig le\") which are said to converge at certain points along the spinal column called chakras. The \"wind energy\" is directed and dissolved into the heart chakra, where-after the Mahamudra remains, and the practitioner is physically and mentally transformed. At the path of liberation the practitioner applies mindfulness, a preparatory practice for Mahamudra or Dzogchen, to realize the inherent emptiness of every-'thing' that exists.\n\nJake Dalton uses the terms \"practices with signs\" (\"mtshan bcas\") and practices without signs\" (\"mtshan med\"). The \"practices with signs\" are \"channels and winds\" (\"rtsa lung\") practices, while in the practices without signs \"the enlightened view is accomplished instantaneously, without any effort.\"\n\nThe completion stage employs the \"mystic vortices\" of the body, the \"cakra\", the subtle energy of the subtle body, the five \"pranas\" or \"vāyu\", together with the channels, the \"nadi\" through which the energy flows in order to generate the 'great bliss' (Tibetan: \"Dem Chog\" or \"bde-mchog\"; Sanskrit: \"Maha-sukha\") associated with \"bodhi\" or enlightenment. According to Keith Dowman,\nAccording to Berzin,\nThe completion stage is defined differently in various strands on Vajrayana practice:\nAccording to Keith Dowman,\n\n"}

After studying mathematics and logic at the University of Neuchâtel (Switzerland) and Bowling Green University (Ohio, United States), Denis Miéville developed an interest in the development and formalization of natural logic that led him to study both the theory of collective classes and the foundations of maximal predicates in propositional logic. These interests were integrated in the doctoral thesis that he defended in 1984 (\"A Development of Stanislaw Lesniewski's logical systems: Protothetic, ontology and mereology\") at the University of Neuchâtel, supervised by the eminent logician Jean-Blaise Grize. Appointed Professor at the University of Neuchâtel in 1987 (he will become its rector from 1999 to 2003), he taught logic and chaired the Semiologic Research Centre.\n\nProfessor Miéville has taught at various institutions such as the University of Geneva, the University of Rennes in France and the University of Iasi in Romania. The University of Iasi awarded him a degree Honoris causa in 2003. He also received the Honorary Certificate of the Francophony in 2001.\n\nProfessor Miéville developed an expertise on Lesniewski's logic due to his interest in developmental systems, that have the advantage of being dynamic, universal, free and of a higher order. Moreover, by developing a theory of syntactic-semantic categories, he focussed on a methodology able to identify logico-discursive indices in texts, by representing them as argumentative and reasoned structures.His interests became more and more inclined towards understanding the way in which discursive thought creates meaning, by inscribing it into reasoning networks. This is one of the reasons that led Professor Miéville to specifically examine the discursive procedures from which new knowledge is developed, such as those proceeding by analogy, and those structuring creative definitions. Very sensitive to the epistemological dimension of knowledge, he has been interested in how concepts develop gradually and crystallize into stable entities.\n\n\n\n"}

It was believed that England belonged in some special way to Mary, who was seen as the country's \"protectress\" and who through her powers of intercession acted as the country's defender or guardian. According to the short film \"Saint Edmund Arrowsmith\" by the company known as Mary's Dowry Productions, this title in reference to England first appeared in 1051. Though the title's precise origin is unknown, it had become widespread by the middle of the fourteenth century, and around the year 1350 a mendicant preacher stated in a sermon that \"it is commonly said that the land of England is the Virgin's dowry\". Around fifty years later, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, discussing Mary and the Incarnation, wrote that \"we English, being ... her own Dowry, as we are commonly called, ought to surpass others in the fervour of our praises and devotions\". By the reign of Henry V, the title \"dos Mariae\", \"dowry of Mary\", was being applied to England in Latin texts and according to chronicler Thomas Elmham, English priests sought the intercession of \"the Virgin, protectress of her dower\" on the eve of the Battle of Agincourt.\n\nThe Wilton Diptych, completed around 1395, depicts Richard II kneeling before the Virgin and Child. Carried by a nearby angel is the Cross of St George, the staff of which is surmounted by an orb featuring a minuscule map of England. An altarpiece from the same era showed Richard handing the orb to Mary, with the inscription \"Dos tua Virgo pia haec est\", \"This is thy dowry, O Holy Virgin\".\n\nIn the wake of the English Reformation, the notion of England enjoying a special association or relationship with Mary became an important aspect of recusant Catholic spirituality. The residents at English College in Valladolid, Spain owned a painting which depicted Mary being handed a scroll carrying the words \"We will remain under the shade of your wings till the wickedness passes\" by a group of kneeling Jesuits. The painting's superscription read \"Anglia dos Mariae\", \"England, Mary's dowry\". At a college in Seville it was reported that students had raised a painting of Mary carrying the superscription \"Anglia Dos Mariae. England is the Dowry of Our Lady\".\n\nPope Leo XIII referred to England's association with the title in 1893. Addressing a group of Catholic pilgrims from England in Rome, he spoke of \"the wonderful filial love which burnt within the heart of your forefathers towards the great Mother of God ... to whose service they consecrated themselves with such abundant proofs of devotion, that the kingdom itself acquired the singular and highly honourable title of 'Mary's Dowry.'\"\n\n"}

Mitchell (1838–1920) was an American philosopher, educator and education reformer. She was one of the first women to be appointed lecturer in a university, in addition to writing philosophy, literature and literary criticism.\n\nEllen M. Smith was born in the Village of Geddes, New York to Harriet H. Rowland and Edwin R. Smith, the eldest of their four children. She graduated from the Cortland Academy, Homer, N.Y. in 1860, with a major in Classics. Ellen, also, taught school in Syracuse. During the Civil War her brother, Edwin R. Smith, Jr., served in New York's 149th Regiment. Edwin was killed in the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863. He was initially reported severely wounded; the family tried to determine whether the Confederates had captured him and treated him in the Confederate field hospital at Ellwood Manor. However, Edwin was lost without a trace. Ellen adopted the nom de plume \"Ella Ellwood\" in identification with Edwin, writing with the name Ellwood during the war. Following Edwin's death, Ellen resigned her teaching position in Syracuse and moved to Cairo, Illinois, where she lived with her uncle, Ward L. Smith and his wife, Anna.\n\nDuring the war, Ellen moved to St. Louis, Missouri. She wrote for the Missouri Republican newspaper of St. Louis, continuing to use the nom de plume Ella Ellwood until the war's end. She married St. Louis attorney and Union civil war veteran Joseph W. Mitchell in the Presbyterian Church of Alton, Illinois in 1867. While in St. Louis, she attended the Hegelian philosophy lectures which had been organized there by William T. Harris. She and Joseph also contributed to a literary and philosophical discussion group called \"The Pen & Pencil Club,\" often hosting the meetings in their home. \nEllen and Joseph moved to Denver, Colorado in 1878, seeking effective treatment for Joseph's illness (possibly tuberculosis). However, Joseph died in February, 1879. Ellen remained in Denver, where she taught school and, then, lectured on philosophy and literature in the University of Denver. Also, she actively contributed to the Kant Club, and to the Fortnightly Club, of Denver.\n\nEllen M. Mitchell attended the first session, in July 1879, of the Concord Summer School of Philosophy, which was hosted in Concord, Mass. by Bronson Alcott on his property. William T. Harris organized the school and its programs after leaving St. Louis, with the intention of unifying the Hegelian Idealism of the St. Louis Philosophical Society with the Transcendentalism of Concord. At that first 1879 session, Ellen became acquainted with many women from across the country who were leading the struggle for women's suffrage, as well as the efforts to improve educational and social policy standards. Among those she met while attending the 1879 Concord session was Julia Ward Howe who, later, became the president of the Association for the Advancement of Women. The Concord School played an important role in helping to build networks of policy reformers; more than one half of those who attended were women. Mrs. Mitchell participated in the annual Concord School of Philosophy every year, until its final session in 1888. She wrote, in 1880, a description of the lectures during the previous session, and she delivered a paper titled \"Friendship in Aristotle's Ethics\" during the Concord session of July, 1887.\n\nMitchell actively contributed to the Association for the Advancement of Women, regularly attending the annual congresses. At the 12th Woman's Congress in 1884, held at Baltimore, she delivered a paper titled \"A Study of Hegel.\" By the A.A.W.'s 13th Congress, held at Des Moines, Iowa, she was Vice Pres. of the A.A.W. for Colorado. At that same 13th Annual Congress, Prof. Maria Mitchell, of New York, and Ellen M. Mitchell, of Chicago (Mrs. Francis Mitchell) also were serving the A.A.W. as V.P.'s for the states of New York and Illinois, respectively. At the A.A.W.'s 18th Women's Congress, at Toronto in 1890, Mitchell delivered a paper titled, \"The Dramas of Henrik Ibsen.\" Continuing as V. P. of the A.A.W. for Colorado, she was \"Chairman\" of the A.A.W.'s Committee for Topics and Papers. For the A.A.W.'s 19th Woman's Congress in 1891, at Grand Rapids, Mich., she continued serving as V.P. for Colorado, as the Chair of the Topics & Papers Committee, and she delivered a paper titled \"The Real and the Ideal in Art.\"\n\nThroughout her career, Mitchell advocated, and endeavored to realize, the noble aspiration for American philosophy which was advocated by Walt Whitman in his great poetic essay manifesto of 1871, \"Democratic Vistas\". \n\nAfter 1893, she permanently returned to Geddes (by then a part of Syracuse) to care for her parents. In Syracuse, she organized and led the Round-Table of Syracuse, a literary and philosophical community adult seminar group. The Round Table began in 1894 and continued for more than 20 years. To assist the participants in their studies and discussions, Mitchell wrote and privately published a series of essays on Dante, Tennyson, and Goethe. The title for one of the essays, \"The Way of the Soul\" is adapted from Hegel's introduction to his Phenomenology of Spirit. In her introduction to the essay, she wrote:\n\nEllen M. Mitchell died in Syracuse, N.Y. May 14, 1920 at the age of 81, three months before the 19th amendment to the constitution was ratified, finally establishing universal suffrage. She is interred beside her parents in the Myrtle Hill Cemetery of the Village of Geddes.\n\nIn her obituary, May 16, 1920, the Syracuse Herald newspaper commented: \"The Herald records with sincere regret the death of Mrs. Ellen M. Mitchell, for many years the gentle preceptor and oracle of the Syracuse Round Table. The value of her services to the literary life of the city cannot easily be overestimated...Mrs. Mitchell's personality was singularly lovable, and it imparted a magnetic charm to her discourse and her teaching. On its intellectual side the City of Syracuse is much the poorer by her death.\"\n\n\"A Study of Greek Philosophy\", Mitchell's book length philosophical discussion, was published in 1891 by S.C.Griggs & Co. The book contains 36 chapter essays, chronologically presenting the development of the classical Greek tradition in philosophy, extending from the pre-Socratics to the neo-Platonists. Her book is the first book length philosophical analysis to have been written in America by a woman scholar. It guides university students, philosophy specialists, educators, and adult scholars through a program of study of the ancient Greek tradition in philosophy. The book is, also, the first book to preserve the legacy of ancient Greek philosophy in the New World.\n\nIn her introduction to her book, Mitchell wrote:\n\nReviews of the book were offered by prominent scholars and thought leaders when it was published in 1891:\n\nWilliam R. Alger, in his introduction to the book wrote, in part:\n\nEllen Mitchell focused her writings on the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, political ethics, transcendentalism, and Phidias and Plato. While lecturing at the Denver University she was one of the first to introduce women to idealist thought, the other being Marietta Kies.\n\nIn “The Philosophy of Pessimism” she was one of the philosophers who resisted philosophical systems that grew out of the skeptical tradition. They were not interested in determining what is not true, possible, or real. She only believed in positive theories that relied on what God created, like nature rather than based on human reason and judgment, it was based on the God-given world. Mitchell was part of the idealist philosophers.\n\nOne of her larger successes was “A Study of Hegel.” This seventeen page article did not discuss Hegel’s theories in detail. It does discuss important issues for women; nature, art, and religion. There is a paragraph in the article that distorts Hegel’s thought by using her own thoughts;\n\nThis conflicts with Hegel’s belief as the mind must not be said to stand apart from the world as Mitchell here implies. This paragraph starts the same as Hegel's belief of communicating with the world through senses, but it changes to hers about how to gain the power of knowledge is through using these senses to your individual experiences in life. This shows that she did not always just state other philosopher beliefs, but also had her own philosophies. When it came to the person and society Mitchell said that someone being away from social order is impossible. She states that “social institutions play a critical role in individual self-determination\", meaning that in order to rise above, an individual must become a part of society to be able to rise above it.\n\nIn her book \"A study of Greek Philosophy\" she claims the object of knowledge in philosophy is the human spirit itself, and truth is a living process which develops and advances in the civilizing course of humanity. Later in the book it reveals that we gain self-knowledge as we gain more experiences in life that affects our knowledge and become who we are.\n\n The St. Louis Years\n\n\n"}

He entered the university of Leyden as a medical student and graduated there as doctor of medicine 3 July 1628. His younger brother Arnold Boate (1606–1653) followed him to study medicine in Leiden. Both moved to London around 1630, where their family had settled earlier. Gerard became employed as physician to Charles I of England and Arnold as physician to the Earl of Leicester. In 1631 in London Gerard married Catharina Menning (or Manning) with whom he had three children.\n\nBoate became a contributor to the fund under the English act of parliament of 1642, which admitted the Dutch to subscribe money for the reduction of the Irish, to be subsequently repaid by grant of forfeited lands in Ireland. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians 6 November 1646. In April 1649 the appointment of Boate as doctor to the hospital at Dublin was referred by the council of state in London to Oliver Cromwell, who had just been appointed commander-in-chief for Ireland. The treasurer-at-war in the following September paid Boate fifty pounds, as physician for Ireland.\n\nBoate arrived in Ireland at the latter end of 1649, while Cromwell was in command there, but he survived only a short time. He died in January 1650. In repayment of Boate's contributions, his widow Katherine Boate, obtained, under certificate dated 15 November 1667, over one thousand acres of land in Tipperary. Among their descendants was the High Court judge Godfrey Boate, who is chiefly remembered for the mocking elegy on his death by Jonathan Swift. The Boate lands passed by inheritance to the Hemsworth family.\n\nIn 1630 he published a book styled ‘Horæ Jucundæ.’ With his brother Arnold, he produced a treatise on philosophy, \"Philosophia Naturalis Reformata\", published in 1641.\n\nTo support the interest of adventurers subscribing for potential Irish lands, he undertook the compilation of a work to supply information on Irish produce. Boate himself had never visited Ireland; but materials for his work were furnished by his brother Arnold and by some of the English who had been expelled by the Irish rebellion of 1641. Boate started the ‘Natural History’ early in 1645 and completed it within the year, but its publication was deferred.\n\nBoate's papers and his ‘Natural History’ left behind him in London came into the hands of Samuel Hartlib. With the assent of Arnold Boate, then in Paris, the ‘Natural History’ was published at London in 1652 by Hartlib, with a dedication to Oliver Cromwell and Charles Fleetwood, commander-in-chief in Ireland. In his dedication, Hartlib observed:\n\nI lookt also somewhat upon the hopefull appearance of replanting Ireland shortly, not only by the adventurers, but happily by the calling in of exiled Bohemians and other Protestants also, and happily by the invitation of some well affected out of the Low Countries, which to advance are thoughts suitable to your noble genius, and to further the settlement thereof, the Natural History of that countrie will not be unfit, but very subservient.\n\nThe ‘Natural History’ is divided into twenty-four chapters. In a letter, dated Paris, 10 August, prefixed to the volume and addressed to Hartlib, Arnold Boate stated that his brother had contemplated three more books on the plants, ‘living creatures,’ and natives of Ireland respectively. A French version, under the title of ‘Histoire Naturelle d'Irlande,’ was published at Paris in 1666. A quarto edition of the ‘Natural History’ by Boate was published at Dublin in 1726, and reissued there in 1755. It was again published in the first volume of a ‘Collection of Tracts and Treatises illustrative of the Natural History, Antiquities, and Political and Social State of Ireland,’ Dublin, 1860.\n\n\n\n"}

The family also included two other brothers, Georges, who would become a lawyer like his father and go onto great success as a member of the Grand Conseil in Paris, and Guillaume, who became a priest and served in the court of the King of France. He began his formal studies at Caen, moving to Paris in 1642. Du Hamel demonstrated an early aptitude for scholarly work, and at the age of eighteen published an explanation of the work of Theodosius of Bithynia called \"Sphériques de Théodose\", to which he added a treatise on trigonometry. He also showed an interest in a religious career, entering the Congregation of the Oratory in 1643, choosing them over other sects due to their focus on service and scholarship. He then moved to Angers to teach philosophy, and was formally ordained a priest while there in 1649. While in Angers, he not only focused his attention on theology, but also on the study of mathematics, astronomy, and science. He was then transferred back to Paris as an instructor at an Oratorian school on the Rue Saint Honoré. It is while in Paris that he published two of his works, the \"Astronomia Physica\" and \"De Meteoris et Fossibilus\" in 1660, both of which analyze and compare ancient theories with Cartesianism. This combination of theoretical and scientific analysis made many of Du Hamel's contemporaries see him and his work as a link between theology and the new ideas of science.\n\nHis return to Paris coincided with the end of the Fronde rebellion in 1652. This timing proved fortuitous for Du Hamel, as his absence from the capital meant he was not tainted by political leanings or participation in the rebellion. He also became reacquainted with his brother George, who, as a prominent attorney and member of the Grand Conseil, introduced him to some powerful patrons, including Hardouin de Péréfixe, a former tutor of Louis XIV and Archbishop of Paris, as well as the prominent Barberini family. Du Hamel leaves the Oratorians in 1653, but is then put in charge of the parish of Neuilly-sur-Marne. Resigning this position in 1663, he became chancellor of the church of Bayeux. At the same time, he is also busy in his study of natural philosophy and science, writing one of his most famous works, \"De Consensu Veteris er Novae Philosophiae\", in 1663. By now, Du Hamel is a well-known and well-respected scholar with books on theological and philosophical issue that gained attention in the learned community, and with the help of his brother, and possibly his patron Péréfixe, Du Hamel comes to the attention of Jean-Baptiste Colbert as a potential secretary for the new Académie des Sciences. Du Hamel possesses many qualities that Colbert was looking for in a secretary for the group: he could read and write well in Latin, which would allow for communication with other scholars in Europe, he had recently published well-received works, he did not have any residual political alliance from the Fronte rebellions, and he had not participated in the handful of private academies that preceded the founding of the Académie des Sciences. When Colbert founds the Académie of Sciences in 1666, he appointed Du Hamel its first secretary.\n\nInitially, Du Hamel handled the traditional work of a secretary; he recorded the minutes of the meetings, and assisted in the leadership of the group. One of his first duties was a trip to Caen to visit the Académie de Physique, formed there in 1662 by Pierre-Daniel Huet and André Graindorge. Here, he observed the operation of the group, and, when the Académie des Sciences is officially founded at the end of 1666, establishes a relationship between the two groups, which will become more formal after the Académie de Physique follows the Académie des Science as the second scientific group to receive royal recognition. In addition, it is Du Hamel, through his writings, which influence the social perception of the organization. In 1678 he publishes a new, four volume work \"Philosophia Vetus et Nova\" (originally attributed to Colbert, but written by Du Hamel), a new version of his \"De Consensu Veteris er Novae Philosophiae\" that was created to be used in universities and other schools to discuss and attempt to reconcile the various schools of philosophy, both ancient and modern. It was considered one of the most influential books in France at the time. Du Hamel also attributed the theories espoused by the book as representative of the ideas of the Academie, rather than just his own, allowing the Académie and its principals to touch students and promote and popularized science in the educated parts of French society.\n\nHowever, Du Hamel’s influence would not be felt as strongly as he (and others) may have wished, with some scholars attributing this to his religious influences, and others to his attention to other work. Specifically, his sterling reputation and his command of Latin caused him to be appointed as a member of the French delegation at Aix-la-Chapelle, negotiating a peace with Spain after the War of Devolution. In addition, he was later sent to England to assist a French diplomat, and while there, met with Robert Boyle, Henry Oldenburg, and other members of the Royal Society.\n\nThis extended absence from the Académie undermined Du Hamel’s influence on the group. While away, Jean Gallois had been acting as secretary, but didn’t command the same respect and admiration from the other members In addition, even upon returning to Paris, Du Hamel does not immediately reengage with the Académie, leaving the business affairs of the group in disorder, with no minutes recorded for the group from 1670–1674. Du Hamel also began to devote himself more reverently to his religious work, stepping back from scientific studies, except for his continued efforts toward writing and publishing a history of the Académie (in Latin). His commitment to writing and publishing in Latin also causes him some difficulty within the Académie, as many of the newer members prefer to write and publish in French. He completed his history of the group (\"Regiae Scientiarum Academiae Historia\") in 1698, shortly after being replaced as secretary by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle. The reorganization of the Académie in 1699 had little or no effect on Du Hamel, with the changes to the organization in many ways anathema to his own interests and values. By 1700 as his scientific work was minimal, and his increasing attention directed toward the church and religion. Du Hamel died on August 6, 1706 in Paris.\n\nDu Hamel’s legacy is mixed. He is best remembered as the first secretary of the Académie des Sciences, but exerted little or no influence over administrative and organizational matters, the traditional role of the secretary. Instead, it is Du Hamel’s scholarly work, both in his analysis of the competing philosophies of the ancient and new science, as well as his role in disseminating the values and beliefs of the Académie to students and scholars that prove to be the most influential on the history of the science in France.\n\nAmong du Hamel's prolific publications were the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1698971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1698971", "title": "John Chilembwe", "text": "John Chilembwe\n\nReverend John Chilembwe (1871 – February 3, 1915) was a Baptist pastor and educator, who trained as a minister in the United States, returning to Nyasaland in 1901. He was an early figure in the resistance to colonialism in Nyasaland (Malawi), opposing both the treatment of Africans working in agriculture on European-owned plantations and the colonial government's failure to promote the social and political advancement of Africans. \n\nSoon after the outbreak of the First World War, Chilembwe organised an unsuccessful uprising against colonial rule. Today, Chilembwe is celebrated as a hero of independence, and John Chilembwe Day is observed annually on January 15 in Malawi.\n\nThere is limited information about John Chilembwe's parentage and birth. An American pamphlet of 1914 claimed that John Chilembwe was born in Sangano, Chiradzulu District, in the south of what became Nyasaland, in June 1871. Joseph Booth also stated that Chilembwe's father was a Yao and his mother a Mang'anja slave, captured in warfare. This information was contemporary; in the 1990s, John Chilembwe's granddaughter stated that Chilembwe's father may have been called Kaundama, and was one of those who settled at Mangoche Hill during the Yao infiltration into Mang'anja territory, and that his mother may have been called Nyangu: his likely pre-baptismal name was Nkologo. However, other also quite recent sources give differing parental names. Chilembwe attended a Church of Scotland mission from around 1890.\n\nIn 1892 he became a house servant of Joseph Booth, a radical and independent-minded missionary. Booth had arrived in Africa in 1892 as a Baptist to establish the Zambezi Industrial Mission near Blantyre. Booth was critical of the reluctance of Scottish Presbyterian missions to admit Africans as full church members, and later founded seven more independent missions in Nyasaland which, like the Zambezi Industrial Mission, focused on the equality of all worshippers. In Booth's household and mission where he was closely associated with Booth, Chilembwe became acquainted with Booth's radical religious ideas and egalitarian feelings.\n\nBooth left Nyasaland with Chilembwe in 1897; he returned to Nyasaland alone in 1899 but left permanently in 1902, although he continued to correspond with Chilembwe. After 1906, Booth was strongly influenced by Millennialism, but the extent to which he retained influence over Chilembwe after 1902 or influenced him towards millennial beliefs is disputed, although Booth later strongly influenced Elliot Kenan Kamwana, the first leader of the Watchtower followers of Charles Taze Russell in Nyasaland.\n\nIn 1897 Booth and Chilembwe traveled together to the United States. Because of the difficulties the two encountered when traveling together in the United States, Booth introduced Chilembwe to the Rev. Dr. Lewis G Gordon, Foreign Missions Secretary of the National Baptist Convention, who arranged for the latter to attend the Virginia Theological Seminary and College, (now Virginia University of Lynchburg), a small Baptist institution at Lynchburg, Virginia where he almost certainly studied African-American history. \n\nThe principal was a militantly independent Negro, Gregory Hayes and Chilembwe both experienced the contemporary prejudice against negroes and was exposed to radical American Negro ideas and the works of John Brown, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass and others. He was ordained as a Baptist minister at Lynchburg in 1899. After completing his studies at Lynchburg in 1900, he returned to Nyasaland in 1900 with the blessing of the Foreign Missions Board and financial assistance from the National Baptist Convention.\n\nFor the first 12 years of his ministry after his return to Nyasaland, Chilembwe encouraged African self-respect and advancement through education, hard work and personal responsibility, as advocated by Booker T. Washington, His activities were initially supported by white Protestant missionaries, although his relations with Catholic missions were less friendly. After 1912, Chilembwe developed closer contacts with local independent African churches, including Seventh Day Baptist and Churches of Christ congregations, with the aim of uniting some or all of these African churches with his own mission church at the centre. Some of Chilembwe's congregation had formerly been Watchtower followers and he maintained contact with Elliot Kamwana, but the influence of Watchtower's millennial beliefs on him is minimised by most authors except the Lindens. Although the vast majority of those found guilty of rebellion and sentenced to death or to long terms of imprisonment were members of Chilembwe's church, a few other members of the Churches of Christ in Zomba were also found guilty.\n\nIn 1900 Chilembwe returned to Nyasaland, in his own words, \"to labour amongst his benighted race\". Backed financially the National Baptist Convention of America who also provided two American Baptist helpers until 1906, Chilembwe started his Providence Industrial Mission (P.I.M.) in Chiradzulu district. In its first decade, the mission developed slowly, assisted by regular small donations from his American backers, and Chilembwe founded several schools, which by 1912 had 1,000 pupils and 800 adult students.\n\nHe preached the values of hard-work, self-respect and self-help to his congregation and, although as early as 1905 he used his church position to deplore the condition of Africans in the protectorate, he initially avoided specific criticism of the government that might be thought subversive. However, by 1912 or 1913, Chilembwe had become more politically militant and openly voiced criticism over the state of African land rights in the Shire Highlands and of the conditions of labour tenants there, particularly on the A. L. Bruce Estates.\n\nIt has also been claimed that Chilembwe preached a form of Millenarianism and that this may have influenced his decision to initiate an armed uprising in 1915. There is very little direct evidence of what Chilembwe did preach although, at least in his first decade in Nyasaland, his main message was of African advancement through Christianity and hard work. The evidence that has been interpreted as showing his millenarian views is dated from 1914 onward, when he began baptizing many new church members without their first receiving instruction, as was normal Baptist practice. However this evidence is ambiguous, and Chilembwe's activities have been more closely related to the Ethiopian movement of African churches breaking away, often with black American backing, from the more orthodox but European controlled Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist or other denominations, than being under the influence of overtly millenarian groups such as the Seventh day Adventists.\n\nIn the Shire Highlands, the most densely populated part of the protectorate, European estates occupied about 867,000 acres, or over 350,000 hectares, almost half of the best arable land. Relatively few local Africans remained on the estates when the owners introduced labour rents, preferring to settle on Crown Land where customary law entitled them to use (sometimes overcrowded) land belonging to the community, or to become migrant workers. However, planters with large areas of available land but limited labour could engage migrants from Mozambique (who had no right to use community lands) on terms that Nyasaland Africans found unacceptable. These were called \"Anguru\", a convenient term employed by Europeans to describe as a number of different peoples, mostly speaking one of the Makua languages, often the Lomwe language, who themselves used various names to refer to their places of origin in Mozambique. They left Mozambique in significant numbers from 1899 when a harsh new labour code was introduced, and especially in 1912 and 1913 after a Mozambique famine in 1912. In 1912, the British Colonial Office described them as working for such low wages as were “a record for any settled part of Africa”. Many of those convicted after the rising were identified as \"Anguru\".\n\nConditions on the estates where the \"Anguru\" became tenants were generally poor, and Africans both on estates and Crown Lands were subjected to an increase in Hut tax in 1912, despite food shortages. Chilembwe's Providence Industrial Mission was situated in an area dominated by the A. L. Bruce Estates, named after a son-in-law of David Livingstone. From 1906, A. L. Bruce Estates developed and started to plant a hardy variety of cotton suitable for the Shire Highlands. Cotton required intensive labour over a long growing period, and the estate manager William Jervis Livingstone (reputed to be a distant relative of David Livingstone) ensured that 5,000 workers were available throughout its 5 or 6 months by exploiting the obligations of the labour tenancy system called thangata, underpaying wage labour and by often violent coercion. Alexander Livingstone Bruce, who controlled the A. L. Bruce Estates operations, instructed Livingstone\nnot to allow any mission work to be carried on or schools to be opened on the Bruce Estates, although the company provided free medical and hospital treatment for workers.\n\nAlexander Livingstone Bruce held the considered view that educated Africans had no place in colonial society and he opposed their education. He also recorded his personal dislike for Chilembwe as an educated African, and considered all African-led churches were centres for agitation, and prohibited building them on the estate. Although this prohibition applied to all missions, Chilembwe's was the closest; it became a natural focus for African agitation, and Chilembwe became the spokesman for African tenants on the Bruce Estates. Chilembwe provoked confrontation by erecting churches on estate land, which Livingstone burned down because he considered them as centres for agitation against the management and because they made potential claims on estate land.\n\nChilembwe was angered by Livingstone's refusal to accept the worth of African people, and also frustrated by the refusal of the settlers and government to provide suitable opportunities or a political voice to the African \"new men\", who had been educated by the Presbyterian and other missions in Nyasaland or in some cases had received a higher education abroad. A number of such men became Chilembwe's lieutenants in the rising.\n\nAlthough in his first decade at P.I.M., Chilembwe had been reasonably successful, in the five years before his death, he faced a series of problems in the mission and in his personal life. From around 1910, he incurred several debts at a time when mission expenses were rising and funds from his American backers were drying up. Attacks of asthma, the death of a daughter, and his declining eyesight and general health may have deepened his sense of alienation and desperation.\n\nThe sources cited above agree that, after 1912 or 1913 the series of social and personal issues mentioned increased Chilembwe's bitterness toward Europeans in Nyasaland, and moved him towards thoughts of revolt. However, they treat the outbreak and effects of the First World War as the key factor in moving him from thought to planning to take action, which he believed it was his destiny to lead, for the deliverance of his people. In the course of this war, some 19,000 Nyasaland Africans served in the King's African Rifles, and up to 200,000 others were forced to be porters for varying periods, mostly in the East African Campaign against the Germans in Tanganyika, and disease caused many casualties among them. \n\nOne of the earliest campaigns, a German invasion of Nyasaland and a battle at Karonga in September 1914 caused Chilembwe to write an impassioned letter against the war to the \"Nyasaland Times\" newspaper, saying that a number of his countrymen, \"have already shed their blood\", others were being \"crippled for life\" and \"invited to die for a cause which is not theirs\". The war-time censor prevented publication of the letter, and by December 1914, Chilembwe was regarded with suspicion by the colonial authorities.\n\nThe Governor decided to deport Chilembwe and some of his followers, and approached the Mauritius government asking them to accept the deportees a few days before the rising started. The censoring of Chilembwe's letter appears to be the trigger moving him to an actual conspiracy. He began organising a rebellion, gathering together a small group of Africans, educated either at the Blantyre Mission or the schools of the independent, separatist African churches in the Shire Highlands and Ncheu District, as his lieutenants. In a series of meetings held in December 1914 and early January 1915, Chilembwe and his leading followers aimed at attacking British rule and supplanting it, if possible. However, it is possible that he learnt of his intended deportation, and was forced to bring forward the date of his revolt, making the prospects of its success more unlikely, and turning it into a symbolic gesture of protest. When he brought forward the date of the Shire Highlands rising, Chilembwe was unable to ensure that it could still be coordinated with the planned rising in the Ntcheu District, which was therefore largely abortive. The failure in Ncheu District may also relate to the pacifism of many Seventh Day Baptist and Watchtower followers who were expected to rise there.\n\nThe aims of the rising remain unclear, partly because Chilembwe and many of his leading supporters were killed, and also because many documents were destroyed in a fire in 1919. However, use of the theme of \"Africa for the Africans\" suggests a political motive rather than a purely millennial religious one. Chilembwe is said to have drawn parallels between his rising and that of John Brown, and stated his wish to \"strike a blow and die\" immediately before the rising started. However, this is based solely on what George Simeon Mwase, who was absent from Nyasaland in 1915, wrote 17 years after the event. Mwase claimed the phrase, “…strike a blow and die…” was said by Chilembwe several times, but it is not recorded elsewhere, and it conflicts with the actual course of the uprising, where several of the chosen leaders stayed home and many followers fled once troops appeared.\n\nThe first part of Chilembwe's plan was to attack European centres in the Shire Highlands on the night between 23 and 24 January 1915, to obtain arms and ammunition, and the second was to attack European estates in the same area simultaneously. Most of Chilembwe's force of about 200 men were from his P.I.M congregations in Chiradzulu and Mulanje, with some support from other independent African churches in the Shire Highlands. In the third part of the plan, the forces of the Ncheu revolt based on the local independent Seventh Day Baptists would move south to link up with Chilembwe. He hoped that discontented Africans on European estates, relatives of soldiers killed in the war and others would join as the rising progressed. \n\nIt is uncertain if Chilembwe had definite plans in the event of failure; some suggest he intended to seek a symbolic death, others that he planned to escape to Mozambique. The first and third parts of the plan failed almost completely: some of his lieutenants did not carry out their attacks, so few arms were obtained, the Ncheu group had failed to form and move south, and there was no mass support for the rising.\n\nThe attack on European estates was largely one on the Bruce estates, where William Jervis Livingstone was killed and beheaded and two other European employees killed. Three African men were also killed by the rebels; a European-run mission was set on fire, and a missionary was severely wounded and an African girl died in the fire. Apart from this girl, all the dead and injured were men, as Chilembwe had ordered that women should not be harmed. On 24 January, a Sunday, Chilembwe conducted a service in the P.I.M. church next to a pole impaling Livingstone's head, but by 26 January he realised that the uprising had failed to gain local support. After avoiding attempts to capture him and apparently trying to escape into Mozambique, he was tracked down and killed on 3 February.\n\nMost of Chilembwe's leading followers and some other participants in the rising were executed after summary trials under Martial law shortly after it failed. The total number of those killed is unclear, because extrajudicial killings were carried out by European members of the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve.\n\nA Commission of Enquiry into Chilembwe’s uprising was appointed and, at its hearings in June 1915, the European planters blamed missionary activities while European missionaries emphasised the dangers of the teaching and preaching by independent African churches like those led by Chilembwe. Several Africans who gave evidence complained about the treatment of workers on estates, but were largely ignored. The official enquiry needed to find causes for the rising and it blamed Chilembwe for his mixture of political and religious teaching, but also the unsatisfactory conditions on the A L Bruce Estates and the unduly harsh regime of W J Livingstone. The enquiry heard that the conditions imposed on the A L Bruce Estates were illegal and oppressive, including paying workers poorly or in kind (not in cash), demanding excessive labour from tenants or not recording the work they did, and whipping and beating both workers and tenants. The abuses were confirmed by Magomero workers and tenants questioned by the Commission in 1915.\n\nLivingstone alone was blamed for these unsatisfactory conditions, and the resident director of the A L Bruce Estates, Alexander Livingstone Bruce, who had absolute control over estate policy and considered that educated Africans had no place in colonial society, escaped censure. The concept that the only appropriate relationship between Europeans and Africans was that of master and servant was at the heart of colonial society, led by the landowners. This concept may have been what Chilembwe aimed to fight against with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why he turned to violent action, although see also for an alternate viewpoint.\n\nNyasaland gained independence in 1964, taking the name Malawi. Chilembwe's likeness was seen on the obverse of all Malawian kwacha notes from 1997 until May 2012, when new notes were launched; the 500 Kwacha note still carries his portrait. Since December 2016, the newly introduced 2000 Kwacha note also carries his picture. John Chilembwe Day is observed annually on January 15 in Malawi.\n\n"}

For example, a lawyer may commit malpractice by:\n\nMalpractice may also occur as the result of a breach of the contract pursuant to which the client is represented by the attorney.\n\nUnder U.S. law, in order to rise to an actionable level of negligence (an actual breach of a legal duty of care), the injured party must show that the attorney's acts were not merely the result of poor strategy, but that they were the result of errors that no reasonably prudent attorney would make. While the elements of a cause of action for legal malpractice may vary by state, under typical state law the four elements of legal malpractice are:\n\nTo satisfy the third element, legal malpractice requires proof of what would have happened had the attorney not been negligent; that is, \"but for\" the attorney's negligence (\"but for\" causation). If the same result would have occurred without negligence by the attorney, no cause of action will be permitted. \"But for\" or actual causation can be difficult to prove. If the malpractice alleged occurred in litigation, the legal malpractice case may result in a \"trial-within-a-trial\" which delves into the facts of the case for which the client originally retained the attorney.\n\nIn at least 11 jurisdictions, a person convicted of a crime who then sues his defense attorney must first prove that he was factually \"innocent\" (in other words, he must first petition for and obtain exoneration from the court that originally convicted him before filing suit) and that he was convicted only because of his attorney's negligence. A plaintiff who has lost a civil case must prove that the legal malpractice complained of caused the case to be lost, so that the plaintiff can then recover from the negligent attorney the damages that would have been owed by the underlying defendant.\n\nSome jurisdictions have reject or limit application of the actual innocence element of the exoneration rule, meaning that a criminal defendant may pursue a legal malpractice claim against his counsel without first having to prove actual innocence or obtain post-conviction relief.\n\nThe rule may be held inapplicable where the question of guilt is irrelevant to the alleged malpractice. For example, in Iowa, a defendant who receives inadequate representation at sentencing was allowed to pursue a malpractice claim without also challenging the underlying conviction. In Kansas, a legal malpractice action was allowed when brought by defendant who was not claiming innocence but was instead asserting that an error by criminal defense counsel cost him the opportunity for a more favorable plea bargain.\n\nIowa and Kansas have held that proof of innocence is not a separate element of a legal malpractice claim against a criminal defense lawyer, but is instead a factor that a jury may consider when applying the standard elements of legal malpractice.\n\nThe Idaho Supreme Court found that to require a defendant to show actual innocence in order to proceed with a legal malpractice claim against a criminal defense lawyer would conflict with the presumption of innocence a defendant is to enjoy at trial, disregards harm that may result to a client other than being convicted, and potentially allow a defense lawyer to shirk duties to a client the lawyer knows to be guilty.\n\n"}

Spann grew up in Altmannsdorf, a suburban area of Vienna, Austria which is 15 minutes outside of the central city. Spann attended a \"Bürgerschule\" (citizen school) and graduated in 1898. After that he studied philosophy in Vienna, followed by Political Sciences in Zürich, Bern, and Tübingen. He received his doctorate in Political Science in 1903.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1907, Spann worked for the \"Center for Private Welfare Service\" in Frankfurt am Main. He was responsible for empirical studies of this population of workers. By the end of 1904 Spann, along with Hermann Beck and Hanns Dorn founded a newspaper called \"Critical Pages for the whole Social Sciences.\"\n\nIn 1907, Spann wrote his \"Habilitation in Political Economy\" for the Hochschule in Brünn. From 1907 to 1909 he was given the position of \"privatdozent\" which allowed him to teach and collect fees from students. As early as 1908 Spann began working as the full-time imperial-royal vice-secretary of the statistic central commission in Vienna. He was given the position of creating a new census for Austria between 1909 and 1910.\n\nFrom 1914 to 1918, during the First World War, Spann was a first lieutenant of the reserve. He was hurt during a conflict in Lemberg, Ukraine on 27 August 1914. When he recovered he was first a commander of a company of Russian prisoners and then until later in 1918 he was given a position on the \"scientific committee for wartime economy\" with the war Ministry in Vienna.\n\nIn 1919, Spann was appointed to a position at the University of Vienna, where he taught until 1938.\n\nSpann was popular with students, not only for his lectures which would spill out into the hallways at the University, but also for mid-summer festivals which he would hold in the woods where he would teach that \"the ability to intuit essences was nurtured by jumping over the fire...\" (Caldwell 2004, 138-9)\n\nRepeatedly, Spann tried to draw the ruling powers' attention to his authoritarian theory of a corporate state, which he thought be introduced immediately for the benefit of all. In 1928. he joined the Militant League for German Culture. Around 1930, he also joined the Nazi Party.\n\n\nAlthough to a large degree in tune with the \"Zeitgeist\", he repeatedly met with disapproval until, in 1938, right after the \"Anschluss\", he was briefly imprisoned by the Nazis and eventually barred from his professorship at the University of Vienna, which he had held since 1919. Living as a recluse till the end of the war, Spann tried to get his university post back in 1945, aged 67. However, he was not allowed to resume his teaching and died in 1950, disappointed and embittered.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56564828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56564828", "title": "Pashtun Tahafuz Movement", "text": "Pashtun Tahafuz Movement\n\nThe Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (, ; abbreviated PTM), or the Pashtun Protection Movement, is a social movement for Pashtun human rights, based in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, Pakistan. It originally started in May 2014 as the Mahsud Tahafuz Movement as an initiative for removing landmines from Waziristan (especially Mahsud land) and other parts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas, affected by the war in North-West Pakistan. \n\nThe movement rose to prominence in January 2018 when it began a justice movement for Naqeebullah Mehsud, who was killed extrajudicially during a police encounter in Karachi that same month. After gaining popularity among the Pashtuns in January, its name was changed from the \"Mahsud Tahafuz Movement\" to the \"Pashtun Tahafuz Movement\" (Pashtun Protection Movement). The movement is led by Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen, a human rights activist from South Waziristan.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement organized a protest march starting from Dera Ismail Khan, passing through Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Domel, Karak, Kohat, and Darra Adam Khel, and reaching Peshawar on January 28. Then after passing through Charsadda, Mardan, Swabi, and Tarnol, the march reached Islamabad, where a sit-in called \"All Pashtun National Jirga\" was organized from February 1. The jirga condemned the murder of the Pashtun shopkeeper Naqeebullah Mehsud who was shot dead by police force in Karachi during an encounter, and the alleged state oppression against the Pashtuns. It asked the government to set up a judicial inquiry for Naqeebullah Mehsud, as well as for all the other Pashtuns murdered extrajudicially in police encounters. The jirga demanded to stop racial profiling of the Pashtuns in Pakistan, and to bring the Pashtun missing persons before the court of law, so that those who are innocent but held could be freed. The jirga also demanded Pakistan Army to guarantee that they will not abduct or open fire on innocents in the tribal areas, or use violence or collective punishment against entire villages and tribes, and that they will not impose the frequent curfews on the movement of locals even after minor incidents. Another demand was to remove all landminess planted in the tribal areas, which have resulted in many civilian casualties. The protesters said that since 2009, more than 35 people including children had been killed due to landmines in South Waziristan alone. \n\nThe sit-in in Islamabad ended on February 10, but the organizers of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement announced that they would reconvene the protest if their demands were not fulfilled by the government. Advisor to Prime Minister on political affairs, Engr. Amir Muqam appeared in front of the protesters with the hand-written agreement from the Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi that included three clauses, agreeing to apprehend Rao Anwar, speed-up the clearing of Mines in South Waziristan, an intermediate college establishment in name of Naqeebullah Mehsud, and promised to addressed \"genuine gravencies\" raised by Jirga members. Muqam also told the protestors, “the way you held the peaceful protest is really commendable and others should learn a lesson to record their protests this way. I’ll stand by you in trying times and you can come to discuss with me all of your legitimate issues anytime.”\n\nFrom March 9 to 11, 2018, PTM organized a protest march from Dera Ismail Khan to Quetta, passing through Drazinda, Zhob, Killa Saifullah, and Khanozai. After reaching Quetta, a grand public gathering was organized at Sadiq Shaheed Stadium, Quetta. Representatives of various political parties addressed the gathering. The speakers said: “We demand constitutionally sanctioned rights in the country for Pashtuns.” Manzoor Pashteen expressed his regret about the failure of Pakistan's law enforcement agencies despite the promise by the government to arrest Rao Anwar, who was involved in the alleged encounter killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud. Pashteen said at the gathering: “We had set one month deadline to certain quarters to apprehend Rao Anwar which expired but no action has been taken by the government.”\n\nThere was a grand gathering of PTM in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on April 8, 2018. About 60,000 people came to the gathering to participate in the protest. Many of the protesters held photographs of their missing relatives, containing captions with names and the dates they disappeared. The main demands of PTM during the gathering were as follows:\n\nThe first PTM's public gathering in Punjab province was held on 22 April at historical Mochi Gate, Lahore. This gathering was hosted by Lahore Left Front (LLF). In May 2018, LLF was formed by 17 left wing parties whose objective was to revive Left-wing politics in country and counter prevailing religious fundamentalism. The objectives of this gathering was to inform Punjab people about Pushtuns ordeal in war-hit areas of country and uniting exploited masses of Punjab and Pushtuns - as well highlighting woes of ordinary Pushtun workers in Lahore. Just one day before gathering, Lahore district administration rejected permission to hold gathering and arrested its leading activists including Ali Wazir, Bilawal Mandokhel, Muzammil and Ismat Shahjahan. This act of administration was sharply criticized by public as well as notable politicians of country like Maryam Nawaz, Pervaiz Rasheed and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.\n\nDespite of all hurdles, Lahore public gathering was held as per plan. In this rally, PTM leaders asserted their demands and announced future rallies in Karachi & Swat. Two days after this successful gathering, Corps Commander Peshawar Lt General Nazir Ahmed declared that PTM demands are genuine and military is ready for talks. According to media reports, military had formed a committee to talk to PTM leaders and discuss their demands.\n\nThere was a grand gathering of PTM in Swat District at Kabal ground near Mingora, on 29th April 2018, which was attended by more than 10,000 people. The attendees were mostly relatives of alleged missing persons in recent times. Speaking with gathering, Manzoor Pashteen said,“We are demanding our legal rights within the domain of the Constitution but who will seek accountability from those who violated Article 6 of the Constitution of Pakistan.”\n\nPashteen criticized Pervez Musharraf for his alleged terrorism, and demanded for Musharraf and the spokesperson of the Taliban Ehsanullah Ehsan to be punished.\n\nThe Karachi gathering was held on 13 May 2018 at the ground near Al-Asif Square in Sohrab Goth, Karachi. Bagh-e-Jinnah was the initially planned venue but the authorities didn't permit it. Before the event, three separate criminal cases were registered against PTM at different police stations in Karachi for hate and anti-state speeches. PTM activists accused authorities of sabotaging their event by initiating a wave of mass arrests and detentions.\n\nOne day before the event, Manzoor Pashteen was barred from boarding his scheduled flight to Karachi from Islamabad International Airport. He was told that his ticket had been cancelled and was not allowed to board the plane. He and his friends then drove for five hours to Lahore, and bought another plane ticket to fly from Lahore Airport. However, their ticket was again cancelled and they were forced to take a road trip to reach Karachi. During the road trip, he was stopped and searched 23 times by the authorities, which made his journey over 40 hours. He reached the gathering venue in Karachi hours after his scheduled arrival time, and addressed the awaiting crowd. At the gathering, he denounced extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in Karachi and all across Pakistan, and also reiterated the main demands of PTM.\n\nThere was a grand gathering of PTM in Bannu, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on 28 October 2018, which was attended by more than 60,000 people. It was one of the largest public gatherings in the history of Bannu. The attendees included relatives of alleged missing persons in recent times. Speaking with the gathering, Manzoor Pashteen said:“We are demanding our legal rights within the domain of the Constitution but who will seek accountability from those who violated Article 6 of the Constitution of Pakistan.”\n\nPakistan's mainstream television channels and media outlets are not reporting and covering the activities of the PTM. Their only medium to interact with the rest of Pakistan and to keep them updated is through social media. This further strengthens their narrative of being sidelined and ignored by the system.\n\nOn March 23, the PTM meeting was scheduled to be held in Peshawar University, but Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Islam Zeb, issued an order under section 144 CrPC, imposing ban on political meetings in University and satted any violation against the order shall be preceded against u/s 188 PPC and order will be exercised \"for 30 days unless modified or withdrawn.\" Later the meeting was held in Baghi-e-Naran, Hayatabad with 200 person attending the gathering.\n\nThe movement's anthem is “Da Sanga Azadi Da?”, which means “What kind of freedom is this?”. Many Pashtun's have discovered their voice with this anthem and it encloses the various grievances they have from being caught between the militants and the military.\n\nDuring the campaign to inform people about the 12 August 2018 gathering in Swabi, one day before the event, Manzoor Pashteen was denied entry into the mausoleum of Captain Karnal Sher Khan by Karnal Sher Khan's brother Anwar Sher Khan. Anwar said he denied Pashteen entry into the mausoleum out of respect for the Pakistan Army.\n\nThe Pashteen hat (also known as the Mazari hat) has become the most iconic symbol of the PTM, as Manzoor Pashteen regularly wears it at public rallies and events.\n\nDue to PTM's outspoken criticism of Pakistan Army, the Pakistan Army has claimed that PTM is backed by foreign powers and that their gatherings are engineered. Consequently, news organizations in Pakistan have been pressured to ignore PTM, and university professors have been forced to identify the students attending PTM's protest gatherings. Some Pakistani politicians also view PTM as working on a foreign agenda. However, PTM's leadership has openly declared that they are loyal to Pakistan and want their demands to be resolved within the Constitution of Pakistan.\n\n"}

{"id": "191987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191987", "title": "Retributive justice", "text": "Retributive justice\n\nRetributive justice is a theory of justice that holds that the best response to a crime is a punishment proportional to the offense, inflicted because the offender deserves the punishment. Prevention of future crimes (deterrence) or rehabilitation of the offender are not considered in determining such punishments. The theory holds that when an offender breaks the law, justice requires that he or she suffer in return. Retribution is different from revenge because retributive justice is only directed at wrongs, has inherent limits, is not personal, involves no pleasure at the suffering of others and employs procedural standards. Classical texts advocating the retributive view include \"De Legibus\" (1st century BC), Kant's \"Science of Right\" (1790), and Hegel's \"Philosophy\" \"of Right\" (1821).\n\nThe concept is found in most world cultures and in many ancient texts. The presence of retributive justice in ancient Jewish culture is shown by its inclusion in the law of Moses, which includes the punishments of \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\". Very similar phrasing is found in the Code of Hammurabi. Documents assert similar values in other cultures. However, the judgment of whether a punishment is appropriately severe can vary greatly across cultures and individuals.\n\nOne purpose of official retribution is to channel the retributive sentiments of the public into the political and legal systems, so that people do not resort to lynchings, blood feuds, and other ugly forms of vigilante self-help. Another purpose is to promote societal solidarity through participation in the act of punishing, under the theory that \"the society that slays together stays together.\" Another purpose is to prevent a situation in which a citizen who would have preferred to obey the law as part of his civic responsibility decides that he would be a fool to not violate it, when so many others are getting away with lawlessness that the point of his obedience is mostly defeated.\n\nIn the early period of all systems of code, retribution for wrongs took precedence over the enforcement of rights. A rough sense of justice demanded that a criminal should be punished with the infliction of proportionate loss and pain as he inflicted on his victim. Therefore, \"\"lex talionis\" (an eye for an eye) was very prominent in ancient law. The Bible is no exception: in its oldest form it too included the \"lex talionis\"\", the law of \"measure for measure\" (this is only the literal translation of \"middah ke-neged middah\").\n\nIn the 19th century, philosopher Immanuel Kant argued in \"Metaphysics of Morals\", §49 E., that retribution is the only legitimate form of punishment the court can prescribe. He said that, \"Judicial punishment can never be used merely as a means to promote some other good for the criminal himself or for civil society, but instead it must in all cases be imposed on him only on the ground that he has committed a crime.\"\n\nKant regarded punishment as a matter of justice, which must be carried out by the state for the sake of the law, not for the sake of the criminal or the victim. He argues that if the guilty are not punished, justice is not done and if justice is not done, then the idea of law itself is undermined.\n\nOne of the reasons for the abandonment of retribution by 20th century reformers was that they gave up on the idea of personal autonomy, since they believed science had discredited it.\n\nAccording to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", retributive justice is committed to three principles:\n\nProportionality requires that the level of punishment be related to the severity of the offending behaviour. An accurate reading of the biblical phrase \"an eye for an eye\" in Exodus and Leviticus is said to be: \"'only\" one eye for one eye', or \"an eye in place of an eye\". However, this does not mean that the punishment has to be \"equivalent\" to the crime. A retributive system must punish severe crimes more harshly than minor crimes, but retributivists differ about how harsh or soft the system should be overall. The crime's level of severity can be determined in multiple ways. Severity can be determined by the amount of harm, unfair advantage or the moral imbalance that the crime caused.\n\nTraditionally, philosophers of punishment have contrasted retributivism with utilitarianism. For utilitarians, punishment is forward-looking, justified by a purported ability to achieve future social benefits, such as crime reduction. For retributionists, punishment is backward-looking, justified by the crime that has already been committed. Therefore, punishment is carried out to atone for the damage already done.\n\nRetributive justice is of two distinct types. The classical definition embraces the idea that the amount of punishment must be proportionate to the amount of harm caused by the offence. A more recent version advocated by philosopher Michael Davis asserts that the amount of punishment must be proportionate to the amount of unfair advantage gained by the wrongdoer. Davis introduced this version of retributive justice in the early 1980s, at a time when retributive justice was resurging within the philosophy of law community, perhaps due to the failings of reform theory in prior decades.\n\nA retributive justice system's assessment of blameworthiness (or lack thereof) can either justify punishment or serve merely to limit the punishments society imposes for other reasons.\n\nMany jurisdictions that adopt retributive justice, especially in the United States, use mandatory sentencing, where judges impose a penalty for a crime within the range set by the law. However, judges have limited discretion to consider mitigating factors, leading to greater penalties under certain circumstances. \n\nWhen the punishment involves a fine, the theory does not allow the financial position of an offender to be considered, leading to situations in which a poor individual and a millionaire could be forced to pay the same amount. Such a fine would be punitive for the poor offender while insignificant for the millionaire. Instead of pure retribution, many jurisdictions use variants such as the European Union's emphasis on punitive equality, which base the amount of a fine not just on the offense but also on the offender's income, salary, and ability to pay. Consequently in 2002 a senior Finnish executive at Nokia was given a fine of €116,000 (US $103,000) on a traffic ticket issued for driving in a zone, based on his income of €14 million (US $12.5 million) per year. Similarly, a Finnish businessman was required to pay €54,000 based on his yearly income of €6.5 million, making the fine equally punitive as a typical €200 (US $246) fine for the same offense would have been had it been issued to a Finn earning an average salary. The retributive theory's lack of consideration of the perpetrator's and victim's status has led many jurisdictions to move away from it in various ways, including punitive equality and taking into consideration the status and wealth, or lack of status and wealth, of an offender and their consequent ability to both pay fines and defend themselves effectively in court.\n\nOne critique of some concepts of just deserts are that they are primitive, emphasizing social harm rather than the character and culpability of offenders, an example being California's 1976 statute calling for \"terms proportionate to the seriousness of the offense with provision for uniformity in the sentences of offenders committing the same offense under similar circumstances.\" More generally, prioritizing justice for the public over crime control goals has come under criticism as attributable more to the relative ease of writing sentencing guidelines as crime tariffs (as opposed to describing the appropriate influence of situational and personal characteristics on punishment) than to any sound arguments about penological theory.\n\nTraditional alternatives to retributive justice have been exile and shunning. In pre-modern societies such sentences were often the equivalent of the death penalty as individuals would find it impossible to survive without the support and protection of the society that they had wronged.\n\nModern alternatives to retributive measures include psychiatric imprisonment, restorative justice and transformative justice. A general overview of criminal justice puts each of these ideals in context.\n\nOne libertarian approach to this issue argues that full restitution (in the broad, rather than technical legal, sense) is compatible with both retributivism and a utilitarian degree of deterrence.\n\n"}
{"id": "51567679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51567679", "title": "Revolutionary Action Movement", "text": "Revolutionary Action Movement\n\nRevolutionary Action Movement (RAM) was a U.S.-based revolutionary black nationalist group in operation from 1962 to 1969. They were the first group to apply the philosophy of Maoism to conditions of black people in the United States and informed the revolutionary politics of the Black Power movement. RAM was the only secular political organization which Malcolm X joined prior to 1964.The group's political formation deeply influenced the politics of Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, and many other future influential Black Panther Party founders and members.\n\nIn 1961, students at Central State University, a historically black university in Ohio came together to form \"Challenge,\" a small conglomerate group of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Largely made up of formerly expelled students and veteran activists, Challenge was created to further political awareness, particularly in relation to the black community. At the request of Donald Freeman, who was enrolled at Case Western Reserve University at the time, Challenge read Harold Cruse's essay \"Revolutionary Nationalism and the Afro-American\" and thereafter shifted its focus from educating their participants to creating a mass black working-class nationalist movement in the North. After this drastic change of agenda, Challenge soon evolved into the Reform Action Movement, as they believed use of the word \"revolutionary\" would stir fear in the university administration. Led by Freeman, Wanda Marshall, and Maxwell Stanford, RAM became a study/action group that hoped to turn the Civil Rights Movement into a worldwide black revolution.\n\nMax stanford (now Ahmad Muhammad) was one of the founding members of RAM, and served as both its national chairman and Philadelphia head for much of the group's existence. He was a Philadelphia native, and one of James and Grace Lee Boggs' \"adopted\" kids, youth who spent a lot of time at the Boggs household and connected with their circle of activists. Prior to joining them, Stanford had been involved with militant civil rights activism since his teenage years. Through the lively discussions of revolutionary politics that thrived in the Boggs household, he developed a sharp critical consciousness and an impressive grasp of theory by adulthood. Beginning in 1963, Stanford also became a protege of Malcolm X.\n\nDon Freeman was black student at Case Western who originally organized Challenge at Central State and then went on to be one of the leaders of the Cleveland branch of RAM. He questioned, however, during RAM's early years, the validity of RAM as a Marxist organization since traditional Marxist theory focused on class, while ignoring racism. So although Freeman believed in collectively owned black enterprises, he also argued that white \"socialists and Marxists do not possess the solutions to the ills of black America.\"\n\nThough it initially started as a small student group at Central State College and Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, RAM at its peak had chapters all over the nation. The full spread of RAM remains hard to discern because RAM was semi-clandestine in nature. Chapters in New York, Oakland, Cleveland, and Detroit went by pseudonyms so as to decrease public scrutiny, while the Philadelphia chapter continued to operate under RAM's name. The decision to go underground was made by leadership after they judged that the ultra-right was preparing to crush the movement and that they could no longer be public without endangering noninvolved people and exposing them to violence.\n\nRAM implemented a \"system of rotating chairmen\" to foster veteran leadership that would help educate the younger, less experienced members. There were three levels of membership in RAM. The first consisted of members who were \"professional, full-time field organizers.\" The second level was made up of members who paid their dues to the organization and \"met the standards for the main criteria for cadre.\" The third group included undisclosed members who only donated money to RAM.\n\nThe overall structure of RAM was organized into three types of cells or units: area units, work units, and political units. Area units were designed to gain community influence by organizing around local issues. Work units were set up in factories or other industrial type settings, and the League of Black Workers, the predecessor to the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, was eventually created through these units. Political units were used to gain access into the Civil Rights Movement and transform it into a movement for black liberation.\n\nThe Afroamerican revolutionary, being inside the citadel of world imperialism and being the Vanguard against the most highly developed capitalist complex has problems no other revolutionary has had. His position is so strategic that victory means the downfall of the arch enemy of the oppressed (U.S. imperialism) and the beginning of the birth of a new world. --\"The African American War of National-Liberation,\" RAM's Black AmericaRAM was the first group in the United States to synthesize the thought of Marx, Lenin, Mao, and Malcolm X into a comprehensive theory of revolutionary black nationalism. They combined socialism, black nationalism, and Third World internationalism into a coherent and applicable theory that called for revolution \"inside the citadel of world imperialism,\" meaning the United States.\n\nThe revolutionary nationalists of RAM believed that colonized peoples around the world must rise up and destroy the \"universal slavemaster.\" They also believed that all people have a right to self-determination, including the \"internal black colony\" of the United States. In their opinion, African Americans had to gain control of land and political power through national liberation and establish revolutionary socialism in sovereign, liberated lands. They emphasized creating a black nation on land in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina that, in their eyes, rightfully belonged to black people. This push for a sovereign black nation was in some ways a reiteration of an old black leftist line from the 1930s.\n\nIn fact, many RAM activists derived their ideology from an older generation of revolutionary black leftists: Harry Haywood, Queen Mother Audley Moore, Harold Cruse, and Abner Berry as well as James and Grace Lee Boggs. Many of these older revolutionaries played a role of ideological and political mentorship to RAM activists.\n\nThe revolutionary spirit of black Americans in the 1960s was by no means the sole example of rebellion in the world at that time. The decade brought forth revolutions and mass uprisings in countries all over the world, and though the people were protesting in different regions, most of these movements sought to achieve a similar goal: the universal elimination of racism and capitalism. Members of RAM understood that black nationalism, the formation of an independent nation of blacks in the U.S., was a concept inseparable from black internationalism, which had the goal of ending white supremacy through a conjoined effort of all oppressed groups to overthrow pan-European racism and the exploitative global capitalist system. In other words, the movement had a global vision, bigger than just the race relations of the United States. They saw the main battle as being between Western imperialism and the oppressed Third World within U.S. borders and around the world. The context of black liberation was the entire world revolution, rather than cultural nationalism, which RAM considered reactionary and bourgeois. RAM members saw themselves as colonial subjects fighting a \"colonial war at home.\"\n\nThe theory of black internationalism was first publicized in W.E.B. DuBois' \"Dark Princess\", where he argues that the black nation in America is just one faction of what he refers to as the \"Land of the Blacks,\" a conglomeration of all racially subjugated groups around the world. RAM spokesman Malcolm X later described the black revolution in the United States as part of a \"worldwide struggle of the oppressed against the oppressor.\" Several other political figures openly supported black internationalism, calling for people to join the revolution and be fully in conjunction \"with the people in the great struggle for Africa and of suffering humanity\".\nSome RAM activists saw themselves as an all-black cadre of Mao's Red Army, and related their black freedom struggle to Mao's strategy of encircling capitalist countries to challenge imperialism. In solidarity and fighting alongside anti-colonial struggles in China, Zanzibar, Cuba, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Algeria, RAM activists saw themselves as playing a global role.\n\nAmong what some saw as the hedonism of the 1960s, Mao's revolutionary code of ethics, alongside the religious self-restraint preached by the Nation of Islam, was a powerful force. Some RAM materials about their revolutionary code of ethics take quotations nearly verbatim from The Little Red Book. When Robert F. Williams, chairman of RAM, came back from his exile in China, he also emphasized that all young black revolutionaries must \"undergo personal and moral transformation. There is a need for a stringent revolutionary code of moral ethics. Revolutionaries are instruments of righteousness.\"\n\nRAM called for a \"cultural revolution\" of sorts: one that would purge the slave mentality from black people in the United States. They were for the creation of a new, revolutionary culture through the reclamation of African aesthetics, creation of art only in the service of the revolution, and active attempt to root out habits, traditions, customs, and philosophies taught to black people by white oppressors.\n\nThere were three main branches of RAM: the founding branch in Cleveland, Ohio; the headquarters branch in Philadelphia, PA; and a west coast branch in Oakland, CA. Though the branches all had different local goals and accomplished different things, RAM engaged in several unifying national political activities.\n\nFor instance, all branches helped distribute Robert Williams' magazine, \"The Crusader\", after it had been banned within the United States. They also took a two-pronged approach to advocating their policies among other civil rights groups: disparaging those that did not advocate for armed self-defense and, simultaneously, infiltrating them to try and spread their revolutionary ideology.\n\nDue to the fact that RAM was made up of mostly college-educated intellectuals (though many dropped out to organize full-time), they thought a lot about who they were trying to mobilize, eventually settling upon the black petit bourgeoisie youth and black working-class youth. RAM thought that the black petit bourgeoisie particularly embodied the contradictions of racial capitalism, and if properly brought into the movement, this group could form a \"revolutionary intelligentsia capable of leading black America to true liberation.\" They also used public street meetings to try and attract as many black working-class youth as possible to their organization, particularly gang members. RAM thought gang members had the most revolutionary potential of the population, because they could be trained to fight not against each other but against white power structures. They believed they could create a fighting force of former gang members on the model of the Congolese Youth guerrilla army and the Mau Mau guerrillas.\n\nIn mid-1965, before opposition to the Vietnam War gained momentum, RAM blazed the ideological trail, expressing solidarity with the Vietnamese National Liberation Front in their fight against imperialism. At the same time RAM was explicitly anti-draft, arguing and organizing around the hypocrisy of drafting black Americans to fight in a war against, in their eyes, other people victimized by U.S. imperialism.\n\nThe Black Guard was a national armed youth self-defense group run by RAM that argued for protecting the interests of Black America by fighting directly against its enemies. The Black Guard, in Max Stanford's words, \"[was] to stop our youth from fighting amongst themselves, teach them a knowledge of [black] history...and prepare them...to protect our community from racist attacks.\"\n\nEverywhere except for Philadelphia, RAM operated as a semi-clandestine group, existing behind front organizations, and under multiple names and branches. Due to this underground status, RAM focused more on producing Agitprop and less on actual community organizing. As a result, RAM has received less attention from historians than the Black Panther Party, even though they blazed the 1960s revolutionary black nationalist ideological trail and heavily influenced the Panthers.\n\nMalcolm X became a RAM officer in 1964. Max Stanford has claimed that Malcolm X's Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) was intended to be the popular front organization to RAM's underground black liberation army. \nDespite numerous chapters all over the country, by 1964, RAM's home base in Philadelphia was the main branch available to the public eye. The Philadelphia chapter was responsible for the publication of RAM's bimonthly newspaper, \"Black America,\" and the single paged newsletter \"RAM Speaks\". During their time in the city, RAM actively supported Leon Sullivan's 1962 selective patronage campaign. This was the beginning of the \"don't buy where you can't work\" method of direct boycott action that serves as an example of the effectiveness of the black masses to black liberation.\n\nThroughout its existence, RAM supported mass action all over Philadelphia, canvassed to try to listen to community needs, and provided public services that they thought were lacking. These actions ranged from responding to local residents' medical emergencies to providing weekly black history classes. By making their presence known throughout the streets and establishing a consistent presence throughout black neighborhoods in the city, RAM was able to effectively mobilize people for anti-union discrimination protests in 1963.\n\nRAM also advocated for the black students in Philadelphia's Bok High School in 1968 by providing protection and political education to students while they protested unequal conditions and a lack of community control in their educational environment.\n\nIn Cleveland, RAM was governed by a secret committee named the \"Soul Circle,\" which was essentially a small selection of black men involved in the local community, as well as civil rights, and student groups. In 1962, a policy-oriented think tank named the Afro-American Institute was founded in Cleveland, Ohio. Through this organization, RAM members held free public lectures and worked with other activists to improve the black community in Cleveland. The following year, Max Stanford and other RAM members traveled to Cleveland and joined CORE to assist in demanding better healthcare for black hospital patients and more inclusion of Black history in the Cleveland public school curriculum.\n\nThe Afro-American Institute organized lectures by revolutionary black artists and intellectuals, and distributed leaflets to inform and inculcate the public in their revolutionary opinions. The subjects of the leaflets were wide-ranging, from elections to the arms race to the black struggle, and eventually the leaflets became the newsletter \"Afropinion\".\n\nIn Cleveland, RAM's most notable accomplishment was their open protestation against Mae Mallory's incarceration. Mallory was a Black woman arrested for her relationship with Robert F. Williams, the future international chairman of RAM who, at the time, had fled to Cuba after being exiled from the United States. Working with the institute and its allies, RAM petitioned the governor of Ohio to revoke the extradition warrant against Mallory and held a large demonstration in front of the county jail, insisting on Mallory's immediate release.\nRAM's Northern California branch operated under the name the \"Soul Students' Advisory Council\" and started after then-member of the Afro-American Association and future-Black Panther Ernie Allen went on a trip to Cuba in 1964. There Allen traveled alongside the future organizers of Uhuru, Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement, and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. He also coincidentally met and talked to Max Stanford, who was in Cuba visiting Robert Williams at the same time. This confluence of events resulted in Allen establishing a branch of RAM in Oakland at Merritt College through the Soul Students' Advisory Council.\n\nThe Soul Students' Advisory Council published a widely distributed prose and poetry journal called \"Soulbook: The Revolutionary Journal of the Black World.\" It was a radical black culture magazine edited by future black power activists Bobby Seale, Huey Newton, and Ernie Allen, among others. The Soul Students' Advisory Council, in its interaction with RAM, exposed Seale and Newton to anti-imperialism, socialism, and revolutionary nationalism for the first time, which was critical in their political development.\n\nAs exemplified by police repression of RAM in Philadelphia in the summer 1967, the FBI and their COINTELPRO program targeted RAM for political destruction. However, RAM was just one of many civil rights or black nationalist groups targeted because of their politics. Tactics used to suppress RAM were also used to suppress and target Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, the National Welfare Rights Organization, Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM), Republic of New Afrika (RNA), Congress of Afrikan People, black student unions at universities all over the country, and black churches and community organizations.\n\nIn 1967, following an exposé on RAM in Life magazine, Max Stanford and 16 other RAM members were arrested on conspiracy charges and for allegedly plotting to assassinate the NAACP's Roy Wilkins and the Urban League's Whitney Young. Stanford went underground to avoid arrest and indictment, but the rest of the Queens 17, as they were called, went to trial and had to pay a $200,000 bail bond.\n\nIn this context of government repression, RAM transformed itself into the Black Liberation Party, and by 1969 had practically dissolved. Many of its members went back to their communities or joined other civil rights groups to continue pushing their ideology of black internationalism and armed self-defense.\n\nOn multiple occasions, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover condemned RAM, describing the organization as a \"militant black nationalist hate group.\" During its existence, RAM was the target of denigration from a wide range of critics, including Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nThough RAM claimed it was a Maoist organization, some scholars, like Robin Kelley, have critiqued it for not sticking to Mao's philosophies. He writes: \"Mao's insistence on the protracted nature of revolution was not taken to heart; at one point they suggested that the war for liberation would probably take ninety days. And because RAM's leaders focused their work on confronting the state head on and attacking black leaders whom they deemed reformists, they failed to build a strong base in black urban communities. Furthermore, despite their staunch internationalism, they did not reach out to other oppressed 'nationalities' in the United States.\"\n\nAmidst the sectarianism of the New Left, other activists and black liberation organizations also criticized RAM. In particular, the Black Panther Party said that although RAM led the development of black nationalist thought in the U.S., examples of their application of revolutionary ideas was few and far between, and mostly limited to students, rather than the black underclass \"lumpenproletariat\" they claimed to represent. RAM oftentimes struggled to meld theory and practice.\n"}
{"id": "29203861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29203861", "title": "Rong Qiqi", "text": "Rong Qiqi\n\nRóng Qǐqī () is a mythological Chinese folk hero. He is depicted as a recluse, who shuns material possessions in favour of an ascetic life. Rong was known in Ancient China for a fable involving an alleged encounter with the philosopher Confucius. Although largely forgotten in the following centuries, in his time, the story of his encounter with Confucius was a source of artistic and poetic inspiration. The story is retold in the famous text \"Liezi\", written by Lie Yukou, a circa 5th-century BCE Hundred Schools of Thought philosopher. Many scholars conclude that Rong Qiqi, while a notable figure in early Chinese literature, is likely fictional or legendary and not historical.\n\nLike many folk heroes, it is uncertain if Rong Qiqi is a fictional character, or if his story has some basis in truth.\n\nAccording to the fable involving Rong, he lived to the age of 95. The text does not indicate the cause of Rong's predicament, whether it arose out of choice or from misfortune, but popular interpretations of the text have assumed it is the former.\n\nIn the story, Confucius encounters Rong Qiqi, an elderly recluse who has chosen a life of ascetism. Rong is starkly in contrast to the Confucian ideal of a successful man; he is elderly, poorly dressed, with little material possessions or ambitions. And yet, despite his poverty, Rong appears happy to Confucius. He responds to Confucius' bewilderment with a cheerful song, happily accompanied by his playing of the lute. The Han Dynasty classic \"Huainanzi\" reports that \"when Rong Qiqi plucks one chord of his lute, Confucius, moved by its harmony, rejoiced for three days.\"\n\nConfucius requests Rong provide reasons for his happiness. Rong Qiqi, Confucius surmised, has nothing to be joyful of; he has no possessions, no hope, and no future. Rong replies that he is happy for three reasons, his \"three joys\" (): being born human, being born a man, and living to an old age. That, for him, is enough.\n\nAfter all, Rong surmises, most men are poor and all men will die, so why should he worry himself? This is consistent with all lives, so instead of waiting with everyone else for it to eventually end, why should he worry himself with anything? Why should he deny himself happiness? Instead of being miserable, waiting for his fate, he chooses to be happy. Says Rong Qiqi:\nConfucius was a famous philosopher in Ancient China, known for his emphasis on filial piety and on the importance of education and studying. This makes him a perfect foil for Rong Qiqi, who rejects his personal responsibilities in favour of pursuing happiness.\n\nRong Qiqi's appeal was his complete abstinence of material desires. He was similar to his Western counterpart, Diogenes the Cynic, in rejecting all societal norms and physical comforts for a life of ascetic virtue.\n\nHe lived in poverty, not because he was forced to, but because he chose to. He chose to reject the material world. Being destitute was, by itself, not an appealing trait.\n\nThe philosophy of the possibly fictional Rong Qiqi was widely admired among writers, with artists viewing it at as a more natural, more fluid, more liberating way to live life. The poet Ruan Kan wrote approvingly of Rong, applauding Rong Qiqi's fatalistic view of life as a way to achieve the tranquillity and harmony valued in Daoism as integral to the Tao.\n\nPoets Gu Kaizhi and Tao Yuanming have also mentioned Rong Qiqi in their poetry, but the latter spoke of him with far more skepticism, wondering if such emphasis on the natural and abandonment of the worldly is actually worth it.\n\nSome poets rejected Rong, seeing seclusion as a cheap escape from recent misfortune and responsibility. The poet Sengdu, while praising the idea of seclusion as a means of spiritual enlightenment, rejected Rong's reaction to futility by indulging in simplistic joys and desire. As he describes in one of his poems, Sendu's response to Rong is \"Though this age might be said to be joyous, what of later lives?\"\n\nRong Qiqi was also popularly associated with a group of Chinese Taoist Qingtan scholars, writers, and musicians called the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove who came together in the 3rd century CE. This is indicated in some apocryphal art from the 4th century CE, in a tomb near Nanjing, depicting Rong Qiqi with the Seven Sages. However, the Seven Sages lived in a time period long after Rong Qiqi's, so this association is probably apocryphal, assuming that Rong Qiqi is a real person and not just a fanciful character.\n\n\n"}

He was called the \"Bentham of Hallamshire\".\n\nBailey was born at Sheffield on 5 July 1791, the son of Joseph Bailey and Mary Eadon. His father was among the first of those Sheffield merchants who went to the United States to establish trade connections. After a few years in his father's business, he retired from all business concerns with an ample fortune, although he remained connected with the Sheffield Banking Company, of which he was a founder in 1831 and served as chairman for many years. Although an ardent liberal, he took little part in political affairs. On two occasions, he stood for Sheffield as a \"philosophic radical\" parliamentary candidate, but without success.\n\nHis life is for the most part a history of his numerous and varied publications. He died suddenly on 18 January 1870, leaving over £80,000 to the town trustees of Sheffield for public use.\n\nHis first work, \"Essays on the Formation and Publication of Opinions\", published anonymously in 1821, attracted more attention than any of his other writings. A sequel to it appeared in 1829, \"Essays on the Pursuit of Truth\". Between these two were \"Questions in Political Economy, Politics, Morals, &c.\" (1823), and a \"Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measure, and Causes of Value\" (1825), directed against the opinions of David Ricardo and his school.\n\nHis next publications also were on economic or political subjects, \"Rationale of Political Representation\" (1835), and \"Money and its Vicissitudes\" (1837) and he has been regarded as one of the main theorists of Free banking. About the same time, there also appeared some of his pamphlets, \"Discussion of Parliamentary Reform\", \"Right of Primogeniture Examined\", \"Defence of Joint-Stock Banks\". In 1842 appeared his \"Review of Berkeley's Theory of Vision\" which called forth rejoinders from John Stuart Mill in the \"Westminster Review\" and from James Frederick Ferrier in \"Blackwood's Magazine\". Bailey replied to his critics in a \"Letter to a Philosopher\" (1843), &c.\n\nIn 1851 he published \"Theory of Reasoning\", a discussion of the nature of inference, and an able criticism of the functions and value of the syllogism. In 1852 he published \"Discourses on Various Subjects\"; and finally summed up his philosophic views in the \"Letters on the Philosophy of the Human Mind\" (three series, 1855, 1858,1863). The \"Letters\" contain a discussion of many of the principal problems in psychology and ethics. Bailey can hardly be classed as belonging either to the strictly empirical or to the idealist school, but his general tendency is towards the former. (1) In regard to method, he founds psychology entirely on introspection. He thus, to a certain extent, agrees with the Scottish School, but he differs from them in rejecting altogether the doctrine of mental faculties. What have been designated faculties are, upon his view, merely classified facts or phenomena of consciousness. He criticizes very severely the habitual use of metaphorical language in describing mental operations. (2) His doctrine of perception, which is, in brief, that \"the perception of external things through the organs of sense is a direct mental act or phenomenon of consciousness not susceptible of being resolved into anything else,\" and the reality of which can be neither proved nor disproved, is not worked out in detail, but is supported by elaborate and sometimes subtle criticisms of all other theories. (3) With regard to general and abstract ideas and general propositions, his opinions are those of the empirical school, but his analysis frequently puts the matter in a new light. (4) In the theory of morals, Bailey is an advocate of utilitarianism (though he objects to the term \"utility\" as being narrow and, to the unthinking, of sordid content), and works out with great skill the steps in the formation of the \"complex\" mental facts involved in the recognition of duty, obligation, right.\n\nHe bases all moral phenomena on five facts: (1) Man is susceptible to pleasure (and pain); (2) he likes (or dislikes) their causes; (3) he desires to reciprocate pleasure and pain received; (4) he expects such reciprocation from others; (5) he feels more or less sympathy with the same feelings in his fellows (cf. \"Letters\", 3rd series).\n\nIn 1845 he published \"Maro\" a poem in four cantos (85 pp., Longmans), containing a description of a young poet who printed 1000 copies of his first poem, of which only 10 were sold. He was a diligent student of Shakespeare, and his last literary work was \"On the Received Text of Shakespeare's Dramatic Writings and its Improvement\" (1862).\n\n"}

A pioneer of chemistry, he developed ways of purification and creation of various acids, metals and other chemical compounds. He discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance-later called oxygen, 170 years before Scheele's discovery of the element. He correctly identified this 'food of life' with the gas (also oxygen) given off by heating nitre (saltpetre). This substance, the 'central nitre', had a central position in Sendivogius' schema of the universe.\n\nLittle is known of his early life: he was born in a noble family that was part of the Clan of Ostoja. His father sent him to study in university of Kraków but Sendivogius visited also most of the European countries and universities; he studied at Vienna, Altdorf, Leipzig and Cambridge. His acquaintances included John Dee and Edward Kelley. It was thanks to him that King Stefan Batory agreed to finance their experiments. In the 1590s he was active in Prague, at the famously open-minded court of Rudolf II.\nIn Poland he appeared at the court of King Sigismund III Vasa around 1600, and quickly achieved great fame, as the Polish king was himself an alchemy enthusiast and even conducted experiments with Sendivogius. In Kraków's Wawel castle, the chamber where his experiments were performed is still intact. The more conservative Polish nobles soon came to dislike him for encouraging the king to expend vast sums of money on chemical experimentation. The more practical aspects of his work in Poland involved the design of mines and metal foundries. His widespread international contacts led to his employment as a diplomat from about 1600.\n\nIn his later years, Michael Sendivogius spent more time in Bohemia and Moravia (now in the Czech Republic), where he had been granted lands by the Habsburg emperor. Near the end of his life, he settled in Prague, in the court of Rudolf II, where he gained even more fame as a designer of metal mines and foundries. However the Thirty Years' War of 1618-48 had effectively ended the golden age of alchemy: the rich patrons now spent their money on financing war rather than chemical speculation, and he died in relative obscurity.\n\nDaniel Stolcius in his \"Viridarium Chymicum\" (1624) praises Sendivogius as the author of twelve books. The most famous of these was his \"New Chemical Light\", published in 1604. Besides a relatively clear exposition of his theory on the existence of a 'food of life' in air, his books contain various scientific, pseudo-scientific and philosophical theories, and were repeatedly translated and widely read among such worthies as Isaac Newton into the 18th century.\n\nFirst appearance of this character in fiction was in an 1845 book \"Sędziwoj\" by Józef Bohdan Dziekoński, a writer during the times of romanticism in Poland. Nowadays he appears in several books by Polish writer Andrzej Pilipiuk (\"Kuzynki, Księżniczka, Dziedziczki\"). He was also shown (thinly disguised) as the Alchemist Sendivogius in the Polish TV series in the 1980s.\n\nThe Polish 19th century realist painter Jan Matejko depicted Sendivogius demonstrating a transmutation of a base metal into gold before King Sigismund III Vasa.\n\nSendivogius is also a character in the novel of Gustav Meyrink (part of \"Goldmachergeschichten, August Scherl Verlag, Berlin 1925\"), a German author from Prague, Bohemia, who often wrote about alchemy and alchemists. He is also the central character in the 2012 fictional conspiracy thriller \"The Man With the Devil's Hand\" by Jarek Garliński, a Polish-English author and translator, who mainly specialises in Polish history during the Second World War.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the book, Unger and West describe a central tradition in American social thought that they call \"the American religion of possibility.\" Arguing that economic inequality, political impasse, and increasing isolation of Americans from each other has called that tradition into question, Unger and West present a plan for increasing economic equality and deepening democracy so that the United States better fulfills the promises of the American religion of possibility.\n\nThe book received largely positive reviews. According to \"Kirkus Reviews\", Unger and West\n\ncall for democratizing the market economy and energizing representative democracy by unleashing the creative abilities of Americans. For we've always been tinkerers, people willing to experiment to find a better way... Their concerns include the influence of money on politics. While in the past this influence was 'sanctified by the judiciary as if the ability of money to talk . . . were a principle rather than a wrong,' it is now time for government to stop upholding this dismal system and start innovating with public financing. In a country where many Democrats aspire to be nothing more than generous Republicans, they maintain, this sort of re-emergent progressivism is needed to introduce a dose of American creativity. A bold political analysis that should inspire public life but, alas, probably will not. \n\nAnother laudatory review came from Mark Satin in the \"Radical Middle Newsletter\", who described the book as\n\nexceptionally bold ... exceptionally detailed... [O]nly a couple of pages into the book you’ll realize that their principal goal is to drag the old New Left and the new 'identity left,' kicking and screaming, into the world of entrepreneurship, personal responsibility, and scientific and technological progress. Instead of basking in unearned self-esteem, all high school students should be expected to master a tough set of conceptual, practical, and learning skills. In short: Progressives should lead the march away from the old economy, and thereby help define the emerging new economy of 'flattened hierarchies and permanent innovation.'\n\nWriting in \"Commonweal\", Eugene McCarraher commended Unger and West's \"sweeping but sensible proposals,\" but contended that their celebration of the practices of vanguard industry as a path for the rest of the U.S. to reach economic equality was misguided:\n\nBy describing as \"religion\" the practical and experimental ways in which Americans approach technology and personal relations, Unger and West highlight the mixture of prophecy and wonkery that has been the glory and the bane of the progressive tradition. They marvel at \"a worldwide network of productive vanguards,\" at \"flexibility\" and \"decentralization\" in labor markets and production, and at the \"flattened hierarchies,\" \"fluid job definitions,\" and \"constant reshaping of products, services, and practices\" that characterize the advanced sectors of contemporary capitalism. But \"The Future of American Progressivism\" seems unaware of the ways this lexicon articulates the libertarian elitism of the \"productive vanguards.\" ... For a couple of leftists, the authors are remarkably forgetful of the market's coercive character.\nAccording to a \"New York Times\" article about Unger's work as a cabinet minister in Brazil, he is best known in the United States for \"The Future of American Progressivism\".\n\n"}

It has been interpreted in many languages which also includes Persian and Braj. This page describes the interpretations of the story conducted by Todar Mal, the Hindu finance minister of Mughal emperor Akbar and Abu al-Faiz, Akbar's poet laureate.\n\nBoth the interpretations include the central theme of love. In Todar Mal's version, the story of Nal (or Nala) and Damayanti has themes such as love, deceit and war between Hindu deities and Nal. On the other hand, Faizi talks about three oppositions which also play a role as themes. The first opposition is love and intellect (aql), the second opposition is between love and beauty (husn) and the third opposition is between Ishq and junnun (frenzy). However, one account is related to Bhakti which includes a lot of Hindu deities and connections between the supreme power and human beings. The other account is related to Sufism which includes a passionate connection between love and humans.\n\nA general statement related to Bhakti states that it is a devotional worship for one supreme deity, by whose blessings a person can achieve salvation. A Bhakti rendition of Nala-Damayanti: Todarmal’s ‘Nector of Nal’s life’ describes the famous story of Nal and Damayanti. The story is described from a Hindu traditional perspective keeping in mind the Hindu culture. The story includes themes of love, deceit and war. 'Nector of Nal's Life' is closely related to Bhakti of a Hindu deity called Hari. It starts off with Damayanti's life. Damayanti is a young princess whose beauty is beyond perfection. Due to this her mother insists on marrying her daughter to a God instead of marrying her to a mere human. They consider Lord Indra to be the perfect match for Damayanti. However, the goose that had been sent to Indra holding the invitation to the marriage was hit by a storm and lands in the kingdom of a handsome king named Nal. Nal takes cares of the goose and instead of continuing its journey the goose decides to choose Nal as the rightful husband of Damayanti. Lord Indra finds out that Nal is in love with Damayanti and demands him not to marry her or else he will have to pay for his actions. However, Indra realises that he must resort to deceit in order to win Damayanti, and so he decides to take the form of Nal. Damayanti is presented with two Nals and so she must choose the one she loves. \"Anguished, she calls upon Hari who guides her actions and enables her to know which is truly Nal. Only when she looks into the eyes of both does she know her true love and garlands the real Nal\" (Wadley 1999, 33). This is the first instance in the story in which the power of Bhakti is displayed.\n\nAnother instance during which the notion of Bhakti is exhibited is when Hari is worried about Indra conspiring with Rahu and Ketu, Suraj and Sani. According to Hari, if their side won, they would cause Nal a lot of suffering. However, Hari says that if Nal was to remember Hari this whole time he would not be devastated. \"But if this should happen and Nal continues to remember Hari throughout his twelve years of sorrow, he will return with more than he lost.\" (Wadley 1999, 34). This notion of believe in God shows the true meaning of Bhakti in the Hindu culture.\n\nIn addition, Nal and Damayanti were destined to struggle a lot. Indra attacks Narvar the kingdom of Nal. All four planets jointly attack the king and destroy his wealth, grain and palaces. Looking at this Damayanti calls upon Hari once again to protect them. \"But as the crisis worsens, Dumaiti calls out to Hari, asking for his help. Hari sends Narad to take Nal out of the city before all the beings in it die from Indra's onslaught\" (Wadley 1999, 34). With the help of Hari, Nal and Damayanti reach the house of an oil presser because Sani cannot harm those who press sesame oil. Here, once again Nal's powers are active and he helps the oil presser a lot by pressing lots of oil and making him very wealthy.\n\nSufism is the actualisation of the Truth by means of love and devotion. Love, Passion and Reason in Faizi's Nal-Daman,\" in Love in South Asia:ACultural History also talks about the story of Nal and Damayanti however; a lot of Sufism elements take account in this version. Abu al-Fayz Faizi’s interpretation starts off with the story of Nal. Nal is portrayed as a man who is possessed by love. He has an illness of love because of which he is not the same. Nal blames love for his state but after meeting Daman (Damayanti) he does not think that love is evil. This is when the first opposition is introduced; love and intellect (Aql). In Sufism context, “when love becomes excess, it can only lead to disaster, for this is the inevitable consequence of the neglect of the intellect (aql) and of notions of equilibrium that are crucial both for kingship and social order\" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 116). After hearing many stories about love, he was possessed by it. Nal is told a story of an Indian princess (Daman) about whom there were many rumours around the kingdom. Upon hearing the story, he concludes that Daman is the reason for this sickness even though he had no direct or indirect contact with her. Also, a section in the story says that Nal is confused as to how the bandits broke into his treasure in spite of all the guards that have been patrolling it. This point is directly connected to intellect as Nal is taken over by love and cannot think straight.\n\nAnother opposition that has been introduced in the story is between love and beauty (husn). In Sufism context love is vulnerable and ever-seeking whereas beauty is distant, refuses to be engaged and altogether is remarkable for its indifference. \"Beauty fires arrows and love is wounded\" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 118). Upon hearing of the beauty of Daman, Nal is mesmerised and falls further into the sickness of love. Lastly, the third opposition that has been introduced is between love and frenzy (junnun). After marrying Daman, Nal is completely lost to pleasure. He is shown to be possessed by frenzy of passion. His life is shown to have formed an alliance between love (ishq) and frenzy (junnun) against intellect (aql). He is so deeply in love that he loses his sense of equilibrium which is an important component of a great ruler. Nal's younger brother tries to take advantage of this situation by proposing a game of chess. Whoever won this game would win all the goods, treasure and the kingdom. \"Nal, who is already a prisoner of junnun, falls into this whirlpool as its unsuspecting victim\" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 130).\n\nFurthermore, another practice that portrays the element of junnun is the practice of Sati. In Hinduism sati was the practice of wife burning herself in the pyre of the husband. The wife would sacrifice their life along with their husbands. \"The Sufi (follower of Sufism) brimming with love and fascination for his beloved, is thought to suffer immense pain, agitation, and distress over separation\" (Rehman 2014, 3). The women would show their junnun for their husbands by setting themselves on fire because they cannot bear the separation.\n\nThe two accounts Bhakti and Sufism are also very similar within these two stories. Nal is portrayed as an aashiq in Faizi's version and in Todarmal's interpretation Nal constantly falls in love with Damayanti once he hears how beautiful she is. In addition, when Nal goes to Daman's Swayamwara his competitor is a Pagan God compared to Indra in Todarmal's version. Another relevant point is the monotheism displayed. There are many Pagan Gods however; Nal only worships one ultimate God which is a little in parallel with the concept of Akbar praying to Allah. Nal is also shown to have amazing skills as a ruler. He makes a great king with a high intellect which again hints towards Akbar because he is known to be one of the greatest rulers in South Asian history.\n\nIn conclusion, the re-interpretation of the story of Nal and Damayanti suggests a lot about the interaction between Bhakti and Sufism in early modern India. Akbar the great mystic king was interested in spreading the rich Indian works all around the Persian tradition. Due to this he chose this story and it exhibits the great interest he had in Hinduism particularly the account of Bhakti. Taking the love story of Nal and Damayanti and adding a metrical scheme of the story of Layla-Majnun is what Abu al-Fayz Faizi tried achieving. The love of Nal for Damayanti is portrayed in a Sufi way by Faizi who used the components like junnun, ishq and aql to exhibit his state in love. In addition, the re-interpretation of story also exhibits the great interest Muslim rulers had in some of the Hindu/Bhakti traditions. This includes the traditions of swayamwara and Sati. Both the interpretations have the component of swayamwara present. In the Bhakti account, Nal is competing with Indra and many other kings to win Damayanti. On the other hand, the Sufism account shows Nal competing with a Pagan God and other kings to win Daman. Also, the notion of Sati is an olden Hindu tradition. In this tradition, the married women whose husband passes away, sits in the pyre of her husband. This tradition explains that once a husband dies, the wife has lost all the hopes of living and so she must take her life as well. Faizi is shown to be interested in the tradition of Sati because he uses this notion in his Sufism account of Nal and Damanyanti's story. After Nal dies, Daman sits in his pyre and dies with him. With the help of such re-interpretations many Bhakti traditions passed over to Muslim and Persian cultures and many Sufi traditions passed over to Hindu culture. Therefore, this suggests that the interaction between the two devotional traditions is very strong.\n\n"}

{"id": "223389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223389", "title": "Vedanta", "text": "Vedanta\n\nVedanta (; Sanskrit: वेदान्त, IAST: ') or Uttara Mīmāṃsā\"' is one of the six orthodox (\"āstika\") schools of Hindu philosophy. \"Vedanta\" literally means \"end of the Vedas\", reflecting ideas that emerged from the speculations and philosophies contained in the Upanishads. It does not stand for one comprehensive or unifying doctrine. Rather it is an umbrella term for many sub-traditions, ranging from dualism to non-dualism, all of which developed on the basis of a common textual connection called the \"Prasthanatrayi\". The \"Prasthanatrayi\" is a collective term for the \"Principal Upanishads\", the \"Brahma Sutras\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita.\"\n\nAll Vedanta schools, in their deliberations, concern themselves with the following three categories but differ in their views regarding the concept and the relations between them: \"Brahman\" – the ultimate metaphysical reality, \"Ātman\" / \"Jivātman\" – the individual soul or self, and \"Prakriti\" – the empirical world, ever-changing physical universe, body and matter.\n\nSome of the better known sub-traditions of Vedanta include Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), and Dvaita (dualism). Most other Vedantic sub-traditions are subsumed under the term Bhedabheda (difference and non-difference). Over time, Vedanta adopted ideas from other orthodox (\"āstika\") schools like \"Yoga\" and \"Nyaya\", and, through this syncretism, became the most prominent school of Hinduism. Many extant forms of Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism have been significantly shaped and influenced by the doctrines of different schools of Vedanta. The Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism.\nThe word \"Vedanta\" literally means the \"end of the Vedas\" and originally referred to the \"Upanishads\". Vedanta was concerned with the or Vedic knowledge part called the \"Upanishads\". The denotation of Vedanta subsequently widened to include the various philosophical traditions based on to the \"Prasthanatrayi\".\n\nThe \"Upanishads\" may be regarded as the end of \"Vedas\" in different senses:\n\nVedanta is one of the six orthodox (\"āstika\") schools of Indian philosophy. It is also called \"Uttara Mīmāṃsā\", the 'latter enquiry' or 'higher enquiry'; and is often contrasted with \"Pūrva Mīmāṃsā\", the 'former enquiry' or 'primary enquiry'. \"Pūrva Mīmāṃsā\" deals with the \"karmakāṇḍa\" or rituals part (the \"Samhita\" and \"Brahmanas\") in the \"Vedas\".\n\nThe \"Upanishads\", the \"Bhagavadgita\" and the \"Brahma Sutras\" constitute the basis of Vedanta. All schools of Vedanta propound their philosophy by interpreting these texts, collectively called the \"Prasthanatrayi\", literally, \"three sources\".\n\n\nThe \"Brahma Sutras\" attempted to synthesize the teachings of the \"Upanishads\". The diversity in the teaching of the \"Upanishads\" necessitated the systematization of these teachings. This was likely done in many ways in ancient India, but the only surviving version of this synthesis is the \"Brahma Sutras\" of \"Badarayana\".\n\nAll major Vedantic teachers, including Shankara, Bhaskara, Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Madhva, have composed commentaries not only on the \"Upanishads\" and \"Brahma Sutras\", but also on the \"Bhagavad Gita\". The \"Bhagavad Gita\", due to its syncretism of Samkhya, Yoga, and Upanishadic thought, has played a major role in Vedantic thought.\n\nThe \"Upanishads\" present a rigorous philosophical inquiry in the form of identifying various doctrines and then presenting arguments for or against them. They form the basic texts and Vedanta interprets them through rigorous philosophical exegesis. Varying interpretations of the \"Upanishads\" and their synthesis, the \"Brahma Sutras\", led to the development of different schools of Vedanta over time of which three, four, five or six are prominent.\n\nThe history of Vedanta is divided into two periods: one prior to the composition of the \"Brahma Sutras\" and the other encompassing the schools that developed after the \"Brahma Sutras\" were written.\n\nLittle is known of schools of Vedanta existing before the composition of the \"Brahma Sutras\" (400–450 BCE). It is clear that Badarayana, the writer of \"Brahma Sutras\", was not the first person to systematize the teachings of the \"Upanishads\", as he quotes six Vedantic teachers before him – Ashmarathya, Badari, Audulomi, Kashakrtsna, Karsnajini and Atreya. References to other early Vedanta teachers – Brahmadatta, Sundara, Pandaya, Tanka and Dravidacharya – are found in secondary literature of later periods. The works of these ancient teachers have not survived, but based on the quotes attributed to them in later literature, Sharma postulates that Ashmarathya and Audulomi were Bhedabheda scholars, Kashakrtsna and Brahmadatta were Advaita scholars, while Tanka and Dravidacharya were either Advaita or Vishistadvaita scholars.\n\nBadarayana summarized and interpreted teachings of the \"Upanishads\" in the \"Brahma Sutras\", also called the \"Vedanta Sutra\". Badarayana summarized the teachings of the classical Upanishads and refuted the rival philosophical schools in ancient India. The Brahma Sutras laid the basis for the development of Vedanta philosophy.\n\nThough attributed to Badarayana, the Brahma Sutras were likely composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years. The estimates on when the Brahma Sutras were complete vary, with Nicholson in his 2013 review stating, that they were most likely compiled in the present form around 400–450 BCE. Isaeva suggests they were complete and in current form by 200 CE, while Nakamura states that \"the great part of the \"Sutra\" must have been in existence much earlier than that.\"\n\nThe book is composed of four chapters, each divided into four quarters or sections. These sutras attempt to synthesize the diverse teachings of the Upanishads. However, the cryptic nature of aphorisms of the \"Brahma Sutras\" have required exegetical commentaries. These commentaries have resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own commentary.\n\nLittle with specificity is known of the period between the \"Brahma Sutras\" (5th century BCE) and Adi Shankara (8th century CE). Only two writings of this period have survived: the \"Vākyapadīya\", written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century), and the \"Kārikā\" written by Gaudapada (early 6th or 7th century CE).\n\nShankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his school in his commentaries. A number of important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the \"Siddhitraya\" by Yamunācārya (c. 1050), the \"Vedārthasamgraha\" by Rāmānuja (c. 1050–1157), and the \"Yatīndramatadīpikā\" by Śrīnivāsa Dāsa. At least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahma Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.\n\nA noted scholar of this period was Bhartriprapancha. Bhartriprapancha maintained that the Brahman is one and there is unity, but that this unity has varieties. Scholars see Bhartriprapancha as an early philosopher in the line who teach the tenet of Bhedabheda.\n\nGaudapada (c. 6th century CE), was the teacher or a more distant predecessor of Govindapada, the teacher of Adi Shankara. Shankara is widely considered as the founder of Advaita Vedanta. Gaudapada's treatise, the '—also known as the ' or the \"\"—is the earliest surviving complete text on Advaita Vedanta.\n\nGaudapada's ' relied on the Mandukya, Brihadaranyaka and Chhandogya \"Upanishads\". In the ', Advaita (non-dualism) is established on rational grounds (\"upapatti\") independent of scriptural revelation; its arguments are devoid of all religious, mystical or scholastic elements. Scholars are divided on a possible influence of Buddhism on Gaudapada's philosophy. The fact that Shankara, in addition to the \"Brahma Sutras\", the principal \"Upanishads\" and the \"Bhagvad Gita\", wrote an independent commentary on the \"\" proves its importance in literature.\n\nAdi Shankara (788–820), elaborated on Gaudapada's work and more ancient scholarship to write detailed commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi and the '. The Mandukya Upanishad and the ' have been described by Shankara as containing \"the epitome of the substance of the import of Vedanta\". It was Shankara who integrated Gaudapada work with the ancient \"Brahma Sutras\", \"and give it a \"locus classicus\"\" alongside the realistic strain of the \"Brahma Sutras\". His interpretation, including works ascribed to him, has become the normative interpretation of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nA noted contemporary of Shankara was Maṇḍana Miśra, who regarded Mimamsa and Vedanta as forming a single system and advocated their combination known as \"Karma-jnana-samuchchaya-vada\". The treatise on the differences between the Vedanta school and the Mimamsa school was a contribution of Adi Shankara. Advaita Vedanta rejects rituals in favor of renunciation, for example.\n\nRāmānuja (1017–1137 CE) was the most influential philosopher in the Vishishtadvaita tradition. As the philosophical architect of Vishishtadvaita, he taught qualified non-dualism. Ramanuja's teacher, Yadava Prakasha, followed the Advaita monastic tradition. Tradition has it that Ramanuja disagreed with Yadava and Advaita Vedanta, and instead followed Nathamuni and Yāmuna. Ramanuja reconciled the \"Prasthanatrayi\" with the theism and philosophy of the Vaishnava Alvars poet-saints. Ramanuja wrote a number of influential texts, such as a bhasya on the \"Brahma Sutras\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\", all in Sanskrit.\n\nRamanuja presented the epistemological and soteriological importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Ramanuja's case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Atman (souls) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman. Vishishtadvaiata provides the philosophical basis of Sri Vaishnavism.\n\nRamanuja was influential in integrating \"Bhakti\", the devotional worship, into Vedanta premises.\n\nDvaita was propounded by Madhvacharya (1238–1317 CE). He presented the opposite interpretation of Shankara in his Dvaita, or dualistic system. In contrast to Shankara's non-dualism and Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism, he championed unqualified dualism. Madhva wrote commentaries on the chief \"Upanishads\", the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and the \"Brahma Sutra\".\n\nMadhva started his Vedic studies at age seven, joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat), studied under guru Achyutrapreksha, frequently disagreed with him, left the Advaita monastery, and founded Dvaita. Madhva and his followers Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha, were critical of all competing Hindu philosophies, Jainism and Buddhism, but particularly intense in their criticism of Advaita Vedanta and Adi Shankara.\n\nDvaita Vedanta is theistic and it identifies Brahman with Narayana, or more specifically Vishnu, in a manner similar to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. But it is more explicitly pluralistic. Madhva's emphasis for difference between soul and Brahman was so pronounced that he taught there were differences (1) between material things; (2) between material things and souls; (3) between material things and God; (4) between souls; and (5) between souls and God. He also advocated for a difference in degrees in the possession of knowledge. He also advocated for differences in the enjoyment of bliss even in the case of liberated souls, a doctrine found in no other system of Indian philosophy. \n\nAdvaita Vedanta (IAST \"\"; Sanskrit: अद्वैत वेदान्त) espouses non-dualism and monism. \"Brahman\" is held to be the sole unchanging metaphysical reality and identical to \"Atman\". The physical world, on the other hand, is always-changing empirical \"Maya\". The absolute and infinite \"Atman\"-\"Brahman\" is realized by a process of negating everything relative, finite, empirical and changing. The school accepts no duality, no limited individual souls (\"Atman\" / \"Jivatman\"), and no separate unlimited cosmic soul. All souls and existence across space and time is considered as the same oneness (i.e. monism). Spiritual liberation in \"Advaita\" is the full comprehension and realization of oneness, that one's unchanging \"Atman\" (soul) is the same as the \"Atman\" in everyone else, as well as being identical to the \"nirguna\" \"Brahman\".\n\n\"Vishishtadvaita\" asserts that \"Jivatman\" (human souls) and \"Brahman\" (as \"Vishnu\") are different, a difference that is never transcended. With this qualification, Ramanuja also affirmed monism by saying that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the \"Brahman\". \"Vishishtadvaita\", like \"Advaita\", is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta in a qualified way, and both begin by assuming that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation. On the relation between the \"Brahman\" and the world of matter (\"Prakriti\"), \"Vishishtadvaita\" states both are two different absolutes, both metaphysically true and real, neither is false or illusive, and that \"saguna\" \"Brahman\" with attributes is also real. Ramanuja states that God, like man, has both soul and body, and the world of matter is the glory of God's body. The path to \"Brahman\" (\"Vishnu\"), according to Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of the personal god (\"bhakti\" of \"saguna\" \"Brahman\").\n\n\"Shuddhadvaita\" (pure non-dualism) states that the entire universe is real and is subtly \"Brahman\" only in the form of \"Krishna\". Vallabhacharya, the propounder of this philosophy, agreed with Advaita Vedanta's ontology, but emphasized that \"prakriti\" (empirical world, body) is not separate from the \"Brahman\", but just another manifestation of the latter. Everything, everyone, everywhere—soul and body, living and non-living, \"jiva\" and matter—is the eternal \"Krishna\". The way to \"Krishna\", in this school, is \"bhakti\". Vallabha opposed renunciation of monistic \"sannyasa\" as ineffective and advocates the path of devotion (\"bhakti\") rather than knowledge (\"jnana\"). The goal of \"bhakti\" is to turn away from ego, self-centered-ness and deception, and to turn towards the eternal \"Krishna\" in everything continually offering freedom from \"samsara\".\n\nThis school is based on the premise of dualism. \"Atman\" (soul) and \"Brahman\" (as \"Vishnu\") are understood as two completely different entities. \"Brahman\" is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter. In \"Dvaita\" Vedanta, an individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and complete devotional surrender to \"Vishnu\" for salvation, and it is only His grace that leads to redemption and salvation. Madhva believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned, a view not found in \"Advaita\" and \"Vishishtadvaita\" Vedanta. While the \"Vishishtadvaita\" Vedanta asserted \"qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls\", Madhva asserted both \"qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls\".\n\n\"Bhedābheda\" means \"difference and non–difference\" and is more a tradition than a school of Vedanta. The schools of this tradition emphasize that the individual self (\"Jīvatman\") is both different and not different from \"Brahman\". Notable figures in this school are Bhartriprapancha, Bhāskara (8th–9th century), Ramanuja's teacher Yādavaprakāśa, Nimbārka (13th century) who founded the Dvaitadvaita school, Caitanya (1486–1534) who founded the Achintya Bheda Abheda school and Vijñānabhikṣu (16th century). \n\nBhaskara, in postulating \"Upadhika\", considers both identity and difference to be equally real. As the causal principle, \"Brahman\" is considered non-dual and formless pure being and intelligence. The same \"Brahman\", manifest as events, becomes the world of plurality. \"\" is \"Brahman\" limited by the mind. Matter and its limitations are considered real, not a manifestation of ignorance. Bhaskara advocated \"bhakti\" as \"dhyana\" (meditation) directed toward the transcendental \"Brahman\". He refuted the idea of \"Maya\" and denied the possibility of liberation in bodily existence.\n\nNimbārka propounded \"Dvaitādvaita\", based upon Bhedābheda as was taught by Bhāskara. \"Brahman\" (God), souls \"(chit)\" and matter or the universe \"(achit)\" are considered as three equally real and co-eternal realities. \"Brahman\" is the controller \"(niyantr)\", the soul is the enjoyer \"(bhoktr)\", and the material universe is the object enjoyed \"(bhogya)\". The Brahman is \"Krishna\", the ultimate cause who is omniscient, omnipotent, all-pervading Being. He is the efficient cause of the universe because, as Lord of \"Karma\" and internal ruler of souls, He brings about creation so that the souls can reap the consequences of their \"karma\". God is considered to be the material cause of the universe because creation was a manifestation of His powers of soul \"(chit)\" and matter \"(achit)\"; creation is a transformation \"(parinama)\" of God's powers. He can be realized only through a constant effort to merge oneself with His nature through meditation and devotion. \n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu was the prime exponent of \"Achintya-Bheda-Abheda\". In Sanskrit \"achintya\" means 'inconceivable'. \"Achintya-Bheda-Abheda\" represents the philosophy of \"inconceivable difference in non-difference\", in relation to the non-dual reality of \"Brahman\"-\"Atman\" which it calls (\"Krishna\"), \"svayam bhagavan\". The notion of \"inconceivability\" (\"acintyatva\") is used to reconcile apparently contradictory notions in Upanishadic teachings. This school asserts that \"Krishna\" is \"Bhagavan\" of the \"bhakti yogins\", the \"Brahman\" of the \"jnana yogins\", and has a divine potency that is inconceivable. He is all-pervading and thus in all parts of the universe (non-difference), yet he is inconceivably more (difference). This school is at the foundation of the \"Gaudiya Vaishnava\" religious tradition.\n\nThe important approaches followed by the most noted proponents of different schools of Vedanta are summarized below:\n\nSivananda gives the following explanation:\nDespite their differences, all schools of Vedanta share some common features:\n\nVedanta philosophies discuss three fundamental metaphysical categories and the relations between the three.\n\nShankara, in formulating Advaita, talks of two conceptions of \"Brahman\": the higher \"Brahman\" as undifferentiated Being, and a lower \"Brahman\" endowed with qualities as the creator of the universe.\n\nRamanuja, in formulating Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, rejects \"nirguṇa\"—that the undifferentiated Absolute is inconceivable—and adopts a theistic interpretation of the \"Upanishads\", accepts \"Brahman\" as \"Ishvara\", the personal God who is the seat of all auspicious attributes, as the One reality. The God of Vishishtadvaita is accessible to the devotee, yet remains the Absolute, with differentiated attributes.\n\nMadhva, in expounding Dvaita philosophy, maintains that \"Vishnu\" is the supreme God, thus identifying the \"Brahman\", or absolute reality, of the \"Upanishads\" with a personal god, as Ramanuja had done before him. Nimbarka, in his dvaitadvata philosophy, accepted the \"Brahman\" both as \"nirguṇa\" and as \"saguṇa\". Vallabha, in his shuddhadvaita philosophy, not only accepts the triple ontological essence of the \"Brahman\", but also His manifestation as personal God (\"Ishvara\"), as matter and as individual souls.\n\nThe schools of Vedanta differ in their conception of the relation they see between \"Ātman\" / \"Jivātman\" and \"Brahman\" / \"Ishvara\":\n\n\"Pramāṇa\" (Sanskrit: प्रमाण) literally means \"proof\", \"that which is the means of valid knowledge\". It refers to epistemology in Indian philosophies, and encompasses the study of reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge. The focus of Pramana is the manner in which correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows or does not know, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six \"pramanas\" as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths:\nThe different schools of Vedanta have historically disagreed as to which of the six are epistemologically valid. For example, while Advaita Vedanta accepts all six \"pramanas\", Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita accept only three \"pramanas\" (perception, inference and testimony).\n\nAdvaita considers \"Pratyakṣa\" (perception) as the most reliable source of knowledge, and \"Śabda\", the scriptural evidence, is considered secondary except for matters related to Brahman, where it is the only evidence. In Vishistadvaita and Dvaita, \"Śabda\", the scriptural testimony, is considered the most authentic means of knowledge instead.\n\nAll schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of \"Satkāryavāda\", which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are two different views on the status of the \"effect\", that is, the world. Most schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya, support \"Parinamavada\", the idea that the world is a real transformation (\"parinama\") of Brahman. According to , \"the \"Brahma Sutras\" espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins\". In contrast to Badarayana, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedantists hold a different view, \"Vivartavada\", which says that the effect, the world, is merely an unreal (\"vivarta\") transformation of its cause, Brahman.\n\nVedanta, adopting ideas from other orthodox (\"āstika\") schools, became the most prominent school of Hinduism. Vedanta traditions led to the development of many traditions in Hinduism. Sri Vaishnavism of south and southeastern India is based on Ramanuja's \"Vishishtadvaita\" Vedanta. Ramananda led to the \"Vaishnav Bhakti\" Movement in north, east, central and west India. This movement draws its philosophical and theistic basis from \"Vishishtadvaita\". A large number of devotional \"Vaishnavism\" traditions of east India, north India (particularly the Braj region), west and central India are based on various sub-schools of \"Bhedabheda\" Vedanta. \"Advaita\" Vedanta influenced \"Krishna Vaishnavism\" in the northeastern state of Assam. The Madhva school of Vaishnavism found in coastal Karnataka is based on \"Dvaita\" Vedanta.\n\n\"Āgamas\", the classical literature of \"Shaivism\", though independent in origin, show Vedanta association and premises. Of the 92 \"Āgamas\", ten are (\"dvaita\") texts, eighteen (\"bhedabheda\"), and sixty-four (\"advaita\") texts. While the \"Bhairava Shastras\" are monistic, \"Shiva Shastras\" are dualistic. finds the link between Gaudapada's \"Advaita\" Vedanta and \"Kashmir Shaivism\" evident and natural. Tirumular, the Tamil \"Shaiva Siddhanta\" scholar, credited with creating \"Vedanta–Siddhanta\" (Advaita Vedanta and Shaiva Siddhanta synthesis), stated, \"becoming \"Shiva\" is the goal of Vedanta and \"Siddhanta\"; all other goals are secondary to it and are vain.\"\n\n\"Shaktism\", or traditions where a goddess is considered identical to \"Brahman\", has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of \"Advaita\" Vedanta and dualism premises of \"Samkhya–Yoga\" school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as \"Shaktadavaitavada\" (literally, the path of nondualistic \"Shakti\").\n\nNeo-Vedanta, variously called as \"Hindu modernism\", \"neo-Hinduism\", and \"neo-Advaita\", is a term that denotes some novel interpretations of Hinduism that developed in the 19th century, presumably as a reaction to the colonial British rule. writes that these notions accorded the Hindu nationalists an opportunity to attempt the construction of a nationalist ideology to help unite the Hindus to fight colonial oppression. Western orientalists, in their search for its \"essence\", attempted to formulate a notion of \"Hinduism\" based on a single interpretation of Vedanta as a unified body of religious praxis. This was contra-factual as, historically, Hinduism and Vedanta had always accepted a diversity of traditions. asserts that the neo-Vedantic theory of \"overarching tolerance and acceptance\" was used by the Hindu reformers, together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism, to challenge the polemic dogmatism of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic missionaries against the Hindus.\n\nThe neo-Vedantins argued that the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy were perspectives on a single truth, all valid and complementary to each other. sees these interpretations as incorporating western ideas into traditional systems, especially Advaita Vedanta. It is the modern form of Advaita Vedanta, states , the neo-Vedantists subsumed the Buddhist philosophies as part of the Vedanta tradition and then argued that all the world religions are same \"non-dualistic position as the philosophia perennis\", ignoring the differences within and outside of Hinduism. According to , neo-Vedanta is Advaita Vedanta which accepts universal realism:\n\nA major proponent in the popularization of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was Vivekananda, who played a major role in the revival of Hinduism. He was also instrumental in the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the Vedanta Society, the international arm of the Ramakrishna Order.\n\n writes that the attempts at integration which came to be known as neo-Vedanta were evident as early as between the 12th and the 16th century− Matilal criticizes Neo-Hinduism as an oddity developed by West-inspired Western Indologists and attributes it to the flawed Western perception of Hinduism in modern India. In his scathing criticism of this school of reasoning, says:\n\nAn exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia since the late 18th century as a result of colonization of parts of Asia by Western powers. This also influenced western religiosity. The first translation of \"Upanishads\", published in two parts in 1801 and 1802, significantly influenced Arthur Schopenhauer, who called them the consolation of his life. He drew explicit parallels between his philosophy, as set out in \"The World as Will and Representation\", and that of the Vedanta philosophy as described in the work of Sir William Jones. Early translations also appeared in other European languages. Influenced by Śaṅkara's concepts of \"Brahman\" (God) and \"māyā\" (illusion), Lucian Blaga often used the concepts \"marele anonim\" (the Great Anonymous) and \"cenzura transcendentă\" (the transcendental censorship) in his philosophy.\n\nAccording to , the Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism:\nFrithjof Schuon summarizes the influence of Vedanta on Hinduism as follows:\nGerman Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker was among the early scholars to notice similarities between the religious conceptions of the Vedanta and those of the Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza, writing that Spinoza's thought was\n\nMax Müller noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying,\n\nHelena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society, also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay,\n\n\n\n"}

Studied at Colegio Taforó in Santiago and later finishing high school education at the Instituto Nacional.\n\nDíaz was graduated as a medical surgeon in 1859, at the Universidad de Chile School of Medicine, when it was located on the building in the intersection of San Francisco and Las Delicias, the current Libertador General Bernardo O’Higgins Avenue. Two years later, he graduated as a Bachelor in Physical Sciences and Mathematics at the same University. He studied many diverse disciplines such as medicine, archeology, geology, seismology, climatology, ethnography and philosophy, and specialized in health geography, considered a prerequisite to specialization in parasitology and tropical diseases. His specialization allowed him to lead the sanitary commission to help the victims of the 1861 Mendoza earthquake.\n\nIn 1873 he was appointed head of the chair of internal medicine at the Universidad de Chile School of Medicine. From that position he pushed the introduction of modern medical instruments like the thermometer and the hypodermic syringe, which was used to administer morphine, atropine and cocaine in the treatment of patients. Both had never been used before in the country.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1880 he was dean of the Faculty of Medicine, where he worked on the design of a new building for the faculty, but he had to leave the project after the outbreak of the War of the Pacific (1879-1883).\n\nDuring the conflict he took over as Director of the Army Health Service, where he also innovated in hospital systems. After the war, he was one of the leaders in controlling the Asian Cholera epidemic that affected Chile in 1887. He described the main characteristics and consequences of the disease in the medical report “Memory of the Cholera Health Service Directive Commission 1887-1888”.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Medical Society of Santiago (1869) and one of the editors of the first issue of its journal, the Revista Médica de Chile (1872). He was also a member of the Society of Pharmacy of Chile, the Surgical Medical Society, the Society of Archeology of Santiago and physician of the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Santiago.\n\nDíaz also stood out as a great connoisseur of the Greek, Latin and Spanish classics. Also a philologist and linguist, he possessed notions of Greek, Latin and other languages. He also studied the native Latin American languages, especially the Mapuche, Quechua and Aymará.\n"}
{"id": "984020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=984020", "title": "What the Bleep Do We Know!?", "text": "What the Bleep Do We Know!?\n\nWhat the Bleep Do We Know!? (stylized as What tнē #$*! D̄ө ωΣ (k)πow!? and What the #$*! Do We Know!?, with \"Bleep\" being a pronounceable placeholder for a grawlix) is a 2004 American film that combines documentary-style interviews, computer-animated graphics, and a narrative that posits a spiritual connection between quantum physics and consciousness. The plot follows the fictional story of a photographer as she encounters emotional and existential obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the material world. Her experiences are offered by the filmmakers to illustrate the film's thesis about quantum physics and consciousness. The 2004 theatrical release was succeeded by a substantially changed, extended home media version in 2006.\n\n\"Bleep\" was conceived and its production funded by William Arntz, who co-directed the film along with Betsy Chasse and Mark Vicente; all three were students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. A moderately low-budget independent film, it was promoted using viral marketing methods and opened in art-house theaters in the western United States, winning several independent film awards before being picked up by a major distributor and eventually grossing over $10 million.\n\nThe film has been described as an example of quantum mysticism, and has been criticized for both misrepresenting science and containing pseudoscience. While many of its interviewees and subjects are professional scientists in the fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering, several have noted that the film quotes them out of context.\n\nFilmed in Portland, Oregon, \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" presents a viewpoint of the physical universe and human life within it, with connections to neuroscience and quantum physics. Some ideas discussed in the film are:\n\nIn the narrative segments of the movie, Marlee Matlin portrays Amanda, a photographer who plays the role of everywoman as she experiences her life from startlingly new and different perspectives.\n\nIn the documentary segments of the film, interviewees discuss the roots and meaning of Amanda's experiences. The comments focus primarily on a single theme: \"We create our own reality.\" The director, William Arntz, has described \"What the Bleep\" as a movie for the \"metaphysical left\".\n\n\nWork was split between Toronto-based Mr. X Inc., Lost Boys Studios in Vancouver, and Atomic Visual Effects in Cape Town, South Africa. The visual-effects team, led by Evan Jacobs, worked closely with the other film-makers to create visual metaphors that would capture the essence of the film's technical subjects with attention to aesthetic detail.\n\nLacking the funding and resources of the typical Hollywood film, the filmmakers relied on \"guerrilla marketing\" first to get the film into theaters, and then to attract audiences. This has led to accusations, both formal and informal, directed towards the film's proponents, of spamming online message boards and forums with many thinly veiled promotional posts. Initially, the film was released in only two theaters: one in Yelm, Washington (the home of the producers, which is also the home of Ramtha), and the other the Bagdad Theater in Portland, Oregon, where it was filmed. Within several weeks, the film had appeared in a dozen or more theaters (mostly in the western United States), and within six months it had made its way into 200 theaters across the US.\n\nAccording to the makers of the film, \"Bleep\" is an expurgation of \"fuck\". William Arntz has referred to the film as \"WTFDWK\" in a message to the film's street team.\n\nThe Institute of Noetic Sciences, a New Age research organization that \"explores phenomena that do not necessarily fit conventional scientific models\", has supported \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" and published a study guide.\n\nAccording to \"Publishers Weekly\", the movie was one of the sleeper hits of 2004, as \"word-of-mouth and strategic marketing kept it in theaters for an entire year.\" The article states that the domestic gross exceeded $10 million, described as not bad for a low-budget documentary, and that the DVD release attained even more significant success with over a million units shipped in the first six months following its release in March 2005. Foreign gross added another $5 million for a worldwide gross of nearly $16 million.\n\nIn the \"Publishers Weekly\" article, publicist Linda Rienecker of \"New Page Books\" says that she sees the film's success as part of a wider phenomenon, stating \"A large part of the population is seeking spiritual connections, and they have the whole world to choose from now\". Author Barrie Dolnick adds that \"people don't want to learn how to do one thing. They'll take a little bit of Buddhism, a little bit of veganism, a little bit of astrology... They're coming into the marketplace hungry for direction, but they don't want some person who claims to have all the answers. They want suggestions, not formulas.\" The same article quotes Bill Pfau, Advertising Manager of Inner Traditions, as saying \"More and more ideas from the New Age community have become accepted into the mainstream.\"\n\nFilm critics offered mixed reviews as seen on the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes, where it was classified as \"Rotten\", with an average score of 4.6/10 based on 77 reviews. In his review of the movie, Dave Kehr of the \"New York Times\" described the \"transition from quantum mechanics to cognitive therapy\" as \"plausible\", but stated also that \"the subsequent leap—from cognitive therapy into large, hazy spiritual beliefs—isn't as effectively executed. Suddenly people who were talking about subatomic particles are alluding to alternate universes and cosmic forces, all of which can be harnessed in the interest of making Ms. Matlin's character feel better about her thighs.\"\n\n\"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" has been described as \"a kind of New Age answer to \"The Passion of the Christ\" and other films that adhere to traditional religious teachings.\" It offers alternative spirituality views characteristic of New Age philosophy, including critiques of the competing claims of stewardship among traditional religions [viz., institutional Judaism, Christianity, and Islam] of universally recognized and accepted moral values.\n\nScientists who have reviewed \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" have described distinct assertions made in the film as pseudoscience. Lisa Randall refers to the film as \"the bane of scientists\". Amongst the assertions in the film that have been challenged are that water molecules can be influenced by thought (as popularized by Masaru Emoto), that meditation can reduce violent crime rates, and that quantum physics implies that \"consciousness is the ground of all being.\" The film was also discussed in a letter published in \"Physics Today\" that challenges how physics is taught, saying teaching fails to \"expose the mysteries physics has encountered [and] reveal the limits of our understanding\". In the letter, the authors write: \"the movie illustrates the uncertainty principle with a bouncing basketball being in several places at once. There's nothing wrong with that. It's recognized as pedagogical exaggeration. But the movie gradually moves to quantum 'insights' that lead a woman to toss away her antidepressant medication, to the quantum channeling of Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior, and on to even greater nonsense.\" It went on to say that \"Most laypeople cannot tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins, and many are susceptible to being misguided,\" and that \"a physics student may be unable to convincingly confront unjustified extrapolations of quantum mechanics,\" a shortcoming which the authors attribute to the current teaching of quantum mechanics, in which \"we tacitly deny the mysteries physics has encountered\".\n\nRichard Dawkins stated that \"the authors seem undecided whether their theme is quantum theory or consciousness. Both are indeed mysterious, and their genuine mystery needs none of the hype with which this film relentlessly and noisily belabours us\", concluding that the film is \"tosh\". Professor Clive Greated wrote that \"thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message\". Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the movie, stating: \"I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK as it has in the US. Science and engineering are important for our future, and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing.\" Simon Singh called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion \"that if observing water changes its molecular structure, and if we are 90% water, then by observing ourselves we can change at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics\" was \"ridiculous balderdash\". According to João Magueijo, professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a \"pseudoscientific docudrama\", saying \"Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought.\"\n\nBernie Hobbs, a science writer with ABC Science Online, explains why the movie is incorrect about quantum physics and reality: \"The observer effect of quantum physics isn't about people or reality. It comes from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and it's about the limitations of trying to measure the position and momentum of subatomic particles... this only applies to sub-atomic particles—a rock doesn't need you to bump into it to exist. It's there. The sub-atomic particles that make up the atoms that make up the rock are there too.\" Hobbs also discusses Hagelin's experiment with Transcendental Meditation and the Washington DC rate of violent crime, saying that \"the number of murders actually went up\". Hobbs further disputed the film's use of the ten percent of the brain myth.\n\nDavid Albert, a philosopher of physics who appears in the film, has accused the filmmakers of selectively editing his interview to make it appear that he endorses the film's thesis that quantum mechanics is linked with consciousness. He says he is \"profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness\". These issues relate to the so-called Quantum mind-body problem.\n\nIn the film, during a discussion of the influence of experience on perception, Candace Pert notes a story, which she says she believes is true, of Native Americans being unable to see Columbus's ships because they were outside their experience. According to an article in \"Fortean Times\" by David Hambling, the origins of this story likely involved the voyages of Captain James Cook, not Columbus, and an account related by Robert Hughes which said Cook's ships were \"...complex and unfamiliar as to defy the natives' understanding\". Hambling says it is likely that both the Hughes account and the story told by Pert were exaggerations of the records left by Captain Cook and the botanist Joseph Banks.\n\nSkeptic James Randi described the film as \"a fantasy docudrama\" and \"[a] rampant example of abuse by charlatans and cults\". Eric Scerri in a review for Committee for Skeptical Inquiry dismisses it as \"a hodgepodge of all kinds of crackpot nonsense,\" where \"science [is] distorted and sensationalized\". A BBC reviewer described it as \"a documentary aimed at the totally gullible\".\n\nAccording to Margaret Wertheim, \"History abounds with religious enthusiasts who have read spiritual portent into the arrangement of the planets, the vacuum of space, electromagnetic waves and the big bang. But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism.\" Wertheim continues that the movie \"abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of quantum mysticism, finding in this aleatory description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film's characters gushes early in the proceedings, 'The moment we acknowledge the quantum self, we say that somebody has become enlightened'. A moment in which 'the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics [...] are stripped of all empirical content and reduced to a set of syrupy nostrums'.\"\n\nJournalist John Gorenfeld, writing in \"Salon\", notes that the film's three directors are students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, which he says has been described as a cult.\n\nIn mid-2005, the filmmakers worked with HCI Books to expand on the film's themes in a book titled \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?—Discovering the Endless Possibilities of Your Everyday Reality\". HCI president Peter Vegso stated that in regard to this book, \"What the Bleep is the quantum leap in the New Age world,\" and \"by marrying science and spirituality, it is the foundation of future thought.\"\n\nOn August 1, 2006 \"What the Bleep! Down the Rabbit Hole - Quantum Edition\" multi-disc DVD set was released, containing two extended versions of \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?,\" with over 15 hours of material on three double-sided DVDs.\n\nThe film features interview segments of:\n\n\n\n"}
