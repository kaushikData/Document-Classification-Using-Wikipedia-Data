{"id": "5086912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5086912", "title": "1 Corinthians 13", "text": "1 Corinthians 13\n\n1 Corinthians 13 is the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle and Sosthenes in Ephesus. This chapter covers the subject of \"love.\" In the original Greek, the word ἀγάπη \"agape\" is used throughout. This is translated into English as \"charity\" in the King James version; but the word \"love\" is preferred by most other translations, both earlier and more recent.\n\n\n\"New King James Version -\"\n\n1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love I am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and can understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have faith, that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 And though I give all I possess to the poor, and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.\n\n4 Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\n\n8 Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.\n\n11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see in a mirror, darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.\n\n13 And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\n\nThis chapter of 1 Corinthians is one of many definitional sources for the word \"agape\" when used to refer to divine love. Introducing his homage to love in , Paul describes \"agape\" as \"a more excellent way\".\n\n1 Corinthians 13:12 contains the phrase βλέπομεν γὰρ ἄρτι δι' ἐσόπτρου ἐν αἰνίγματι (\"blepomen gar arti di esoptrou en ainigmati\"), which was translated in the 1560 Geneva Bible as \"For now we see through a glass darkly\" (without a comma), which wording was used in the 1611 KJV, which added a comma before \"darkly\". This passage has inspired the titles of many works, with or without the comma.\n\nThe word ἐσόπτρου \"esoptrou\" (genitive; nominative: ἔσοπτρον \"esoptron\"), here translated \"glass\", is ambiguous, possibly referring to a mirror or a lens. Influenced by Strong's Concordance, many modern translations conclude that this word refers specifically to a mirror. Example English-language translations include:\nPaul's usage is in keeping with rabbinic use of the term אספקלריה (\"aspaklaria\"), a borrowing from the Latin \"specularia\". This has the same ambiguous meaning, although Adam Clarke concluded that it was a reference to \"specularibus lapidibus\", clear polished stones used as lenses or windows. One way to preserve this ambiguity is to use the English cognate, \"speculum\". Rabbi Judah ben Ilai (2nd century) was quoted as saying \"All the prophets had a vision of God as He appeared through nine specula\" while \"Moses saw God through one speculum.\" The Babylonian Talmud states similarly \"All the prophets gazed through a speculum that does not shine, while Moses our teacher gazed through a speculum that shines.\"\n\nThere are other passages from 1 Corinthians 13 that have been notably influential.\n\nPerhaps the most significant portion of 1 Corinthians 13 is the revered passage that defines love and indicates how Christians should love others.\n\n1 Corinthians 13, verse 1: \"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.\"\n\nBob Dylan paraphrases verse 1 in his song 'Dignity': \"I heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men... wasn't any difference to me.\"\n\n1 Corinthians 13, verses 4-8, and 13: \"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. ...And now these three remain: Faith, Hope, and Love. But the greatest of these is Love.\" (New International Version)\n\nThe passage is frequently read during wedding ceremonies.\n\nThe first sentence of this passage is used as a refrain at the end of the song \"Same Love\" by Macklemore.\n\nThe passage is also used in the song \"Pag-ibig\" by Yeng Constantino.\n\nIn the King James Version, instead of \"love\", the word was \"charity\".\n\nThe verse was used in the 1995 anime, \"Ghost in the Shell\", at time 1:17:21.\n\nThe verse is quoted by Matthew Lillard in the 1995 film \"Hackers\", at time 01:03:03\n\nThe verse is quoted by former slave trader Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro), when he is admitted into the Jesuit order in the 1986 film \"The Mission\".\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama referenced verse 11 in his to the nation on January 20, 2009.\n\nThe verse is quoted by Dakin Matthews in the 1991 film, \"Child's Play 3\"\n\nThis verse is quoted by the character Wilson in the sitcom Home Improvement|\"Home Improvement\" on the episode \"For Whom the Belch Tolls\"\n\nThe verse is quoted by Todd Rundgren in the song \"Real Man\" from his 1975 album \"Initiation\"\n\nThe verse is referenced in Episode 34 of Season 2 of \"In Treatment\". The character Walter says that his parents' grief after the death of his brother forced him to 'put away childish things'. Walter's therapist Paul Weston notes that, unlike the narrator of Corinthians, Walter was still a boy and not yet a man when this happened.\n\nVerse 13, in praise of the Theological virtues:\n\nUS President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the oath at his inauguration in 1933, with his hand on his family Bible, open to 1 Corinthians 13.\n\nVerse 13 is paraphrased in country singer Alan Jackson's 2001 hit \"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)\".\n\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair read 1 Corinthians 13 at the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.\n\n1 Corinthians 13, verses 2,3,4,11 and 13: are introspectively digested aloud by ex-slave-trader mercenary, transitioned to Jesuit missionary, Rodrigo Mendoza (played by Robert DeNiro) in the Robert Bolt penned 1986 cinematographic Oscar winner \"The Mission\", directed by Roland Joffé, at time 48:02.\n\n of the film \"\" composed by Zbigniew Preisner features a solo soprano singing the epistle in Greek (in a piece titled \"Song for the Unification of Europe\").\n\nThe paragraphs 1-3 and 12-13 of the text are cited for the fourth song of the \"Vier ernste Gesänge\" by Johannes Brahms.\n\nThe Renaissance composer Orlando di Lasso set verses 11-13 in his sacred motet \"Cum essem parvulus.\"\n\nA paraphrase of the text is the basis for the song \"Love Is the Law\" composed and sung by Australian musician Paul Kelly.\n\nSymphony No.6 \"Liturgical\" for baritone, choir and orchestra by Andrei Yakovlevich Eshpai (1989).\nJoni Mitchell uses much of the text in 20th-century vernacular, including \"through a glass darkly\" in her song \"Love\" from her 1982 album \"Wild Things Run Fast\", and fully -and dramatically -orchestrated on her 2002 retrospective \"Travelogue\".\n\nThe Rolling Stones paraphrase the verse in the title of their 1969 compilation album \"Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)\".\n\nMacklemore uses the verse \"Love is patient. Love is kind\" in his 2012 song, \"Same Love\".\n\nVideo game developer Arkane Studios paraphrased the title of Lewis Carroll's book by linking it with the verse, as the title for a chapter in their game \"Prey\": \"Through the Looking Glass Darkly\".\n\nThe text is drawn on / paraphrased in Lauryn Hill's song 'Tell Him' hidden on 'The Miseducation Of ...\"\n\nCar Seat Headrest uses verses 8-12 at the end of the song \"Famous Prophets (Stars)\" on the album \"Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)\".\n\nJames Baldwin quotes verse 11 in the fifth to last paragraph of \"Giovani's Room\".\n\nThrice uses verbiage from in the song Moving Mountains.\n\nThe lyrics of Legião Urbana's song \"Monte Castelo\" are a mix of this text and Camões' \"Sonnet 11\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14039556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14039556", "title": "Atopy (philosophy)", "text": "Atopy (philosophy)\n\nAtopy (Greek \"ατοπία, atopía - placelessness, unclassifiable, of high originality\"; Socrates has often been called \"átopos\") describes the ineffability of things or emotions that are seldom experienced, that are outstanding and that are original in the strict sense. The term depicts a certain quality (of experience) that can be observed within oneself or within others. It does not depict an ideal, although it has been abused to do so, for example by the \"genius-cult\" during the era of romanticism.\n\nA human being in love, no matter at whom or what his adoration and affection is pointed at—be it a beloved person, a god in some mystical sense or an idol—is not able to reduce the \"item\" of his love down to certain characteristics, he claims his \"obscure object of desire\" to be unique and incomparable.\n\nThe attribution of characteristics from the banal everyday world would, in the eye of the one being seriously in love, mean betrayal (sacrilege) to the very own love itself. Up until now, no one has managed to describe and analyze this more strikingly than Roland Barthes in his famous and acclaimed collection of essays \"\", published in 1977. But if you look at it more closely, this is an everyday phenomenon each and every mere mortal is encountering: parents can describe, praise or curse the relation between them and their children—but they realize at the same time that the depth and the profoundness of their feelings for their offspring are atopical, or ineffable.\n\nNatural religions, like mysticism, therefore talk about \"Tao\", about the \"original\" and the \"pristine\"; in the field of ontological philosophy and theology it is called \"richness of being\". The rather sensual, mundane and secular poetry speaks of cornucopia (also see: cornucopian), or, more prosaically of \"inspiration\". In the field of science, especially in psychological sciences, this phenomenon is being researched under the leading definition of creativity or as \"Flow\".\n\nMost adults are familiar with atopy, having experienced the view on the world through \"rose-tinted glasses\" in phases of limerence. Art lovers know it as genius and as something auratic, readers as \"Thou shalt not make for thyself an idol\" in Max Frisch's \"Stiller\", which refers to the notion of God from the \"Ten Commandments\", or \"Geschichten von Herrn Keuner\" by Bertold Brecht.\n\n"}
{"id": "1907447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1907447", "title": "Benjamin Fondane", "text": "Benjamin Fondane\n\nBenjamin Fondane () or Benjamin Fundoianu (; born Benjamin Wechsler, Wexler or Vecsler, first name also Beniamin or Barbu, usually abridged to B.; November 14, 1898 – October 2, 1944) was a Romanian and French poet, critic and existentialist philosopher, also noted for his work in film and theater. Known from his Romanian youth as a Symbolist poet and columnist, he alternated Neoromantic and Expressionist themes with echoes from Tudor Arghezi, and dedicated several poetic cycles to the rural life of his native Moldavia. Fondane, who was of Jewish Romanian extraction and a nephew of Jewish intellectuals Elias and Moses Schwartzfeld, participated in both minority secular Jewish culture and mainstream Romanian culture. During and after World War I, he was active as a cultural critic, avant-garde promoter and, with his brother-in-law Armand Pascal, manager of the theatrical troupe \"Insula\".\n\nFondane began a second career in 1923, when he moved to Paris. Affiliated with Surrealism, but strongly opposed to its communist leanings, he moved on to become a figure in Jewish existentialism and a leading disciple of Lev Shestov. His critique of political dogma, rejection of rationalism, expectation of historical catastrophe and belief in the soteriological force of literature were outlined in his celebrated essays on Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, as well as in his final works of poetry. His literary and philosophical activities helped him build close relationships with other intellectuals: Shestov, Emil Cioran, David Gascoyne, Jacques Maritain, Victoria Ocampo, Ilarie Voronca etc. In parallel, Fondane also had a career in cinema: a film critic and a screenwriter for Paramount Pictures, he later worked on \"Rapt\" with Dimitri Kirsanoff, and directed the since-lost film \"Tararira\" in Argentina.\n\nA prisoner of war during the fall of France, Fondane was released and spent the occupation years in clandestinity. He was eventually captured and handed to Nazi German authorities, who deported him to Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was sent to the gas chamber during the last wave of the Holocaust. His work was largely rediscovered later in the 20th century, when it became the subject of scholarly research and public curiosity in both France and Romania. In the latter country, this revival of interest also sparked a controversy over copyright issues.\n\nFondane was born in Iași, the cultural capital of Moldavia, on November 14, 1898, but, as he noted in a diary he kept at age 16, his birthday was officially recorded as November 15. Fondane was the only son of Isac Wechsler and his wife Adela (née Schwartzfeld), who also bore the sisters Lina (b. 1892) and Rodica (b. 1905), both of whom had careers in acting. Wechsler was a Jewish man from Hertza region, his ancestors having been born on the \"Fundoaia\" estate (which the poet later used as the basis for his signature). Adela was from an intellectual family, of noted influence within the urban Jewish community: her father, poet B. Schwartzfeld, was the owner of a book collection, while her uncles Elias and Moses both had careers in humanities. Adela herself was well acquainted with the intellectual elite of Iași, Jewish as well as ethnic Romanian, and kept recollections of her encounters with authors linked with the \"Junimea\" society. Through Moses Schwartzfeld, Fondane was also related with socialist journalist Avram Steuerman-Rodion, one of the literary men who nurtured the boy's interest in literature.\n\nThe young Benjamin was an avid reader, primarily interested in the Moldavian classics of Romanian literature (Ion Neculce, Miron Costin, Dosoftei, Ion Creangă), Romanian traditionalists or Neoromantics (Vasile Alecsandri, Ion Luca Caragiale, George Coșbuc, Mihai Eminescu) and French Symbolists. In 1909, after graduating from School No. 1 (an annex of the Trei Ierarhi Monastery), he was admitted into the Alexandru cel Bun secondary school, where he did not excel as a student. A restless youth (he recalled having had his first love affair at age 12, with a girl six years his senior), Fondane twice failed to get his remove before the age of 14.\n\nBenjamin divided his time between the city and his father's native region. The latter's rural landscape impressed him greatly, and, enduring in his memory, became the setting in several of his poems. The adolescent Fondane took extended trips throughout northern Moldavia, making his debut in folkloristics by writing down samples of the narrative and poetic tradition in various Romanian-inhabited localities. Among his childhood friends was the future Yiddish-language writer B. Iosif, with whom he spent his time in Iași's Podul Vechi neighborhood. In this context, Fondane also met Yiddishist poet Iacob Ashel Groper—an encounter which shaped Fondane's intellectual perspectives on Judaism and Jewish history. At the time, Fondane became known to his family and friends as \"Mielușon\" (from \"miel\", Romanian for \"lamb\", and probably in reference to his bushy hairdo), a name which he later used as a colloquial pseudonym.\n\nAlthough Fondane later claimed to have started writing poetry at age eight, his earliest known contributions to the genre date from 1912, including both pieces of his own and translations from such authors as André Chénier, Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff, Heinrich Heine and Henri de Régnier. The same year, some of these were published, under the pseudonym \"I. G. Ofir\", in the local literary review \"Floare Albastră\", whose owner, A. L. Zissu, was later a noted novelist and Zionist political figure. Later research proposed that these, like some other efforts of the 1910s, were collective poetry samples, resulting from a collaboration between Fondane and Groper (the former was probably translating the latter's poetic motifs into Romanian). In 1913, Fondane also tried his hand at editing a student journal, signing his editorial with the pen name \"Van Doian\", but only produced several handwritten copies of a single issue.\n\nFondane's actual debut dates back to 1914, during the time when he became a student at the National High School Iași and formally affiliated with the provincial branch of the nationwide Symbolist movement. That year, samples of lyric poetry were also published in the magazines \"Valuri\" and \"Revista Noastră\" (whose owner, writer Constanța Hodoș, even offered Fondane a job on the editorial board, probably unaware that she was corresponding with a high school student). Also in 1914, the Moldavian Symbolist venue \"Absolutio\", edited by Isac Ludo, featured pieces he signed with the pen name \"I. Hașir\". Among his National High School colleagues was Alexandru Al. Philippide, the future critic, who remained one of Fondane's best friends (and whose poetry Fondane proposed for publishing in \"Revista Noastră\"). Late in 1914, Fondane also began his short collaboration with the Iași Symbolist tribune \"Vieața Nouă\". While several of his poems were published there, the review's founder Ovid Densusianu issued objections to their content, and, in their subsequent correspondence, each writer outlines his stylistic disagreements with the other.\n\nDuring the first two years of World War I and Romania's neutrality, the young poet established new contacts within the literary environments of Iași and Bucharest. According to his brother-in-law and biographer Paul Daniel, \"it is amazing how many pages of poetry, translations, prose, articles, chronicles have been written by Fundoianu in this interval.\" In 1915, four of his patriotic-themed poems were published on the front page of \"Dimineața\" daily, which campaigned for Romanian intervention against the Central Powers (they were the first of several contributions Fondane signed with the pen name \"Alex. Vilara\", later \n\"Al. Vilara\"). His parallel contribution to the Bârlad-based review \"Revista Critică\" (originally, \"Cronica Moldovei\") was more strenuous: Fondane declared himself indignant that the editorial staff would not send him the galley proofs, and received instead an irritated reply from manager Al. Ștefănescu; he was eventually featured with poems in three separate issues of \"Revista Critică\". At around that time, he also wrote a memoir of his childhood, \"Note dintr-un confesional\" (\"Notes from a Confessional\").\n\nAround 1915, Fondane was discovered by the journalistic tandem of Tudor Arghezi and Gala Galaction, both of whom were also modernist authors, left-wing militants and Symbolist promoters. The pieces Fondane sent to Arghezi and Galaction's \"Cronica\" paper were received with enthusiasm, a reaction which surprised and impressed the young author. Although his poems went unpublished, his Iași-themed article \"A doua capitală\" (\"The Second Capital\"), signed \"Al. Vilara\", was featured in an April 1916 issue. A follower of Arghezi, he was personally involved in raising awareness about Arghezi's unpublished verse, the \"Agate negre\" (\"Black Diamonds\") cycle.\n\nRemaining close friends with Fondane, Galaction later made persistent efforts of introducing him to critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, with the purpose of having him published by the Poporanist \"Viața Românească\" review, but Ibrăileanu refused to recognize Fondane as an affiliate. Fondane had more success in contacting \"Flacăra\" review and its publisher Constantin Banu: on July 23, 1916, it hosted his sonnet \"Eglogă marină\" (\"Marine Eglogue\"). Between 1915 and 1923, Fondane also had a steady contribution to Romanian-language Jewish periodicals (\"Lumea Evree\", \"Bar-Kochba\", \"Hasmonaea\", \"Hatikvah\"), where he published translations from international representatives of Yiddish literature (Hayim Nahman Bialik, Semyon Frug, Abraham Reisen etc.) under the signatures \"B. Wechsler\", \"B. Fundoianu\" and \"F. Benjamin\". Fondane also completed work on a translation of the \"Ahasverus\" drama, by the Jewish author Herman Heijermans.\nHis collaboration with the Bucharest-based \"Rampa\" (at the time a daily newspaper) also began in 1915, with his debut as theatrical chronicler, and later with his Carpathian-themed series in the travel writing genre, \"Pe drumuri de munte\" (\"On Mountain Roads\"). With almost one signed or unsigned piece per issue over the following years, Fondane was one of the more prolific contributors to that newspaper, and frequently made use of either pseudonyms (\"Diomed\", \"Dio\", \"Funfurpan\", \"Const. Meletie\") or initials (\"B. F.\", \"B. Fd.\", \"fd.\"). These included his January 1916 positive review of \"Plumb\", the first major work by Romania's celebrated Symbolist poet, George Bacovia.\n\nIn 1917, after Romania joined the Entente side and was invaded by the Central Powers, Fondane was in Iași, where the Romanian authorities had retreated. It was in this context that he met and befriended the doyen of Romanian Symbolism, poet Ion Minulescu. Minulescu and his wife, author Claudia Millian, had left their home in occupied Bucharest, and, by spring 1917, hosted Fondane at their provisional domicile in Iași. Millian later recalled that her husband had been much impressed by the Moldavian teenager, describing him as \"a rare bird\" and \"a poet of talent\". The same year, at age 52, Isac Wechsler fell ill with typhus and died in Iași's Sfântul Spiridon Hospital, leaving his family without financial support.\n\nAt around that time, Fondane began work on the poetry cycle \"Priveliști\" (\"Sights\" or \"Panoramas\", finished in 1923). In 1918, he became one of the contributors to the magazine \"Chemarea\", published in Iași by the leftist journalist N. D. Cocea, with help from Symbolist writer Ion Vinea. In the political climate marked by the Peace of Bucharest and Romania's remilitarization, Fondane used Cocea's publication to protest against the arrest of Arghezi, who had been accused of collaborationism with the Central Powers. In this context, Fondane spoke of Arghezi as being \"Romania's greatest contemporary poet\" (a verdict which was later to be approved of by mainstream critics). According to one account, Fondane also worked briefly as a fact checker for \"Arena\", a periodical managed by Vinea and N. Porsenna. His time with \"Chemarea\" also resulted in the publication of his Biblical-themed short story \"Tăgăduința lui Petru\" (\"Peter's Denial\"). Issued by \"Chemarea\"s publishing house in 41 bibliophile copies (20 of which remained in Fondane's possession), it opened with the tract \"O lămurire despre simbolism\" (\"An Explanation of Symbolism\").\n\nIn 1919, upon the war's end, Benjamin Fondane settled in Bucharest, where he stayed until 1923. During this interval, he frequently changed domicile: after a stay at his sister Lina's home in Obor area, he moved on Lahovari Street (near Piața Romană), then in Moșilor area, before relocating to Văcărești (a majority Jewish residential area, where he lived in two successive locations), and ultimately to a house a short distance away from Foișorul de Foc. Between these changes of address, he established contacts with the Symbolist and avant-garde society of Bucharest: a personal friend of graphic artist Iosif Ross, he formed an informal avant-garde circle of his own, attended by writers F. Brunea-Fox, Ion Călugăru, Henri Gad, Sașa Pană, Claude Sernet-Cosma and Ilarie Voronca, as well as by artist-director Armand Pascal (who, in 1920, married Lina Fundoianu). Pană would later note his dominant status within the group, describing him as the \"stooping green-eyed youth from Iași, the standard-bearer of the iconoclasts and rebels of the new generation\".\n\nThe group was occasionally joined by other friends, among them Millian and painter Nicolae Tonitza. In addition, Fondane and Călugăru frequented the artistic and literary club established by the controversial Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, a cultural promoter and political militant whose influence spread over several Symbolist milieus. In a 1922 piece for \"Rampa\", he remembered Bogdan-Pitești in ambivalent terms: \"he could not stand moral elevation. [...] He was made of the greatest of joys, in the most purulent of bodies. How many generations of ancient boyars had come to pass, like unworthy dung, for this singular earth to be generated?\"\n\nPressed on by his family and the prospects of financial security, Fondane contemplated becoming a lawyer. Having passed his baccalaureate examination in Bucharest, he was, according to his own account, a registered student at the University of Iași Law School, obtaining a graduation certificate but prevented from becoming a licentiate by the opposition of faculty member A. C. Cuza, the antisemitic political figure. According to a recollection of poet Adrian Maniu, Fondane again worked as a fact checker for some months after his arrival to the capital. His activity as a journalist also allowed him to interview Arnold Davidovich Margolin, statesman of the defunct Ukrainian People's Republic, with whom he discussed the fate of Ukrainian Jews before and after the Soviet Russian takeover.\n\nOver the following years, he restarted his career in the press, contributing to various nationally circulated newspapers: \"Adevărul\", \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", \"Cuvântul Liber\", \"Mântuirea\", etc. The main topics of his interest were literary reviews, essays reviewing the contribution of Romanian and French authors, various art chronicles, and opinion pieces on social or cultural issues. A special case was his collaboration with \"Mântuirea\", a Zionist periodical founded by Zissu, where, between August and October 1919, he published his studies collection \"Iudaism și elenism\" (\"Judaism and Hellenism\"). These pieces, alternating with similar articles by Galaction, showed how the young man's views in cultural anthropology had been shaped by his relationship with Groper (with whom he nevertheless severed all contacts by 1920).\n\nFondane also renewed his collaboration with \"Rampa\". He and another contributor to the magazine, journalist Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște, carried out a debate in the magazine's pages: Fondane's articles defended Romanian Symbolism against criticism from Teodorescu-Braniște, and offered glimpse into his personal interpretation of Symbolist attitudes. One piece he wrote in 1919, titled \"Noi, simboliștii\" (\"Us Symbolists\") stated his proud affiliation to the current (primarily defined by him as an artistic transposition of eternal idealism), and comprised the slogan: \"We are too many not to be strong, and too few not to be intelligent.\" In May 1920, another of his \"Rampa\" contributions spoke out against Octavian Goga, Culture Minister of the Alexandru Averescu executive, who contemplated sacking George Bacovia from his office of clerk. The same year, \"Lumea Evree\" published his verse drama fragment \"Monologul lui Baltazar\" (\"Belshazzar's Soliloquy\").\n\nAround the time of his relocation to Bucharest, Fondane first met the moderate modernist critic Eugen Lovinescu, and afterward became both an affiliate of Lovinescu's circle and a contributor to his literary review \"Sburătorul\". Among his first contributions there was a retrospective coverage of the boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier, which comprised his reflections on the mythical power of sport and the clash of cultures. Although a \"Sburătorist\", he was still in contact with Galaction and the left-wing circles. In June 1921, Galaction paid homage to \"the daring Benjamin\" in an article for \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", calling attention to Fondane's \"overwhelming originality.\"\n\nA year later, Fondane was employed by Vinea's new venue, the prestigious modernist venue \"Contimporanul\". Having debuted in its first issue with a comment on Romanian translation projects (\"Ferestre spre Occident\", \"Windows on the Occident\"), he was later assigned the theatrical column. Fondane's work was again featured in \"Flacăra\" magazine (at the time under Minulescu's direction): the poem \"Ce simplu\" (\"How Simple\") and the essay \"Istoria Ideii\" (\"The History of the Idea\") were both published there in 1922. The same year, with assistance from fellow novelist Felix Aderca, Fondane grouped his earlier essays on French literature as \"Imagini și cărți din Franța\" (\"Images and Books from France\"), published by Editura Socec company. The book included what was probably the first Romanian study of Marcel Proust's contribution as a novelist. The author announced that he was planning a similar volume, grouping essays about Romanian writers, both modernists (Minulescu, Bacovia, Arghezi, Maniu, Galaction) and classics (Alexandru Odobescu, Ion Creangă, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Anton Pann), but this work was not published in his lifetime.\n\nAlso in 1922, Fondane and Pascal set up the theatrical troupe \"Insula\" (\"The Island\"), which stated its commitment to avant-garde theater. Probably named after Minulescu's earlier Symbolist magazine, the group was likely a local replica of Jean Copeau's nonconformist productions in France. Hosted by the Maison d'Art galleries in Bucharest, the company was joined by, among others, actresses Lina Fundoianu-Pascal and Victoria Mierlescu, and director Sandu Eliad. Other participants were writers (Cocea, Pană, Zissu, Scarlat Callimachi, Mărgărita Miller Verghy, Ion Pillat) and theatrical people (George Ciprian, Marietta Sadova, Soare Z. Soare, Dida Solomon, Alice Sturdza, Ionel Țăranu).\n\nAlthough it stated its goal of revolutionizing the Romanian repertoire (a goal published as an art manifesto in \"Contimporanul\"), \"Insula\" produced mostly conventional Symbolist and Neoclassical plays: its inaugural shows included \"Legenda funigeilor\" (\"Gossamer Legend\") by Ștefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel, one of Lord Dunsany's \"Five Plays\" and (in Fondane's own translation) Molière's \"Le Médecin volant\". Probably aiming to enrich this program with samples of Yiddish drama, Fondane began, but never finished, a translation of S. Ansky's \"The Dybbuk\". The troupe ceased its activity in 1923, partly because of significant financial difficulties, and partly because of a rise in antisemitic activities, which put its Jewish performers at risk. For a while, \"Insula\" survived as a conference group, hosting modernist lectures on classical Romanian literature—with the participation of Symbolist and post-Symbolist authors such as Aderca, Arghezi, Millian, Pillat, Vinea, N. Davidescu, Perpessicius, and Fondane himself. He was at the time working on his own play, \"Filoctet\" (\"Philoctetes\", later finished as \"Philoctète\").\n\nIn 1923, Benjamin Fondane eventually left Romania for France, spurred on by the need to prove himself within a different cultural context. He was at the time interested in the success of Dada, an avant-garde movement launched abroad by the Romanian-born author Tristan Tzara, in collaboration with several others. Not dissuaded by the fact that his sister and brother-in-law (the Pascals) had returned impoverished from an extended stay in Paris, Fondane crossed Europe by train and partly by foot.\n\nThe writer (who adopted his Francized name shortly after leaving his native country) was eventually joined there by the Pascals. The three of them continued to lead a bohemian and at times precarious existence, discussed in Fondane's correspondence with Romanian novelist Liviu Rebreanu, and described by researcher Ana-Maria Tomescu as \"humiliating poverty\". The poet acquired some sources of income from his contacts in Romania: in exchange for his contribution to the circulation of Romanian literature in France, he received official funds from the Culture Ministry's directorate (at the time headed by Minulescu); in addition, he published unsigned articles in various newspapers, and even relied on handouts from Romanian actress Elvira Popescu (who visited his home, as did avant-garde painter M. H. Maxy). He also translated into French Zissu's novel \"Amintirile unui candelabru\" (\"The Recollections of a Chandelier\"). For a while, the poet also joined his colleague Ilarie Voronca on the legal department of L'Abeille insurance company.\n\nAfter a period of renting furnished rooms, Fondane accepted an offer from Jean, brother of the deceased literary theorist Remy de Gourmont, and, employed as a librarian-concierge, moved into the Gourmonts' museum property on Rue des Saints-Pères, some distance away from to the celebrated literary café \"Les Deux Magots\". In the six years before Pascal's 1929 death, Fondane left Gourmont's house and, with his sister and brother-in-law, moved into a succession of houses (on Rue Domat, Rue Jacob, Rue Monge), before settling into a historical building once inhabited by author Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (Rue Rollin, 6). Complaining about eye trouble and exhaustion, and several times threatened with insolvency, Fondane often left Paris for the resort of Arcachon.\n\nClaudia Millian, who was also spending time in Paris, described Fondane's new focus on studying Christian theology and Catholic thought, from Hildebert to Gourmont's own \"Latin mystique\" (it was also at this stage that the Romanian writer acquired and sent home part of Gourmont's bibliophile collection). He coupled these activities with an interest in grouping together the cultural segments of the Romanian diaspora: around 1924, he and Millian were founding members of the Society of Romanian Writers in Paris, presided upon by the aristocrat Elena Văcărescu. Meanwhile, Fondane acquired a profile on the local literary scene, and, in his personal notes, claimed to have had his works praised by novelist André Gide and philosopher Jules de Gaultier. They both were his idols: Gide's work had shaped his own contribution in the prose poem genre, while Gaultier did the same for his philosophical outlook. The self-exiled debutant was nevertheless still viewing his career with despair, describing it as languishing, and noting that there was a chance of him failing to earn a solid literary reputation.\n\nThe mid-1920s brought Benjamin Fondane's affiliation with Surrealism, the post-Dada avant-garde current centered in Paris. Fondane also rallied with Belgian Surrealist composers E. L. T. Mesens and André Souris (with whom he signed a manifesto on modernist music), and supported Surrealist poet-director Antonin Artaud in his efforts to set up a theater named after Alfred Jarry (which was not, however, an all-Surrealist venue). In this context, he tried to persuade the French Surrealist group to tour his native country and establish contacts with local affiliates.\n\nBy 1926, Fondane grew disenchanted with the communist alignment proposed by the main Surrealist faction and its mentor, André Breton. Writing at the time, he commented that the ideological drive could prove fatal: \"Perhaps never again will [a poet] recover that absolute freedom that he had in the bourgeois republic.\" A few years later, the Romanian writer expressed his support for the anti-Breton dissidents of \"Le Grand Jeu\" magazine, and was a witness at the 1930 riot which opposed the two factions. His anti-communist discourse was again aired in 1932: commenting on indictment of Surrealist poet Louis Aragon for communist texts (read by the authorities as instigation to murder), Fondane stated that he did believe Aragon's case was covered by the freedom of speech. His ideas also brought him into conflict with Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, who was moving away from an avant-garde background and into the realm of far right ideas. By the early 1930s, Fondane was in contact with the mainstream modernist Jacques Rivière and his \"Nouvelle Revue Française\" circle.\n\nIn 1928, his own collaboration with the Surrealists took shape as the book \"Trois scenarii: ciné-poèmes\" (\"Three Scenarios: Cine-poems\"), published by \"Documents internationaux de l'esprit nouveau\" collection, with artwork by American photographer Man Ray and Romanian painter Alexandru Brătășanu (one of his other contacts in the French Surrealist photographers' group was Eli Lotar, the illegitimate son of Arghezi). The \"cine-poems\" were intentionally conceived as unfilmable screenplays, in what was his personal statement about artistic compromise between experimental film and the emerging worldwide film industry. The book notably comprised his verdict about cinema being \"the only art that was never classical.\"\n\nWith time, Fondane became a contributor to newspapers or literary journals in France, Belgium, and Switzerland: a regular presence in \"Cahiers du Sud\" of Carcassonne, he had his work featured in the Surrealist press (\"Discontinuité\", \"Le Phare de Neuilly\", \"Bifur\"), as well as in \"Le Courrier des Poètes\", \"Le Journal des Poètes\", Romain Rolland's \"Europe\", Paul Valéry's \"Commerce\" etc. In addition, Fondane's research was hosted by specialized venues such as \"Revue Philosophique\", \"Schweizer Annalen\" and Carlo Suarès' \"Cahiers de l'Étoile\". After a long period of indecision, the Romanian poet became a dedicated follower of Lev Shestov, a Russian-born existentialist thinker whose ideas about the eternal opposition between faith and reason he expanded upon in later texts. According to intellectual historian Samuel Moyn, Fondane was, with Rachel Bespaloff, one of the \"most significant and devoted of Shestov's followers\". In 1929, as a frequenter of Shestov's circle, Fondane also met Argentinian female author Victoria Ocampo, who became his close friend (after 1931, he became a contributor to her modernist review, \"Sur\"). Fondane's essays were more frequently than before philosophical in nature: \"Europe\" published his tribute Shestov (January 1929) and his comments of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, which included his own critique of rationalism (June 1930).\n\nInvited (on Ocampo's initiative) by the \"Amigos del Arte\" society of Buenos Aires, Fondane left for Argentina and Uruguay in summer 1929. The object of his visit was promoting French cinema with a set of lectures in Buenos Aires, Montevideo and other cities (as he later stated in a \"Rampa\" interview with Sarina Cassvan-Pas, he introduced South Americans to the work of Germaine Dulac, Luis Buñuel and Henri Gad). In this context, Fondane met essayist Eduardo Mallea, who invited him to contribute in \"La Nación\"s literary supplement. His other activities there included conferencing on Shestov at the University of Buenos Aires and publishing articles on several subjects (from Shestov's philosophy to the poems of Tzara), but the fees received in return were, in his own account, too small to cover the cost of decent living.\n\nIn October 1929, Fondane was back in Paris, where he focused on translating and popularizing some of Romanian literature's milestone texts, from Mihai Eminescu's \"Sărmanul Dionis\" to the poetry of Ion Barbu, Minulescu, Arghezi and Bacovia. In the same context, the expatriate writer helped introduce Romanians to some of the new European tendencies, becoming, in the words of literary historian Paul Cernat, \"the first important promoter of French Surrealism in Romanian culture.\"\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Fondane and painter János Mattis-Teutsch joined the external editorial board of \"Integral\" magazine, an avant-garde tribune published in Bucharest by Ion Călugăru, F. Brunea-Fox and Voronca. He was assigned a permanent column, known as \"Fenêtres sur l'Europe/Ferestre spre Europa\" (French and Romanian for \"Windows on Europe\"). With Barbu Florian, Fondane became a leading film reviewer for the magazine, pursuing his agenda in favor of non-commercial and \"pure\" films (such as René Clair's \"Entr'acte\"), and praising Charlie Chaplin for his lyricism, but later making some concessions to talkies and the regular Hollywood films. Exploring what he defined as \"the great ballet of contemporary French poetry\", Fondane also published individual notes on writers Aragon, Jean Cocteau, Joseph Delteil, Paul Éluard and Pierre Reverdy. In 1927, \"Integral\" also hosted one of Fondane's replies to the communist Surrealists in France, as \"Le surréalisme et la révolution\" (\"Surrealism and Revolution\").\n\nHe also came into contact with \"unu\", the Surrealist venue of Bucharest, which was edited by several of his avant-garde friends at home. His contributions there included a text on Tzara's post-Dada works, which he analyzed as Valéry-like \"pure poetry\". In December 1928, \"unu\" published some of Fondane's messages home, as \"Scrisori pierdute\" (\"Lost Letters\"). Between 1931 and 1934, Fondane was in regular correspondence with the \"unu\" writers, in particular Stephan Roll, F. Brunea-Fox and Sașa Pană, being informed about their conflict with Voronca (attacked as a betrayer of the avant-garde) and witnessing from afar the eventual implosion of Romanian Surrealism on the model of French groups. In such dialogues, Roll complains about right-wing political censorship in Romania, and speaks in some detail about his own conversion to Marxism.\n\nWith Fondane's approval and Minulescu's assistance, \"Priveliști\" also saw print in Romania during 1930. Published by Editura Cultura Națională, it sparked significant controversy with its nonconformist style, but also made the author the target of critics' interest. As a consequence, Fondane was also sending material to Isac Ludo's \"Adam\" review, most of it notes (some hostile) clarifying ambiguous biographical detail discussed in Aderca's chronicle to \"Priveliști\". His profile within the local avant-garde was also acknowledged in Italy and Germany: the Milanese magazine \"Fiera Letteraria\" commented on his poetry, reprinting fragments originally featured in \"Integral\"; in its issue of August–September 1930, the Expressionist tribune \"Der Sturm\" published samples of his works, alongside those of nine other Romanian modernists, translated by Leopold Kosch.\n\nAs Paul Daniel notes, the polemics surrounding \"Priveliști\" only lasted for a year, and Fondane was largely forgotten by the Romanian public after this moment. However, the discovery of Fondane's avant-garde stance by traditionalist circles took the form of bemusement or indignation, which lasted into the next decades. The conservative critic Const. I. Emilian, whose 1931 study discussed modernism as a psychiatric condition, mentioned Fondane as one of the leading \"extremists\", and deplored his abandonment of traditionalist subjects. Some nine years later, the antisemitic far right newspaper \"Sfarmă-Piatră\", through the voice of Ovidiu Papadima, accused Fondane and \"the Jews\" of having purposefully maintained \"the illusion of a literary movement\" under Lovinescu's leadership. Nevertheless, before that date, Lovinescu himself had come to criticize his former pupil (a disagreement which echoed his larger conflict with the \"unu\" group). Also in the 1930s, Fondane's work received coverage in the articles of two other maverick modernists: Perpessicius, who viewed it with noted sympathy, and Lucian Boz, who found his new poems touched by \"prolixity\".\n\nBack in France, where he had become Shestov's assistant, Fondane was beginning work on other books: the essay on 19th-century poet Arthur Rimbaud—\"Rimbaud le voyou\" (\"Rimbaud the Hoodlum\")—and, despite an earlier pledge not to return to poetry, a new series of poems. His eponymously titled study-portrait of German philosopher Martin Heidegger was published by \"Cahiers du Sud\" in 1932. Despite his earlier rejection of commercial films, Fondane eventually became an employee of Paramount Pictures, probably spurred on by his need to finance a personal project (reputedly, he was accepted there with a second application, his first one having been rejected in 1929). He worked first as an assistant director, before turning to screenwriting. Preserving his interest in Romanian developments, he visited the Paris set of \"Televiziune\", a Romanian cinema production for which he shared directorial credits. His growing interest in Voronca's own poetry led him to review it for Tudor Arghezi's Bucharest periodical, \"Bilete de Papagal\", where he stated: \"Mr. Ilarie Voronca is at the top of his form. I'm gladly placing my stakes on him.\"\n\nIn 1931, the poet married Geneviève Tissier, a trained jurist and lapsed Catholic. Their home on Rue Rollin subsequently became a venue for literary sessions, mostly grouping the \"Cahiers du Sud\" contributors. The aspiring author Paul Daniel, who became Rodica Wechsler's husband in 1935, attended such meetings with his wife, and recalls having met Gaultier, filmmaker Dimitri Kirsanoff, music critic Boris de Schlözer, poets Yanette Delétang-Tardif and Thérèse Aubray, as well as Shestov's daughter Natalie Baranoff. Fondane also enjoyed a warm friendship with Constantin Brâncuși, the Romanian-born modern sculptor, visiting Brâncuși's workshop on an almost daily basis and writing about his work in \"Cahiers de l'Étoile\". He witnessed first-hand and described Brâncuși's primitivist techniques, likening his work to that of a \"savage man\".\n\n\"Rimbaud le voyou\" was eventually published by Denoël & Steele company in 1933, the same year when Fondane published his poetry volume \"Ulysse\" (\"Ulysses\") with \"Les Cahiers du Journal des Poètes\". The Rimbaud study, partly written as a reply to Roland de Renéville's monograph \"Rimbaud le Voyant\" (\"Rimbaud the Seer\"), consolidated Fondane's international reputation as a critic and literary historian. In the months after its publication, the book earned much praise from scholars and writers—from Joë Bousquet, Jean Cocteau, Benedetto Croce and Louis-Ferdinand Céline, to Jean Cassou, Guillermo de Torre and Miguel de Unamuno. It also found admirers in the English poet David Gascoyne, who was afterward in correspondence with Fondane, and the American novelist Henry Miller. \"Ulysse\" itself illustrated Fondane's interest in scholarly issues: he sent one autographed copy to Raïssa Maritain, wife of Jacques Maritain (both of whom were Catholic thinkers). Shortly after this period, the author was surprised to read Voronca's own French-language volume \"Ulysse dans la cité\" (\"Ulysses in the City\"): although puzzled by the similarity of titles with his own collection, he described Voronca as a \"great poet.\" Also then, in Romania, B. Iosif completed the Yiddish translation of Fondane's \"Psalmul leprosului\" (\"The Leper's Psalm\"). The text, left in his care by Fondane before his 1923 departure, was first published in \"Di Woch\", a periodical set up in Romania by poet Yankev Shternberg (October 31, 1934).\n\nThe 1933 establishment of a Nazi regime in Germany brought Fondane into the camp of anti-fascism. In December 1934, his \"Apelul studențimii\" (\"The Call of Students\") was circulated among the Romanian diaspora, and featured passionate calls for awareness: \"Tomorrow, in concentration camps, it will be too late\". The following year, he outlined his critique of all kinds of totalitarianism, \"L'Écrivain devant la révolution\" (\"The Writer Facing the Revolution\"), supposed to be delivered in front of the Paris-held International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture (organized by left-wing and communist intellectuals with support from the Soviet Union). According to historian Martin Stanton, Fondane's activity in film, like Jean-Paul Sartre's parallel beginnings as a novelist, was itself a political statement in support of the Popular Front: \"[they were] hoping to introduce critical dimensions in the fields they felt the fascists had colonized.\" Fondane nevertheless ridiculed the communist version of pacifism as a \"parade of big words\", noting that it opposed mere slogans to concrete German re-armament. Writing for the film magazine \"Les Cahiers Jaunes\" in 1933, he expressed the ambition of creating \"an absurd film about something absurd, to satisfy [one's] absurd taste for freedom\".\n\nFondane left the Paramount studios the same year, disappointed with company policies and without having had any screen credit of his own (although, he claimed, there were over 100 Paramount scripts to which he had unsigned contributions). During 1935, he and Kirsanoff were in Switzerland, for the filming of \"Rapt\", with a screenplay by Fondane (adapted from Charles Ferdinand Ramuz's \"La séparation des races\" novel). The result was a highly poetic production, and, despite Fondane's still passionate defense of silent film, the first talkie in Kirsanoff's career. The poet was enthusiastic about this collaboration, claiming that it had enjoyed a good reception from Spain to Canada, standing as a manifesto against the success of more \"chatty\" sound films. In particular, French critics and journalists hailed \"Rapt\" as a necessary break with the \"comédie en vaudeville\" tradition. In the end, however, the independent product could not compete with the Hollywood industry, which was at the time monopolizing the French market. In parallel with these events, Fondane followed Shestov's personal guidance and, by means of \"Cahiers du Sud\", attacked philosopher Jean Wahl's secular reinterpretation of Søren Kierkegaard's Christian existentialism.\n\nDespite selling many copies of his books and having \"Rapt\" played at the Panthéon Cinema, Benjamin Fondane was still facing major financial difficulties, accepting a 1936 offer to write and assist in the making of \"Tararira\", an avant-garde musical product of the Argentine film industry. This was his second option: initially, he contemplated filming a version of Ricardo Güiraldes' \"Don Segundo Sombra\", but met opposition from Güiraldes' widow. While en route to Argentina, he became friends with Georgette Gaucher, a Breton woman, with whom he was in correspondence for the rest of his life.\n\nUnder contract with the Falma-film company, Fondane was received with honors by the Romanian Argentine community, and, with the unusual cut of his preferred suit, is said to have even become a trendsetter in local fashion. For Ocampo and the \"Sur\" staff, literary historian Rosalie Sitman notes, his visit also meant an occasion to defy the xenophobic and antisemitic agenda of Argentine nationalist circles. Centered on the tango, Fondane's film enlisted contributions from some leading figures in several national film and music industries, having Miguel Machinandiarena as producer and John Alton as editor; in starred, among others, Orestes Caviglia, Miguel Gómez Bao and Iris Marga. The manner in which \"Tararira\" approached its subject scandalized the Argentine public, and it was eventually rejected by its distributors (no copies survive, but writer Gloria Alcorta, who was present at a private screening, rated it a \"masterpiece\"). Fondane, who had earlier complained about the actors' resistance to his ideas, left Argentina before the film was actually finished. It was on his return trip that he met Jacques and Raïssa Maritain, with whom he and Geneviève became good friends.\n\nWith the money received in Buenos Aires, the writer contemplated returning on a visit to Romania, but he abandoned all such projects later in 1936, instead making his way to France. He followed up on his publishing activity in 1937, when his selected poems, \"Titanic\", saw print. Encouraged by the reception given to \"Rimbaud le voyou\", he published two more essays with Denoël & Steele: \"La Conscience malheureuse\" (\"The Unhappy Consciousness\", 1937) and \"Faux traité d'esthétique\" (\"False Treatise of Aesthetics\", 1938). In 1938, he was working on a collected edition of his \"Ferestre spre Europa\", supposed to be published in Bucharest but never actually seeing print. At around that date, Fondane was also a presenter for the Romanian edition of 20th Century Fox's international newsreel, \"Movietone News\".\n\nIn 1939, Fondane was naturalized French. This followed an independent initiative of the \"Société des écrivains français\" professional association, in recognition for his contribution to French letters. \"Cahiers du Sud\" collected the required 3,000 francs fee through a public subscription, enlisting particularly large contributions from music producer Renaud de Jouvenel (brother of Bertrand de Jouvenel) and philosopher-ethnologist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl. Only months after this event, with the outbreak of World War II, Fondane was drafted into the French Army. During most of the \"Phoney War\" interval, considered too old for active service, he was in the military reserve force, but in February 1940 was called under arms with the 216 Artillery Regiment. According to Lina, \"he left [home] with unimaginable courage and faith.\" Stationed at the Sainte Assise Castle in Seine-Port, he edited and stenciled a humorous gazette, \"L'Écho de la I C-ie\" (\"The 1st Company Echo\"), where he also published his last-ever work of poetry, \"Le poète en patrouille\" (\"The Poet on Patrolling Duty\").\n\nFondane was captured by the Germans in June 1940 (shortly before the fall of France), and was taken into a German camp as a prisoner of war. He managed to escape captivity, but was recaptured in short time. After falling ill with appendicitis, he was transported back to Paris, kept in custody at the Val-de-Grâce, and operated on. Fondane was eventually released, the German occupiers having decided that he was no longer fit for soldierly duty.\n\nHe was working on two poetry series, \"Super Flumina Babylonis\" (a reference to \"Psalm 137\") and \"L'Exode\" (\"The Exodus\"), as well as on his last essay, focusing on 19th-century poet Charles Baudelaire, and titled \"Baudelaire et l'expérience du gouffre\" (\"Baudelaire and the Experience of the Abyss\"). In addition to these, his other French texts, incomplete or unpublished by 1944, include: the poetic drama pieces \"Philoctète\", \"Les Puits de Maule\" (\"Maule's Well\", an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The House of the Seven Gables\") and \"Le Féstin de Balthazar\" (\"Belshazzar's Feast\"); a study about the life and work of Romanian-born philosopher Stéphane Lupasco; and the selection from his interviews with Shestov, \"Sur les rives de l'Illisus\" (\"On the Banks of the Illisus\"). His very last text is believed to be a philosophical essay, \"Le Lundi existentiel\" (\"The Existential Monday\"), on which Fondane was working in 1944. Little is known about \"Provèrbes\" (\"Proverbs\"), which, he announced in 1933, was supposed to be an independent collection of poems.\n\nAccording to various accounts, Fondane made a point of not leaving Paris, despite the growing restrictions and violence. However, others note that, as a precaution against the antisemitic measures in the occupied north, he eventually made his way into the more permissive \"zone libre\", and only made returns to Paris in order to collect his books. Throughout this interval, the poet refused to wear the yellow badge (mandatory for Jews), and, living in permanent risk, isolated himself from his wife, adopting an even more precarious lifestyle. He was still in contact with writers of various ethnic backgrounds, and active on the clandestine literary scene. In this context, Fondane stated his intellectual affiliation to the French Resistance: his former Surrealist colleague Paul Éluard published several of his poems in the pro-communist \"Europe\", under the name of \"Isaac Laquedem\" (a nod to the Wandering Jew myth). Such pieces were later included, but left unsigned, in the anthology \"L'Honneur des poètes\" (\"The Honor of Poets\"), published by the Resistance activists as an anti-Nazi manifesto. Fondane also preserved his column in \"Cahiers du Sud\" for as long as it was possible, and had his contributions published in several other clandestine journals.\n\nAfter 1941, Fondane became friends with another Romanian existentialist in France, the younger Emil Cioran. Their closeness signaled an important stage in the latter's career: Cioran was slowly moving away from his fascist sympathies and his antisemitic stance, and, although still connected to the revolutionary fascist Iron Guard, had reintroduced cosmopolitanism to his own critique of Romanian society. In 1943, transcending ideological boundaries, Fondane also had dinner with Mircea Eliade, the Romanian novelist and philosopher, who, like their common friend Cioran, had an ambiguous connection with the far right. In 1942, his own Romanian citizenship rights, granted by the Jewish emancipation of the early 1920s, were lost with the antisemitic legislation adopted by the Ion Antonescu regime, which also officially banned his entire work as \"Jewish\". At around that time, his old friends outside France made unsuccessful efforts to obtain him a safe conduct to neutral countries. Such initiatives were notably taken by Jacques Maritain from his new home in the United States and by Victoria Ocampo in Argentina.\n\nHe was eventually arrested by collaborationist forces in spring 1944, after unknown civilians reported his Jewish origin. Held in custody by the Gestapo, he was assigned to the local network of Holocaust perpetrators: after internment in the Drancy transit camp, he was sent on one of the transports to the extermination camps in occupied Poland, reaching Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the meantime, his family and friends remained largely unaware of his fate. After news of his arrest, several of his friends reportedly intervened to save him, including Cioran, Lupasco and writer Jean Paulhan. According to some accounts, such efforts may have also involved another one of Cioran's friends, essayist Eugène Ionesco (later known for his work in drama).\n\nAccounts differ on what happened to his sister Lina. Paul Daniel believes that she decided to go looking for her brother, also went missing, and, in all probability, became a victim of another deportation. Other sources state that she was arrested at around the same time as, or even together with, her brother, and that they were both on the same transport to Auschwitz. According to other accounts, Fondane was in custody while his sister was not, and sent her a final letter from Drancy; Fondane, who had theoretical legal grounds for being spared deportation (a Christian wife), aware that Lina could not invoke them, sacrificed himself to be by her side. While in Drancy, he sent another letter, addressed to Geneviève, in which he asked for all his French poetry to be published in the future as \"Le Mal des fantômes\" (\"The Ache of Phantoms\"). Optimistically, Fondane referred to himself as \"the traveler who isn't done traveling\".\n\nWhile Lina is believed to have been marked for death upon arrival (and immediately after sent to the gas chamber), her brother survived the camp conditions for a few more months. He befriended two Jewish doctors, Moscovici and Klein, with whom he spent his free moments engaged in passionate discussions about philosophy and literature. As was later attested by a survivor of the camp, the poet himself was among the 700 inmates selected for extermination on October 2, 1944, when the Birkenau subsection outside Brzezinka was being evicted by SS guards. He was aware of impending death, and reportedly saw it as ironic that it came so near to an expected Allied victory. After a short interval in Block 10, where he is said to have awaited his death with dignity and courage, he was driven to the gas chamber and murdered. His body was cremated, along with those of the other victims.\n\nAs a young writer, Benjamin Fondane moved several times between the extremes of Symbolism and Neoromantic traditionalism. Literary historian Mircea Martin analyzed the very first of his as pastiches of several, sometimes contradictory, literary sources. These influences, he notes, come from local traditionalists, Romantics and Neoromantics—Octavian Goga (the inspiration for Fondane's earliest pieces), Grigore Alexandrescu, Vasile Alecsandri, George Coșbuc, Ștefan Octavian Iosif; from French Symbolists—Paul Verlaine; and from Romanian disciples of Symbolism—Dimitrie Anghel, George Bacovia, Alexandru Macedonski, Ion Minulescu. The young author had a special appreciation for the 19th century national poet, Mihai Eminescu. Familiar with Eminescu's entire poetic work, he was one of the young poets who tried to reconcile Eminescu's Neoromantic, ruralizing, traditionalism with the urban phenomenon that was Symbolism. While Fondane continued to credit Minulescu's radical and jocular Symbolism as a main influence on his own poems, this encounter was overall less significant than his enthusiasm for Eminescu; in contrast, Bacovia's desolate and macabre poetry left enduring traces in Fondane's work, shaping his depiction of provincial environments and even transforming his worldview.\n\nFondane's early affiliation with Ovid Densusianu's version of Romania's Symbolist current was, according to literary historian Dumitru Micu, superficial. Micu notes that the young Fondane sent his verse to be published by magazines with incompatible agendas, suggesting that his collaboration with \"Vieața Nouă\" was therefore incidental, but also that, around 1914, Fondane's own style was a \"conventional Symbolism\". Writing in 1915, the poet himself explained that his time with the magazine in question ought not be interpreted as anything other than conjectural. During his polemic with Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște, he defined himself as an advocate of an \"insolent\" Symbolism, a category defined by and around Remy de Gourmont. This perspective was further clarified in \"O lămurire...\", which explained how \"Tăgăduința lui Petru\" was to be read: \"A clear, although Symbolist, book. For it is, unmistakably, Symbolist. [...] Symbolism doesn't necessarily mean neologism, morbid, bizarre, decadent, confusing and badly written. But rather—if there is talent—original, commonsensical, depth, non-imitation, lack of standard, subconscious, new and sometimes healthy.\" From a regional point of view, the young Fondane is sometimes included with Bacovia in the Moldavian branch of Romanian Symbolism, or, more particularly, in the Jewish Moldavian subsection.\n\nThe various stylistic directions of Fondane's early poetry came together in \"Priveliști\". Mircea Martin reads in it the poet's emancipation from both Symbolism and traditionalism, despite it being opened with a dedication to Minulescu, and against Eugen Lovinescu's belief that such pastorals were exclusively traditionalist. According to Martin, \"Priveliști\" parts from its Romantic predecessors by abandoning the \"descriptive\" and \"sentimentalist\" in pastoral conventions: \"Everything seems designed on purpose to confound and defy the traditional mindset.\" Similarly, writer-critic Gheorghe Crăciun found the \"Priveliști\" texts contiguous with other early forms of Romanian modernism.\n\nNevertheless, much of the volume still adheres to lyricism and the conventional idyll format, primarily by identifying itself with the slow rhythms of country life. These traits were subsumed by literary historian George Călinescu into a special category, that of \"traditionalist Symbolism\", centered on \"that which brings man closer to Creation's interior life\". The same commentator suggested that the concept linked modernism and traditionalism through the common influence of Charles Baudelaire, whom Fondane himself credited as the \"mystical power\" behind \"Priveliști\". The cycle also recalls Fondane's familiarity with another pastoral poet, Francis Jammes. Of special note is an ode, \"Lui Taliarh\" (\"At Thaliarchus\"), described by Călinescu as the masterpiece of \"Priveliști\". Directly inspired by Horace's \"Odes I.9\", and seen by Martin as Fondane's will to integrate death into life (or \"plenary living\"), it equates existence with the seasonal cycle:\nFrom its traditionalist core, \"Priveliști\" created a modernist structure of uncertainty and violent language. According to Mircea Martin, the two tendencies were so intertwined that one could find both expressed within the same poem. The very preference for vitalism and the energy of wilderness, various critics assess, is a modernist reaction to the drama of World War I, rather than a return to Romantic ideals. In this interval, Fondane had also discovered the poetic revolution promoted by Tudor Arghezi, who united traditionalist discourse with modernist themes, creating new poetic formats. Martin notes that Fondane, more than any other, tried to replicate Arghezi's abrupt prosody and \"tooth and nail\" approach to the literary language, but lacked his mentor's \"verbal magic.\" The same critic suggests that the main effect of Arghezi's influence on Fondane was not in poetic form, but in determining the disciple to \"discover himself\", to seek his own independent voice. Paul Cernat also sees Fondane as indebted to Arghezi's mix of \"cruelty\" and \"formal discipline\". In contrast to such assessments, Călinescu saw Fondane not as an Arghezian pupil, but as a traditionalist \"spiritually related\" to Ion Pillat's own post-Symbolist avatar. This verdict was implicitly or explicitly rejected by other commentators: Martin argued that Pillat's omnipresent \"calm joy\", modulated with \"impeccable taste\", clashed with Fondane's \"tension\", \"surprises\" and \"intelligence superior to [his] talent\"; Cernat assessed that \"Priveliști\" was at \"the antipode\" of Pillat and Jammes, that its themes pointed to social alienation and a patriarchal universe gone \"off its rocker\".\n\nStatements made by the young Fondane, in which he explains his indifference toward the landscape as it is, and his preference for the landscape as the poet himself creates it, have been a traditional source for critical commentary. As Martin notes, this attitude led the poet and travel writer to express an apathy, or even boredom, in regard to the wild landscape, to promote \"withdrawal\" rather than \"adhesion\", \"solitude\" rather than \"communion\". However, as a way of cultivating a cosmic level of poetry, Fondane's work veered into synesthesia and vitalism, being commended by critics for its tactile, aural or olfactory suggestions. In one such poem, cited by Călinescu as a sample of \"exquisite freshness\", the author imagines being turned into a ripe watermelon. These works also part with convention in matters of prosody (with a modern treatment of alexandrines) and vocabulary (a stated preference for Slavic versus Romance terminologies). In addition, Martin, who declared himself puzzled at noting that Fondane would not publish some of his most accomplished poems of youth, made special note of their occasional disregard for Romanian grammar and other artistic licenses (left uncorrected by Paul Daniel on Fondane's explicit request). Some of the \"Priveliști\" poems look upon nature with ostentatious sarcasm, focusing on its grotesque elements, its rawness and its repetitiveness, as well as attacking the idyllic portrayal of peasants in traditionalist literature. Martin notes in particular one of the untitled pieces about Hertza region:\n\nLiterary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu was the first to suggest, in the 1960s, that the underlying traits of such imagery made the post-Symbolist Fondane an Expressionist poet, who had detected \"the fundamental anarchy of the universe\". The verdict was echoed and amended by those of other critics. Martin finds that it applies to many of Fondane's early poems, where \"explosive\" imagery is central, but opines that, generally toned down by melancholy, their message too blends into a new form of \"crepuscular wisdom\". Scholar Dan Grigorescu stresses that the Neo-romantic and Symbolist element is dominant throughout the \"Priveliști\" volume and, contrary to Crohmălniceanu's thesis, argues that Fondane's projection of the self into the nature is not Expressionist, but rather a convention borrowed from Romanticism (except for \"perhaps, [...] the exacerbated dilatation\" in scenes in which terrified cattle are driven into town). In Grigorescu's interpretation, the volume has some similarities with the pastoral Expressionism of Romanian writers Lucian Blaga and Adrian Maniu, as well as with the wilderness paintings of Franz Marc, but is at \"the opposite pole\" from the \"morbid hallucination\" Expressionism of H. Bonciu and Max Blecher. He indicates that, overall, Fondane's contributions confuse critics by following \"contradictory directions\", a mix that \"hardly finds any grounds for comparison within [Romanian] poetry.\" In contrast, Paul Cernat sees both Fondane's poetry and Ion Călugăru's prose as \"Expressionist \"écorchés\"\", and connects Fondane's \"modern attitude\" to his familiarity with the poems of Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nThe introduction of rhetorical violence within a traditional poetic setting announced Fondane's transition into the more radical wing of the modernist movement. During his \"Priveliști\" period, in his articles for \"Contimporanul\", the poet stated that Symbolism was dead, and in subsequent articles drew a line between the original and non-original sides of Romanian Symbolism, becoming particularly critical of Macedonski. Defining his programmatic approach as leading, through the avant-garde, into a Neoclassical modernism (or a \"new Classicism\"), Benjamin Fondane argued: \"To be excessive: that is the only way of being innovative.\" His perspective, mixing revolt and messages about creating a new tradition, was relatively close to \"Contimporanul\"s own artistic program, and as such a variant of Constructivism. During his own transition from Symbolism, Fondane looked on the avant-garde itself with critical distance. Discussing it as the product of a tradition leading back to Stéphane Mallarmé, he reproached Cubism for displaying a limitation of range, and viewed Futurism as essentially destructive (but also useful for having created a virgin territory to support \"constructive man\"); likewise, he found Dada a solid, but limited, method of combating interwar period's \"metaphysical despair\".\n\nThe affiliation to the avant-garde came with a sharp critique of Romanian culture, accused by Fondane of promoting imitation and parochialism. During a period which ended with his 1923 departure, the young poet sparked polemic with a series of statements in which, reviewing the impact of local Francophilia, he equated Romania with a colony of France. This theory proposed a difference between Westernization and \"parasitism\": \"If a foreign intellectual direction is always useful, an alien soul is always a danger.\" He did not cease to promote foreign culture at home, but stated a complex argument about the need to recognize differences in culture: his global conclusion about civilizations, which he viewed as equal but not identical, built on Gourmont's theory about an \"intellectual constancy\" throughout human history, as well as on philosopher Henri Bergson's critique of mechanism. In parallel, Fondane criticized the cultural setting of Greater Romania, noting that it was so Bucharest-focused that Transylvanian authors only became widely known by attending the capital's Casa Capșa restaurant. In his retrospective interpretation of Romanian literature, the avant-garde essayist stated that there were precious few authors who could be considered original, primarily citing Ion Creangă, the peasant writer, as a model of authenticity. While stating this point in his \"Imagini și cărți din Franța\", Fondane cited in his favor a traditionalist culture critic, historian Nicolae Iorga.\n\nHowever, during a virtual polemic with Poporanism (hosted by \"Sburătorul\" in 1922), Fondane also questioned the originality and Thraco-Roman origin of Romanian folklore, as well as, through it, historical myths surrounding the Latin ethnogenesis: \"Present-day Romania, of obscure origins, Thraco-Roman-Slavic-Barbarian, owes its existence and present-day European inclusion to a fecund error [...]: \"it is the idea of our Latin origin\" [Fondane's italics].\" Likewise, the author put forth the thesis according to which traditionalists such as Mihail Sadoveanu and George Coșbuc invoked literary themes present not just in Romania's archaic tradition, but also in Slavic folklore. Fondane went on to draw a comparison between the idea of Jewish chosenness and that of Romanian Latinity, concluding that they both resulted in positive national goals (in the case of Romania and its inhabitants, that of \"becoming part of Europe\"). Paul Cernat found his perspective \"more reasonable\" than that of his \"Contimporanul\" colleagues, who speculated about creating a modernity on folkloric roots.\n\nScholar Constantin Pricop interprets Fondane's overall perspective as that of a \"constructive\" critic, citing a fragment of \"Imagini și cărți din Franța\": \"Let us hope the time will come when we may bring our personal contribution into Europe. [...] Until such time, let's keep a check on the continuous assimilation of foreign culture [...]; let's therefore return to cultural criticism.\" Commenting at length on the probable motivations of Fondane's discourse, Cernat suggests that, like many of his avant-garde colleagues, Fondane experienced a \"peripheral complex\", merging Bovarysme and frustrated ambition. According to Cernat, the poet surpassed this moment after experiencing success in France, and his decision to have \"Priveliști\" printed at home was intended as a special tribute to Romania and its language. There is however a pronounced difference between Fondane's French and Romanian work, as discussed by critics and by Fondane himself. The elements of continuity are highlighted in Crăciun's account: \"French literature and culture signified for Fundoianu a process of clarification and self-definition, but not a change of identity.\"\n\nSeveral of Fondane's exegetes have discussed the links between his apparent traditionalism and the classical themes of either secular Jewish culture or Judaism, with a focus on his Hasidic roots. According to Swedish researcher Tom Sandqvist (who discusses the Jewish background of many Romanian avant-garde authors and artists), the Hasidic and Kabbalah connection is enhanced by both the pantheistic vision of \"Tăgăduința lui Petru\" and the \"Ein Sof-like emptiness\" suggested in \"Priveliști\". Paul Cernat too argued that the traditionalist elements in Fondane's work reflected Hasidism as it was experienced in Galicia or Bukovina, as well as the direct influence of Iacob Ashel Groper. According to George Călinescu's analysis (originally stated in 1941), Fondane's origin within the rural minority of Romanian Jews (and not the urban Jewish mainstream) was of special psychological interest: \"The poet is a Jew from Moldavia, where Jews have almost pastoral professions, but are nevertheless prevented by a tradition of market agglomerations from fully enjoying the sincerity of rustic life.\" The fond memory of Judaic practice is notably intertwined with the \"Priveliști\" pastorals: \nFondane expanded on his interest in the Jewish heritage in his early prose and drama. The various pre-1923 articles, including his obituary pieces for Elias Schwartzfeld and Avram Steuerman-Rodion, speak at length about Jewish ethics (which Fondane described as unique and idealistic), assimilation and Jewish nationalism. They also offer his answer to antisemitism, including his case, relying on proof of Jewish exogamy, against all theories about a distinct Semitic race. In other such pieces, he comments at length on Groper's Yiddishist literature and corrects opinions expressed on the same topic by their common friend Gala Galaction. As he explains in this context, Groper quelled his adolescent identity crisis, helping him find a core Judaism, more \"vital\" to him than the political scope of Zionism. During these dialogues, Fondane recalled, he first discovered his interest in philosophy: he played the \"Sophist\", paradoxical and abstract, in front of the \"sentimental\" Groper. This antithesis also inspired the core essay in \"Iudaism și elenism\", where Fondane writes at length about the hostile dialogue between Jewish philosophy, in search of fundamental truths, and Greek thought, with its ultimate value of beauty.\n\n\"Tăgăduința lui Petru\", believed by Mircea Martin to be a sample of Fondane's debt to André Gide, is the first of his works to take inspiration from the Bible (in this case, looking beyond the Talmud). Also Biblical in subject, \"Monologul lui Baltazar\" has been interpreted by Crohmălniceanu as a negative comment on nihilism and the \"Übermensch\" theory, notions embodied by the protagonist Belshazzar, legendary ruler of Babylon during the Jewish captivity. Fondane's progressive focus on Jewish Biblical sources mirrored the Christian interests of his mentor Arghezi. Like Arghezi, Fondane wrote a series of \"Psalms\"—although, according to Martin, his tone was \"too cadenced and solemn for one to expect a confrontation or a touching confession\". However, Martin notes, the Jewish author either adopted or anticipated (depending on the reliability of his manuscripts' dating) Arghezi's poetry of exhortation and curses, in which ugliness, baseness and destitution speak directly to divinity. These sentiments are found in Fondane's \"Psalmul leprosului\", which the same critic identifies as \"the series' masterpiece\": \nThroughout and beyond his participation in the Surrealist milieus (an affiliation illustrated primarily by his filmmaker and popularizer activities, rather than by his literary creation), Benjamin Fondane remained an existentialist, primarily following Lev Shestov's views on the human condition. This came as a critique of the scientific method and rationalism as human explanations of the world, notably outlined in his own \"Faux traité d'esthétique\". Probably developed independently from Shestovist thought, his overall objection toward abstract projects has been likened by essayist Gina Sebastian Alcalay to the later stances of André Glucksmann or Edgar Morin. These attitudes shaped his assessments of Surrealism. In one of \"Integral\" chronicles, Fondane himself explained that the movement, described as superior to Dada's \"joyous suicide\", had created a \"new continent\" with its rediscovery of dreams. Poet and critic Armelle Chitrit notes that, in part, Fondane's later dissidence was also motivated on an existentialist level, since Surrealism \"had stopped asking questions\"; instead, she notes, Fondane \"believed neither in reason nor in any system based on it. It is folly, he wrote, to perpetuate the attempt to make man and history cohabitable. One of [S]hestov's rare disciples, he sets only the powers of life against those of chaos.\" As Fondane wrote to Claude Sernet, \"Rimbaud le voyou\" was in part at attempt at preventing the other Surrealists from confiscating Rimbaud's mythical status. According to Romanian-born writer Lucian Raicu, its \"somber\" tone and allusive language are also early clues that Fondane had a nightmarish vision of the political and intellectual climate. His Shestovist interpretation, opposing existence to ideas, was contested by intellectual figure Raymond Queneau: himself a former Surrealist, Queneau suggested that Fondane was relying on blind faith, having a distorted perspective on science, literature and the human intellect. Furthermore, he noted that, under the influence of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, Fondane described reality exclusively in primitivist terms, as the realm of savagery and superstition.\n\nFondane's objection to the communist flirtations of the main Surrealist wing had roots in his earlier discourse: before leaving Romania, Fondane had criticized socialism as a modern myth, symptomatic of a generalized desecration, suggesting that Leninist and Labor Zionist projects were economically unsound. Much admired by Emil Cioran for his rejection of all modern ideology, the poet argued that a critical distance imposed itself between artists and social structures, and, although he too reacted against \"bourgeois\" culture, concluded that communism carried a greater risk for the independent mind. In particular, he objected to the Marxist theory on base and superstructure: although his planned address for the Writers' Congress spoke of Marxian economics as being justified by reality, it also argued that economic relationships could not be used to explain all historical developments. His critique of the Soviet Union as an equally \"bourgeois\" society also came with the argument that Futurism, not Surrealism, could transform into art the communist version of voluntarism.\n\nFondane found himself opposed to the general trend of intellectual partisanship, and took pride in defining himself as a politically independent skeptic. Around 1936, he reacted strongly against Julien Benda's rationalist political essays, with their overall critique of intellectual passions, describing them as revived and \"excruciatingly boring\" versions of positivism, but ignoring their primary, anti-totalitarian, agenda. However, \"La Conscience malheureuse\" (with essays on Shestov, Edmund Husserl, Friedrich Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard) was noted as Fondane's own contribution to the debate surrounding Popular Front activities and the rise of fascism: titled after a concept in Hegelian philosophy, which originally referred to the thinking process generating its own divisions, it referred to the possibility of thinkers to interact with the larger world, beyond subjectivity.\n\nRallying himself with the main trends of Jewish existentialism, the poet remained critical of other existentialist schools, such as those of Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre, believing them to be overly reliant on dialectics, and therefore on rational thought; likewise, citing Kierkegaard as his reference point, Fondane criticized Jean Wahl for not discussing existential philosophy as an act of faith. His dislike for secular existentialism was also outlined in a text he authored shortly before his 1944 arrest, where he spoke of the Bible as being, \"whether or not it wants to\", the original reference for all existential philosophy. Geneviève Tissier-Fondane later recalled that her husband was \"profoundly Jewish\" to his death, but also that he would not abide by any formal regulation within the \"Halakha\" tradition. This approach also implied a measure of ecumenism: Jacques Maritain, who cultivated his relationship with Fondane across the religious and philosophical divides, described his friend as \"a disciple of Shestov but one inhabited by the Gospel\"; Fondane himself explained to Maritain that Shestov and himself were aiming for a new Judaic philosophy that would be equally indebted to the Christianity of Kierkegaard, Martin Luther and Tertullian. He was critical of Maritain's worldview, but remained a passionate reader of his work; in contrast, Geneviève attested that the Maritains' beliefs shaped her own, leasing her back into the Church.\n\nThe spiritual crisis experienced in France was the probable reason why Fondane refused to write poems between 1923 and 1927. As he stated in various contexts, he mistrusted the innate ability of words to convey the tragedy of existence, describing poetry as the best tool for rendering a universal \"wordless scream\", an \"ultimate reality\", or an eternal expression of things ephemeral. In his essays, he suggested that the invention of art, like the invention of theory and rhetoric, had deprived poets of their existential function; beyond letting themselves be guided by their art, he argued, writers needed to confirm that the principles of life, negative as well as positive, exist. He saw poets as waging an unequal battle with both scientific perspectives and moralism, urging them to place their unique faith \"in the mysterious virtue of poetry, in the existential virtue that poetry upholds\". \"Rimbaud le voyou\" was in part a study of how, during his self-exile to Harar, Rimbaud had not merely abandoned poetry for the sake of adventure, but rather transformed his lifestyle into a poetry of incertitude and personal ambition. As Fondane explained in his \"Baudelaire et l'expérience du gouffre\", a poet and thinker could also evidence the abyss he faced, and alleviate his own anxiety, through the use of irony: \"Laugh in the face of tragedy, or disappear!\"\n\nAccording to Cernat, his articles for \"Integral\" show Fondane as an ally of the \"anti-political\" and lyrical side of Surrealism, a poet placing his trust in \"the negative-soteriological, liberating function of poetry\". The impact of existentialist philosophy was even traced to the \"cine-poems\" by Martin Stanton (who called the pieces \"amazing\"). In contrast to the Surrealists, Fondane did not believe in a need to circulate poems as universal messages, but rather saw them as the basis for a very personal relationship with the reader: \"This is not a time for print. Poetry is seeking its friends, not an audience. [...] Poetry will be for the few—or it will not be at all.\" Chitrit, who parallels Fondane's definitions with the similar views of Romanian poet and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan, concludes: \"This is probably the closest that we can come to seeing contemporary poetry.\" Fondane's other literary works also evidence the impact of his philosophical preoccupations. With \"Le Féstin de Balthazar\", the writer modified his earlier \"Monologul\" by adopting Shestivist themes (introducing allegorical characters who discuss Aristotelianism, capitalism and revolution) and by introducing some elements from the burlesque. Originally conceived in 1918 and completed in 1933, \"Philoctète\" reworked Sophocles' play of the same title, interpreting it through the style of Gide's dramas.\n\n\"Ulysse\" was an epic poem in free verse, the first such work in Fondane's career, and testing a format later adopted in \"Titanic\" and \"L'Exode\". Although quite similar to Voronca's own work, which also used Homer's \"Odyssey\" as the pretext for a comment on social alienation, it included an additional allegory of Jewishness (according to critic Petre Răileanu, Voronca had stripped his own text of Jewish symbolism, in the hope of not entering a competition with Fondane). Fondane's 1933 text echoes his earlier intertextual Homeric references (present in poems he wrote back in 1914), but, to their adventurous escapism, it opposes the Ithaca metaphor—an ideal of stability in the assumption of one's destiny. Claude Sernet referred to \"Ulysse\" as \"painful and sober, a cry of anxiety, of revolt and resignation, a fraternal and noble song to mankind\". The poem is also Fondane's comment on the Wandering Jew story (the mythical figure is rescaled into an urban Ulysses), and, according to cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu, reinterprets the Christian prejudice about Jews being eternal \"witnesses\" of Christ's Passion. Together, such motifs intimated the writer's own experiences, leading various commentators to conclude that he too was \"the Jewish Ulysses\". Italian academic Gisèle Vanhese, who connects this lyrical discourse with Fondane's \"experience of the abyss\" concept, notes that ocean waters are the vehicles of nomadism in \"Ulysse\", while, in \"Titanic\", the same environment serves as a metaphor of dying.\n\nIn Cioran's account, Benjamin Fondane lived his final years permanently aware \"of a misfortune that was about to happen\", and built a \"complicity with the unavoidable\". The same is noted by German Romanian poet and Cioran exegete Dieter Schlesak, who suggests: \"Fondane was a man who wished to bear the absolute uncertainty of the outside; that which exists is an intermittent, not continuous, reality. But [true misfortune] is the boredom of faint unliving, [...] of things implied, these being the ones [Fondane] hated.\" Fondane's visions about history and the role of poetry were notably outlined in \"L'Exode\", a portion of which is dedicated to the powerlessness of Jews in front of prejudice. According to Oișteanu, this text, where the narrative voice speaks of sufferings and defects common in all humans, was probably inspired by the famous monologue in William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\". Another part, called \"astonishingly prophetic\" and \"cynical apocalyptic\" by Chitrit, reads:\nSimilar themes were being explored by the \"Super Flumina Babylonis\" cycle, described by Sernet as \"a terrible foreshadowing of events into which peoples and continents were about to sink, into which the author himself was to be dragged without the possibility of return.\" Writing about the entirety of Fondane's French poetry (\"Le Mal des fantômes\"), poet and language theorist Henri Meschonnic argued that the Romanian author was unique in depicting \"the revolt and the flavor of life mixed into the sense of death\".\n\nAfter her husband's death (of which she was for long ignorant) and the end of the war, Geneviève Tissier-Fondane, aided by the Maritains, moved into Kolbsheim Castle, tutoring the children of Antoinette and Alexander Grunelius. A devout Catholic, she eventually retreated from public life, becoming a nun in the Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion (dedicated to Catholic missionary work among the Jews). Relocating to the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, she died, after a long battle with cancer, in March 1954. Fondane was also survived by his mother Adela, who died in June 1953 at age 94, and sister Rodica (d. 1967).\n\nThe writer was the subject of several visual portrayals by noted artists, some of whom were his personal friends. During his collaboration with \"Integral\" and \"unu\", Victor Brauner and Jules Perahim both drew his vignette portraits (the former as part of a series titled \"film unu\"). He is the subject of a 1930 sketch by Constantin Brâncuși, a 1931 Surrealist painting by Brauner (who also painted one of Adela Schwartzfeld), and an artistic photograph by Man Ray. The 1934 edition of \"Psalmul leprosului\" featured Fondane's portrait in the hand of graphic artist Sigmund Maur (the original version of which was dated to 1921). A posthumous image of the poet in military attire was drawn by Romanian-born artist Eugen Drăguțescu. Benjamin Fondane was also commemorated with a mention on the Panthéon plaque, among the \"Morts pour la France\" (reportedly, his name was added upon a request from Cioran). There is a similar landmark in Iași's Eternitatea cemetery, set up by the Writers' Union of Romania near his family grave.\n\nThe poet-philosopher left behind a large manuscript collection, a personal library and a set of works due for publishing. His book collection was split into individual documentary funds, some located in France and others in Romania. In February 1930, Benjamin Fondane explained that he did not consider revisiting his land of birth until such time as his earlier volumes would be printed, indicating that these included (in addition to \"Priveliști\"): \"Ferestre spre Europa\", \"Imagini și scriitori români\" (\"Images and Romanian Writers\"), \"Caietele unui inactual\" (\"The Notebooks of an Outdated Man\"), \"Probleme vesele\" (\"Merry Problems\"), \"Dialoguri\" (\"Dialogues\") and an introduction to the work of art critic Walter Pater. Among Fondane's other Romanian works, unpublished at the time of his death, were the prose poem \"Herța\" (\"Hertza\"), \"Note dintr-un confesional\" and many other prose fragments and poems, all preserved in Daniel's manuscript collection. According to Paul Daniel, part of the poet's book collection in Romania was left in the care of literary critic Lucian Boz, who sold it upon his departure for Australia. In France, the copyright to Fondane's work was passed on in the late 20th century to scholar Michel Carassou, who was personally involved in several publication projects.\n\nIn France, the caretaker of documentary enterprises regarding Fondane was for long Sernet (Voronca's brother-in-law), who released part of \"Super Flumina Babylonis\" and other previously unknown texts (published in various issues of \"Cahiers du Sud\" and other journals), while supervising a new edition of \"L'Honneur des poètes\", where Fondane was properly credited. In 1945, philosopher Jean Grenier edited the first-ever version of \"Le Lundi existentiel\". A Fondane reader (comprising \"L'Exode\") was being planned around 1946, and supposed to be published by Les Éditions de Minuit, with contributions from poets Jean Lescure and Paul Éluard. \"Baudelaire et l'expérience du gouffre\" was eventually published by Éditions Seghers in 1947, under the supervision of Jean Cassou (second edition 1972; third edition 1973). Sernet was also the author of the poem \"À Benjamain Fondane, déporté\" (\"To Benjamin Fondane, Upon His Deportation\"), reportedly dated June 3, 1944. Recollections of Fondane's activity and his friendship with Victoria Ocampo are also found in Ocampo's series \"Testimonios\" (\"Testimonies\").\n\nWith support from Culture Minister André Malraux, Sernet also published a 1965 bound version of \"L'Exode\" and \"Super Flumina...\", reconstructed from the fragmentary manuscripts. Also on Sernet's initiative, Le Chant du Monde record label and comedian Ève Griliquez released an LP album of public recitations from his work. Other collections of his written work were published in later years, including his \"Écrits pour le cinéma\" (\"Writings for the Cinema\", 1984), \"Le Féstin de Balthazar\" (1985), \"Le Lundi existentiel\" (1989), and \"Le Mal des fantômes\" (1996). His interviews with Shestov, left by the poet in Ocampo's care, were collected in 1982, as \"Rencontres avec Léon Chestov\" (\"Meetings with Lev Shestov\"). Fondane's notes on Dada, as well as other documents, saw print in 1996, as \"Le voyageur n'a pas fini de voyager\" (\"The Traveler Isn't Done Traveling\"). The following year, Fondane scholar Monique Jutrin discovered and published his manuscript speech for the 1935 Congress, \"L'Écrivain devant la révolution\". Another previously unknown text, the screenplay sketch \"Une journée d'ivresse\" (\"A Day of Drunkenness\"), was included by editors Carassou and Petre Răileanu in a critical edition of 1999.\n\nIn the Western world (including the Romanian diaspora), there were a few authors whose work was influenced directly by Fondane's, among them Voronca and David Gascoyne. Gascoyne, the author of \"I.M. Benjamin Fondane\" poem and recollection pieces on their friendship, spoke of the Romanian as a mentor, with a \"decisive and lasting influence\" on his own writings. France is home to a Benjamin Fondane Studies Society, which organizes an annual workshop in Peyresq. Since 1994, it publishes the academic review \"Cahiers Benjamin Fondane\", which has recovered and published much of Fondane's correspondence and political texts. In 2006, following a Fondane Society request, a square on Paris' Rue Rollin was renamed in honor of the Romanian-born writer. Three years later, on the 65th commemoration of Fondane's killing, the Mémorial de la Shoah museum hosted a special exhibit dedicated his life and literary work. In Israel, a fragment from his \"L'Exode\" is engraved in English and Hebrew versions on the entrance of Yad Vashem memorial.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Fondane's Romanian work was attracting researchers and authors of monographs from various other countries, in particular the United States (John Kenneth Hyde, Eric Freedman etc.) and Communist Czechoslovakia (Libuše Valentová). In West Germany, Fondane's poetic and philosophical contributions were in focus by 1986, when exiled poet Dieter Schlesak published translated samples in \"Akzente\" journal. Preceded by Gascoyne's French-to-English translation attempts from Fondane, American film editor Julian Semilian's contribution as a translator from Romanian is credited with having played an important part in introducing the English-speaking world to the writings of Fondane and various other Romanian modernists. The first-ever volume of Hebrew translations from Fondane's verse saw print in 2003, with support from Tel Aviv University. Other international echoes include the publication of Odile Serre's Romanian-to-French translations from his early poems.\n\nRecognition of Fondane's overall contribution was however rare, as noted in 1989 by Martin Stanton: \"[Fondane is] surely the most underestimated intellectual of the 1930s\". Writing some nine years later, Chitrit also argued: \"His works [...] are as important as they are unknown.\" Cioran, who in 1986 dedicated a portion of his \"Exercises in Admiration\" collection to his deceased friend, mentioned that \"Baudelaire et l'expérience du gouffre\", made memorable by its study of boredom as a literary subject, had since found numerous readers. Cioran kept a fond memory of his friend, and recalled not being able to pass on Rue Rollin without experiencing \"terrible pain\". Awareness of Fondane's philosophy was nevertheless judged unsatisfactory by scholar Moshe Idel. Speaking in 2007, he suggested that Fondane the philosopher remained less familiar to Jewish studies academics in Israel than his various counterparts in Germanic Europe.\n\nArgentinian director Edgardo Cozarinsky, who was inspired in his youth by Fondane's introduction of avant-garde films (preserved in the Argentine Film Archives), staged and narrated a dramatized version of his biography, performed at the Villa Ocampo. Fondane scholar Olivier Salazar-Ferrer also authored a theatrical adaptation of \"L'Exode\" (premiered by France's \"Théâtre de La Mouvance\" company in 2008).\n\nIn his native country, Benjamin Fondane was present in the memoirs of several authors. One special case is Arghezi, who, despite his disciple's admiration, left a sarcastic and intentionally demoralizing portrayal of Fondane in his 1930 volume \"Poarta Neagră\". A year after the poet's death at Auschwitz, Arghezi returned with a sympathetic obituary, printed in \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\". Fondane was also the subject of a Surrealist poem in prose, or \"short-circuit\", by Stephan Roll, where he was referred to as \"a Don Juan of the brain's lineage from God\". A very hostile depiction of Fondane and other Jewish writers, noted for its antisemitic undertones, was present in the 1942 memoirs of writer Victor Eftimiu. A reflection of the late 1940s communization of Romania, Sașa Pană's recollection piece \"De la B. Fundoianu la Benjamin Fondane\" (\"From B. Fundoianu to Benjamin Fondane\"), published by \"Orizont\" review, reinterpreted some of the poet's activities, and avant-garde history in general, from a partisan Marxist vantage point. Later memoirs mentioning the writer include a piece by Adrian Maniu in the Cluj-based magazine \"Steaua\" (December 1963) and a new tribute by Pană in \"Luceafărul\" (October 1964). Pană's recollections were later turned into a larger narrative, the 1973 autobiographical novel \"Născut în 02\" (\"Born in '02\"). Fondane also features prominently in Claudia Millian's \"Cartea mea de aduceri-aminte\" (\"My Book of Recollections\"), published the same year as Pană's volume. Also in 1973, the former Surrealist campaigner Geo Bogza dedicated Fondane an eponymous prose poem, centered on an existential contradiction: \"To be born in Moldavia, in sweet, gentle Moldavia... and to end up in the furnaces at Auschwitz.\" Among the younger Romanian poets, who debuted during communism, Nichita Stănescu was influenced by \"Priveliști\" in some of his own earliest works, as was Andrei Codrescu.\n\nPosthumous Romanian editions of Fondane's works included the selection \"Poezii\" (\"Poems\"), edited by the former Surrealist author Virgil Teodorescu (Editura pentru Literatură, 1965), and Daniel's new version of \"Priveliști\" (Cartea Românească, 1974), followed in 1978 by the Martin and Daniel selection, and in 1980 by Teodorescu and Martin's \"Imagini și cărți\" (\"Images and Books\", grouping Fondane's French literary studies, as translated by Sorin Mărculescu). Translated by Romulus Vulpescu, \"Le poète en patrouille\" was featured in \"Manuscriptum\" review (1974). During communism, various Romanian scholars who dedicated significant portions of their work to Fondane studies; in addition to Martin, Ovid Crohmălniceanu and Dumitru Micu, they include: Paul Cornea, Nicolae Manolescu, Dan Mănucă, Marin Mincu, Dan Petrescu, Mihail Petroveanu and Ion Pop. In the 1980s, modern classical composer Doru Popovici completed the cantata \"In memoriam Beniamin Fundoianu\" (lyrics by Victor Bârlădeanu).\n\nWriting in 1978, Martin noted that the focus of such recoveries was on Fondane's poetry, while Fondane the thinker and \"informed commentator\", \"one of the most evolved critical voices in 1920s Romanian culture\", remained unfamiliar to Romanians. The limits on Fondane's posthumous circulation were partly dictated by the policies of Communist Romania. In 1975, the censorship apparatus (who followed national communist ideas about restricting references to Judaism) removed references to Fondane's ethnic and religious background from a reprint of Arghezi's 1945 text. In 1980, a version of his \"Mântuirea\" series, \"Iudaism și elenism\", was purged from \"Imagini și cărți\", on orders from the same institution. Martin's 1984 monograph, \"Introducere în opera lui B. Fundoianu\" (\"An Introduction to B. Fundoianu's Work\"), was saluted as \"penetrating\" by his colleague Gheorghe Crăciun. The same study is primarily noted by Paul Cernat as a \"problem-oriented\" text about the \"complexes\" of Romanian culture, and therefore an implicit reaction against the national communism promoted under Nicolae Ceaușescu.\n\nThe hidden parts of Benjamin Fondane's contribution became accessible only after the anti-communist uprising of 1989. In 1999, the Jewish community publishers, Editura Hasefer, issued \"Iudaism și elenism\" (with scholars Leon Volovici and Remus Zăstroiu as editors). The same year, the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania published an anthology of his texts, \"Strigăt întru eternitate\" (\"A Shout unto Eternity\"), and Editura Echinox a concordance dictionary of his poetry (one of several such projects initiated by linguist Marian Papahagi). In 2004, Mircea Martin and Ion Pop also collected Fondane's political essays as \"Scriitorul în fața revoluției\" (titled after the Romanian version of \"L'Écrivain devant la révolution\"). Writing in 2001, Crăciun assessed that the poet was still \"non-integrated\" into his native Romanian culture, which mostly perceived him as estranged, and his work in the vernacular as traditionalist.\n\nEight years later, comparatist Irina Georgescu assessed that interest in the more unknown aspects of Fondane's work had been rekindled by public conferences and new monographs (among which she cites the contributions of scholars Mariana Boca, Nedeea Burcă and Ana-Maria Tomescu). \"Le Féstin de Balthazar\" was performed in its Romanian version (\"Ospățul lui Baltazar\"), directed by Alexandru Dabija for the Nottara Theater company. The 65th commemoration of Fondane's death was marked locally with several events, including the premiere of Andreea Tănăsescu's \"Exil în pământul uitării\" (\"Exile to the Land of Oblivion\"), a contemporary ballet and performance art show loosely inspired by his poetry. In 2006, the Romanian Cultural Institute set up the Benjamin Fondane International Award for Francophone literature in countries outside France. In 2016, Cătălin Mihuleac published a biographical short story (and eulogy), \"Ultima țigară a lui Fondane\" (\"Fondane's Last Cigarette\").\n\nFondane's literary posterity was also touched by an extended controversy, notably involving Mircea Martin and philosopher Mihai Șora. The scandal was ignited after October 2007, when Șora and poet Luiza Palanciuc set up the \"Restitutio Benjamin Fondane\" translation program, with support from Editura Limes and \"Observator Cultural\" magazine. Martin contested this initiative, arguing that he had earlier publicized his intent of editing a Romanian-language Fondane reader, and claiming legal precedence on copyrights. A parallel conflict ensued between Editura Limes and \"Observator Cultural\", after which the \"Restitutio\" program split into separate projects.\n\n"}

{"id": "16851108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16851108", "title": "Cadet Honor Code", "text": "Cadet Honor Code\n\nThe United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, the Virginia Military Institute, and The Citadel have a Cadet Honor Code as a formalized statement of the minimum standard of ethics expected of cadets. The only single-sanction honor code systems in the United States exists at the Virginia Military Institute, where a \"Drum-Out\" ceremony is still conducted in barracks in the middle of the night for those found guilty of an honor violation. At The Citadel where if found guilty the result of the trial is announced at lunch the following day, and they are never permitted to return to the campus. \nThe United States Naval Academy has a related standard, known as the Honor Concept.\n\nOther military-styled schools like Norwich University and Texas A&M have similar codes which apply to both cadets and civilian students with their own methods of administration. \nA system and tradition of peer-enforced honorable conduct in a higher educational setting has historically been a part of campus life in other notable U.S. institutions, including Princeton, College of William and Mary, Texas A&M University, University of Virginia and Harvard, among others. In contrast, the U.K. educational system has not until very recently adopted such honor codes, sarcastically dubbing them \"cheaters charters\".\n\nWest Point's Cadet Honor Code reads simply that\n\nCadets accused of violating the Honor Code face a standardized investigative and hearing process (). First they are tried by a jury of their peers. If they are found guilty, the case will go up to the Commandant of the Academy who will give his recommendation, then to the Superintendent of the Academy, who has the discretion to either impose sanctions or recommend that the Secretary of the Army expel the cadet from the Academy.\n\nLYING: Cadets violate the Honor Code by lying if they deliberately deceive another by stating an untruth or by any direct form of communication to include the telling of a partial truth and the vague or ambiguous use of information or language with the intent to deceive or mislead.\n\nCHEATING: A violation of cheating would occur if a Cadet fraudulently acted out of self-interest or assisted another to do so with the intent to gain or to give an unfair advantage. Cheating includes such acts as plagiarism (presenting someone else's ideas, words, data, or work as one's own without documentation), misrepresentation (failing to document the assistance of another in the preparation, revision, or proofreading of an assignment), and using unauthorized notes.\n\nSTEALING: The wrongful taking, obtaining, or withholding by any means from the possession of the owner or any other person any money, personal property, article, or service of value of any kind, with intent to permanently deprive or defraud another person of the use and benefit of the property, or to appropriate it to either their own use or the use of any person other than the owner.\n\nTOLERATION: Cadets violate the Honor Code by tolerating if they fail to report an unresolved incident with honor implications to proper authority within a reasonable length of time. \"Proper authority\" includes the Commandant, the Assistant Commandant, the Director of Military Training, the Athletic Director, a tactical officer, teacher or coach. A \"reasonable length of time\" is the time it takes to confront the Cadet candidate suspected of the honor violation and decide whether the incident was a misunderstanding or a possible violation of the Honor Code. A reasonable length of time is usually considered not to exceed 24 hours.\n\nTo have violated the honor code, a Cadet must have lied, cheated, stolen, or attempted to do so, or tolerated such action on the part of another Cadet. The procedural element of the Honor System examines the two elements that must be present for a Cadet to have committed an honor violation: the act and the intent to commit that act. The latter does not mean intent to violate the Honor Code, but rather the intent to commit the act itself.\n\n\nThe premise behind the Honor Code is as old as the Academy itself. When the Academy was founded in 1802, the officer corps operated on a simple code of honor—an officer's word was his bond. Sylvanus Thayer, Superintendent of the Academy from 1817 to 1833, explicitly banned cheating as part of his efforts to increase the Academy's scholarship standards. Allegations of theft were dealt with under normal Army regulations until the 1920s. The first major step toward formalizing the unwritten Honor Code came in 1922 when Superintendent Douglas MacArthur formed the first Cadet Honor Committee, which reviewed all allegations of honor infractions. In 1947, Superintendent Maxwell Taylor drafted the first official Honor Code publication, which is considered the first codification of the “Cadet Honor Code.” Although failure to report violations had long been reckoned as grounds for expulsion, the code wasn't formally amended to expressly forbid \"toleration\" until 1970.\"\n\nIn August 1951, \"Time\" reported that 90 of the Academy's 2,500 cadets were facing dismissal for mass violations of the honor code related to \"cribbing\", receiving the answers to exams ahead of time, allegedly through upperclass tutors who were assisting other cadets, mostly dedicated football players, to study for those exams.\"\n\nThe Army arranged for an investigation by a panel which included famed jurist Learned Hand and retired generals Troy H. Middleton, then president of Louisiana State University, and Robert M. Danford, a former Commandant of Cadets at West Point. The board recommended dismissal of all 90 suspected violators of the Honor Code, and while the Army and Congress debated the issue and its causes, the cadets were left with a cloud hanging over their heads and their futures.\n\nThere have been other instances of mass cheating scandals at the Academy, including two very famous ones. In August 1976, where it was found that possibly over half of the junior class at the Academy had violated the honor code by cheating on a case assignment. In 1951, 37 members of the football team were dismissed after they were found to have cheated. The team was so decimated that it fell to 2-7, the only losing record suffered by legendary coach Red Blaik.\n\n\"Above all else, cadets are men and women of honor and integrity who can always be trusted. They live by a simple code, The VMI Honor Code, which states:\n\n\"“A Cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.”\" \n\nThe Code pervades all aspects of a cadet’s life. A cadet’s honor is his/her most guarded possession.\nThe education of new cadets about the Honor System is the responsibility of the Honor Court. The Honor Court is composed of first and second class cadets elected by their classmates. In addition to education, the Honor Court is also responsible for adjudicating reported violations of the Honor Code.\nThe VMI Honor System is unique in that it is a single sanction system. The system does not recognize degrees of honor. The sanction for any breach of honor is dismissal. So, when new cadets sign the book on matriculation day they are committing themselves to a life of honesty and integrity. If their commitment is not complete, their stay at the Institute may be short.\"\n\nCadets found guilty of an honor violation at VMI are still dismissed in a Drum Out Ceremony.\n\nThe Cadet Honor Code at the Air Force Academy, like that at West Point, is the cornerstone of a cadet's professional training and development — the minimum standard of ethical conduct that cadets expect of themselves and their fellow cadets. Air Force's honor code was developed and adopted by the Class of 1959, the first class to graduate from the Academy, and has been handed down to every subsequent class. The code adopted was based largely on West Point's Honor Code, but was modified slightly to its current wording:\n\nIn 1984, the Cadet Wing voted to add an \"Honor Oath,\" which was to be taken by all cadets. The oath is administered to fourth class cadets (freshmen) when they are formally accepted into the Wing at the conclusion of Basic Cadet Training. The oath consists of a statement of the code, followed by a resolution to live honorably:\n\nCadets are considered the \"guardians and stewards\" of the Code. Cadet honor representatives throughout the Wing oversee the honor system by conducting education classes and investigating possible honor incidents. Cadets throughout the Wing are expected to sit on Honor Boards as juries that determine whether their fellow cadets violated the code. Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. Although the presumed sanction for a violation is disenrollment, mitigating factors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for some period of time. This \"honor probation\" is usually only reserved for cadets in their first two years at the Academy.\n\nThe Cadet Honor Codes, described within the Cadet Honor Manuals, belong to the Corps of Cadets at these institutions and is administered by cadets. It is each cadet's duty upon enrollment to be familiar with the honor system as set forth in the Honor Manual and to abide by the Honor Code. Simply stated, the Code demands that a cadet does not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Civilian Students at these schools are also required to adhere to an honor code. \n\nThe 2005 ESPN made-for-TV movie \"Code Breakers\" was about the 1951 scandal in which 83 West Point cadets were implicated in violations of the Cadet Honor Code in order to help the West Point football team. The film was nominated for two awards.\n\nThe song 'Intolerance' by the rock band Tool makes specific mention of the Honor Code.\n\nThe 1975 TV movie The Silence is a recounting of the case of Cadet James Pelosi, who though accused of an honor code violation maintained his innocence and refused to resign from the Military Academy; and as a result was \"silenced\" by his fellow cadets as permitted under such circumstances by the Honor Code at that time. He was isolated from the other cadets, was not permitted to have roommates, and had to eat all his meals at a separate table. He was not spoken to by other cadets or officers except on duty, and then only on matters of duty; and when addressed was addressed as \"Mister,\" not by name. Pelosi endured 19 months of this treatment, but went on to graduate with his class in 1973.\n\nThe Long Gray Line, a 1955 biopic of Master Sergeant Martin Maher, who served in the West Point Athletic Department as both an Army enlisted man and a civilian employee, featured a sequence concerning a cadet who married a girl on impulse while on leave. Even though the marriage was immediately annulled, Sergeant Maher pointed out to the cadet that there was the Honor Code to consider. (Cadets at West Point cannot be married, an inflexible rule even today.) The cadet in question submitted his resignation rather than face the Honor Committee.\n\nJimmy Cagney starred in the 1950 movie The West Point Story. Part of the plot involved his character, Elwin \"Bix\" Bixby, a World War II combat veteran and Broadway director, living at West Point as a plebe cadet and occasionally running afoul of the Honor Code.\n\n"}
{"id": "22855682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22855682", "title": "Caigentan", "text": "Caigentan\n\nThe Caigentan () is circa 1590 text written by the Ming Dynasty scholar and philosopher Hong Zicheng (). This compilation of aphorisms eclectically combines elements from the Three teachings (Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism), and is comparable (Goodrich and Fang 1976:678) with Marcus Aurelius' \"Meditations\" or La Rouchefoucauld's \"Maximes\".\n\nChinese \"Caigentan\" combines \"cai\" \"vegetables; greens; (non-staple) food; dish; course (in menu)\", \"gen\" \"roots (of plants); bottom (of mountains)\", and \"talk; conversation; discourse\". This compound \"caigen\" 菜根 \"inedible root of a vegetable; cabbage stalk\" is a literary metaphor meaning \"bare subsistence\" (originating in Zhu Xi's \"Xiaoxue\" 小學 \"Minor Learning\"). The Chinese proverb \"Jiao de caigen, baishi ke zuo\" 嚼得菜根, 百事可做 (Rohsenow 2002:66) literally means \"[One who has] chewed vegetable roots [for lack of anything better to eat] can accomplish anything\", or figuratively \"One who has gone through hardships can do anything\". \"By vegetable roots, food such as turnips, radish, carrots and sweet potatoes is meant\", says Vos (1993:172).\n\nEnglish translations of the \"Caigentan\" title range from literal to figurative:\nIsobe clarifies the title as meaning \"Talks by a man who lives on vegetable roots\", or more freely \"Talks by a man who lives a plain and humble life\".\n\nThe history of \"Caigentan\" editions is convoluted (see Vos 1993, Aitken and Kwok 2006:165-176). No original text is extant in China, and the earliest printed editions are preserved in Japan.\n\nTraditionally, the two received \"Caigentan\" versions are identified by whether they list the author Hong's given name Yingming 應明 or courtesy name Zicheng 自誠. These two texts have three early prefaces. The first \"Zicheng version\" preface is by Yu Kongjian 于孔兼, a contemporary friend who calls the author Hong Zicheng. The second and third \"Yingming version\" prefaces, dated 1768 and 1794, are by Suichutang zhuren 遂初堂主人 \"Suichu Hall Master\" and Sanshan bingfu Tongli 三山病夫通理 \"Three Mountains Invalid Tongli\".\n\nBoth \"Caigentan\" versions are divided into two \"ce\" 冊 \"books; volumes\".\nThe Zicheng version has 360 (or 359) entries, and the Yingming version has 383. The first book is subdivided into four sections, titled \"Xiushen\" 修身 \"Self-cultivation\", \"Yingchou\" 應酬 \"Social Relations\", \"Pingyi\" 評議 \"Critiques\", and \"Xianshi\" 閒適 \"Leisure\"; the second book is titled \"Gailun\" 概論 \"General Comments\". Besides differing in number and ordering of entries, the Zicheng and Yingming editions also differ in content. \"The Yingming version shows many more editorial changes and liberties\", write (Aitken and Kwok 2006:171), and subsequent versions also exhibit \"editorial excisions and additions\". \"Generally speaking \", say (Goodrich and Fang 1976:678), \"the first part of his work counsels integrity in office, whereas the second part describes the joys of living in retirement. Its general spirit is that of the \"Golden Mean\".\"\n\nScholarship tentatively dates the \"Caigentan\" between 1588 and 1591. Yu Kongjian's undated preface to the Zicheng version (tr. Vos 1991:171) provides internal evidence. It begins, \"Sending [uninvited] visitors away, I am leading a retired life all by myself in a thatched cottage.\" The preface further says, \"One day my friend Hung Tzu-ch'eng appeared with his \"Ts'ai-ken t'an\" which he showed to me begging me for a preface.\" In 1588, the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) demoted many scholar-bureaucrats involved in a scandal, including Yu Kongjian who retired to the lower Yangzi River valley, where he and his fellow exile Hong Zicheng lived. In 1591, the \"Caigentan\" was first published as an appendix to Gao Lian's \"Zunsheng Bajian\" 遵生八笺 \"Eight Treatises on Nurturing Life\". Thus, the \"Caigentan\" reasonably dates from 1588 to 1591.\n\nThe classic \"Caigentan\" \"Vegetable Roots Discourse\" remains popular in the present day. Digital editions are freely available on the Internet, and comic book adaptations are offered in both Japanese \"manga\" and Chinese \"manhua\".\n\nIn terms of traditional Chinese literary genres, the \"Caigentan\" is a \"yulu\" 語錄 (lit. \"recorded sayings\") \"quotations; aphorisms\", a subtype of \"shanshu\" 善書 (\"good book\") \"moral-instruction; morality\" book category.\n\nThe individual entries are predominantly written in \"pianwen\" 駢文 \"parallel style\", an ornate rhythmical prose marked by parallelism or chiasmus. For instance,\n口乃心之門, 守口不密, 洩盡真機; 意乃心之足, 防意不嚴, 走盡邪蹊. (1:220)<br>\nThe mouth is the portal of the mind. If not carefully guarded, it leaks true intents and motives. Feelings are the feet of the mind. If not carefully watched, they will take you onto all kinds of wayward paths. (tr. Aitken and Kwok 2006:100) \n\nThe \"Caigentan\" records life lessons from the decadent and corrupt late Ming society, many of which have universal appeal. Take, for example, this warning to partygoers.\nThose who pick up their coats to depart at the height of festivity are admired as adepts who can halt at the precipice. Those who pursue their night journey after their candle has burned out are ridiculed as ordinary persons awash in the bitter sea. (2:104, tr. Aitkens and Kowk 2006:147) \nReferring to the first of the Buddhist Four Noble Truths, Sanskrit \"dukkha\" (Chinese \"ku\") \"suffering; bitterness\", this \"kuhai\" 苦海 \"bitter sea\" is the Chinese translation of \"dukkha-samudra\" \"sea of bitterness; ocean of suffering\".\n\nRetirement and old age are common themes in the \"Caigentan\".\nThe sun is setting and the evening clouds are more colorful than ever. The year is about to end and the oranges and tangerines are all the more fragrant. Thus noble persons in their old age should all the more enliven their spirits a hundredfold. (1:11, tr. Aitken and Kwok 2006:91)\n\nThe Chinese \"Caigentan\" has been translated into many languages. Japanese \"Saikontan\" translations are the most numerous, with over 26 annotated editions published (Wilson 1985:17). English translations are available from Isobe Yaichiro (1926), William Scott Wilson (1985), Thomas Cleary (1990), Paul White (2000), and Robert Baker Aitken and Daniel W. Y. Kwok (2006). In addition, there are partial translations by Chao Tze-Chiang (1959) and by Lee Siu-Leung and Fu Yiyao (2002). Three annotated editions (White, Aitken and Kwok, and Lee and Fu) include parallel text Chinese.\n\nTo illustrate the translational range in English, the \"Caigentan\" metaphorically compares two traditional Chinese artifacts, the \"qiqi\" 攲器 (lit. \"leaning/inclining vessel\") \"a lopsided vessel designed to overturn when full\" and the \"puman\" 撲滿 (lit. \"strike [when] full\") \"clay coin bank; piggy bank\". Compare these translations of 欹器以滿覆, 撲滿以空全. 故君子寧居無不居有, 寧處缺不處完 (1.63):\nThere is an ancient vessel which is so constructed that when it contains no water, it stands obliquely; when half filled, it stands upright; but when full, it will fall down. There is another antique vessel made of earth and used as a savings-box. It has a small opening, through which coins are dropped. Thus, the former falls when it is full, while the latter is useful because it is empty within. Such is the way of the supreme man. He prefers nothing to something; he is content with want rather than seeking after fullness. (Isobe 1926) \n\nWhen the water bottle is full, it overturns. When the piggy bank remains empty, it is whole. Therefore, the gentleman: Resides in vacuity rather than existence, and exists in the lacking rather than the complete. (Wilson 1985) \n\nThere is a kind of vessel that tips over when it is full. A piggy bank is not broken as long as it is empty. So for enlightened people it is better to dwell in nonbeing than in being, better to be lacking than replete. (Cleary 1990) \n\nThe \"qi\" vessel tips over when it is filled with water. The \"puman\" money stays whole so long as it is not filled up with money. Therefore, the accomplished man prefers to settle in a place where there is neither strife nor striving, and dwell in an incomplete placed, not a finished one. (White 2000) \n\nA vessel topples because it is too full. A piggy bank is saved from being shattered for its emptiness. So a true person prefers \"have-not\" than \"have\". Rather be incomplete than to be complete. (Lee and Fu 2004) \n\nThe \"qiqi\" water vessel tips over when it is full. The \"puman\" money-saving vessel is perfect when it is empty. The noble person abides with nothing rather than with something, and is content with lack rather than with completeness. (Aitken and Kwok 2006) \n\nThis \"qiqi\" alludes to the ancient \"Xunzi\" (28.1, tr. Knoblock 1994:244), where it was a symbolic warning against complacency. When Confucius visited the ancestral temple of Duke Huan of Qi, he saw a \"vessel that inclined to one side\", which the caretaker called a \"you zuo zhi qi\" 宥坐之器 \"warning vessel that sat on the right\". Confucius said: \"I have heard of such a warning vessel; if empty, it inclines; if half full, it is upright, and if completely full, it overturns\". After watching a demonstration of the vessel's operation, he sighed: \"Alas! How indeed could there be complete fullness and no overturning!\"\n\n\n"}

He attended primary school in his native city from 1856 to 1860, followed by high school from 1860 to 1867. His classmates there included Alexandru Lambrior, George Panu and Calistrat Hogaș. From 1867 to 1869, he attended the literature and philosophy faculty of Iași University, and at the same time worked as a substitute Latin teacher. From 1869 to 1870, Dimitrescu-Iași taught at Botoșani. He again taught at Iași from 1870 to 1872, continuing his university studies in the process. From 1872 to 1875, he was a teacher in Bârlad. He then went to Germany to study at the universities of Berlin (1875-1876) and Leipzig (1876-1877). From 1879 to 1885, he taught aesthetics, history of philosophy, logic, psychology and pedagogy at Iași University.\n\nIn 1885, Dimitrescu-Iași transferred to Bucharest University, where he taught history of ancient and modern philosophy, ethics and aesthetics until his retirement in 1919. An inspector general with the Education Minister, he was also director of the Iași higher normal school, of the Bucharest University Library (1898-1910) and of the pedagogic seminary run by the university (1899-1919). He served as rector of Bucharest University for twelve years, from October 1898 to January 1911. Although he joined \"Junimea\" in 1878, Dimitrescu-Iași did not endorse its political orientation, indeed condemning its positions in a series of articles that appeared in \"Drapelul\" and \"Democrația\" from 1897 to 1898. Dimitrescu-Iași led \"Revista pedagogică\" magazine from 1891 to 1898 and was quite familiar with the principles of modern pedagogy. A close associate of Spiru Haret, he made a substantial contribution to the 1898 law for the reform of secondary and higher education. He died in Turnu Severin.\n\nHis philosophical outlook was deeply influenced by the European positivism and evolutionism of the 19th century's second half, from which he adopted numerous ideas, sometimes uncritically. Dimitrescu-Iași considered that people were machines in motion, mere complexes of physiological phenomena. An adherent of a monism tinged with materialism, he believed in the unity of matter and spirit and advocated an ethics based on scientific data. He was the first to teach sociology in Romania; his courses were based on Darwinist arguments. In his teaching, he helped circulate certain socialist ideas, but was against their practical application. He wrote several studies on the sociology of literature (\"Recenzentul\"; \"Spiritul democratic în literatură, arte, știință\") that did not consistently apply rigorous argumentation.\n\nIn the field of aesthetics, Dimitrescu-Iași attempted to reconcile positivism and evolutionism with the ideas of Romantic German philosophy, starting from Johann Friedrich Herbart's formalism, of which he considered himself a disciple. He set forth his ideas in \"Der Schönheitsbegriff\" (\"The Concept of the Beautiful\"), which he partly translated in 1895 in \"România literară și științifică\", as well as in several articles that appeared under the pen name Faust in the newspapers \"Dreptatea\" (1896), \"Drapelul\" and \"Democrația\" (1896-1898). He played an important role in leading Romanian aesthetics toward a more precise understanding of the role and function of art in society. Emphasizing the importance of the natural sciences for aesthetics, he tended to base his opinions on the experimental sciences. He believed that beauty could be explained by experimental methods working together with psychology, particularly those of Völkerpsychologie. Using Herbart's opinions and the experimental findings of Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Fechner, Adolf Zeising, Friedrich Theodor Vischer and Robert von Zimmermann, he distinguished between two aspects of beauty (one purely formal and objective, the other subjective), and theorized that their coming into harmony defined beauty's essence.\n\nFor Dimitrescu-Iași, poetic beauty was purely subjective, based on imagination and feeling; the term \"beauty\" in this case was merely a convention, and the material itself comprised its imagery. But poetic creations could only be considered beautiful through the lens of formal relations between images, the only ones which defined their originality. The artist was seen as a superior being in terms of physiological development, giving rise to the notion of \"dynasties of talent\". However, these are influenced by their natural and social surroundings, which explains the appearance of creative individuals under democratic conditions.\n\nHis view of literary criticism was that the discipline needed to avoid a mechanical application of aesthetic theories, instead explaining the origin, development and dissipation of literary trends. By adhering to objectivity, it forms judgments based not on the value of the work's subject, but on the originality of formal relations and the author's sincerity. This is because in art, beauty is equivalent to truth, and is more thoroughly explained by the laws of emotional life. Some of his opinions allowed him to understand and sympathize with many of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea's principles, whom he assisted in his journalistic activity.\n"}

He was named Cyril, after his Dad, just as his sister, born two years later, was named Maisie, after his Mum. Another sister, Marina, was born two years later. She was to die of TB at the age of eighteen months. Says Desbruslais, \"She has always been my little baby intercessor in heaven. Mum and Dad died, also of TB, in the early 1950s (it was a fatal illness, in those days). We were brought up by a very loving Uncle (my Mum's brother).\" Desbruslais was schooled, at first in Calcutta, with the Jesuits (St Xavier's), then with the Irish Christian brothers (in a boarding school, Asansol) and he enjoyed his five years with them. He almost joined them, but thought better of it. He did his Bachelor of Commerce at St Xavier's College (Calcutta) and worked for a year at Remington Rand of India.\nDesbruslais was inspired to join the Society of Jesus.\nHe had a Jesuit Uncle, Fr Vernon Desbruslais SJ, and perhaps his personality and the love everyone had for his gentle ways of service had some impact on him, which he did not notice at the time. He had been, off and on, considering being a priest, which he used to brush aside. But from 1962, the whole question began to bug him so, that he decided to give it a try. He joined the Society as they were the only Catholic priests he really knew In retrospect, Desbruslais is glad that he entered the Society. He says, \"I don't think I'd have lasted very long anywhere else. The Jesuits, for all their stress on obedience, give plenty of scope for creativity and initiative.\" He has influenced countless young people, including Shashi Tharoor, former Minister of External Affairs, and General Shankar Roychowdhury, former Chief of the Army Staff.\n\nApart from St Ignatius of Loyola, Pedro Arrupe SJ inspired Desbruslais most. As Desbruslais puts it,\"He helped the Society come alive for me. He taught me about the inseparable link between faith and justice. He was a true contemplative in action. He was able to meet this charismatic personality twice, when he visited DNC and one of my treasured possessions is a book with his signature in it. Just to re-read one of his writings (especially \"On Our Way of Proceeding\") fires me with enthusiasm and fervor all over again.\" He is also deeply impressed by Adolfo Nicolás SJ, whom he met before he became General, at the \"Asian Identity Seminar\" in Delhi and who reminds him in so many ways of Arrupe. Nicolas has an infectious joy and sense of commitment. Desbruslais is also influenced by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ, who taught him about the holiness of matter and the divine milieu.\n\nHe started the group \"Searching in Service and Unity\" (SSU) in 1971, when he was beginning his Theology studies at De Nobili College, Pune, India. Since he had faced a lot of problems and confusion in his own youth, he wanted to help other youngsters not to make the mistakes and blunders he did. He wanted to reach out especially to youngsters who normally don't feel drawn to join any youth groups, who seemed to be interested only in \"freaking out\" and drifting along. He also wanted to set up an inter-denominational youth group, one made up of young people of different religious and ethnic backgrounds. \"And I wanted us to celebrate our differences, not just sweep them under the carpet and so we had inter-faith celebrations of our major feasts\". Finally he wanted to help youngsters to develop a deep social sense, a sense of responsibility and concern for the poor, the deprived and all victims of injustice, in our country and all over the world – and do something about it.\nIn the SSU there are Outreach programmes where they collaborate with Institutions doing this kind of work (mainly with NGOs). The group also stages an annual play (usually written by him) with a social message, giving youngsters to discover and develop her talents.The lion's share of the profits go to the NGO concerned. Yes, the group is now 42 years old (2013) and had a three-day Ruby Anniversary Celebration of this in December 2011, with SSU members from over the years (many of whom have their own teenage children following in their footsteps into the SSU). They meet once on Sundays (a one hour's fun and games session, followed by a one hour of creativity or personality development) after the Catholics - with more than a little help from some of the non-Christians! - have animated the 5.30 Sunday evening Mass at the Jesuit parish of St Xavier's in Pune, Camp. Then there are the regular Outreaches, the Annual one week leadership training Camp, at Kune, besides the yearly fund-raiser dramatic venture.\n\nIn an interview given to \"DNC Times\", he put it succinctly: \"I suppose it's to help all people become more fully human, more fully alive. That would also imply recognizing that beauty is unity in diversity. Unity without diversity is uniformity, and that's boring; diversity without beauty is jarring and garish, and that's ugly. We, the so-called clergy, must be prepared to do a little more listening and learning and a good deal less talking and teaching. Each of us can learn how to better and appreciate our faith and culture more by being more open to, and learning from, the views of others.\nHe was exposed to liberation theology during his Theology studies (1971–1974) at and was deeply moved by it. As Gustavo Gutiérrez had put it, liberation theology is not a mere re-hashing of the old doctrinal theses with a new emphases, as in Jürgen Moltmann's \"Theology of Hope\", for instance. Rather, liberation theology is a radically new hermeneutic – \"a theologising from the underside of the boot.\" If other contemporary Western theologians, like Karl Rahner, Edward Schillebeeckx and Avery Dulles weren't exactly wearing the oppressor's boot that trod down the poor, they certainly did not share the situation of the oppressed. Now it is oppressed people (\"under the boot\") who are enunciating a theology, from their oppressed perspective. And that is a totally new way of looking at things. And wasn't the Bible addressed primarily to them?\nBut, one might ask, \"Could such uneducated, illiterate and dehumanised people theologise at all?\" Desbruslais devoured the latters volumes and was convinced.\n\nAround about this time (1975), an International Synod of Bishops, inspired by Medellin, spoke of the inseparable link between authentic faith and action for justice. General Congregation XXXII of the Society of Jesus put it more forcefully when it spoke of the \"inseparable link\" between faith formation and building up God's kingdom (action for justice, again). And then there was Fr Pedro Arrupe SJ, the man who helped put the Society of Jesus back on its radical path again. He was convinced that this was the way to live out the Christian, Jesuit way of life in today's world.\n\nBut, it took inspiration from the Bible and was inspired by the mission of Moses, the Old Testament prophets and finally, the greatest and most striking prophet of them all, Jesus - a man, \"THE\" man, more than a man. But India is 98.5% non-Christian, so liberation theology would be able to galvanize, at most a minute 1 1/2% of our people for faith-inspired action for justice. What about the others? One could, of course, try to elaborate a separate liberation theology for Hindus, based on the Gita (as some Indian freedom fighters had done, during the struggle for Independence - or other Hindu Holy Books), a liberation theology for Muslims, based on the Koran (as Ashgar Ali Engineer and some brave young radicals in Iran are doing) ... but that would only divide us up again! What we need is united action for justice and liberation by ALL Indians, inspired with a common vision. And this common vision could NOT be the Holy Book of one religion, but a shared understanding of the human person. However, After all, the colonials had fallen into the rut of peddling the dominant qualities of their oppressive group as THE human characteristics: adult, male, white, Christian (and they had scant respect for people or cultures which were not distinguished by these attributes).\n\nYet, So he dialogued with people (\"common people\", youth of all religions and their families, from his youth group, and all over the country and abroad, not forgetting to talk over controversial issues with academics and University professors, too). And he eventually formulated an understanding of \"common human nature, adequately understood\" (the phrase is from the medieval Francisco Suárez SJ and listed the following four conditions for considering a being human: embodiedness, a social dimension, rootedness in the world and a capacity for transcendence (the ability to go beyond the space-time boundaries). Thus it is not absolutely necessary to believe in God or be religious to be fully human; but one must be, at least, spiritual and open to transcendence.\n\nAnd the work still goes on.\n\n\nDesbruslais has written and directed yearly plays with relevant social themes. With more than 25 stage plays on themes as diverse as nuclear disarmament, globalisation, terrorism, capitalism and consumerism and religious dogma to his credit, Desbruslais believes that theatre enlightens and changes mindsets, attitudes and prejudices. \"Through the messages embedded in our plays, SSU is promoting out-of-the-box thinking among the young and is abating — if not removing — hatred that's making us all such violent beings,\" he says. Some of his plays are:\n"}
{"id": "61093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61093", "title": "Deductive reasoning", "text": "Deductive reasoning\n\nDeductive reasoning, also deductive logic, logical deduction is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.\n\nDeductive reasoning goes in the same direction as that of the conditionals, and links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.\n\nDeductive reasoning (\"top-down logic\") contrasts with inductive reasoning (\"bottom-up logic\") in the following way; in deductive reasoning, a conclusion is reached reductively by applying general rules which hold over the entirety of a closed domain of discourse, narrowing the range under consideration until \"only\" the conclusion(s) is left. In inductive reasoning, the conclusion is reached by generalizing or extrapolating from specific cases to general rules, i.e., there is epistemic uncertainty. However, the inductive reasoning mentioned here is not the same as induction used in mathematical proofs – mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning.\n\nDeductive reasoning differs from abductive reasoning by the direction of the reasoning relative to the conditionals. Deductive reasoning goes in the \"same direction as that of the conditionals, whereas abductive reasoning goes in the opposite direction to that of the conditionals.\n\nAn example of an argument using deductive reasoning:\n\nThe first premise states that all objects classified as \"men\" have the attribute \"mortal.\" The second premise states that \"Socrates\" is classified as a \"man\" – a member of the set \"men.\" The conclusion then states that \"Socrates\" must be \"mortal\" because he inherits this attribute from his classification as a \"man.\"\n\nModus ponens (also known as \"affirming the antecedent\" or \"the law of detachment\") is the primary deductive rule of inference. It applies to arguments that have as first premise a conditional statement (formula_1) and as second premise the antecedent (formula_2) of the conditional statement. It obtains the consequent (formula_3) of the conditional statement as its conclusion. The argument form is listed below:\n\nIn this form of deductive reasoning, the consequent (formula_3) obtains as the conclusion from the premises of a conditional statement (formula_1) and its antecedent (formula_2). However, the antecedent (formula_2) cannot be similarly obtained as the conclusion from the premises of the conditional statement (formula_1) and the consequent (formula_3). Such an argument commits the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nThe following is an example of an argument using modus ponens:\n\nSince the measurement of angle formula_13 is greater than 90° and less than 180°, we can deduce from the conditional (if-then) statement that formula_13 is an obtuse angle.\nHowever, if we are given that formula_13 is an obtuse angle, we cannot deduce from the conditional statement that 90° < formula_13 < 180°. It might be true that other angles outside this range are also obtuse.\n\nModus tollens (also known as \"the law of contrapositive\") is a deductive rule of inference. It validates an argument that has as premises a conditional statement (formula_1) and the negation of the consequent (formula_22) and as conclusion the negation of the antecedent (formula_23). In contrast to modus ponens, reasoning with modus tollens goes in the opposite direction to that of the conditional. The general expression for modus tollens is the following:\n\n\nThe following is an example of an argument using modus tollens:\n\n\nThe law of syllogism takes two conditional statements and forms a conclusion by combining the hypothesis of one statement with the conclusion of another. Here is the general form:\n\nThe following is an example:\n\n\nWe deduced the final statement by combining the hypothesis of the first statement with the conclusion of the second statement.\nWe also allow that this could be a false statement. This is an example of the transitive property in mathematics. Another example is the transitive property of equality which can be stated in this form:\n\n\nDeductive arguments are evaluated in terms of their \"validity\" and \"soundness\".\n\nAn argument is “valid” if it is impossible for its premises to be true while its conclusion is false. In other words, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. An argument can be “valid” even if one or more of its premises are false.\n\nAn argument is “sound” if it is \"valid\" and the premises are true.\n\nIt is possible to have a deductive argument that is logically \"valid\" but is not \"sound\". Fallacious arguments often take that form.\n\nThe following is an example of an argument that is “valid”, but not “sound”:\n\nThe example’s first premise is false – there are people who eat carrots who are not quarterbacks – but the conclusion would necessarily be true, if the premises were true. In other words, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is “valid”, but not “sound”. False generalizations – such as \"Everyone who eats carrots is a quarterback\" – are often used to make unsound arguments. The fact that there are some people who eat carrots but are not quarterbacks proves the flaw of the argument.\n\nIn this example, the first statement uses categorical reasoning, saying that all carrot-eaters are definitely quarterbacks. This theory of deductive reasoning – also known as term logic – was developed by Aristotle, but was superseded by propositional (sentential) logic and predicate logic. \n\nDeductive reasoning can be contrasted with inductive reasoning, in regards to validity and soundness. In cases of inductive reasoning, even though the premises are true and the argument is “valid”, it is possible for the conclusion to be false (determined to be false with a counterexample or other means).\n\nAristotle started documenting deductive reasoning in the 4th century BC.\n\n\n"}

Variably deployable physiological processes relate mostly to processes that defend or clear infections as these are optional while also having high costs and circumstance linked benefits. They include immune system responses, fever, antioxidants and the plasma level of iron. Notable determining factors are life history stage, and resource availability.\n\nActivating the immune system has the present and future benefit of clearing infections, but it is also both expensive in regard to present high metabolic energy consumption, and in the risk of resulting in a future immune related disorder. Therefore, an adaptive advantage exists if an animal can control its deployment in regard to actuary-like evaluations of future benefits and costs as to its biological fitness. In many circumstances, such trade-off calculations explain why immune responses are suppressed and infections are tolerated. Circumstances where immunity is not activated due to lack of an actuarial benefit include:\n\nCost benefit trade-off actuary issues apply to the antibacterial and antiviral effects of fever (increased body temperature). Fever has the future benefit of clearing infections since it reduces the replication of bacteria and viruses. But it also has great present metabolic (BMR) cost, and the risk of hyperpyrexia. Where it is achieved internally, each degree raise in blood temperature, raises BMR by 10–15%. 90% of the total cost of fighting pneumonia, goes, for example, on energy devoted to raising body temperature. During sepsis, the resulting fever can raise BMR by 55%—and cause a 15% to 30% loss of body mass. Circumstances in which fever deployment is not selected or is reduced include:\n\nAntioxidants such as carotenoids, vitamin C, Vitamin E, and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) can protect against reactive oxygen species that damage DNA, proteins and lipids, and result in cell senescence and death. A cost exists in creating or obtaining these antioxidants. This creates a conflict between the biological fitness benefits of future survival compared with the use of these antioxidants to advantage present reproductive success. In some birds, antioxidants are diverted from maintaining the body to reproduction for this reason with the result that they have accelerated senescence Related to this, birds can show their biological capacity to afford the cost of diverting antioxidants (such as carotenoids) in the form of pigments into plumage as a costly signal.\n\nIron is vital to biological processes, not only of a host, but also to bacteria infecting the host. A biological fitness advantage can exist for hosts to reduce the availability of iron within itself to such bacteria (hypoferremia), even though this happens at a cost of the host impairing itself with anemia. The potential benefits of such self impairment is illustrated by the paradoxical effect that providing iron supplements to those with iron deficiency (which interferes with its antibacterial action) can result in an individual being cured of anemia but having increased bacterial illness.\n\n"}
{"id": "8355930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8355930", "title": "Developmental systems theory", "text": "Developmental systems theory\n\nDevelopmental systems theory (DST) is an overarching theoretical perspective on biological development, heredity, and evolution. It emphasizes the shared contributions of genes, environment, and epigenetic factors on developmental processes. DST, unlike conventional scientific theories, is not directly used to help make predictions for testing experimental results; instead, it is seen as a collection of philosophical, psychological, and scientific models of development and evolution. As a whole, these models argue the inadequacy of the modern evolutionary synthesis on the roles of genes and natural selection as the principle explanation of living structures. Developmental systems theory embraces a large range of positions that expand biological explanations of organismal development and hold modern evolutionary theory as a misconception of the nature of living processes.\n\nAll versions of developmental systems theory espouse the view that:\n\n\nIn other words, although it does not claim that all structures are equal, development systems theory is fundamentally opposed to reductionism of all kinds. In short, developmental systems theory intends to formulate a perspective which does not presume the causal (or ontological) priority of any particular entity and thereby maintains an explanatory openness on all empirical fronts. For example, there is vigorous resistance to the widespread assumptions that one can legitimately speak of genes ‘for’ specific phenotypic characters or that adaptation consists of evolution ‘shaping’ the more or less passive species, as opposed to adaptation consisting of organisms actively selecting, defining, shaping and often creating their niches.\n\nTo adopt a computing metaphor, the reductionists whom developmental systems theory opposes assume that causal factors can be divided into ‘processes’ and ‘data’, as in the Harvard computer architecture. Data (inputs, resources, content, and so on) is required by all processes, and must often fall within certain limits if the process in question is to have its ‘normal’ outcome. However, the data alone is helpless to create this outcome, while the process may be ‘satisfied’ with a considerable range of alternative data. Developmental systems theory, by contrast, assumes that the process/data distinction is at best misleading and at worst completely false, and that while it may be helpful for very specific pragmatic or theoretical reasons to treat a structure now as a process and now as a datum, there is always a risk (to which reductionists routinely succumb) that this methodological convenience will be promoted into an ontological conclusion. In fact, for the proponents of DST, either all structures are both process and data, depending on context, or even more radically, no structure is either.\n\nFor reductionists there is a fundamental asymmetry between different causal factors, whereas for DST such asymmetries can only be justified by specific purposes, and argue that many of the (generally unspoken) purposes to which such (generally exaggerated) asymmetries have been put are scientifically illegitimate. Thus, for developmental systems theory, many of the most widely applied, asymmetric and entirely legitimate distinctions biologists draw (between, say, genetic factors that create potential and environmental factors that select outcomes or genetic factors of determination and environmental factors of realisation) obtain their legitimacy from the conceptual clarity and specificity with which they are applied, not from their having tapped a profound and irreducible ontological truth about biological causation. One problem might be solved by reversing the direction of causation correctly identified in another. This parity of treatment is especially important when comparing the evolutionary and developmental explanations for one and the same character of an organism.\n\nOne upshot of this approach is that developmental systems theory also argues that what is inherited from generation to generation is a good deal more than simply genes (or even the other items, such as the fertilised zygote, that are also sometimes conceded). As a result, much of the conceptual framework that justifies ‘selfish gene’ models is regarded by developmental systems theory as not merely weak but actually false. Not only are major elements of the environment built and inherited as materially as any gene but active modifications to the environment by the organism (for example, a termite mound or a beaver’s dam) demonstrably become major environmental factors to which future adaptation is addressed. Thus, once termites have begun to build their monumental nests, it is the demands of living in those very nests to which future generations of termite must adapt.\n\nThis inheritance may take many forms and operate on many scales, with a multiplicity of systems of inheritance complementing the genes. From position and maternal effects on gene expression to epigenetic inheritance to the active construction and intergenerational transmission of enduring niches, development systems theory argues that not only inheritance but evolution as a whole can be understood only by taking into account a far wider range of ‘reproducers’ or ‘inheritance systems’ – genetic, epigenetic, behavioural and symbolic – than neo-Darwinism’s ‘atomic’ genes and gene-like ‘replicators’. DST regards every level of biological structure as susceptible to influence from all the structures by which they are surrounded, be it from above, below, or any other direction – a proposition that throws into question some of (popular and professional) biology’s most central and celebrated claims, not least the ‘central dogma’ of Mendelian genetics, any direct determination of phenotype by genotype, and the very notion that any aspect of biological (or psychological, or any other higher form) activity or experience is capable of direct or exhaustive genetic or evolutionary ‘explanation’.\n\nDevelopmental systems theory is plainly radically incompatible with both neo-Darwinism and information processing theory. Whereas neo-Darwinism defines evolution in terms of changes in gene distribution, the possibility that an evolutionarily significant change may arise and be sustained without any directly corresponding change in gene frequencies is an elementary assumption of developmental systems theory, just as neo-Darwinism’s ‘explanation’ of phenomena in terms of reproductive fitness is regarded as fundamentally shallow. Even the widespread mechanistic equation of ‘gene’ with a specific DNA sequence has been thrown into question, as have the analogous interpretations of evolution and adaptation.\n\nLikewise, the wholly generic, functional and anti-developmental models offered by information processing theory are comprehensively challenged by DST’s evidence that nothing is explained without an explicit structural and developmental analysis on the appropriate levels. As a result, what qualifies as ‘information’ depends wholly on the content and context out of which that information arises, within which it is translated and to which it is applied.\n\nDevelopmental systems theory is by no means a narrowly defined collection of ideas, and the boundaries with neighbouring models are very porous. Notable related ideas (with key texts) include:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14613155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14613155", "title": "Dynamism (metaphysics)", "text": "Dynamism (metaphysics)\n\nDynamism is a general name for a group of philosophical views concerning the nature of matter. However different they may be in other respects, all these views agree in making matter consist essentially of simple and indivisible units, substances, or forces. Dynamism is sometimes used to denote systems that admit not only matter and extension, but also determinations, tendencies, and forces intrinsic and essential to matter. More properly, however, it means exclusive systems that do away with the dualism of matter and force by reducing the former to the latter.\n\nDynamism is the metaphysics of Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) that reconciles hylomorphic substance theory with mechanistic atomism by way of a pre-established harmony, and which was later developed by Christian Wolff (1679–1754) as a metaphysical cosmology. The major thesis for Leibniz follows as a consequences of his \"monad\", that: “the nature of every substance carries a general expression of the whole universe. [The monad provides] the concept of an individual substance that contains...all its phenomena, such that nothing can happen to substance that is not generated from its own ground...but in conformity to what happens to another”... Whereby Leibniz \"counters the tendency inherent in Cartesian and Spinozistic rationalism toward an “isolationist” interpretation of the ontological independence of substance... Leibniz’s account of substantial force aims to furnish the complete metaphysical groundwork for a science of dynamics\".\n\nElements of Dynamism can be found in the works of Henri Bergson, and in more contemporary works, such as the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead in terms of relations, as well as the systems theory of Ludwig von Bertalanffy and William Ross Ashby. The Basque philosopher Xavier Zubiri, most notably in his works, \"On Essence\" and \"Dynamic Structure of Reality\" details of several dynamisms inherent in the universe, beginning with variation, then onto alteration, selfhood, self-possession, living-together, onto Dynamism as a Mode of Being-in-the-world. It is a response to the Philosophy of Spirit via Hegel in addition to reductionists and Heidegger. This concept also has resonances with the Object-oriented ontology and Speculative Realism schools of philosophy.\n"}

{"id": "3829592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3829592", "title": "Human bonding", "text": "Human bonding\n\nHuman bonding is the process of development of a close, interpersonal relationship between two or more people. It most commonly takes place between family members or friends, but can also develop among groups, such as sporting teams and whenever people spend time together. Bonding is a mutual, interactive process, and is different from simple liking.\n\nBonding typically refers to the process of attachment that develops between romantic or platonic partners, close friends, or parents and children. This bond is characterized by emotions such as affection and trust. Any two people who spend time together may form a bond. Male bonding refers to the establishment of relationships between men through shared activities. The term female bonding refers to the formation of close personal relationships between women. Cross-sex friendships refers to personal relationships between men and women.\n\nIn the 4th century BC, the Greek philosopher Plato argued that love directs the bonds of human society. In his \"Symposium\", Eryximachus, one of the narrators in the dialog, states that love goes far beyond simple attraction to human beauty. He states that it occurs throughout the animal and plant kingdoms, as well as throughout the universe. Love directs everything that occurs, in the realm of the gods as well as that of humans (186a–b).\n\nEryximachus reasons that when various opposing elements such as wet and dry are \"animated by the proper species of Love, they are in harmony with one another ... But when the sort of Love that is crude and impulsive controls the seasons, he brings death and destruction\" (188a). Because it is love that guides the relations between these sets of opposites throughout existence, in every case it is the higher form of love that brings harmony and cleaves toward the good, whereas the impulsive vulgar love creates disharmony.\n\nPlato concludes that the highest form of love is the greatest. When love \"is directed, in temperance and justice, towards the good, whether in heaven or on earth: happiness and good fortune, the bonds of human society, concord with the gods above—all these are among his gifts\" (188d).\n\nIn the 1660s, the Dutch philosopher Spinoza wrote, in his \"Ethics of Human Bondage or the Strength of the Emotions\", that the term \"bondage\" relates to the human infirmity in moderating and checking the emotions. That is, according to Spinoza, \"when a man is prey to his emotions, he is not his own master, but lies at the mercy of fortune.\"\n\nIn 1809 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in his classic novella \"Elective Affinities\", wrote of the \"marriage tie,\" and by analogy shows how strong marriage unions are similar in character to that by which the particles of quicksilver find a unity together through the process of chemical affinity. Humans in passionate relationships, according to Goethe, are analogous to reactive substances in a chemical equation.\n\nThe term \"pair bond\" originated in 1940 in reference to mated pairs of birds; referring to a monogamous or relatively monogamous relationship. Whilst some form of monogamy may characterize around 90% of bird species, in mammals long-term pairing (beyond the brief duration of copulation itself) is rare, at around 3% (see animal monogamy). The incidence of monogamy in primate species is similarly low in contrast with polygyny (one male mating with two or more females), the most common pattern. However, regardless of mating patterns, primate life is typically characterized by long-lasting social relationships (whether sexual, care-giving, coalitionary or otherwise) formed in the context of living in durable social groups, and any such durable relationship (whether exclusive or not) is characterized by some degree of bonding. Similarly, whilst the 'naturalness' of monogamy in humans is debated, durable monogamous or polygamous relationships will typically be accompanied by affectional or emotional bonding (see next section).\n\nAccording to \"limerence theory\", posited in 1979 by psychologist Dorothy Tennov, a certain percentage of couples may go through what is called a \"limerent reaction\", in which one or both of the pair may experience a state of passion mixed with continuous intrusive thinking, fear of rejection, and hope. Hence, with all human romantic relationships, one of three varieties of \"bonds\" may form, defined over a set duration of time, in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence:\n\nThe constitution of these bonds may vary over the course of the relationship, in ways that may either increase or decrease the intensity of the limerence. A characteristic of this delineation made by Tennov, is that based on her research and interviews with over 500 people, all human bonded relationships can be divided into three varieties being defined by the amount of limerence or non-limerence each partner contributes to the relationship.\n\nIn 1958, British developmental psychologist John Bowlby published the paper \"the \"Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother\",\" in which the precursory concepts of \"attachment theory\" were developed. This included the development of the concept of the \"affectional bond\", sometimes referred to as the \"emotional bond\", which is based on the universal tendency for humans to attach, i.e. to seek closeness to another person and to feel secure when that person is present. Attachment theory has some of its origins in the observation of and experiments with animals, but is also based on observations of children who had missed typical experiences of adult care. Much of the early research on attachment in humans was done by John Bowlby and his associates. Bowlby proposed that babies have an inbuilt need from birth to make emotional attachments, i.e. bonds, because this increases the chances of survival by ensuring that they receive the care they need. Bowlby did not describe mutuality in attachment. He stated that attachment by mother was a pathological inversion and described only behaviors of the infant. Many developmental specialists elaborated Bowlby's ethological observations. However, neither Bowlby's proximity seeking (not possible for human infants prior to walking) nor subsequent descriptions of caregiver–infant mutuality with emotional availability and synchrony with emotional modulation include the enduring motivation of attachment into adult life. The enduring motivation is the desire to control a pleasantly surprising transformation that is the route of belief in effectiveness by humans.[citation needed] This motivation accounts for curiosity and intellectual growth of language, mathematics and logic, all of which have an emotional base of security.\n\nOf all human bonds, the \"maternal bond\" (mother–infant relationship) is one of the strongest. The maternal bond begins to develop during pregnancy; following pregnancy, the production of oxytocin during lactation increases parasympathetic activity, thus reducing anxiety and theoretically fostering bonding. It is generally understood that maternal oxytocin circulation can predispose some mammals to show caregiving behavior in response to young of their species.\n\nBreastfeeding has been reported to foster the early post-partum maternal bond, via touch, response, and mutual gazing. Extensive claims for the effect of breastfeeding were made in the 1930s by Margaret Ribble, a champion of \"infant rights,\" but were challenged by others. The claimed effect is not universal, and bottle-feeding mothers are generally appropriately concerned with their babies. It is difficult to determine the extent of causality due to a number of confounding variables, such as the varied reasons families choose different feeding methods. Many believe that early bonding ideally increases response and sensitivity to the child's needs, bolstering the quality of the mother–baby relationship—however, many exceptions can be found of highly successful mother–baby bonds, even though early breastfeeding did not occur, such as with premature infants who may lack the necessary sucking strength to be successfully breastfed.\n\nResearch following Bowlby's observations (above) created some concern about whether adoptive parents have missed some crucial period for the child's development. However, research on The Mental and Social Life of Babies suggested that the \"parent-infant system,\" rather than a bond between biologically related individuals, is an evolved fit between innate behavior patterns of all human infants and equally evolved responses of human adults to those infant behaviors. Thus nature \"ensures some initial flexibility with respect to the particular adults who take on the parental role.\"\n\nIn contrast to the maternal bond, \"paternal bonds\" tend to vary over the span of a child's development in terms of both strength and stability. In fact, many children now grow up in fatherless households and do not experience a paternal bond at all. In general, paternal bonding is more dominant later in a child's life after language develops. Fathers may be more influential in play interactions as opposed to nurturance interactions. Father–child bonds also tend to develop with respect to topics such as political views or money, whereas mother–child bonds tend to develop in relation to topics such as religious views or general outlooks on life.\n\nIn 2003, a researcher from Northwestern University in Illinois found that progesterone, a hormone more usually associated with pregnancy and maternal bonding, may also control the way men react towards their children. Specifically, they found that a lack of progesterone reduced aggressive behavior in male mice and stimulated them to act in a fatherly way towards their offspring.\n\nThe \"human–animal bond\" can occur between people and domestic or wild animals; be it a cat as a pet or birds outside one's window. The phrase “Human-Animal Bond” also known as HAB began to emerge as terminology in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Research into the nature and merit of the human–animal bond began in the late 18th century when, in York, England, the Society of Friends established The Retreat to provide humane treatment for the mentally ill. By having patients care for the many farm animals on the estate, society officials theorized that the combination of animal contact plus productive work would facilitate the patients' rehabilitation. In the 1870s in Paris, a French surgeon had patients with neurological disorders ride horses. The patients were found to have improved their motor control and balance and were less likely to suffer bouts of depression.\n\nDuring the 1820-1870s America's Victorian middle class used the human-animal bond to aid in children's socialization. This was an entirely gendered process, as parents and society believed only boys had an innate tendency towards violence and needed to be socialized towards kindness and empathy through companion animals. Over time pet keeping to socialize children became more gender neutral, but even into the 1980s and 90s there remained a belief that boys especially benefited from pet keeping due to the fact that it was one of only ways they could practice nurturing given the limiting gender norms.\n\nAn example of the Human-Animal Bond can be seen during World War I on the Western Front with horses. The use of this animal was widespread as over 24,000 horses and mules were used in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I. The horse connection can be seen as horses were used to pull wagons for their drivers, as individual transport mounts for officers, and patients for veterinarians. When researching the human-animal bond there is a danger of anthropomorphism and projections of human qualities.\n\nIn the 19th century, in Bielefeld, Germany, epileptic patients were given the prescription to spend time each day taking care of cats and dogs. The contact with the animals was found to reduce the occurrence of seizures. As early as the 1920s people were starting to utilize the human-animal bond not just for healing, but also granting independence through service animals. In 1929 The Seeing Eye Inc. school formed to train guide dogs for the blind in the United States, inspired by dogs being trained to guide World War I veterans in Europe. Furthermore, the idea is that the human-animal bond can provide health benefits to humans as the animals \"appeal to fundamental human needs for companionship, comfort, and security...\" In 1980, a team of scientists at the University of Pennsylvania found that human to animal contact was found to reduce the physiological characteristics of stress; specifically, lowered levels of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, anxiety, and tension were all found to correlate positively with human–pet bonding.\n\nIn some cases, despite its benefits, the human-animal bond can be used for harmful purposes. The 1990s saw an increase in social and scientific awareness of the use of companion animals as a tool for domestic violence. A 1997 study found that 80% of shelters reported women staying with them had experienced their abuser threatening or harming companion animals as a form of abuse.\n\nA study in 2003, by the U.S. Department of Defense, based on human-animal bonding determined that there was an improvement and enrichment of life when animals were closely involved with humans. The study tested blood levels and noticed a rise in Oxytocin in humans and animals which participated; Oxytocin has the ability to lower stress, heart rate, and fear levels in humans and animals.\n\nHistorically, animals were domesticated for functional use; for example, dogs for herding and tracking, and cats for killing mice or rats. Today, in Western societies, their function is primarily bonding. For example, current studies show that 60–80% of dogs sleep with their owners at night in the bedroom, either in or on the bed. Moreover, in the past the majority of cats were kept outside (barn cats) whereas today most cats are kept indoors (housecats) and considered part of the family. Currently, in the US, for example, 1.2 billion animals are kept as pets, primarily for bonding purposes. In addition, as of 1995 there were over 30 research institutions looking into the potential benefits of the human–animal bond.\n\nThere is evidence in a variety of species that the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin are involved in the bonding process, and in other forms of prosocial and reproductive behavior. Both chemicals facilitate pair bonding and maternal behavior in experiments on laboratory animals. In humans, there is evidence that oxytocin and vasopressin are released during labor and breastfeeding, and that these events are associated with maternal bonding. According to one model, social isolation leads to stress, which is associated with activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the release of cortisol. Positive social interaction is associated with increased oxytocin. This leads to bonding, which is also associated with higher levels of oxytocin and vasopressin, and reduced stress and stress-related hormones.\n\nOxytocin is associated with higher levels of trust in laboratory studies on humans. It has been called the \"cuddle chemical\" for its role in facilitating trust and attachment. In the reward centers of the limbic system, the neurotransmitter dopamine may interact with oxytocin and further increase the likelihood of bonding. One team of researchers has argued that oxytocin only plays a secondary role in affiliation, and that endogenous opiates play the central role. According to this model, affiliation is a function of the brain systems underlying reward and memory formation.\n\nBecause the vast majority of this research has been done on animals—and the majority of that on rodents—these findings must be taken with caution when applied to humans. One of the few studies that looked at the influence of hormones on human bonding compared participants who had recently fallen in love with a control group. There were no differences for most of the hormones measured, including LH, estradiol, progesterone, DHEAS, and androstenedione. Testosterone and FSH were lower in men who had recently fallen in love, and there was also a difference in blood cortisol for both sexes, with higher levels in the group that was in love. These differences disappeared after 12–28 months and may reflect the temporary stress and arousal of a new relationship.\n\nProlactin is a peptide hormone primarily produced in the anterior pituitary gland. Prolactin affects reproduction and lactation in humans and other non-human mammals. It is also thought to mediate the formation of social bonds between mothers and their infants, much like the hormone oxytocin. In addition to prolactin’s role in the formation of social bonds, it is thought to be involved in romantic attachment, especially in its early stages. Prolactin may also act to mediate well-being and the positive effects of close relationships on one's health. To do so, it alters an individual's neuroendocrine system to increase the probability of forming a strong social bond without requiring long gestation periods; this may enable bonding between mother and child in cases of adoption.\n\nProlactin can also influence both maternal and paternal behavior. The administration of prolactin to female rats initiates maternal behavior, and in bird and fish fathers, it can increase paternal behavior, whereas antagonists to prolactin decrease paternal behavior. In human studies, fathers with higher prolactin concentrations are more alert and nurturing towards their infants. In a different study where fathers and infants were observed over a six-months period after the child was born, the researchers found that fathers with higher prolactin levels were more likely to facilitate play with their infant. Moreover, following the birth of the child, prolactin promotes bonding between the father and the newborn.\n\nProlactin levels can also increase during socially stressful situations in humans. This has been seen by administering the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and then measuring blood serum prolactin concentrations. The TSST is a widely accepted stress test in which the research subject undergoes a mock job interview and then a mental arithmetic task in front of a three-person committee. This test is proven to simulate social psychological stress. After the administration of this test, significantly higher prolactin levels can be observed in the serum. There is a large variation in the amount prolactin levels increase in different individuals, however the effect is not significantly different between men and women\n\nIn 1962, while a freshman history major at Harvard, Mark Granovetter became enamored of the concepts underlying the classic chemistry lecture in which \"weak\" hydrogen bonds hold huge numbers of water molecules together, which themselves are held together by \"strong\" covalent bonds. This model was the stimulus behind his famous 1973 paper \"The Strength of Weak Ties\", which is now considered a classic paper in sociology.\n\nWeak social bonds are believed to be responsible for the majority of the embeddedness and structure of social networks in society as well as the transmission of information through these networks. Specifically, more novel information flows to individuals through weak than through strong ties. Because our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, the information they receive overlaps considerably with what we already know. Acquaintances, by contrast, know people that we do not, and thus receive more novel information. There are some demographic groups, such as alexythimics, who may find it very difficult to bond or share an emotional connection with others.\n\nIn 1953, sociologist Diane Vaughan proposed an uncoupling theory. It states that during the dynamics of relationship breakup, there exists a \"turning point,\" only noted in hindsight, followed by a transition period in which one partner unconsciously knows the relationship is going to end, but holds on to it for an extended period, sometimes for a number of years.\n\nWhen a person to which one has become bonded is lost, a grief response may occur. Grief is the process of accepting the loss and adjusting to the changed situation. Grief may take longer than the initial development of the bond. The grief process varies with culture.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3223340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3223340", "title": "Imputation (law)", "text": "Imputation (law)\n\nIn law, the principle of imputation or attribution underpins the concept that \"ignorantia juris non excusat\"—ignorance of the law does not excuse. All laws are published and available for study in all developed states. The content of the law is imputed to all persons who are within the jurisdiction, no matter how transiently.\n\nThis fiction tries to negate the unfairness of someone avoiding liability for an act or omission by simply denying knowledge of the law. The principle also arises in specific areas of law, such as criminal law and commercial law, to describe the need for the law to hold a person liable, even when they may not have known the particular circumstances that caused another person to sustain loss or damage.\n\nTo incur liability for a crime, a person must have both committed a prohibited act (the \"actus reus\", which must be willed: see automatism) and have had an appropriate mental element (the \"mens rea\") at the relevant time (see the technical requirement for concurrence). A key component of the \"mens rea\" is any knowledge that the alleged criminal might have had. For these purposes, knowledge can be both actual and constructive—i.e., the court can impute knowledge where appropriate.\n\nThere is no problem when the alleged criminal actually intended to cause the particular harm. Things are more difficult when the defendant denies actual knowledge. When evaluating behavior, the legal process assumes the defendant was aware of their immediate physical surroundings and understood practical cause and effect. A \"mens rea\" is imputed when a person with reasonable foresight in the same circumstances would have foreseen that the \"actus reus\" would occur. This prevents a person from raising a defence based on willful blindness (note that in the United States, wilful blindness has a slightly different meaning).\n\nA problem arises when the defendant is a corporation. By its nature, a fictitious person can only act through the human agency of the natural persons that it employs. Equally, it has no mind to constitute the \"mens rea\". Hence, the notion of vicarious liability for companies and other business entities exclusively depends on the ability to impute knowledge.\n\nThe test is one of identification. If the natural person who acts can be \"identified with the mind of the company\" when performing the actions forming the \"actus reus\", all the relevant mental elements will be imputed to the company. This test, sometimes termed the \"alter ego\" test, is objective and cannot be distracted by the job title or description formally held by the human agent. This prevents evasion of liability by the simple expedient of naming the real director of affairs as the janitor.\n\nHowever, not all actions trigger this transference. When acting, the human agent identified as the mind must be promoting the company's interests in some practical way. If they are engaged in an entirely personal activity—e.g., attacking a fellow employee out of anger or stealing from the company—the courts do not impute the relevant \"mens rea\" to the company.\n\nIn the United States, the courts use a three-pronged test to determine whether a corporation is vicariously liable for the acts of its employees: \n\nA standard example of imputation arises through the principle of \"joint endeavour\". Where two or more people embark on a joint exercise, they are equally liable for everything that happens during the execution of their plan. For this purpose, joint principals are treated as knowing everything that happens, whether they were present or not. The requisite \"mens rea\" formed by one is imputed to the others to enable a conviction. For example, suppose that a gang conspire to rob a bank. One remains outside in the car to ensure a quick escape. If the others kill a guard inside the bank, the driver is jointly liable for the homicide.\n\nIn the majority of agency situations, Agents must be allowed some degree of discretion in the conduct of routine transactions. Hence, there is no need to seek specific authorisation for every deal or detail within a deal. But, when the Agent acts with actual or apparent authority, all the Agent's knowledge will be imputed to the Principal. If Principals were allowed to hide behind their agents' ignorance, mistakes, or failures to communicate, they could achieve better results than if they acted personally. For example, if the particular deal turned out well, the Principal could adopt the transaction—if it turned out badly, the Principal could disavow it. If not for imputation, there would be a perverse incentive to conduct business through Agents rather than personally. Consequently, the Principal cannot exploit ignorance to advantage by instructing the Agent to withhold key information, or by appointing an Agent known to be secretive.\n\nThis rule in favour of imputation relates to the generality of the duties an Agent owes to a Principal, in particular the Agent's duty to communicate material facts to the Principal. Since the purpose of the law is to offer protection to Third Parties who act in good faith, it is reasonable to allow them to believe that, in most cases, the Agents have fulfilled this duty. After all, the Principal selects the Agents and has the power to control their actions both through express instructions and incentives intended to influence their behaviour which will include laying down routines for how Agents should handle information, and the extent to which Agents will be rewarded for transmitting information of commercial value. The result is a form of strict liability in which the legal consequences of an Agent's acts or omissions are attributed to a Principal even when the Principal was without fault in appointing or supervising the Agent.\n\nIn English law, a corporation can only act through its employees and agents so it is necessary to decide in which circumstances the law of agency or vicarious liability will apply to hold the corporation liable in tort for the frauds of its directors or senior officers. If liability for the particular tort requires a state of mind, then to be liable, the director or senior officer must have that state of mind and it must be attributed to the company.\n\nIn \"Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission\" [1995] 2 AC 500, two employees of the company, acting within the scope of their authority but unknown to the directors, used company funds to acquire some shares. The question was whether the company knew, or ought to have known that it had acquired those shares. The Privy Council held that it did. Whether by virtue of their actual or ostensible authority as agents acting within their authority (see \"Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co.\" [1912] AC 716) or as employees acting in the course of their employment (see \"Armagas Limited v Mundogas S.A.\" [1986] 1 AC 717), their acts and omissions and their knowledge could be attributed to the company, and this could give rise to liability as joint tortfeasors where the directors have assumed responsibility on their own behalf and not just on behalf of the company.\n\nSo, if a director or officer is expressly authorised represent a particular class on behalf of the company, and makes a fraudulent representation that causes loss to a Third Party, the company is liable, even though the representation was an improper way of doing what he was authorised to do. The extent of authority is a question fact and is significantly more than the fact of an employment that gave the employee the opportunity to carry out the fraud.\n\nIn \"Panorama Developments (Guildford) Ltd v Fidelis Furnishing Fabrics Ltd\" [1971] 2 QB 711, a company secretary fraudulently hired cars for his own use without the managing director knowing. A company secretary routinely enters into contracts in the company's name and has administrative responsibilities that would give apparent authority to hire cars. Hence, the company was liable.\n\nDemott, Deborah A. \"When is a Principal Charged with an Agent's Knowledge?\" 13 \"Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law\". 291\n"}

The index is the predecessor of the Human Freedom Index, which was been annually published since 2015. The coauthors of both indexes are Ian Vásquez and Tanja Porčnik (née Štumberger).\n\nThe index is based on measures of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, individual economic choice, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, violence and crimes, freedom of movement, LGBT rights, and women's rights. Other components of the Freedom Index include human trafficking, sexual violence, female genital mutilation, homicide, and adoption by homosexuals.\n\nThe index rates countries on a scale from 10 (freest) to 0 (least free). In 2012, the freest countries were New Zealand (8.7), the Netherlands (8.5), and Hong Kong (8.3). Least free were Zimbabwe (3.4), Burma (3.7), and Pakistan (4.5). The components on which the index is based can be divided into economic freedoms and other personal freedoms. Highest ranking in economic freedoms were Hong Kong (9.0) and Singapore (8.8). Highest ranking in personal freedoms were the Netherlands (9.5) and Uruguay (9.4).\n\nThe Freedom Index does not measure democracy, but it does measure freedom of speech and media, press killings, political imprisonment, etc. According to the report, democracy may be the form of government that best protects freedom, but democracy may both increase and reduce freedom. Nevertheless, democracy strongly correlates with freedom (7.9), as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and the Freedom Index.\n\nThe Freedom Index is included as part of the book \"Towards a Worldwide Index of Human Freedom\", written by 13 academics and economists from Canada (Fraser Institute), the United States (Cato Institute, Emory University), Germany (Liberales Institut, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main), and Russia (Institute of Economic Analysis). Among other claims, the report argues that the criminalization of and the war on drugs have restricted many components of freedom.\n\n\n"}

Exotic species with high invader potential are ones with high tolerance of different climates, dissolved oxygen content (for aquatic organisms), high propagule pressure and species with a large number of individuals introduced. The last factor is called a transport vector, for instance, sea lampreys and zebra mussels were transported into the Great Lakes through the vector of ballast water in ships. Transport vector is one of the most important factors, because if a large enough number of individuals are transported to an area that they cannot thrive in, a mutation within that population to thrive in the new ecosystem is more likely.\n\nMost invaders are adapted to disturbed areas, so ecosystems that have been disrupted or roadside ditches are susceptible to invasion.\n\nClimate matching is one of the most common measures of invader potential. Mostly exotic species that have already exhibited invasive traits are studied. \n\nBiotic resistance is a controversial concept in invader potential. Small scale studies have borne the concept of diversity resistance, that diverse ecosystems resist invasions better than less diverse ecosystems. However, evidence on regional scales finds a positive correlation between diversity and number of invasions. The exact interpretation of these studies is unclear.\n"}

The book gives readers instructions on how to build a Linux system from source. The book is available freely from the Linux From Scratch site.\n\n\"Linux From Scratch\" is a way to install a working Linux system by building all components of it manually. This is, naturally, a longer process than installing a pre-compiled Linux distribution. According to the \"Linux From Scratch\" site, the advantages to this method are a compact, flexible and secure system and a greater understanding of the internal workings of the Linux-based operating systems.\n\nTo keep LFS small and focused, the book \"Beyond Linux From Scratch\" (BLFS) was created, which presents instructions on how to further develop the basic Linux system that was created in LFS. It introduces and guides the reader through additions to the system including networking, X, sound, printer and scanner support. Since Release 5.0, the BLFS book version matches the LFS book version.\n\nThe book \"Cross Linux from Scratch\" (CLFS) focuses on cross compiling, including compiling for headless or embedded systems that can \"run\" Linux, but lack the resources needed to \"compile\" Linux. CLFS supports a broad range of processors and addresses advanced techniques not included in the LFS book such as cross-build toolchains, multilibrary support (32 & 64-bit libraries side-by-side), and alternative instruction set architectures such as Itanium, SPARC, MIPS, and Alpha.\n\nThe book \"Hardened Linux From Scratch\" (HLFS) focuses on security enhancements such as hardened kernel patches, mandatory access control policies, stack-smashing protection, and address space layout randomization. Besides its main purpose of creating a security-focused operating system, HLFS has the secondary goal of being a security teaching tool.\n\n\"Automated Linux From Scratch\" (ALFS) is a project designed to automate the process of creating an LFS system. It is aimed at users who have gone through the LFS and BLFS books several times and wish to reduce the amount of work involved. A secondary goal is to act as a test of the LFS and BLFS books by directly extracting and running instructions from the XML sources of the LFS and BLFS books.\n\nA clean partition and a working Linux system with a compiler and some essential software libraries are required to build LFS. Instead of installing from an existing Linux system, one can also use a Live CD to build an LFS system.\n\nThe project formerly maintained the Linux From Scratch Live CD. LFS Live CD contains all the source packages (in the full version of the Live CD only), the LFS book, automated building tools and (except for the minimal Live CD version) an Xfce GUI environment to work in. The official LFS Live CD is no longer maintained, and cannot be used to build the LFS version7 or later. There are, however, two unofficial builds that can be used to build a 32-bit or 64-bit kernel and userspace respectively for LFS 7.x.\n\nFirst, a toolchain must be compiled consisting of the tools used to compile LFS, like GCC, glibc, binutils and other necessary utilities. Then, the root directory must be changed, (using chroot), to the toolchain's partition to start building the final system. One of the first packages to compile is glibc; after that, the toolchain's linker must be adjusted to link against the newly built glibc, so that all other packages that will make up the finished system can be linked against it as well. During the chroot phase, bash's hashing feature is turned off and the temporary toolchain's bin directory moved to the end of PATH. This way the newly compiled programs come first in PATH and the new system builds on its own new components.\n\nThis is a list of the packages included in CLFS version 1.1.0. Unless otherwise noted, this list is applicable to all supported architectures.\n\n\nA \"standard build unit\" (\"SBU\") is a term used during initial bootstrapping of the system, and represents the amount of time required to build the first package in LFS on a given computer. Its creation was prompted by the long time required to build an LFS system, and the desire of many users to know how long a source tarball will take to build ahead of time.\n\nAs of Linux From Scratch version 6.3, the first package built by the user is GNU binutils. When building it, users are encouraged to time that build process using shell constructs and dub that time that system's \"standard build unit\". Once this number is known, an estimate of the time required to build later packages is expressed relative to the known SBU.\n\nSeveral packages built during compilation take much longer to build than binutils, including the GNU C Library (rated at 4.1 SBUs) and the GNU Compiler Collection (rated at 8.4 SBUs). The unit must be interpreted as an approximation; various factors influence the actual time required to build a package.\nLWN.net reviewed LFS in 2004:\n\nTux Machines wrote review about Linux From Scratch 6.1 in 2005:\n\nTux Machines also have second part of review, and third part.\n\nOther source-based Linux distributions:\n\n"}
{"id": "37531624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37531624", "title": "Logical consequence", "text": "Logical consequence\n\nLogical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically \"follows from\" one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises? and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises? All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.\n\nLogical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e. without regard to any \"personal\" interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.\n\nLogicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language formula_1, either by constructing a deductive system for formula_1 or by formal intended semantics for language formula_1. The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences, (2) The relation is a priori, i.e. it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience), and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component.\n\nThe most widely prevailing view on how to best account for logical consequence is to appeal to formality. This is to say that whether statements follow from one another logically depends on the structure or logical form of the statements without regard to the contents of that form.\n\nSyntactic accounts of logical consequence rely on schemes using inference rules. For instance, we can express the logical form of a valid argument as:\n\nThis argument is formally valid, because every instance of arguments constructed using this scheme is valid.\n\nThis is in contrast to an argument like \"Fred is Mike's brother's son. Therefore Fred is Mike's nephew.\" Since this argument depends on the meanings of the words \"brother\", \"son\", and \"nephew\", the statement \"Fred is Mike's nephew\" is a so-called material consequence of \"Fred is Mike's brother's son,\" not a formal consequence. A formal consequence must be true \"in all cases\", however this is an incomplete definition of formal consequence, since even the argument \"\"P\" is \"Qs brother's son, therefore \"P\" is \"Qs nephew\" is valid in all cases, but is not a \"formal\" argument.\n\nIf you know that formula_4 follows logically from formula_5 no information about the possible interpretations of formula_5 or formula_4 will affect that knowledge. Our knowledge that formula_4 is a logical consequence of formula_5 cannot be influenced by empirical knowledge. Deductively valid arguments can be known to be so without recourse to experience, so they must be knowable a priori. However, formality alone does not guarantee that logical consequence is not influenced by empirical knowledge. So the a priori property of logical consequence is considered to be independent of formality.\n\nThe two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of \"proofs\" and via \"models\". The study of the syntactic consequence (of a logic) is called (its) proof theory whereas the study of (its) semantic consequence is called (its) model theory.\n\nA formula formula_10 is a syntactic consequence within some formal system formula_11 of a set formula_12 of formulas if there is a formal proof in formula_11 of formula_10 from the set formula_12.\n\nSyntactic consequence does not depend on any interpretation of the formal system.\n\nA formula formula_10 is a semantic consequence within some formal system formula_11 of a set of statements formula_12\n\nif and only if there is no model formula_21 in which all members of formula_12 are true and formula_10 is false. Or, in other words, the set of the interpretations that make all members of formula_12 true is a subset of the set of the interpretations that make formula_10 true.\n\nModal accounts of logical consequence are variations on the following basic idea:\n\nAlternatively (and, most would say, equivalently):\n\nSuch accounts are called \"modal\" because they appeal to the modal notions of logical necessity and logical possibility. 'It is necessary that' is often expressed as a universal quantifier over possible worlds, so that the accounts above translate as:\n\nConsider the modal account in terms of the argument given as an example above:\n\nThe conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises because we can't imagine a possible world where (a) all frogs are green; (b) Kermit is a frog; and (c) Kermit is not green.\n\nModal-formal accounts of logical consequence combine the modal and formal accounts above, yielding variations on the following basic idea:\n\nThe accounts considered above are all \"truth-preservational,\" in that they all assume that the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from true premises to an untrue conclusion. As an alternative, some have proposed \"warrant-preservational\" accounts, according to which the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from justifiably assertible premises to a conclusion that is not justifiably assertible. This is (roughly) the account favored by intuitionists such as Michael Dummett.\n\nThe accounts discussed above all yield monotonic consequence relations, i.e. ones such that if formula_10 is a consequence of formula_12, then formula_10 is a consequence of any superset of formula_12. It is also possible to specify non-monotonic consequence relations to capture the idea that, e.g., 'Tweety can fly' is a logical consequence of\n\nbut not of\n\nFor more on this, see Non-monotonic inference relation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "742665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=742665", "title": "Mutatis mutandis", "text": "Mutatis mutandis\n\nMutatis mutandis is a Medieval Latin phrase meaning \"the necessary changes having been made\" or \"once the necessary changes have been made\". It remains unnaturalized in English and is therefore usually italicized in writing. It is used in many countries to acknowledge that a comparison being made requires certain obvious alterations, which are left unstated. It is not to be confused with the similar \"ceteris paribus\", which excludes any changes other than those explicitly mentioned. \"Mutatis mutandis\" is increasingly replaced by non-Latin equivalents, such as without loss of generality, but is still used in law, economics, mathematics, linguistics, and philosophy. In particular, in logic, it is encountered when discussing counterfactuals, as a shorthand for all the initial and derived changes which have been previously discussed.\n\nThe phrase '—now sometimes written ' to show vowel length—does not appear in surviving classical literature. It is Medieval Latin, first attested in British sources in 1272.\n\nBoth words are participles of the Latin verb ' (\"to move; to change; to exchange\"). ' is its perfect passive participle (\"changed; having been changed\"). \"\" is its gerundive, which functions both as a future passive participle (\"to be changed; going to be changed\") and as a verbal adjective or noun expressing necessity (\"needing to be changed; things needing to be changed\"). The phrase is an ablative absolute, using the ablative case to show that the clause is a necessary condition for the rest of the sentence.\n\n\"Mutatis mutandis\" was first borrowed into English in the 16th century, but continues to be italicized as a foreign phrase. Although many similar adverbial phrases are treated as part of the sentence, \"mutatis mutandis\" is usually set apart by commas or in some other fashion. The nearest English equivalent to an ablative absolute is the nominative absolute, so that a literal translation will either use the nominative case (\"those things which need to be changed having been changed\") or a preposition (\"with the things needing to be changed having been changed\"). More often, the idea is expressed more tersely (\"with the necessary changes\") or using subordinating conjunctions and a dependent clause (\"once the necessary adjustments are made\").\n\nThe legal use of the term is somewhat specialized. As glossed by Shira Scheindlin, judge for the Southern District of New York, for a 1998 case: \"This Latin phrase simply means that the necessary changes in details, such as names and places, will be made but everything else will remain the same.\" In the wake of the Plain English movements, some countries attempted to replace their law codes' legal Latin with English equivalents.\n\n\nThe phrase appears in other European languages as well. A passage of Marcel Proust's \"Remembrance of Things Past\" includes \"...j'ai le fils d'un de mes amis qui, mutatis mutandis, est comme vous...\" (\"A friend of mine has a son whose case, \"mutatis mutandis\", is very much like yours.\") The German Ministry of Justice, similar to the Plain English advocates above, now eschews its use. Their official English translation of the Civil Code now reads:\n\n\"Section 27 (Appointment of and management by the board). ...(3) The management by the board is governed by the provisions on mandate in sections 664 to 670 \"with the necessary modifications.\"\"\n\n"}

It allows a beleaguered person to enter the house of any other person and make a request of him which cannot be refused, even at the cost of the host's own life or fortune. A similar code of conduct is used by the neighbouring Baluch people.\n\nTraditionally it is used to refer to a request for sanctuary, whereby the host must be willing to fight or die for the sake of anyone who comes knocking at his door seeking refuge, even if it is a sworn enemy.\n\nAs the burden of sanctuary and protection extends even to fighting against government troops on behalf of the person seeking refuge, some have suggested that Mullah Omar's refusal to turn in Osama bin Laden was due only to his having availed himself of \"nanawatai\".\n\nBy invoking \"nanawatai\", one is said to \"seize the skirt\" (\"laman niwul\") of his new protector, and the other party is obligated to extend peace and acquiesce to grant shelter and protection, when someone has placed themselves in harm's way in this fashion.\n\nTraditionally, the burden of protection exists only insofar as the one pleading clemency stays within the property of the protector; if one leaves the company of the protector, the responsibility vanishes and even the protector can attack him. Often, the one pleading for sanctuary would be made to first humiliate himself, perhaps wearing a halter made of grass around his neck, to demonstrate that he was entirely supplicant to his host.\n\nNanawatai can typically be used to force a victim, or victim's family, to forgive a transgressor and offer their protection to the repentant aggressor. However, in cases of rape and adultery, the guilty party cannot request sanctuary, and must flee or submit willingly to the prescribed punishment. Sources are divided on whether those who elope can request such protection.\n\nIn one example, a woman was sheltering two robbers when their pursuers came to her and told her that the men she was sheltering had killed her son. She replied \"That may be so, but they have come \"nanawatai\" to my house and I cannot see any one laying his hands on them so long as they are under my roof\". Deputy Minister for Tribal Affairs Mohammed Omar Barakzai recounted the time that another woman was greeted at her door in Saidkhail by a transient student who had just stabbed her son and requested sanctuary; and she told her husband and brothers that he must be given refuge, and taken to safety outside the city.\n\nIn a counter-example, the Utmanzai tribe decided to pay a visit to the house of the Governor of the North-West Frontier Province, Owais Ahmed Ghani. Once they arrived, they impressed upon him a \"nanawatai\" obligation to give them anything they demanded, and he acquiesced to re-instate the salaries of 5,000 local tribal police whose payments he had suspended ten months earlier following a refusal to work after Taliban threats.\n\nIn 1986, after witnessing a team of mujahideen capture and execute a Soviet tank crew, William Mastrosimone wrote a stage play entitled \"Nanawatai\", about a tank driver captured during the Soviet war in Afghanistan and his resulting plea for sanctuary from those who find him. The story was later adapted into the 1988 action film \"The Beast of War\".\n\nNorwegian composer Hakon Berge wrote an instrumental piece, for drums and brass pipes, titled \"Nanawatai\".\n\nIn centuries past, the Highland Clans of Scotland honoured a similar code of hospitality and protection. This is evinced in the story of the Lamonts and MacGregors.\n"}

In addition, he served in various Synodical Committees of the Church of Greece (of Liturgical Renewal, and of Inter-Orthodox and Inter-Christian Relations), consultant of the United Bible Societies for the improvement of the relations with the Orthodox Churches and the presentation of the Orthodox understanding of the Bible to the global family of the Bible Societies, institutional coordinator of the Forum Mediterraneum, dealing with issues pertinent to faith, history of religions, and cultural anthropological research on the three monotheistic religions of the Mediterranean sea, and member of the editorial committee of the Orthodox biblical journal \"Δελτίο Βιβλικών Μελετών\" (Bulletin of Biblical Studies) of the “Artos Zoes” foundation, and of the Regnum Edinburgh 2010 Mission Series of the Oxford Center of Mission Studies.\n\nHe is Honorary President of the WOCATI, a founding member, secretary, and vice-president of the Society for Ecumenical Studies and Inter-Orthodox Relations (SESIOR), founding member, first secretary, and now president of the CEMES, member of the Q International Project of the Society of Biblical Literature, as well as of the \"Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas\" (SNTS), and among the coordinators of the regular conferences of Eastern and Western N.T. Scholars. He was one of the main contributors of the Inter-Christian Symposia of the Department of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the Pontifical University Antonianum of Rome, and a close friend of the ecumenical monastic community of Bose in Italy.\n\nHe was awarded with the highest honour of the municipality of Neapoli, Thessaloniki, for his contribution to the religious and cultural development of his home town, and also from the municipality of Edessa for his overall scientific contribution. Together with his colleagues, professors S. Agouridis, G. Galitis, J. Karavidopoulos, B. Stoyannos and J. Galanis, he translated the New Testament into Modern Greek (1977-1989). He published, edited in Greek and English nearly 20 books, and 300 articles in scientific journals, conference proceedings, and collective volumes, as well as in the conventional and electronic press. He supervised more than 17 master and 10 doctoral dissertations (promoting, in addition to the traditional, the sociological, feminist and other contemporary exegetical methods of biblical analysis), but also of missiological, ecumenical and liturgical character. He also participated in radio and television discussions, and gave numerous interviews on a variety of themes. He participated in more than 100 international conferences.\n\nIn the field of biblical literature his scholarly speciality was mainly the Sayings of the Historical Jesus, the Q-Document, the Pauline theology, and the theology of Liturgy and Eucharist.\n\nΗis contribution to the Synoptic (Q) scholarship was mainly his widely accepted and used procedural principles for the reconstruction of the Q-Document and the consequences of the Q Hypothesis, not so much as a solution to the Synoptic Problem, but as a change of the conventional picture of Christian origins. With regard to the Pauline collection project, on the basis of a thorough examination of 2 Corinthians 8-9, he is among those specialized scholars who support the social character of this ancient radical institution of Christianity, the main purpose of which was the ideal of “equal distribution and permanent sharing of the material wealth.” As to the Pauline (and general New Testament) Theology his recommendation is a combination of historical and thematic approach of this discipline, with a parallel recognition and use of such semi- and extra-canonical texts and traditions, as Q and the Gospel of Thomas among others, suggesting what he calls a “Eucharistic Paradigm”.\n\nAlthough his primary scholarly profession is biblical, he has deliberately chosen to engage with the wider theological scholarship. With the decline of the word of God, the Gospel and the overall biblical foundation of the Orthodox theology, mainly as a result of the predominance of the institutional expression of the Church at the expense of her charismatic character, he attempted in many of his works a creative encounter between the later development of the ecclesiastical tradition and the modern theological problematic with the foundational biblical tradition. Realizing the fragmentation of contemporary theological scholarship, and wishing to overcome it, he extended his scholarly and practical engagement to other areas, such as ecumenical movement and theology, missiology, liturgical theology, and world theological education.\n\nAmong his characteristic theological propositions is the priority of the eschatological experience of the early Christian community over against its literary products (texts, Bible etc.), although from the time of St. Paul there has been a shift of the center of gravity from the (Eucharistic) experience to the (Christian) message, from eschatology to Christology (and further and consequently to soteriology), from the event (the Kingdom of God), to the bearer and center of this event (Christ, and more precisely his sacrifice on the cross). This basic theological positions of his, i.e. the priority of the horizontal (ecclesiological and eschatological) perspective, both in the N.T. and in the early Church, as well as in later Christian literature, with the vertical soteriological (Pauline?) teaching placed always within the framework of the horizontal eschatological as complementary, has determined his extra-biblical theological activity and research.\n\nBasing his theological endeavour on the foundational, yet marginalized, incarnational Christian doctrine, and maintaining the overcoming the traditional patristic “exclusivity” of modern Orthodox theology, and in addition promoting the necessity of the biblical foundation of the Eucharistic ecclesiology, he adamantly promotes – following the legacy of his Doctor Vater, the late Savvas Agouridis – the Prophetic theology, above and beyond the contemporary classical “theologies”, which dominated his country since the decade of the ‘60s, i.e. the Eucharistic and the therapeutic. In quite a number of his works he opined that the relegation of the biblical word has inevitably resulted in limiting contemporary theology in dilemmas of the type: therapeutic or Eucharistic theology, gerontes/starets or bishop, theosis or sacraments etc. Following the general line of Metropolitan of Pergamon, John (Zizioulas’) Eucharistic ecclesiology for the necessity of the “primacy” on a theological and not just historical basis, he also brought into the fore for reconsideration the views expressed by the pioneer in the field Nicholas Afanasiev, underlining Pneumatological (in addition to the Christological) and the Missiological (beyond the Eucharistic) dimension of the Church, thus coming closer to the theological views supported by the Archbishop Anastasios (Yannoulatos) of Tirana, Durrës and All Albania.\n\nBased on this position and relying on the biblical data he suggested a reconsideration of the Orthodox position on \"intercommunio\" and of the exclusivistic character of the Eucharist, as well as of the Orthodox position on Christian anthropology.\n\nFrom the mid-80s he promotes a new “paradigm” of Christian witness (mission) in the post-modern era, being at the same time systematically engaged with the Orthodox understanding of the ecumenical theology, underlining the Christian witness as the real Liturgy after the liturgy and insisting on the necessity of the inter-Christian and inter-faith dialogue, and especially the biblical and liturgical renewal.\n\nDuring the last decade (since 2006, as a member of the WCC program on Poverty-Wealth-Ecology [PWE]) he is specialized and practically engaged in the alternative (to the neo-liberal economic globalization) Christian proposal. His engagement with the interfaith dialogue, and his position for an encounter between Christianity and modernity (and post-modernity) made him aware of the need of a legally established and internationally binding Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, along with the Human Rights. He suggested that the interfaith dialogue and cooperation are necessary in the areas, where the “modern paradigm” failed to succeed, i.e. in the spiritual and material welfare of the people, the degradation in social and moral values, in the inability of our world order to enforce a lasting just peace on earth, and especially in its unwillingness to preserve the natural environment, and its surrender to the rules of the dominant world economic system.\n\nIn 2002, after more than a decade in WOCATI, having also served as member of the executive committee, he was elected WOCATI's president (2002–2008), and for his contribution he was awarded for life the title of its honorary president. His scholarly contribution on the world ecumenical theological education is specified in combining the new challenges with the traditional Christian presuppositions. On the basis of his international experience and the nearly 40 years academic service in Greece he is one of the contributors to the revision of the religious course in the public secondary education (Lyceum) of his country, and a fervent supporter of the constitutional changes in Greek public higher education, and a member of the Association of Professors of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\n\nHis most important books are:\nProfessor Vassiliadis has been member of the translation committee of the Modern Greek Bible \"\", 1989. \nHe also published collections of studies: \nSo far he has also published two e-books: \nHe edited: \n\n\nΚατηγορίες: \n• Έλληνες θεολόγοι\n• Καθηγητές Αριστοτελείου Πανεπιστημίου Θεσσαλονίκης\n• Γεννήσεις το 1945\n"}

{"id": "24133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24133", "title": "Principia Mathematica", "text": "Principia Mathematica\n\nThe Principia Mathematica (often abbreviated PM) is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell and published in 1910, 1912, and 1913. In 1925–27, it appeared in a second edition with an important \"Introduction to the Second Edition\", an \"Appendix A\" that replaced ✸9 and all-new \"Appendix B\" and \"Appendix C\".\n\n\"PM\" was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven. As such, this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy, being one of the foremost products of the belief that such an undertaking may be achievable. However, in 1931, Gödel's incompleteness theorem proved definitively that PM, and in fact any other attempt, could never achieve this lofty goal; that is, for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, either the system must be inconsistent, or there must in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them.\n\nOne of the main inspirations and motivations for \"PM\" was the earlier work of Gottlob Frege on logic, which Russell discovered allowed for the construction of paradoxical sets. \"PM\" sought to avoid this problem by ruling out the unrestricted creation of arbitrary sets. This was achieved by replacing the notion of a general set with the notion of a hierarchy of sets of different 'types', a set of a certain type only allowed to contain sets of strictly lower types. Contemporary mathematics, however, avoids paradoxes such as Russell's in less unwieldy ways, such as the system of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.\n\n\"PM\" is not to be confused with Russell's 1903 \"The Principles of Mathematics\". \"PM\" states: \"The present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a second volume of Principles of Mathematics... But as we advanced, it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left obscure and doubtful in the former work, we have now arrived at what we believe to be satisfactory solutions.\"\n\n\"PM\" has long been known for its typographical complexity. Famously, several hundred pages of \n\"PM\" precede the proof of the validity of the proposition 1+1=2. The Modern Library placed it 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century.\n\nThe \"Principia\" covered only set theory, cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, and real numbers. Deeper theorems from real analysis were not included, but by the end of the third volume it was clear to experts that a large amount of known mathematics could \"in principle\" be developed in the adopted formalism. It was also clear how lengthy such a development would be.\n\nA fourth volume on the foundations of geometry had been planned, but the authors admitted to intellectual exhaustion upon completion of the third.\n\nAs noted in the criticism of the theory by Kurt Gödel (below), unlike a formalist theory, the \"logicistic\" theory of \"PM\" has no \"precise statement of the syntax of the formalism\". Another observation is that almost immediately in the theory, \"interpretations\" (in the sense of model theory) are presented in terms of \"truth-values\" for the behaviour of the symbols \"⊢\" (assertion of truth), \"~\" (logical not), and \"V\" (logical inclusive OR).\n\nTruth-values: \"PM\" embeds the notions of \"truth\" and \"falsity\" in the notion \"primitive proposition\". A raw (pure) formalist theory would not provide the meaning of the symbols that form a \"primitive proposition\"—the symbols themselves could be absolutely arbitrary and unfamiliar. The theory would specify only \"how the symbols behave based on the grammar of the theory\". Then later, by \"assignment\" of \"values\", a model would specify an \"interpretation\" of what the formulas are saying. Thus in the formal Kleene symbol set below, the \"interpretation\" of what the symbols commonly mean, and by implication how they end up being used, is given in parentheses, e.g., \"¬ (not)\". But this is not a pure Formalist theory.\n\nThe following formalist theory is offered as contrast to the logicistic theory of \"PM\". A contemporary formal system would be constructed as follows:\n\nThe theory of \"PM\" has both significant similarities, and similar differences, to a contemporary formal theory. Kleene states that \"this deduction of mathematics from logic was offered as intuitive axiomatics. The axioms were intended to be believed, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world\". Indeed, unlike a Formalist theory that manipulates symbols according to rules of grammar, \"PM\" introduces the notion of \"truth-values\", i.e., truth and falsity in the \"real-world\" sense, and the \"assertion of truth\" almost immediately as the fifth and sixth elements in the structure of the theory (\"PM\" 1962:4–36):\n\nCf. \"PM\" 1962:90–94, for the first edition:\n\nThe \"first\" edition (see discussion relative to the second edition, below) begins with a definition of the sign \"⊃\"\n\n✸1.01. \"p\" ⊃ \"q\" .=. ~ \"p\" ∨ \"q\". Df.\n\n✸1.1. Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true. Pp modus ponens\n\n✸1.2. ⊦: \"p\" ∨ \"p\" .⊃. \"p\". Pp principle of tautology\n\n✸1.3. ⊦: \"q\" .⊃. \"p\" ∨ \"q\". Pp principle of addition\n\n✸1.4. ⊦: \"p\" ∨ \"q\" .⊃. \"q\" ∨ \"p\". Pp principle of permutation\n\n✸1.5. ⊦: \"p\" ∨ ( \"q\" ∨ \"r\" ) .⊃. \"q\" ∨ ( \"p\" ∨ \"r\" ).

If φ\"p\" and ψ\"p\" are elementary propositional functions which take elementary propositions as arguments, φ\"p\" ∨ ψ\"p\" is an elementary proposition. Pp\n\nTogether with the \"Introduction to the Second Edition\", the second edition's Appendix A abandons the entire section ✸9. This includes six primitive propositions ✸9 through ✸9.15 together with the Axioms of reducibility.\n\nThe revised theory is made difficult by the introduction of the Sheffer stroke (\"|\") to symbolise \"incompatibility\" (i.e., if both elementary propositions \"p\" and \"q\" are true, their \"stroke\" \"p\" | \"q\" is false), the contemporary logical NAND (not-AND). In the revised theory, the Introduction presents the notion of \"atomic proposition\", a \"datum\" that \"belongs to the philosophical part of logic\". These have no parts that are propositions and do not contain the notions \"all\" or \"some\". For example: \"this is red\", or \"this is earlier than that\". Such things can exist \"ad finitum\", i.e., even an \"infinite enumeration\" of them to replace \"generality\" (i.e., the notion of \"for all\"). \"PM\" then \"advance[s] to molecular propositions\" that are all linked by \"the stroke\". Definitions give equivalences for \"~\", \"∨\", \"⊃\", and \".\".\n\nThe new introduction defines \"elementary propositions\" as atomic and molecular positions together. It then replaces all the primitive propositions ✸1.2 to ✸1.72 with a single primitive proposition framed in terms of the stroke:\n\nThe new introduction keeps the notation for \"there exists\" (now recast as \"sometimes true\") and \"for all\" (recast as \"always true\"). Appendix A strengthens the notion of \"matrix\" or \"predicative function\" (a \"primitive idea\", \"PM\" 1962:164) and presents four new Primitive propositions as ✸8.1–✸8.13.\n✸88. Multiplicative axiom\n\n✸120. Axiom of infinity\n\nIn simple type theory objects are elements of various disjoint \"types\". Types are implicitly built up as follows. If τ...,τ are types then there is a type (τ...,τ) that can be thought of as the class of propositional functions of τ...,τ (which in set theory is essentially the set of subsets of τ×...×τ). In particular there is a type () of propositions, and there may be a type ι (iota) of \"individuals\" from which other types are built. Russell and Whitehead's notation for building up types from other types is rather cumbersome, and the notation here is due to Church.\n\nIn the ramified type theory of PM all objects are elements of various disjoint ramified types. Ramified types are implicitly built up as follows. If τ...,τ,σ...,σ are ramified types then as in simple type theory there is a type (τ...,τ,σ...,σ) of \"predicative\" propositional functions of τ...,τ,σ...,σ. However, there are also ramified types (τ...,τ|σ...,σ) that can be thought of as the classes of propositional functions of τ...τ obtained from propositional functions of type (τ...,τ,σ...,σ) by quantifying over σ...,σ. When \"n\"=0 (so there are no σs) these propositional functions are called predicative functions or matrices. This can be confusing because current mathematical practice does not distinguish between predicative and non-predicative functions, and in any case PM never defines exactly what a \"predicative function\" actually is: this is taken as a primitive notion. \n\nRussell and Whitehead found it impossible to develop mathematics while maintaining the difference between predicative and non-predicative functions, so they introduced the axiom of reducibility, saying that for every non-predicative function there is a predicative function taking the same values. In practice this axiom essentially means that the elements of type (τ...,τ|σ...,σ) can be identified with the elements of type (τ...,τ), which causes the hierarchy of ramified types to collapse down to simple type theory. (Strictly speaking this is not quite correct, because PM allows two propositional functions to be different even it they take the same values on all arguments; this differs from current mathematical practice where one normally identifies two such functions.)\n\nIn Zermelo set theory one can model the ramified type theory of PM as follows. One picks a set ι to be the type of individuals. For example, ι might be the set of natural numbers, or the set of atoms (in a set theory with atoms) or any other set one is interested in. Then if τ...,τ are types, the type (τ...,τ) is the power set of the product τ×...×τ, which can also be thought of informally as the set of (propositional predicative) functions from this product to a 2-element set {true,false}. The ramified type (τ...,τ|σ...,σ) can be modeled \nas the product of the type (τ...,τ,σ...,σ) with the set of sequences of \"n\" quantifiers (∀ or ∃) indicating which quantifier should be applied to each variable σ. (One can vary this slightly by allowing the σs to be quantified in any order, or allowing them to occur before some of the τs, but this makes little difference except to the bookkeeping.)\n\nOne author observes that \"The notation in that work has been superseded by the subsequent development of logic during the 20th century, to the extent that the beginner has trouble reading PM at all\"; while much of the symbolic content can be converted to modern notation, the original notation itself is \"a subject of scholarly dispute\", and some notation \"embod[y] substantive logical doctrines so that it cannot simply be replaced by contemporary symbolism\".\n\nKurt Gödel was harshly critical of the notation:\nThis is reflected in the example below of the symbols \"\"p\", \"q\", \"r\"\" and \"⊃\" that can be formed into the string \"\"p\" ⊃ \"q\" ⊃ \"r\"\". \"PM\" requires a \"definition\" of what this symbol-string means in terms of other symbols; in contemporary treatments the \"formation rules\" (syntactical rules leading to \"well formed formulas\") would have prevented the formation of this string.\nSource of the notation: Chapter I \"Preliminary Explanations of Ideas and Notations\" begins with the source of the elementary parts of the notation (the symbols =⊃≡−ΛVε and the system of dots):\nPM changed Peano's Ɔ to ⊃, and also adopted a few of Peano's later symbols, such as ℩ and ι, and Peano's practice of turning letters upside down.\n\n\"PM\" adopts the assertion sign \"⊦\" from Frege's 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\":\nThus to assert a proposition \"p\" \"PM\" writes:\nMost of the rest of the notation in PM was invented by Whitehead. \n\n\"PM\" 's dots are used in a manner similar to parentheses. Each dot (or multiple dot) represents either a left or right parenthesis or the logical symbol ∧. More than one dot indicates the \"depth\" of the parentheses, for example, \".\", \":\" or \":.\", \"::\". However the position of the matching right or left parenthesis is not indicated explicitly in the notation but has to be deduced from some rules that are complicated, confusing and sometimes ambiguous. Moreover, when the dots stand for a logical symbol ∧ its left and right operands have to be deduced using similar rules. First one has to decide based on context whether the dots stand for a left or right parenthesis or a logical symbol. Then one has to decide how far the other corresponding parenthesis is: here one carries on until one meets either a larger number of dots, or the same number of dots next that have equal or greater \"force\", or the end of the line. Dots next to the signs ⊃, ≡,∨, =Df have greater force than dots next to (\"x\"), (∃\"x\") and so on, which have greater force than dots indicating a logical product ∧.\n\nExample 1. The line \ncorresponds to \nwhere the colon represents the outer (), the next two dots represent the parentheses around ~p and ~q, the third dot represents the parentheses around p ∧ q, and the fourth dot (rather confusingly) represents the logical symbol ∧ rather than a pair of parentheses. This uses the definition (followed by the explanatory comment):\nExample 2, with double, triple, and quadruple dots: \nstands for\n\nExample 3, with a double dot indicating a logical symbol (from volume 1, page 10):\nstands for \nwhere the double dot represents the logical symbol ∧, and its right operand consists of everything after it because it has priority over the single dots.\n\nLater in section ✸14, brackets \"[ ]\" appear, and in sections ✸20 and following, braces \"{ }\" appear. Whether these symbols have specific meanings or are just for visual clarification is unclear. Unfortunately the single dot (but also \":\", \":.\", \"::\", etc.) is also used to symbolise \"logical product\" (contemporary logical AND often symbolised by \"&\" or \"∧\").\n\nLogical implication is represented by Peano's \"Ɔ\" simplified to \"⊃\", logical negation is symbolised by an elongated tilde, i.e., \"~\" (contemporary \"~\" or \"¬\"), the logical OR by \"v\". The symbol \"=\" together with \"Df\" is used to indicate \"is defined as\", whereas in sections ✸13 and following, \"=\" is defined as (mathematically) \"identical with\", i.e., contemporary mathematical \"equality\" (cf. discussion in section ✸13). Logical equivalence is represented by \"≡\" (contemporary \"if and only if\"); \"elementary\" propositional functions are written in the customary way, e.g., \"\"f\"(\"p\")\", but later the function sign appears directly before the variable without parenthesis e.g., \"φ\"x\"\", \"χ\"x\"\", etc.\n\nExample, \"PM\" introduces the definition of \"logical product\" as follows:\n\nTranslation of the formulas into contemporary symbols: Various authors use alternate symbols, so no definitive translation can be given. However, because of criticisms such as that of Kurt Gödel below, the best contemporary treatments will be very precise with respect to the \"formation rules\" (the syntax) of the formulas.\n\nThe first formula might be converted into modern symbolism as follows:\nalternately\nalternately\netc.\n\nThe second formula might be converted as follows:\nBut note that this is not (logically) equivalent to (\"p\" → (\"q\" → \"r\")) nor to ((\"p\" → \"q\") → \"r\"), and these two are not logically equivalent either.\n\nThese sections concern what is now known as predicate logic, and predicate logic with identity (equality).\n\nSection ✸10: The existential and universal \"operators\": \"PM\" adds \"(\"x\")\" to represent the contemporary symbolism \"for all \"x\" \" i.e., \" ∀\"x\"\", and it uses a backwards serifed E to represent \"there exists an \"x\"\", i.e., \"(Ǝx)\", i.e., the contemporary \"∃x\". The typical notation would be similar to the following:\n\nSections ✸10, ✸11, ✸12: Properties of a variable extended to all individuals: section ✸10 introduces the notion of \"a property\" of a \"variable\". \"PM\" gives the example: φ is a function that indicates \"is a Greek\", and ψ indicates \"is a man\", and χ indicates \"is a mortal\" these functions then apply to a variable \"x\". \"PM\" can now write, and evaluate:\nThe notation above means \"for all \"x\", \"x\" is a man\". Given a collection of individuals, one can evaluate the above formula for truth or falsity. For example, given the restricted collection of individuals { Socrates, Plato, Russell, Zeus } the above evaluates to \"true\" if we allow for Zeus to be a man. But it fails for:\nbecause Russell is not Greek. And it fails for\nbecause Zeus is not a mortal.\n\nEquipped with this notation \"PM\" can create formulas to express the following: \"If all Greeks are men and if all men are mortals then all Greeks are mortals\". (\"PM\" 1962:138)\n\nAnother example: the formula:\n\nmeans \"The symbols representing the assertion 'There exists at least one \"x\" that satisfies function φ' is defined by the symbols representing the assertion 'It's not true that, given all values of \"x\", there are no values of \"x\" satisfying φ'\".\n\nThe symbolisms ⊃ and \"≡\" appear at ✸10.02 and ✸10.03. Both are abbreviations for universality (i.e., for all) that bind the variable \"x\" to the logical operator. Contemporary notation would have simply used parentheses outside of the equality (\"=\") sign:\n\n\"PM\" attributes the first symbolism to Peano.\n\nSection ✸11 applies this symbolism to two variables. Thus the following notations: ⊃, ⊃, ⊃ could all appear in a single formula.\n\nSection ✸12 reintroduces the notion of \"matrix\" (contemporary truth table), the notion of logical types, and in particular the notions of \"first-order\" and \"second-order\" functions and propositions.\n\nNew symbolism \"φ ! \"x\"\" represents any value of a first-order function. If a circumflex \"＾\" is placed over a variable, then this is an \"individual\" value of \"y\", meaning that \"ŷ\" indicates \"individuals\" (e.g., a row in a truth table); this distinction is necessary because of the matrix/extensional nature of propositional functions.\n\nNow equipped with the matrix notion, \"PM\" can assert its controversial axiom of reducibility: a function of one or two variables (two being sufficient for \"PM\" 's use) \"where all its values are given\" (i.e., in its matrix) is (logically) equivalent (\"≡\") to some \"predicative\" function of the same variables. The one-variable definition is given below as an illustration of the notation (\"PM\" 1962:166–167):\n\n✸12.1 ⊢: (Ǝ \"f\"): φ\"x\" .≡. \"f\" ! \"x\" Pp;\n\nThis means: \"We assert the truth of the following: There exists a function \"f\" with the property that: given all values of \"x\", their evaluations in function φ (i.e., resulting their matrix) is logically equivalent to some \"f\" evaluated at those same values of \"x\". (and vice versa, hence logical equivalence)\". In other words: given a matrix determined by property φ applied to variable \"x\", there exists a function \"f\" that, when applied to the \"x\" is logically equivalent to the matrix. Or: every matrix φ\"x\" can be represented by a function \"f\" applied to \"x\", and vice versa.\n\n✸13: The identity operator \"=\" : This is a definition that uses the sign in two different ways, as noted by the quote from \"PM\":\n\nmeans:\nThe not-equals sign \"≠\" makes its appearance as a definition at ✸13.02.\n\n✸14: Descriptions:\nFrom this \"PM\" employs two new symbols, a forward \"E\" and an inverted iota \"℩\". Here is an example:\nThis has the meaning:\n\nThe text leaps from section ✸14 directly to the foundational sections ✸20 GENERAL THEORY OF CLASSES and ✸21 GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIONS. \"Relations\" are what is known in contemporary set theory as sets of ordered pairs. Sections ✸20 and ✸22 introduce many of the symbols still in contemporary usage. These include the symbols \"ε\", \"⊂\", \"∩\", \"∪\", \"–\", \"Λ\", and \"V\": \"ε\" signifies \"is an element of\" (\"PM\" 1962:188); \"⊂\" (✸22.01) signifies \"is contained in\", \"is a subset of\"; \"∩\" (✸22.02) signifies the intersection (logical product) of classes (sets); \"∪\" (✸22.03) signifies the union (logical sum) of classes (sets); \"–\" (✸22.03) signifies negation of a class (set); \"Λ\" signifies the null class; and \"V\" signifies the universal class or universe of discourse.\n\nSmall Greek letters (other than \"ε\", \"ι\", \"π\", \"φ\", \"ψ\", \"χ\", and \"θ\") represent classes (e.g., \"α\", \"β\", \"γ\", \"δ\", etc.) (\"PM\" 1962:188):\n\nWhen applied to relations in section ✸23 CALCULUS OF RELATIONS, the symbols \"⊂\", \"∩\", \"∪\", and \"–\" acquire a dot: for example: \"⊍\", \"∸\".\nThe notion, and notation, of \"a class\" (set): In the first edition \"PM\" asserts that no new primitive ideas are necessary to define what is meant by \"a class\", and only two new \"primitive propositions\" called the axioms of reducibility for classes and relations respectively (\"PM\" 1962:25). But before this notion can be defined, \"PM\" feels it necessary to create a peculiar notation \"\"ẑ\"(φ\"z\")\" that it calls a \"fictitious object\". (\"PM\" 1962:188)\n\nAt least \"PM\" can tell the reader how these fictitious objects behave, because \"A class is wholly determinate when its membership is known, that is, there cannot be two different classes having the same membership\" (\"PM\" 1962:26). This is symbolised by the following equality (similar to ✸13.01 above:\n\nPerhaps the above can be made clearer by the discussion of classes in \"Introduction to the 2nd Edition\", which disposes of the \"Axiom of Reducibility\" and replaces it with the notion: \"All functions of functions are extensional\" (\"PM\" 1962:xxxix), i.e.,\n\nThis has the reasonable meaning that \"IF for all values of \"x\" the \"truth-values\" of the functions φ and ψ of \"x\" are [logically] equivalent, THEN the function ƒ of a given φ\"ẑ\" and ƒ of ψ\"ẑ\" are [logically] equivalent.\" \"PM\" asserts this is \"obvious\":\nObserve the change to the equality \"=\" sign on the right. \"PM\" goes on to state that will continue to hang onto the notation \"\"ẑ\"(φ\"z\")\", but this is merely equivalent to φ\"ẑ\", and this is a class. (all quotes: \"PM\" 1962:xxxix).\n\nAccording to Carnap's \"Logicist Foundations of Mathematics\", Russell wanted a theory that could plausibly be said to derive all of mathematics from purely logical axioms. However, Principia Mathematica required, in addition to the basic axioms of type theory, three further axioms that seemed to not be true as mere matters of logic, namely the axiom of infinity, the axiom of choice, and the axiom of reducibility. Since the first two were existential axioms, Russell phrased mathematical statements depending on them as conditionals. But reducibility was required to be sure that the formal statements even properly express statements of real analysis, so that statements depending on it could not be reformulated as conditionals. Frank P. Ramsey tried to argue that Russell's ramification of the theory of types was unnecessary, so that reducibility could be removed, but these arguments seemed inconclusive.\n\nBeyond the status of the axioms as logical truths, one can ask the following questions about any system such as PM:\n\nPropositional logic itself was known to be consistent, but the same had not been established for \"Principia\"'s axioms of set theory. (See Hilbert's second problem.) Russell and Whitehead suspected that the system in PM is incomplete: for example, they pointed out that it does not seem powerful enough to show that the cardinal ℵ exists. However, one can ask if some recursively axiomatizable extension of it is complete and consistent.\n\nIn 1930, Gödel's completeness theorem showed that first-order predicate logic itself was complete in a much weaker sense—that is, any sentence that is unprovable from a given set of axioms must actually be false in some model of the axioms. However, this is not the stronger sense of completeness desired for Principia Mathematica, since a given system of axioms (such as those of Principia Mathematica) may have many models, in some of which a given statement is true and in others of which that statement is false, so that the statement is left undecided by the axioms.\n\nGödel's incompleteness theorems cast unexpected light on these two related questions.\n\nGödel's first incompleteness theorem showed that no recursive extension of \"Principia\" could be both consistent and complete for arithmetic statements. (As mentioned above, Principia itself was already known to be incomplete for some non-arithmetic statements.) According to the theorem, within every sufficiently powerful recursive logical system (such as \"Principia\"), there exists a statement \"G\" that essentially reads, \"The statement \"G\" cannot be proved.\" Such a statement is a sort of Catch-22: if \"G\" is provable, then it is false, and the system is therefore inconsistent; and if \"G\" is not provable, then it is true, and the system is therefore incomplete.\n\nGödel's second incompleteness theorem (1931) shows that no formal system extending basic arithmetic can be used to prove its own consistency. Thus, the statement \"there are no contradictions in the \"Principia\" system\" cannot be proven in the \"Principia\" system unless there \"are\" contradictions in the system (in which case it can be proven both true and false).\n\nBy the second edition of \"PM\", Russell had removed his \"axiom of reducibility\" to a new axiom (although he does not state it as such). Gödel 1944:126 describes it this way: \n\nThis new proposal resulted in a dire outcome. An \"extensional stance\" and restriction to a second-order predicate logic means that a propositional function extended to all individuals such as \"All 'x' are blue\" now has to list all of the 'x' that satisfy (are true in) the proposition, listing them in a possibly infinite conjunction: e.g. \"x\" ∧ \"x\" ∧ . . . ∧ \"x\" ∧ . . .. Ironically, this change came about as the result of criticism from Wittgenstein in his 1919 \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\". As described by Russell in the Preface to the 2nd edition of \"PM\":\nIn other words, the fact that an infinite list cannot realistically be specified means that the concept of \"number\" in the infinite sense (i.e. the continuum) cannot be described by the new theory proposed in \"PM Second Edition\".\n\nWittgenstein in his \"Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics, Cambridge 1939\" criticised \"Principia\" on various grounds, such as:\n\nWittgenstein did, however, concede that \"Principia\" may nonetheless make some aspects of everyday arithmetic clearer.\n\nIn his 1944 \"Russell's mathematical logic\", Gödel offers a \"critical but sympathetic discussion of the logicistic order of ideas\":\n\nThis section describes the propositional and predicate calculus, and gives the basic properties of classes, relations, and types.\n\nThis part covers various properties of relations, especially those needed for cardinal arithmetic.\n\nThis covers the definition and basic properties of cardinals. A cardinal is defined to be an equivalence class of similar classes (as opposed to ZFC, where a cardinal is a special sort of von Neumann ordinal). Each type has its own collection of cardinals associated with it, and there is a considerable amount of bookkeeping necessary for comparing cardinals of different types. PM define addition, multiplication and exponentiation of cardinals, and compare different definitions of finite and infinite cardinals. ✸120.03 is the Axiom of infinity.\n\nA \"relation-number\" is an equivalence class of isomorphic relations. PM defines analogues of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation for arbitrary relations. The addition and multiplication is similar to the usual definition of addition and multiplication of ordinals in ZFC, though the definition of exponentiation of relations in PM is not equivalent to the usual one used in ZFC.\n\nThis covers series, which is PM's term for what is now called a totally ordered set. In particular it covers complete series, continuous functions between series with the order topology (though of course they do not use this terminology), well-ordered series, and series without \"gaps\" (those with a member strictly between any two given members).\n\nThis section constructs the ring of integers, the fields of rational and real numbers, and \"vector-families\", which are related to what are now called torsors over abelian groups.\n\nThis section compares the system in PM with the usual mathematical foundations of ZFC. The system of PM is roughly comparable in strength with Zermelo set theory (or more precisely a version of it where the axiom of separation has all quantifiers bounded).\n\n\nApart from corrections of misprints, the main text of PM is unchanged between the first and second editions. In the second edition volumes 2 and 3 are essentially unchanged apart from a change of page numbering, but volume 1 has five new additions:\n\nIn 1962 Cambridge University Press published a shortened paperback edition containing parts of the second edition of volume 1: the new introduction, the main text up to *56, and appendices A and C.\n\n\nPrimary:\nThe first edition was reprinted in 2009 by Merchant Books, , , .\n\nSecondary:\n\n"}

A Korean monk named Dowon (1973~ ) created this term in 2015. The method is inspired by the idea that when people are curious about something, they can better concentrate without distracting thoughts.\n\nThe purpose of this meditation is attaining Enlightenment. Enlightenment does not have to be a special milestone, but rather a state of being in which one can get to know that which wasn't known before. The bigger a question is, the bigger the enlightenment. One can experience some enlightened periods in life, but most are not so powerful as to solve fundamental questions of life. If one raises fundamental questions and struggles with them until solved, profound enlightenment may be reached. Through the ultimate enlightenment, one can be free from all suffering and attain true eternal happiness.\n\nThe most common question in this meditation practice is, \"What is my true self before I was born?\" This question is so profound and fundamental that once the question is answered, the ultimate enlightenment can be reached. In questioning meditation, the most important aspect is the confirmation process when an answer is found. One may not be able to identify if the answer is right or wrong. In turn, examination of the answer with an enlightened teacher is essential.\n"}

{"id": "33275549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33275549", "title": "Sophia (Gnosticism)", "text": "Sophia (Gnosticism)\n\nSophia ( \"Wisdom\", \"the Sophia\") is a major theme, along with Knowledge ( \"gnosis\", Coptic \"sooun\"), among many of the early Christian knowledge-theologies grouped by the heresiologist Irenaeus as \"gnostikos\", \"learned\". Gnosticism is a 17th-century term expanding the definition of Irenaeus' groups to include other syncretic and mystery religions.\n\nIn gnosticism, Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the human soul but also simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of God. Gnostics held that she was the \"syzygy\" (female twin divine Aeon) of Jesus (i.e. the Bride of Christ), and Holy Spirit of the Trinity. She is occasionally referred to by the Hebrew equivalent of \"Achamōth\" (, \"chokhmah\") and as \"Prunikos\" (). In the Nag Hammadi texts, Sophia is the lowest Aeon, or anthropic expression of the emanation of the light of God. She is considered to have fallen from grace in some way, in so doing creating or helping to create the material world.\n\nAlmost all Gnostic systems of the Syrian or Egyptian type taught that the universe began with an original, unknowable God, referred to as the Parent or Bythos, or as the Monad by Monoimus. From this initial unitary beginning, the One spontaneously emanated further Aeons, being pairs of progressively 'lesser' beings in sequence. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the \"Pleroma\", or fullness, of God, and thus should not be seen as distinct from the divine, but symbolic abstractions of the divine nature. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in one of the Aeons.\n\nIn most versions of the Gnostic mythos, it is Sophia who brings about this instability in the Pleroma, in turn bringing about the creation of materiality. According to some Gnostic texts, the crisis occurs as a result of Sophia trying to emanate without her syzygy or, in another tradition, because she tries to breach the barrier between herself and the unknowable Bythos. After cataclysmically falling from the Pleroma, Sophia's fear and anguish of losing her life (just as she lost the light of the One) causes confusion and longing to return to it. Because of these longings, matter (Greek: \"hylē\", ὕλη) and soul (Greek: \"psychē\", ψυχή) accidentally come into existence. The creation of the Demiurge (also known as Yaldabaoth, \"Son of Chaos\") is also a mistake made during this exile. The Demiurge proceeds to create the physical world in which we live, ignorant of Sophia, who nevertheless manages to infuse some spiritual spark or \"pneuma\" into his creation.\n\nIn the \"Pistis Sophia\", Christ is sent from the Godhead in order to bring Sophia back into the fullness (Pleroma). Christ enables her to again see the light, bringing her knowledge of the spirit (Greek: \"pneuma\", πνευμα). Christ is then sent to earth in the form of the man Jesus to give men the Gnosis needed to rescue themselves from the physical world and return to the spiritual world. In Gnosticism, the Gospel story of Jesus is itself allegorical: it is the Outer Mystery, used as an introduction to Gnosis, rather than it being literally true in a historical context. For the Gnostics, the drama of the redemption of the Sophia through Christ or the Logos is the central drama of the universe. The Sophia resides in all of us as the Divine Spark.\n\nJewish Alexandrine religious philosophy was much occupied with the concept of the Divine \"Sophia\", as the revelation of God's inward thought, and assigned to her not only the formation and ordering of the natural universe (comp. Clem. \"Hom.\" ) but also the communication of all insight and knowledge to mankind. In Wisdom (the noun is feminine) is described as God's Counsellor and Workmistress (Master-workman, R.V.), who dwelt beside Him before the Creation of the world and sported continually before Him.\n\nIn accordance with the description given in the Book of Proverbs, a dwelling-place was assigned by the Gnostics to the Sophia, and her relation to the upper world defined as well as to the seven planetary powers which were placed under her. The seven planetary spheres or heavens were for the ancients the highest regions of the created universe. They were thought of as seven circles rising one above another, and dominated by the seven Archons. These constituted the (Gnostic) Hebdomad. Above the highest of them, and over-vaulting it, was the Ogdoad, the sphere of immutability, which was nigh to the spiritual world (Clemens Alexandrinus, \"Stromata\", , 161; comp. , 138 sqq.). Now we read in :\n\nThese seven pillars being interpreted as the planetary heavens, the habitation of the Sophia herself was placed above the Hebdomad in the Ogdoad (\"Excerpt. ex Theodot\". 8, 47). It is said further of the same divine wisdom ():\n\nThis meant, according to the Gnostic interpretation, that the Sophia has her dwelling-place \"on the heights\" above the created universe, in the place of the midst, between the upper and lower world, between the Pleroma and the \"ektismena\". She sits at \"the gates of the mighty,\" i.e. at the approaches to the realms of the seven Archons, and at the \"entrances\" to the upper realm of light her praise is sung. The Sophia is therefore the highest ruler over the visible universe, and at the same time the mediatrix between the upper and the lower realms. She shapes this mundane universe after the heavenly prototypes, and forms the seven star-circles with their Archons under whose dominion are placed, according to the astrological conceptions of antiquity, the fates of all earthly things, and more especially of man. She is \"the mother\" or \"the mother of the living.\" (Epiph. \"Haer\". 26, 10). As coming from above, she is herself of pneumatic essence, the \"mētēr phōteinē\" (Epiph. 40, 2) or the \"anō dynamis\" (Epiph. 39, 2) from which all pneumatic souls draw their origin.\n\nIn reconciling the doctrine of the pneumatic nature of the Sophia with the dwelling-place assigned her, according to the Proverbs, in the kingdom of the midst, and so outside the upper realm of light, there was envisioned a descent of Sophia from her heavenly home, the Pleroma, into the void (\"kenōma\") beneath it. The concept was that of a seizure or robbery of light, or of an outburst and diffusion of light-dew into the \"kenōma\", occasioned by a vivifying movement in the upper world. But inasmuch as the light brought down into the darkness of this lower world was thought of and described as involved in suffering, this suffering must be regarded as a punishment. This inference was further aided by the Platonic notion of a spiritual fall.\n\nAlienated through their own fault from their heavenly home, souls have sunk down into this lower world without utterly losing the remembrance of their former state, and filled with longing for their lost inheritance, these fallen souls are still striving upwards. In this way the mythos of the fall of Sophia can be regarded as having a typical significance. The fate of the \"mother\" was regarded as the prototype of what is repeated in the history of all individual souls, which, being of a heavenly pneumatic origin, have fallen from the upper world of light their home, and come under the sway of evil powers, from whom they must endure a long series of sufferings until a return into the upper world be once more vouchsafed them.\n\nBut whereas, according to the Platonic philosophy, fallen souls still retain a remembrance of their lost home, this notion was preserved in another form in Gnostic circles. It was taught that the souls of the Pneumatici, having lost the remembrance of their heavenly derivation, required to become once more partakers of Gnosis, or knowledge of their own pneumatic essence, in order to make a return to the realm of light. In the impartation of this Gnosis consists the redemption brought and vouchsafed by Christ to pneumatic souls. But the various fortunes of such souls were wont to be contemplated in those of Sophia, and so it was taught that the Sophia also needed the redemption wrought by Christ, by whom she is delivered from her \"agnoia\" and her \"pathe\", and will, at the end of the world's development, be again brought back to her long lost home, the Upper Pleroma, into which this mother will find an entrance along with all pneumatic souls her children, and there, in the heavenly bridal chamber, celebrate the marriage feast of eternity.\n\nThe Sophia mythos has in the various Gnostic systems undergone great variety of treatment. The oldest, the Syrian Gnosis, referred to the \"Sophia\" the formation of the lower world and the production of its rulers the Archons; and along with this they also ascribed to her the preservation and propagation of the spiritual seed.\n\nAs described by Irenaeus, the great Mother-principle of the universe appears as the first woman, the Holy Spirit (\"rūha d'qudshā\") moving over the waters, and is also called the mother of all living. Under her are the four material elements—water, darkness, abyss, and chaos. With her, combine themselves the two supreme masculine lights, the first and the second man, the Father and the Son, the latter being also designated as the Father's \"ennoia\". From their union proceeds the third imperishable light, the third man, Christ. But unable to support the abounding fulness of this light, the mother in giving birth to Christ, suffers a portion of this light to overflow on the left side. While, then, Christ as \"dexios\" (He of the right hand) mounts upward with his mother into the imperishable Aeon, that other light which has overflowed on the left hand, sinks down into the lower world, and there produces matter. And this is the Sophia, called also \"Aristera\" (she of the left hand), \"Prouneikos\" and the male-female.\n\nThere is here, as yet, no thought of a fall, properly so called, as in the Valentinian system. The power which has thus overflowed leftwards, makes a voluntary descent into the lower waters, confiding in its possession of the spark of true light. It is, moreover, evident that though mythologically distinguished from the \"humectatio luminis\" (Greek: \"ikmas phōtos\", ἰκμὰς φωτός), the Sophia is yet, really nothing else but the light-spark coming from above, entering this lower material world, and becoming here the source of all formation, and of both the higher and the lower life. She swims over the waters, and sets their hitherto immoveable mass in motion, driving them into the abyss, and taking to herself a bodily form from the \"hylē\". She compasses about, and is laden with material every kind of weight and substance, so that, but for the essential spark of light, she would be sunk and lost in the material. Bound to the body which she has assumed and weighed down thereby, she seeks in vain to make her escape from the lower waters, and hasten upwards to rejoin her heavenly mother. Not succeeding in this endeavour, she seeks to preserve, at least, her light-spark from being injured by the lower elements, raises herself by its power to the realm of the upper region, and there spreading herself out she forms out of her own bodily part, the dividing wall of the visible firmament, but still retains the \"aquatilis corporis typus\". Finally seized with a longing for the higher light, she finds, at length, in herself, the power to raise herself even above the heaven of her own forming, and to fully lay aside her corporeity. The body thus abandoned is called \"Woman from Woman.\"\n\nThe narrative proceeds to tell of the formation of the seven Archons by Sophia herself, of the creation of man, which \"the mother\" (i.e. not the first woman, but the Sophia) uses as a mean to deprive the Archons of their share of light, of the perpetual conflict on his mother's part with the self-exalting efforts of the Archons, and of her continuous striving to recover again and again the light-spark hidden in human nature, till, at length, Christ comes to her assistance and in answer to her prayers, proceeds to draw all the sparks of light to Himself, unites Himself with the Sophia as the bridegroom with the bride, descends on Jesus who has been prepared, as a pure vessel for His reception, by Sophia, and leaves him again before the crucifixion, ascending with Sophia into the world or Aeon which will never pass away (; Epiph. 37, 3, sqq.; Theodoret, h. f. i. 14).\n\nIn this system the original cosmogonic significance of the Sophia still stands in the foreground. The antithesis of Christus and Sophia, as He of the right (\"ho dexios\") and She of the Left (\"hē aristera\"), as male and female, is but a repetition of the first Cosmogonic Antithesis in another form. The Sophia herself is but a reflex of the \"Mother of all living\" and is therefore also called \"Mother.\" She is the formatrix of heaven and earth, for as much as mere matter can only receive form through the light which, coming down from above has interpenetrated the dark waters of the \"hylē;\" but she is also at the same time the spiritual principle of life in creation, or, as the world-soul the representative of all that is truly pneumatic in this lower world: her fates and experiences represent typically those of the pneumatic soul which has sunk down into chaos.\n\nIn the Gnostic system described by Irenaeus (; see Ophites) the name Prunikos several times takes the place of Sophia in the relation of her story. The name Prunikos is also given to Sophia in the account of the kindred Barbeliot system, given in the preceding chapter of Irenaeus. Celsus, who shows that he had met with some Ophite work, exhibits acquaintance with the name Prunikos () a name which Origen recognizes as Valentinian. That this Ophite name had really been adopted by the Valentinians is evidenced by its occurrence in a Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Epiph. \"Haer\". xxxi. 5). Epiphanius also introduces Prunikos as a technical word in the system of the Simonians (Epiph. \"Haer\". xxi. 2) of those whom he describes under the head of Nicolaitans (Epiph. \"Haer\". xxv. 3, 4) and of the Ophites (Epiph. \"Haer\". xxxvii. 4, 6).\n\nNeither Irenaeus nor Origen indicates that he knew anything as to the meaning of this word; and we have no better information on this subject than a conjecture of Epiphanius (Epiph. \"Haer\". xxv. 48). He says that the word means \"wanton\" or \"lascivious,\" for that the Greeks had a phrase concerning a man who had debauched a girl, \"Eprounikeuse tautēn\". One feels some hesitation in accepting this explanation. Epiphanius was deeply persuaded of the filthiness of Gnostic morals, and habitually put the worst interpretation on their language. If the phrase reported by Epiphanius had been common, it is strange that instances of its use should not have been quoted from the Greek comic writers. It need not be denied that Epiphanius had heard the phrase employed, but innocent words come to be used in an obscene sense, as well by those who think \"double entendre\" witty, as by those who modestly avoid the use of plainer language. The primary meaning of the word \"prouneikos\" seems to be a porter, or bearer of burdens, the derivation being from \"enenkein\", the only derivation indeed that the word seems to admit of. Then, modifying its meaning like the word \"agoraios\", it came to be used in the sense of a turbulent violent person. The only distinct confirmation of the explanation of Epiphanius is that Hesychius (\"s. v. Skitaloi\") has the words \"aphrodisiōn kai tēs prounikias tēs nykterinēs\". This would be decisive, if we could be sure that these words were earlier in date than Epiphanius.\n\nIn favour of the explanation of Epiphanius is the fact, that in the Gnostic cosmogonical myths, the imagery of sexual passion is constantly introduced. It seems on the whole probable that \"prouneikos\" is to be understood in the sense of \"propherēs\" which has for one of its meanings \"precocious in respect of sexual intercourse.\" According to Ernst Wilhelm Möller (1860) the name is possibly meant to indicate her attempts to entice away again from the lower Cosmic Powers the seed of Divine light. In the account given by Epiphanius (\"Haer\". 37:6) the allusion to enticements to sexual intercourse which is involved in this name, becomes more prominent.\n\nHowever, in the \"Exegesis on the Soul\" text found at Nag Hammadi, the soul is likened to a woman which fell from perfection into prostitution, and that the Father will elevate her again to her original perfect state. In this context, the female personification of the soul resembles the passion of Sophia as Prunikos.\n\nNigh related to this is the notion widely diffused among Gnostic sects of the impure \"mētra\" (womb) from whence the whole world is supposed to have issued. As according to the Italian Valentinians the Soter opens the \"mētra\" of the lower Sophia, (the \"Enthymēsis\"), and so occasions the formation of the universe (, ) so on the other hand the \"mētra\" itself is personified. So Epiphanius reports the following cosmogony as that of a branch of the Nicolaitans:\n\nThe Sethians (Hippolytus. \"Philosophum.\" ) teach in like manner that from the first concurrence (\"syndromē\") of the three primeval principles arose heaven and earth as a \"megalē tis idea sphragidos\". These have the form of a \"mētra\" with the \"omphalos\" in the midst. The pregnant \"mētra\" therefore contains within itself all kinds of animal forms in the reflex of heaven and earth and all substances found in the middle region. This \"mētra\" also encounters us in the great \"Apophasis\" ascribed to Simon where it is also called Paradise and Eden as being the locality of man's formation.\n\nThese cosmogonic theories have their precedent in the Thalatth or Tiamat of Syrian mythology, the life-mother of whom Berossus has so much to relate, or in the world-egg out of which when cloven asunder heaven and earth and all things proceed. The name of this Berossian Thalatth meets us again among the Peratae of the \"Philosophumena\" () and is sometimes mistakenly identified with that of the sea—\"thalassa\".\n\nA similar part to that of the \"mētra\" is played by Edem, consort of Elohim in the Gnostic book \"Baruch\" () who there appears as a two-shaped being formed above as a woman and from the middle downwards as a serpent ().\n\nAmong the four and twenty Angels which she bears to Elohim, and which form the world out of her members, the second female angelic form is called \"Achamōs\" [\"Achamōth\"]. Like to this legend of the \"Philosophumena\" concerning the Baruch-Gnosis is that which is related by Epiphanius of an Ophite Party that they fabled that a Serpent from the Upper World had had sexual intercourse with the Earth as with a woman (Epiphanius, \"Haer\". 45: 1 cf. 2).\n\nVery nigh related to the doctrines of the Gnostics in Irenaeus are the views of the so-called Barbeliotae (). The name Barbelo, which according to one interpretation is a designation of the upper Tetrad, has originally nothing to do with the Sophia. This latter Being called also \"Spiritus Sanctus\" and \"Prunikos\" is the offspring of the first angel who stands at the side of the Monogenes. Sophia seeing that all the rest have each its \"syzygos\" within the Pleroma, desires also to find such a consort for herself; and not finding one in the upper world she looks down into the lower regions and being still unsatisfied there she descends at length against the will of the Father into the deep. Here she forms the Demiurge (the \"Proarchōn\"), a composite of ignorance and self-exaltation. This Being, by virtue of pneumatic powers stolen from his mother, proceeds to form the lower world. The mother, on the other hand, flees away into the upper regions and makes her dwelling there in the Ogdoad.\n\nWe meet this Sophia also among the Ophiana whose \"Diagram\" is described by Celsus and Origen, as well as among various Gnostic (Ophite) parties mentioned by Epiphanius. She is there called Sophia or Prunikos, the upper mother and upper power, and sits enthroned above the Hebdomad (the seven Planetary Heavens) in the Ogdoad (Origen, \"Against Celsus\". , , , ; Epiphan. \"Haer\". 25, 3 sqq. 26, 1,10. 39, 2 ; 40, 2). She is also occasionally called \"Parthenos\" () and again is elsewhere identified with the Barbelo or Barbero (Epiph. \"Haer\". 25, 3 ; 26, 1, 10).\n\nThis mythos of the soul and her descent into this lower world, with her various sufferings and changing fortunes until her final deliverance, recurs in the Simonian system under the form of the All-Mother who issues as its first thought from the \"Hestōs\" or highest power of God. She generally bears the name \"Ennoia\", but is also called Wisdom (Sophia), Ruler, Holy Spirit, Prunikos, Barbelo. Having sunk down from the highest heavens into the lowest regions, she creates angels and archangels, and these again create and rule the material universe. Restrained and held down by the power of this lower world, she is hindered from returning to the kingdom of the Father. According to one representation she suffers all manner of insult from the angels and archangels bound and forced again and again into fresh earthly bodies, and compelled for centuries to wander in ever new corporeal forms. According to another account she is in herself incapable of suffering, but is sent into this lower world and undergoes perpetual transformation in order to excite by her beauty the angels and powers, to impel them to engage in perpetual strife, and so gradually to deprive them of their store of heavenly light. The \"Hestōs\" himself at length comes down from the highest heaven in a phantasmal body in order to deliver the suffering \"Ennoia\", and redeem the souls held in captivity by imparting gnosis to them.\n\nThe most frequent designation of the Simonian \"Ennoia\" is \"the lost\" or \"the wandering sheep.\" The Greek divinities Zeus and Athena were interpreted to signify \"Hestōs\" and his \"Ennoia\", and in like manner the Tyrian sun-god Herakles-Melkart and the moon-goddess Selene-Astarte. So also the Homeric Helena, as the cause of quarrel between Greeks and Trojans, was regarded as a type of the \"Ennoia\". The story which the fathers of the church handed down of the intercourse of Simon Magus with his consort Helena (; ; Epiphanius \"Haer\". 21; ; Philaster, \"Haer\". 29; , ; ; ), had probably its origin in this allegorical interpretation, according to Richard Adelbert Lipsius (1867).\n\nIn the Simonian \"Apophasis\" the great \"dynamis\" (also called \"Nous\") and the great \"epinoia\" which gives birth to all things form a syzygy, from which proceeds the male-female Being, who is called \"Hestōs\" (). Elsewhere \"nous\" and \"epinoia\" are called the upper-most of the three Simonian Syzygies, to which the \"Hestōs\" forms the Hebdomad: but on the other hand, \"nous\" and \"epinoia\" are identified with heaven and earth ().\n\nThe most significant development of this Sophia mythos is found in the Valentinian system. The descent of the Sophia from the Pleroma is ascribed after Plato's manner to a fall, and as the final cause of this fall a state of suffering is indicated which has penetrated into the Pleroma itself. Sophia or \"Mētēr\" is in the doctrine of Valentinus the last, i.e. the thirtieth Aeon in the Pleroma, from which having fallen out, she now in remembrance of the better world which she has thus forsaken, gives birth to the Christus \"with a shadow\" (\"meta skias tinos\"). While Christus returns to the Pleroma, Sophia forms the Demiurge and this whole lower world out of the \"skia\", a right and a left principle (). For her redemption comes down to Sophia either Christus himself () or the \"Soter\" (, cf. \"exc. ex Theod\". 23; 41), as the common product of the Aeons, in order to bring her back to the Pleroma and unite her again with her \"syzygos\".\n\nThe motive for the Sophia's fall was defined according to the Anatolian school to have lain therein, that by her desire to know what lay beyond the limits of the knowable she had brought herself into a state of ignorance and formlessness. Her suffering extends to the whole Pleroma. But whereas this is confirmed thereby in fresh strength, the Sophia is separated from it and gives birth outside it (by means of her \"ennoia\", her recollections of the higher world), to the Christus who at once ascends into the Pleroma, and after this she produces an \"ousia amorphos\", the image of her suffering, out of which the Demiurge and the lower world come into existence; last of all looking upwards in her helpless condition, and imploring light, she finally gives birth to the \"spermata tēs ekklēsias\", the pneumatic souls. In the work of redemption the Soter comes down accompanied by the masculine angels who are to be the future \"syzygoi\" of the (feminine) souls of the Pneumatici, and introduces the Sophia along with these Pneumatici into the heavenly bridal chamber (\"Exc. ex Theod.\" 29-42; ). The same view, essentially meets us in the accounts of Marcus, (; cf. ; ; ) and in the Epitomators of the Syntagma of Hippolytus (; Philaster, \"Haer\". 38).\n\nThe Italic school distinguished on the other hand a two-fold Sophia, the \"ano Sophia\" and the \"katō Sophia\" or Achamoth.\n\nAccording to the doctrine of Ptolemaeus and that of his disciples, the former of these separates herself from her \"syzygos\", the \"thelētos\" through her audacious longing after immediate Communion with the Father of all, falls into a condition of suffering, and would completely melt away in this inordinate desire, unless the \"Horos\" had purified her from her suffering and established her again in the Pleroma. Her \"enthymēsis\", on the other hand, the desire which has obtained the mastery over her and the consequent suffering becomes an \"amorphos kai aneideos ousia\", which is also called an \"ektrōma\", is separated from her and is assigned a place beyond the limits of the Pleroma.\n\nFrom her dwelling-place above the Hebdomad, in the place of the Midst, she is also called Ogdoad (Ὀγδοάς), and further entitled \"Mētēr\", \"Sophia\" also, and \"he Hierousalēm, Pneuma hagion\", and (\"arsenikōs\") \"Kyrios\". In these names some partial reminiscences of the old Ophitic Gnosis are retained.\n\nThe Achamoth first receives (by means of Christus and \"Pneuma hagion\" the Pair of Aeons within the Pleroma whose emanation is most recent), the \"morphōsis kat' ousian\". Left alone in her suffering she has become endued with penitent mind (\"epistrophē\"). Now descends the son as the common fruit of the Pleroma, gives her the \"morphōsis kata gnōsin\", and forms out of her various affections the Demiurge and the various constituents of this lower world. By his appointment the Achamoth produces the pneumatic seed (the \"ekklēsia\").\n\nThe end of the world's history is here also (as above) the introduction of the lower Sophia with all her pneumatic offspring into the Pleroma, and this intimately connected with the second descent of the Soter and his transient union with the psychical Christus; then follows the marriage-union of the Achamoth with the Soter and of the pneumatic souls with the angels (; \"exc. ex Theod\". 43-65).\n\nThe same form of doctrine meets us also in Secundus, who is said to have been the first to have made the distinction of an upper and a lower Sophia (), and in the account which the \"Philosophumena\" give us of a system which most probably referred to the school of Heracleon, and which also speaks of a double Sophia (). The name Jerusalem also for the \"exō Sophia\" meets us here (). It finds its interpretation in the fragments of Heracleon (ap. Origen. \"in Joann.\" tom. x. 19). The name Achamoth, on the other hand, is wanting both in Hippolytus and in Heracleon. One school among the Marcosians seems also to have taught a two-fold Sophia (; cf. ).\n\nAugust Hahn (1819) debated whether the name \"Achamōth\" (Ἀχαμώθ) is originally derived from the Hebrew \"Chokhmah\" (חָכְמָ֑ה), in Aramaic \"Ḥachmūth\" or whether it signifies 'She that brings forth'—'Mother.' The Syriac form \"Ḥachmūth\" is testified for us as used by Bardesanes (Ephraim, \"Hymn\" 55), the Greek form \"Hachamōth\" is found only among the Valentinians: the name however probably belongs to the oldest Syrian Gnosis.\n\nCosmogonic myths play their part also in the doctrine of Bardesanes. The \"locus foedus\" whereon the gods (or Aeons) measured and founded Paradise (Ephraim, \"Hymn\" 55) is the same as the impure \"mētra\", which Ephraim is ashamed even to name (cf. also Ephraim, \"Hymn\" 14). The creation of the world is brought to pass through the son of the living one and the Rūha d' Qudshā, the Holy Spirit, with whom Ḥachmūth is identical, but in combination with \"creatures,\" i.e. subordinate beings which co-operate with them (Ephraim, \"Hymn\" 3). It is not expressly so said, and yet at the same time is the most probable assumption, that as was the case with the father and mother so also their offspring the son of the Living One, and the Rūha d' Qudshā or Ḥachmūth, are to be regarded as a Syzygy. This last (the Ḥachmūth) brings forth the two daughters, the \"Shame of the Dry Land\" i.e. the \"mētra\", and the \"Image of the Waters\" i.e. the \"Aquatilis Corporis typus\", which is mentioned in connection with the Ophitic Sophia (Ephraim, \"Hymn\" 55). Beside which, in a passage evidently referring to Bardesanes, air, fire, water, and darkness are mentioned as aeons (Īthyē: \"Hymn\" 41) These are probably the \"Creatures\" to which in association with the Son and the Rūha d' Qudshā, Bardesanes is said to have assigned the creation of the world.\n\nThough much still remains dark as to the doctrine of Bardesanes we cannot nevertheless have any right to set simply aside the statements of Ephraim, who remains the oldest Syrian source for our knowledge of the doctrine of this Syrian Gnostic, and deserves therefore our chief attentions. Bardesanes, according to Ephraim, is able also to tell of the wife or maiden who having sunk down from the Upper Paradise offers up prayers in her dereliction for help from above, and on being heard returns to the joys of the Upper Paradise (Ephraim, \"Hymn\" 55).\n\nThese statements of Ephraim are further supplemented by the \"Acts of Thomas\" in which various hymns have been preserved which are either compositions of Bardesanes himself, or at any rate are productions of his school.\n\nIn the Syriac text of the Acts, we find the \"Hymn of the Pearl\", where the soul which has been sent down from her heavenly home to fetch the pearl guarded by the serpent, but has forgotten here below her heavenly mission until she is reminded of it by a letter from \"the father, the mother, and the brother,\" performs her task, receives back again her glorious dress, and returns to her old home.\n\nOf the other hymns which are preserved in the Greek version more faithfully than in the Syriac text which has undergone Catholic revision, the first deserving of notice is the \"Ode to the Sophia\" which describes the marriage of the \"maiden\" with her heavenly bridegroom and her introduction into the Upper Realm of Light. This \"maiden,\" called \"daughter of light,\" is not as the Catholic reviser supposes the Church, but Ḥachmūth (Sophia) over whose head the \"king,\" i.e. the father of the living ones, sits enthroned; her bridegroom is, according to the most probable interpretation, the son of the living one, i.e. Christ. With her the living Ones i.e. pneumatic souls enter into the Pleroma and receive the glorious light of the living Father and praise along with \"the living spirit\" the \"father of truth\" and the \"mother of wisdom.\"\n\nThe Sophia is also invoked in the first prayer of consecration. She is there called the \"merciful mother,\" the \"consort of the masculine one,\" \"revealant of the perfect mysteries,\" \"Mother of the Seven Houses,\" \"who finds rest in the eighth house,\" i.e. in the Ogdoad. In the second Prayer of Consecration she is also designated, the \"perfect Mercy\" and \"Consort of the Masculine One,\" but is also called \"Holy Spirit\" (Syriac \"Rūha d' Qudshā\") \"Revealant of the Mysteries of the whole Magnitude,\" \"hidden Mother,\" \"She who knows the Mysteries of the Elect,\" and \"she who partakes in the conflicts of the noble Agonistes\" (i.e. of Christ, cf. \"exc. ex Theod\". 58 \"ho megas agōnistēs Iēsous\").\n\nThere is further a direct reminiscence of the doctrine of Bardesanes when she is invoked as the Holy Dove which has given birth to the two twins, i.e. the two daughters of the Rūha d' Qudshā (ap. Ephraim, \"Hymn\" 55).\n\nA special and richly coloured development is given to the mythical form of the Sophia of the Gnostic Book \"Pistis Sophia\". The two first books of this writing to which the name \"Pistis Sophia\" properly belongs, treat for the greater part (pp. 42–181) of the fall, the Repentance, and the Redemption of the Sophia.\n\nShe has by the ordinance of higher powers obtained an insight into the dwelling-place appropriated to her in the spiritual world, namely, the \"thēsauros lucis\" which lies beyond the XIIIth Aeon. By her endeavours to direct thither her upward flight, she draws upon herself the enmity of the \"Authadēs\", Archon of the XIIIth Aeon, and of the Archons of the XII Aeons under him; by these she is enticed down into the depths of chaos, and is there tormented in the greatest possible variety of ways, in order that she may thus incur the loss of her light-nature.\n\nIn her utmost need she addresses thirteen penitent prayers (\"metanoiai\") to the Upper Light. Step by step she is led upwards by Christus into the higher regions, though she still remains obnoxious to the assaults of the Archons, and is, after offering her XIIIth \"Metanoia\", more vehemently attacked than ever, until at length Christus leads her down into an intermediate place below the XIIIth Aeon, where she remains until the consummation of the world, and sends up grateful hymns of praise and thanksgiving.\n\nThe earthly work of redemption having been at length accomplished, the Sophia returns to her original celestial home. The peculiar feature in this representation consists in the further development of the philosophical ideas which find general expression in the Sophia mythos. According to Karl Reinhold von Köstlin (1854), Sophia is here not merely, as with Valentinus, the representative of the longing which the finite spirit feels for the knowledge of the infinite, but at the same time a type or pattern of faith, of repentance, and of hope. After her restoration she announces to her companions the twofold truth that, while every attempt to overstep the divinely ordained limits, has for its consequence suffering and punishment, so, on the other hand, the divine compassion is ever ready to vouchsafe pardon to the penitent.\n\nWe have a further reminiscence of the Sophia of the older Gnostic systems in what is said in the book \"Pistis Sophia\" of the Light-Maiden (\"parthenos lucis\"), who is there clearly distinguished from the Sophia herself, and appears as the archetype of Astraea, the Constellation Virgo. The station which she holds is in the place of the midst, above the habitation assigned to the Sophia in the XIIIth Aeon. She is the judge of (departed) souls, either opening for them or closing against them the portals of the light-realm (pp. 194–295). Under her stand yet seven other light-maidens with similar functions, who impart to pious souls their final consecrations (p. 291 sq. 327 sq. 334). From the place of the \"parthenos lucis\" comes the sun-dragon, which is daily borne along by four light-powers in the shape of white horses, and so makes his circuit round the earth (p. 183, cf. p. 18, 309).\n\nThis light-maiden (\"parthenos tou phōtos\") encounters us also among the Manichaeans as exciting the impure desires of the Daemons, and thereby setting free the light which has hitherto been held down by the power of darkness (\"Dispuiat. Archelai et Manetis\", c. 8, n. 11; Theodoret., h. f. I. 26). On the other hand, the place of the Gnostic Sophia is among Manichaeans taken by the \"Mother of Life\" (\"mētēr tēs zōēs\"), and by the World-Soul (\"psychē hapantōn\"), which on occasions is distinguished from the Life-Mother, and is regarded as diffused through all living creatures, whose deliverance from the realm of darkness constitutes the whole of the world's history (Titus of Bostra, \"adv. Manich\". I., 29, 36, ed. Lagarde, p. 17 sqq. 23; Alexander Lycopolitus c. 3; Epiphan. \"Haer\". 66, 24; \"Acta dispatat. Archelai et Manetis\", c. 7 sq. et passim). Their return to the world of light is described in the famous \"Canticum Amatorium\" (ap. Augustin. c. Faust, iv. 5 sqq).\n\nIn \"On the Origin of the World\", Sophia is depicted as the ultimate destroyer of this material universe, Yaldabaoth and all his Heavens:\n\nCarl Jung linked the figure of Sophia to the highest archetype of the anima in depth psychology. The archetypal fall and recovery of Sophia is additionally linked (to a varying degree) to many different myths and stories (see damsel in distress). Among these are:\n\nNote that many of these myths have alternative psychological interpretations. For example, Jungian psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz interpreted fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty as symbolizing the 'rescue' or reintegration of the anima, the more 'feminine' part of a man's unconscious, but not wisdom or \"sophia\" per se.\n\n"}
{"id": "30643442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30643442", "title": "Stefan Lorenz Sorgner", "text": "Stefan Lorenz Sorgner\n\nStefan Lorenz Sorgner is a German metahumanist philosopher, a Nietzsche scholar, a philosopher of music and an authority in the field of ethics of emerging technologies.\n\nSorgner was born on 15 October 1973 in Wetzlar (Germany). He studied philosophy at King's College London (BA), the University of Durham (MA by thesis; examiners: David E. Cooper, Durham; David Owen, Southampton), the Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen and the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena (Dr. phil.; Examiners: Wolfgang Welsch, Jena; Gianni Vattimo, Turin). He taught philosophy and ethics at the Universities of Giessen, Jena, Erfurt and Erlangen. Currently, he teaches at a US Liberal Arts College, John Cabot University. Sorgner is a member of several editorial and advisory boards.\n\nIn issue 20(1) of the Journal of Evolution and Technology, Sorgner's article “Nietzsche, the Overhuman, and Transhumanism” was published in which he shows that there are significant similarities between Nietzsche's concept of the overhuman and the concept of the posthuman according to the view of some transhumanists. His interpretation brought about a response both among Nietzsche scholars as well as among transhumanists. The editors of the Journal of Evolution and Technology dedicated a special issue to the question concerning the relationship between transhumanism, Nietzsche and European posthumanist philosophies (posthumanism). Vol. 21 Issue 1 – January 2010 of the Journal of Evolution and Technology was entitled \"Nietzsche and European Posthumanisms\" and it included responses to Sorgner's article, for example by Max More, Michael Hauskeller. Due to the intense debate, the editors of the journal decided to give Sorgner the chance to react to the articles. In vol. 21 Issue 2 – October 2010, Sorgner replied to the various responses in his article \"Beyond Humanism: Reflections on Trans- and Posthumanism\". In addition, herein he also put forward some aspects of his own philosophical position which was strongly influenced by his teacher Gianni Vattimo. He accepts Vattimo's pensiero debole, but criticises Vattimo's understanding of the history of the weakening of being. As an alternative, Sorgner suggests a this-worldly, naturalist and perspectivist interpretation of the world, which he explained in more detail in his 2010 monograph \"Menschenwürde nach Nietzsche: Die Geschichte eines Begriffs\" (WBG, Darmstadt 2010). Sorgner regards \"Nihilism\", as described by Nietzsche, \"entirely a gain\": „From the perspective of my perspectivism, this also means that the prevalent conception of human dignity has no higher status in hitting truth as correspondence to reality than the conceptions of Adolf Hitler or Pol Pot.\" After bioethicists, and transhumanists had discussed the relationship between Nietzsche and transhumanism, the debate was taken up by some leading Nietzsche scholars: Keith Ansell-Pearson, Paul Loeb and Babette Babich wrote responses in the journal the Agonist which is being published by the Nietzsche Circle New York. Sorgner's perspectivist metahumanism and in particular his monograph \"Menschenwürde nach Nietzsche\" (WBG 2010) was dealt with in a symposium organised by the Nietzsche Forum Munich which had been co-founded by Thomas Mann. Leading German philosophers, e.g. Annemarie Pieper, responded to Sorgner's radical suggestions concerning the need to revise the prevalent conception of human dignity at this event. In May 2013, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit published an interview with Sorgner in which several of his suggestions concerning human dignity, emerging technologies and trans- and posthumanism were summarized. In Autumn 2014, an essay collection entitled \"Umwertung der Menschenwürde\" (edited by Beatrix Vogel) was published by Alber Verlag in which leading international theologians, philosophers, and ethicists wrote critical replies to Sorgner's suggestions concerning the notion \"human dignity\". Sorgner has been an invited and keynote speaker at many important events and conferences, e.g. Phil.cologne, TED, and the World Humanities Forum, ICISTS-KAIST. According to Prof. Dr. Zimmmermann of the Identity Foundation, a recently set-up German private think tank, Sorgner is “Germany’s leading post- and transhumanist philosopher” („Deutschlands führender post- und transhumanistischer Philosoph“).\n"}
