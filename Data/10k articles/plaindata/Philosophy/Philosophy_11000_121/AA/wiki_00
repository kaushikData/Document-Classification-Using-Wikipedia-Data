Originally published in 1995, Philipse brought out a new version in 2004, that included a new bundle of four essays titled \"De onredelijkheid van religie\" (\"The Unreasonableness of Religion\"). The compilation was published under the name Atheïstisch manifest en De onredelijkheid van religie (\"Atheist Manifesto and The Unreasonableness of Religion\").\n\nIn the short book, Philipse opines that one can speak rationally about the existence of God, but if one wishes to take the natural sciences seriously, one needs to reject the traditional meaning of the word 'God'. However, if one wished to define the word 'God' as something unknowable, God cannot have any descriptive contents and therefore not exist. Thus there is no grounding for theistic morality.\n\nPhilipse's \"Atheïstisch manifest\" got him into a fierce argument with several theologians, including Eginhard Meijering, Vincent Brümmer and Harry Kuitert, who replied to him disapprovingly, and eventually faced him in a debate on \"the tenability of atheism\" in the spring of 1996. Philipse claimed that all arguments thus far proposed for the existence of God were invalid, while the theologians argued Philipse had insufficiently delved into the matter, missed the religious context, and ignored how much consolation belief in God offered.\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Ayaan Hirsi Ali read \"Atheïstisch manifest\" in 2002, which led her to her definitive apostasy, after which she famously became a critic of Islam. For Philipse, too, the topic of religion and morality once again gained urgency because of \"9/11\", whereupon he decided to write four new essays on the relationship between religion and science under the title of \"De onredelijkheid van religie\", and combine it with his 1995 work. The entire composition, complete with a preface written by Hirsi Ali, was published in 2004 under the name \"Atheïstisch manifest en De onredelijkheid van religie\".\n\nIn 2012, Philipse published a new and much more elaborate book, \"God in the Age of Science?\", as an improvement on \"Atheïstisch manifest\". He commented on the issue: \"It was a matter of conscience. Everyone in the Netherlands knows me only because of that odd manifesto. Well, that frustrates one. I wanted to research the question really well for once. So that they can no longer say: you have merely written a superficial booklet about it.\"\n"}

HHS funding includes the funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Technically the Dickey Amendment is a \"rider\" to other legislation, which amends the original legislation. The rider receives its name from the name of the Congressman that originally introduced the amendment, Representative Jay Dickey. The Dickey amendment language has been added to each of the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations acts for FY1997 through FY2009. The original rider can be found in Section 128 of P.L. 104-99\n. The wording of the rider is generally the same year after year. For FY2009, the wording in Division F, Section 509 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, \n\nIn March 2009, President Obama issued an executive order which removed the restriction against federal funding of stem cell research. However, the Dickey–Wicker Amendment remains an obstacle for federally funded researchers seeking to create their own stem cell lines. In August 2010, as part of preliminary motions in \"Sherley vs Sebelius\", Judge Royce C. Lamberth granted an injunction against federally funded embryonic stem cell (ESC) research on the grounds that the guidelines for ESC research \"clearly violate\" the Dickey–Wicker Amendment. In September 2010, he refused to lift the injunction pending the conclusion of the case and the issuance of his ruling and a likely appeal. In response, the Obama Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to lift the injunction via an order pending the appeal of Judge Lamberth's ruling, which it did on April 29, 2011. Judge Lamberth was thereby obliged to reverse his ruling, and grudgingly dismissed the case entirely on July 27, 2011.\n\nIn the 2-1 opinion of April 29, 2011, the appeals panel said that the Dickey–Wicker Amendment was \"ambiguous\" and that the National Institutes of Health had \"reasonably concluded\" that although federal funds could not be used to directly destroy an embryo, the amendment does not prohibit funding a research project using embryonic stem cells. This is an important distinction under the law, because for federal funds to be used directly to support the destruction of embryos- as opposed to indirect use just in embryo stem cell research that avoids killing the embryo- is supposedly a violation of the Hyde Amendment, which has been ruled constitutional and which prohibits abortions using federal tax dollar funds (those questions will now have to be settled by the whole Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sitting en banc, or perhaps, ultimately, by the Supreme Court of the United States).\n\nFederal concern with human embryo research began over 25 years ago with the advent of assisted reproduction technologies, i.e. in vitro fertilization (IVF) or \"test tube babies.\"\n\nAlthough the first report of laboratory studies of human fertilization appeared in Science in 1944, (the work was conducted in Brookline, Massachusetts), clinical IVF was successful first in Great Britain in 1978 for couples with infertility. IVF became standard of care in the United States in the early 1980s. As with all forms of clinical treatment, the medical community looked to basic science research to improve the safety and efficacy of IVF for mothers and babies.\n\nIn 1979, an Ethics Advisory Board for the National Institutes of Health issued guidelines for research on early human embryos, but no action was taken. The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (see: Human subject research legislation in the United States) enacted in 1977 remained in place: 45CFR § 46.204(d), \"No application or proposal involving human in vitro fertilization may be funded by the Department or any component thereof until the application or proposal has been reviewed by the Ethical Advisory Board and the Board has rendered advice as to its acceptability from an ethical standpoint.\" Since there was no Ethics Advisory Board, federally funded research was not possible.\n\n"}

For example, no agent has full information as to other agents' budgets, preferences, resources or technologies, not to mention their plans for the future and numerous other factors which affect prices in those markets.\n\nMarket prices are the result of price discovery, in which each agent participating in the market makes use of its current knowledge and plans to decide on the prices and quantities at which it chooses to transact. The resulting prices and quantities of transactions may be said to reflect the current state of knowledge of the agents currently in the market, even though no single agent commands information as to the entire set of such knowledge.\n\nSome economists believe that market transactions provide the basis for a society to benefit from the knowledge that is dispersed among its constituent agents. For example, in his \"Principles of Political Economy\", John Stuart Mill states that one of the justifications for a laissez faire government policy is his belief that self-interested individuals throughout the economy, acting independently, can make better use of dispersed knowledge than could the best possible government agency.\nFriedrich Hayek claimed that \"dispersed knowledge is \"essentially\" dispersed, and cannot possibly be gathered together and conveyed to an authority charged with the task of deliberately creating order\".\n\n\n\nDispersed knowledge will give rise to uncertainty which will lead to different kinds of results.\nRichard LeFauve highlights the advantages of organizational structure in companies:\n\n\"Before if we had a tough decision to make, we would have two or three different perspectives with strong support of all three. In a traditional organization the bossman decides after he’s heard all three alternatives. At Saturn we take time to work it out, and what generally happens is that you end up with a fourth answer which none of the portions had in the first place. but one that all three portions of the organization fully support (AutoWeeR, Oct. 8, 1990. p. 20).\"\n\nCompanies are supposed to think highly of the dispersed knowledge and make adjustments to meet demands.\nTsoukas stated:\n\n\"A firm’s knowledge is distributed, not only in a computational sense . . . or in Hayek’s (1945, p. 521) sense that the factual knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place cannot be surveyed as a whole. But, more radically, a firm’s knowledge is distributed in the sense that it is inherently indeterminate: nobody knows in advance what that knowledge is or need be. Firms are faced with radical uncertainty: they do not, they cannot, know what they need to know.\"\n\nThere are several strategies targeting at the problems caused by dispersed knowledge.\n\nFirst of all, replacing knowledge by getting access to knowledge can be one of the strategies.\n\nWhat's more, the capability to complete incomplete knowledge can deal with knowledge gaps created by the dispersed knowledge.\n\nIn addition, making a design of institutions with reasonable coordination mechanisms can be regarded as the third strategy.\n\nBesides, resolving organization units into smaller ones should be taken into consideration.\n\nLast but not least, providing more data to decision maker will be helpful for making a correct decision.\n\n"}
{"id": "5186633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5186633", "title": "Energy (psychological)", "text": "Energy (psychological)\n\nMental energy or psychic energy is a concept in some psychological theories or models of a postulated unconscious mental functioning on a level between biology and consciousness.\n\nThe idea harks back to Aristotle's conception of \"actus et potentia\". \"Energy\" here used in the literal meaning of \"activity\" or \"operation\". Henry More, in his 1642 \"Psychodia platonica; or a platonicall song of the soul\", defined an \"energy of the soul\" as including \"every phantasm of the soul\". Julian Sorell Huxley defines \"mental energy\" as \"the driving forces of the psyche, emotional as well as intellectual\" (\"On living in a revolution\" xv.192, 1944).\n\nIn 1874, the concept of \"psychodynamics\" was proposed with the publication of \"Lectures on Physiology\" by German physiologist Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke who, in coordination with physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, one of the formulators of the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy), supposed that all living organisms are energy-systems also governed by this principle. During this year, at the University of Vienna, Brücke served as supervisor for first-year medical student Sigmund Freud who adopted this new \"dynamic\" physiology. In his \"Lectures on Physiology\", Brücke set forth the then-radical view that the living organism is a dynamic system to which the laws of chemistry and physics apply.\n\nIn \"The Ego and the Id\", Freud argued that the id was the source of the personality's desires, and therefore of the psychic energy that powered the mind. Freud defined libido as the instinct energy or force. Freud later added the death drive (also contained in the id) as a second source of mental energy. The origins of Freud's basic model, based on the fundamentals of chemistry and physics, according to John Bowlby, stems from Brücke, Meynert, Breuer, Helmholtz, and Herbart.\n\nIn 1928, Carl Jung published a seminal essay entitled \"On Psychic Energy\". Later, the theory of psychodynamics and the concept of \"psychic energy\" was developed further by those such as Alfred Adler and Melanie Klein.\n\nJust as physical energy acts upon physical objects, psychological energy would act upon psychological entities, i.e. thoughts. Psychological energy and force are the basis of an attempt to formulate a scientific theory according to which psychological phenomena would be subject to precise laws akin to how physical objects are subject to Newton's laws. This concept of psychological energy is completely separate and distinct from (or even opposed to) the mystical eastern concept of spiritual energy.\n\nThe divides people into 16 categories based on whether certain activities leave them feeling energized or drained of energy.\n\nMental energy has been repeatedly compared to or connected with the physical quantity energy.\n\nStudies of the 1990s to 2000s (and earlier) have found that mental effort can be measured in terms of increased metabolism in the brain. The modern neuroscientific view is that brain metabolism, measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography, is a physical correlate of mental activity.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36336399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36336399", "title": "English clause syntax", "text": "English clause syntax\n\nThis article describes the syntax of clauses in the English language, that is, the ways of combining and ordering constituents such as verbs and noun phrases to form a clause.\n\nClauses can be classified as \"independent\" (main clauses) and \"dependent\" (subordinate clauses). A typical sentence consists of one independent clause, possibly augmented by one or more dependent clauses.\n\nAn independent clause is a simple sentence. Sentences can be classified according to the purpose or function of the sentence into \"declarative\" (making a statement), \"interrogative\" (asking a question), exclamatory sentence or \"imperative\" (giving an order).\n\nIn interrogative main clauses, unless the subject is or contains the interrogative word, the verb precedes the subject: \"Are you hungry?\" \"Where am I?\" (but \"Who did this?\", without inversion, since the interrogative \"who\" is itself the subject). However such inversion is only possible with an auxiliary or copular verb; if no such verb would otherwise be present, \"do\"-support is used.\n\nIn most imperative clauses the subject is absent: \"Eat your dinner!\" However imperative clauses may include the subject for emphasis: \"You eat your dinner!\". The form of the verb is the base form of the verb, such as \"eat\", \"write\", \"be\". Modal verbs do not have imperative forms. Negation uses \"do\"-support, even if the verb is \"be\"; see below. The imperative here refers to second-person forms; constructions for other persons may be formed periphrastically, e.g. \"Let's (let us) go\"; \"Let them eat cake\".\n\nA dependent clause may be \"finite\" (based on a finite verb, as independent clauses are), or \"non-finite\" (based on a verb in the form of an infinitive or participle). Particular types of dependent clause include relative clauses, content clauses and adverbial clauses.\n\nIn certain instances, clauses use a verb conjugated in the subjunctive mood; see English subjunctive.\n\nClauses can be nested within each other, sometimes up to several levels. For example, the sentence \"I know the woman who says she saw your son drinking beer\" contains a non-finite clause (\"drinking beer\") within a content clause (\"she saw your son drinking beer\") within a relative clause (\"who says she saw your son drinking beer\") within an independent declarative clause (the whole sentence).\n\nA non-finite clause is one in which the main verb is in a non-finite form, namely an infinitive, past participle, or \"-ing\" form (present participle or gerund); for how these forms are made, see English verbs. (Such a clause may also be referred to as an \"infinitive phrase\", \"participial phrase\", etc.)\n\nThe internal syntax of a non-finite clause is generally similar to that of a finite clause, except that there is usually no subject (and in some cases a missing complement; see below). The following types exist:\n\nIn certain uses, a non-finite clause contains a missing (zero) item – this may be an object or complement of the verb, or the complement of a preposition within the clause (leaving the preposition \"stranded\"). Examples of uses of such \"passive\" non-finite clauses are given below: \n\nFor details of the uses of such clauses, see below. See also English passive voice (particularly under Additional passive constructions).\n\nEnglish is an SVO language, that is, in simple declarative sentences the order of the main components is \"subject–verb–object(s)\" (or \"subject–verb–complement\").\n\nA typical finite clause consists of a noun phrase functioning as the subject, a finite verb, followed by any number of dependents of the verb. In some theories of grammar the verb and its dependents are taken to be a single component called a verb phrase or the predicate of the clause; thus the clause can be said to consist of subject plus predicate.\n\nDependents include any number of complements (especially a noun phrase functioning as the object), and other modifiers of the verb. Noun phrase constituents which are personal pronouns or (in formal registers) the pronoun \"who(m)\" are marked for case, but otherwise it is word order alone that indicates which noun phrase is the subject and which the object.\n\nThe presence of complements depends on the pattern followed by the verb (for example, whether it is a transitive verb, i.e. one taking a direct object). A given verb may allow a number of possible patterns (for example, the verb \"write\" may be either transitive, as in \"He writes letters\", or intransitive, as in \"He writes often\").\n\nSome verbs can take two objects: an indirect object and a direct object. An indirect object precedes a direct one, as in \"He gave the dog a bone\" (where \"the dog\" is the indirect object and \"a bone\" the direct object). However the indirect object may also be replaced with a prepositional phrase, usually with the preposition \"to\" or \"for\", as in \"He gave a bone to the dog\". (The latter method is particularly common when the direct object is a personal pronoun and the indirect object is a stronger noun phrase: \"He gave it to the dog\" would be used rather than ?\"He gave the dog it\".)\n\nAdverbial adjuncts are often placed after the verb and object, as in \"I met John yesterday\". However other positions in the sentence are also possible; see , and for \"phrasal\" particles, Phrasal verb. Another adverb which is subject to special rules is the negating word \"not\"; see below.\n\nObjects normally precede other complements, as in \"I told him to fetch it\" (where \"him\" is the object, and the infinitive phrase \"to fetch it\" is a further complement). Other possible complements include prepositional phrases, such as \"for Jim\" in the clause \"They waited for Jim\"; predicative expressions, such as \"red\" in \"The ball is red\"; subordinate clauses, which may be introduced by a subordinating conjunction such as \"if\", \"when\", \"because\", \"that\", for example the \"that\"-clause in \"I suggest that you wait for her\"; and non-finite clauses, such as \"eating jelly\" in the sentence \"I like eating jelly\".\n\nMany English verbs are used together with a particle (such as \"in\" or \"away\") and with preposition phrases in constructions that are commonly referred to as \"phrasal verbs\". These complements often modify the meaning of the verb in an unpredictable way, and a verb-particle combination such as \"give up\" can be considered a single lexical item. The position of such particles in the clause is subject to different rules from other adverbs; for details see Phrasal verb.\n\nEnglish is not a \"pro-drop\" (specifically, null-subject) language – that is, unlike some languages, English requires that the subject of a clause always be expressed explicitly, even if it can be deduced from the form of the verb and the context, and even if it has no meaningful referent, as in the sentence \"It is raining\", where the subject \"it\" is a dummy pronoun. Imperative and non-finite clauses are exceptions, in that they usually do not have a subject expressed.\n\nAdjuncts are constituents which are not required by the main verb, and can be removed without leaving behind something ungrammatical. Adjuncts are usually adverbs or adverbial phrases or clauses.\n\nMany clauses have as their finite verb an auxiliary, which governs a non-finite form of a lexical (or other auxiliary) verb. For clauses of this type, see below.\n\nVariations on the basic SVO pattern occur in certain types of clause. The subject is absent in most imperative clauses and most non-finite clauses (see the and sections). For cases in which the verb or a verb complement is omitted, see .\n\nThe verb and subject are inverted in most interrogative clauses. This requires that the verb be an auxiliary or copula (and \"do\"-support is used to provide an auxiliary if there is otherwise no invertible verb). The same type of inversion occurs in certain other types of clause, particularly main clauses beginning with an adjunct having negative force (\"Never have I witnessed such carnage\"), and some dependent clauses expressing a condition (\"Should you decide to come...\"). For details see subject–auxiliary inversion and negative inversion.\n\nA somewhat different type of inversion may involve a wider set of verbs (as in \"After the sun comes the rain\"); see subject–verb inversion.\n\nIn certain types of clause an object or other complement becomes zero or is brought to the front of the clause: see .\n\nIn many English clauses, the finite verb is an auxiliary verb, whose complement is some type of non-finite clause. For example, in the clause \"he is eating his dinner\", the finite verb is the auxiliary \"is\", whose complement is the participial clause \"eating his dinner\". In some cases the non-finite clause itself has an auxiliary as its main verb, with another embedded non-finite clause as complement. For example:\nHere \"eating his dinner\" is the complement of \"been\", and \"been eating his dinner\" is the complement of \"has\".\n\nThe form of each lexical or auxiliary verb (apart from the first) is determined by the auxiliary preceding it. The first auxiliary is conjugated as a finite verb in present or past tense: the modals are invariant, but the other auxiliaries may take the forms \"have\", \"has\", \"had\", \"am\", \"is\", \"are\", \"be\" (subjunctive), \"was\", \"were\", \"do\", \"does\", \"did\". (If the clause being considered is a non-finite clause, then the initial auxiliary form may be \"having\", \"(to) have\", \"being\", or \"(to) be\".)\n\nThe principal auxiliaries and the verb forms they govern are:\n\nA modal verb, if present, comes first. Any other auxiliaries come in the order listed above, namely perfect \"have\" followed by progressive \"be\" followed by passive \"be\". The auxiliary \"do\" is not used in combination with any other auxiliary. Otherwise, the above auxiliaries can be used in any combination (but with no more than one instance from each group).\n\nA clause containing the maximum number of auxiliaries might therefore be \"I will have been being operated on for six hours.\" Here the modal \"will\" is the finite verb; perfect \"have\" is in bare infinitive form (since it follows a modal), progressive \"be\" is in the past participle form \"been\" (following perfect \"have\"), passive \"be\" is in the present participle form \"being\" (following progressive \"be\"), and the lexical verb is in the past participle form \"operated\" (following passive \"be\"; here it is the dependent preposition \"on\" that has zero complement).\n\nConstructions of this type serve a variety of functions, including the expression of aspect, voice and modality. The meaning of combinations of these auxiliary verbs are presented in more detail later in this article.\n\nSome of these constructions are described, particularly in teaching contexts, as \"tenses\" – for example, \"is eating\" is represented as the \"present progressive tense\" of \"eat\". (This terminology is rejected by many theoretical grammarians, since the construction does not serve purely to indicate present time, but also encodes aspectual information.) The series of auxiliaries and non-finite verb form is treated as a unit. Thus in the examples above, the strings \"is eating\" and \"has been eating\" may be presented as forms of the verb \"eat\", with \"his dinner\" serving as their object. (From a theoretical perspective, these verb series are examples of catenae.)\n\nNon-finite constructions exist for combinations of auxiliary verbs other than the modals verbs or \"do\":\n\nThe verbs \"ought\" and \"used\" differ from other modals in that they require the \"to\"-infinitive rather than the bare infinitive: \"He ought to go\"; \"We used to go\" (for this reason they are not always classified as modals). There are certain other auxiliary-like expressions that are variously classified:\n\nIn interrogative and relative clauses, \"wh\"-fronting occurs; that is, the interrogative word or relative pronoun (or in some cases a phrase containing it) is brought to the front of the clause: \"What did you see?\" (the interrogative word \"what\" comes first even though it is the object); \"The man to whom you gave the book...\" (the phrase \"to whom\", containing the relative pronoun, comes to the front of the relative clause; for more detail on relative clauses see English relative clauses).\n\nFronting of various elements can also occur for reasons of focus; occasionally even an object or other verbal complement can be fronted rather than appear in its usual position after the verb, as in \"I met Tom yesterday, but Jane I haven't seen for ages\". (For cases in which fronting is accompanied by inversion of subject and verb, see negative inversion and subject–verb inversion.)\n\nIn certain types of non-finite clause (\"passive\" types; see non-finite clauses above), and in some relative clauses, an object or a preposition complement is absent (becomes zero). For example, in \"I like the cake you made\", the words \"you made\" form a reduced relative clause in which the verb \"made\" has zero object. This can produce preposition stranding (as can \"wh\"-fronting): \"I like the song you were listening to\"; \"Which chair did you sit on?\"\n\nA clause is negated by the inclusion of the word \"not\":\n\nCertain clauses display ellipsis, where some component is omitted, usually by way of avoidance of repetition. Examples include:\nFor more analysis and further examples, see Verb phrase ellipsis.\n\nThe various constructions with auxiliary verbs (see above) can be used to express aspect (with perfective \"have\" and progressive \"be\"), voice (with passive \"be\") and modality (with the modal verbs).\n\nEnglish clauses can be described as having progressive aspect, perfect aspect, neither (\"simple aspect\"), or both (\"perfect progressive aspect\"). They can also be described as having active voice or passive voice. The following table shows these combinations:\nThe constructions given above are third-person singular present indicative. However, by changing the form of the finite (i.e. first) verb in each case, equivalent forms can be constructed for other persons and numbers, for past tense, and for imperative and subjunctive mood (although the imperative is not normally used with perfect aspect, and only rarely with progressive).\n\nThe meanings of the aspects are as follows:\n\nModal verbs can also be used, such as \"will\" used as above in future constructions and \"would\" in conditional constructions. These serve as uninflected auxiliary verbs, even in the third person singular. Most of these have multiple modal uses, depending on context. With the exception of \"ought\", all are followed by the short form of the main verb's infinitive (that is, without the particle \"to\"). \"Dare\" and \"need\", are infrequently used as modals and are much more frequently used instead as main verbs that are inflected with \"-s\" in the present tense third person singular; when they are used as main verbs, the infinitive following them includes the particle \"to\".\n\nThis is illustrated in the table below with the modal \"might\".\n\nThe modals are invariant, so in this case it is not possible to inflect for tense or mood (except insofar as certain modals express these categories; for example, \"could\" may serve as a past tense of \"can\"). There are no imperative or non-finite forms (periphrasis may be used in some cases; for example, infinitive clauses can be made with \"to be able to...\" or \"to be going to...\").\n\nThe modal \"will\", in some of its uses, expresses future time. Hence constructions using \"will\" as the modal in the above schema are often referred to as being instances of a future tense. Thus forms like \"will take\" can be called the simple future, \"will have taken\" the future perfect, and so on. Analogous terminology is used for the forms with \"would\" (sometimes \"should\"); these are referred to as conditional (or \"future-in-the-past\") forms. Sometimes \"shall\" and \"should\" are also used in this way: see \"shall\" and \"will\".\n\nThe simple constructions can be used to express habitual action. In many contexts they can also be used to express single completed actions.\n\nThe passive voice is formed using the appropriate form of the verb \"be\" followed by the past participle (more accurately called the passive participle in this context) of the main verb, e.g. \"He is written.\"\n\nThe simple present has three main uses in English: First, it often identifies habitual or customary action referring to no specific time frame:\nSecond, it is used with stative verbs to refer to a present situation:\nThird, it can have a future meaning in two contexts (though its use as an indicator of futurity is much less common than in many other languages):\nThe simple present has an intensive or emphatic construction with \"do\": \"He does write\". In the negative and interrogative constructions, of course, this is identical to the non-emphatic constructions. It is typically used as a response to the question \"Does he write\", whether that question is expressed or implied, and says that indeed, he does write.\n\nThe different syntactic behavior of the negative particle \"not\" and the negative inflectional suffix \"-n't\" in the interrogative constructions is also worth noting. In formal literary English of the sort in which contractions are avoided, \"not\" attaches itself to the main verb: \"Does he not write?\" When the colloquial contraction \"-n't\" is used, this attaches itself to the auxiliary \"do\": \"Doesn't he write?\" This in fact is a contraction of a more archaic word order, still occasionally found in poetry: *\"Does not he write?\"\n\nThe simple past is also called the preterite.\n\nThe preterite is used for the English simple (non-iterative or iterative, but not progressive) past tense. \"He wrote two more chapters about the dam at Kashagawigamog Lake.\"\n\nThis tense is used for a single event in the past (\"I went there yesterday\"), for past habitual action (\"I went there every day for a year\"), and in chronological narration. Like the present simple, it has an emphatic variant with \"do\": \"he did write\".\n\nThe simple past is distinct from the present perfect:\n\nThe preterite, when used to indicate habitual aspect, can often be replaced by a compound construction:\n\nEnglish does not have a dedicated future tense in the sense of a morphological form that always indicates what the speaker views as facts about the future.\n\n\"Shall\" can be used in place of \"will\": see the article Shall and Will for a discussion of the two auxiliary verbs used to form the simple future in English.\n\n\"Will\" and \"would\" can be used with a different meaning to futurity or conditionality:\n\nThe \"will\" construction can be used to indicate what the speaker views as facts about the future:\n\nIt can also indicate a combination of futurity and intentional or volitional modality:\n\nIt can also indicate predictive modality — what the speaker intends as predictions about the future:\n\nThe \"will\" construction is occasionally used for statements about the present to indicate that they are speculative:\n\nThe \"will\" construction can be used to indicate strong volition in the present in the first person:\n\nIt can also be used to indicate habituality in the past, present and future:\n\nThere is also a future with \"go\" which is used with the infinitive of the action verb especially for intended actions and for the weather, and which is generally more common in colloquial speech:\nThe will/shall construction can be used for spontaneous decisions:\n\nThis form is always identical to the infinitive. This means that apart from the verb \"to be\", it is distinct from the indicative present only in the third person singular and the obsolete second person singular.\n\nIt is used to express wishes about the present or future:\n\nIt can be used (in formal writing) to express present doubt, especially after \"if\", \"whether\", and \"lest\" and in set phrases:\n\nThe subordinate conjunction \"whether\" can be replaced by inversion of \"be\" and the subject:\n\nIt is also used in a mandative sense:\n\nThe present subjunctive can be written in the passive voice as in\n\nThe conditional present is formed by combining the modal auxiliary \"would\" (never *\"woulds\", not even in the third person singular) with the infinitive (without \"to\") of the main verb:\n\nThe conditional present is used principally in a main clause accompanied by an implicit or explicit doubt or \"if-clause\"; it may refer to conditional statements in present or future time:\n\nSome varieties of English regularly use \"would\" (often shortened to \"(I)'d\") in \"if\" clauses, but this is often considered non-standard: \"If you'd leave now, you'd be on time\". Such use of \"would\" is widespread especially in spoken US English in all sectors of society, but these forms are not usually used in writing that is more formal. Nevertheless, some reliable sources simply label this usage as acceptable US English and no longer label it as colloquial.\n\nThere are exceptions, however, where \"would\" is used in British English too in seemingly counterfactual conditions, but these can usually be interpreted as a modal use of \"would\": \"If you would listen to me once in a while, you might learn something\". In cases in which the action in the \"if\" clause takes place after that in the main clause, use of \"would\" in counterfactual conditions is however considered standard and correct usage in even formal UK and US usage: \"If it would make Bill happy, I'd [I would] give him the money.\"\nThe auxiliary verbs \"could\" and \"might\" can also be used to indicate the conditional mood, as in the following:\n\nProgressive constructions denote ongoing activity at a specific point of time or continuous activity over an extent of time. All verbal constructions can be made progressive (e.g. \"I have written\" → \"I have been writing\"), and these constructions are very common. Progressive constructions are also known as \"continuous\".\n\nThe passive voice of the progressive is formed by the present progressive of \"to be\" (\"is being\") followed by the past participle of the main verb (\"written\"), e.g. \"He is being written.\"\n\nAn important difference between the present progressive tense in English and many other languages with similar tenses (e.g. Spanish) is that the English present progressive \"must\" be used in many circumstances. In particular, a statement about an ongoing action at the present time normally \"must\" use the progressive (\"I am writing a letter now\" but not \"*I write a letter now\"). The simple present is used in the following circumstances:\n\nIn the latter cases, the progressive is often possible, sometimes with different implications. Generally, it implies an action rather than a state, and an ongoing, often temporary situation. For example, \"I am feeling lonely\" and \"I am seeing a bear\" specifically emphasize the perception of the feeling at the current time, which is implied to be temporary.\n\nWith \"have\" and \"be\" the present progressive is even clearer in imparting a meaning of \"currently ongoing action\". Hence \"??I am having a large car\" would sound quite strange, and be almost uninterpretable, while \"?I am being a doctor\" still sounds strange but potentially might mean \"I'm not a doctor but I'm temporarily trying to act like one\". But there are a number of quite acceptable usages of progressive \"have\" and \"be\":\n\nThis construction describes the simple engagement in a present activity, with the focus on action in progress \"at this very moment\". It too can indicate a future, particularly when discussing plans already in place: \"I am flying to Paris tomorrow\". Used with \"always\" it suggests irritation; compare \"He always does that\" (neutral) with \"He is always doing that\" (and it annoys me).\nWord order differs here in the negative interrogative between the more formal \"is he not writing\" and the colloquial contraction \"isn't he writing\"?\n\nThe past progressive construction indicates ongoing action in the past\n\nThis construction is typically used for two events in parallel:\nIt can also be used for an interrupted action (the past simple being used for the interruption):\nFurther, it can be used to indicate continuing action at a specific time in the past:\n\nIt can also be used to refer to past action that occurred over a range of time and is viewed as an ongoing situation:\n\nThis construction is used especially to indicate that an event will be in progress at a particular point in the future: \"This time tomorrow I will / shall be taking my driving test.\"\n\nThe passive construction \"It will be being written\" is rarely used. If it is desired to express future progressivity in the passive voice, the construction \"It will be in the process of being written\" can be used.\n\nThe conditional present progressive is used for the continuous aspect of the conditional construction; it describes a situation that would now be prevailing had it not been for some intervening event:\n\nThe passive voice of the conditional present progressive can be formed as \"It would be being written\", but since this construction is awkward the form \"It would be in the process of being written\" would be more common.\n\nPerfect constructions are used to express actions or events that happened before a point in time, with an emphasis on the continuing effects of these at this point of time.\n\nThe following table shows examples of perfect constructions being used with the pronoun \"he\":\n\nThe passive voice is formed with by the present perfect of \"to be\" (\"been\") followed by the past participle of the main verb, e.g. \"He has been written.\"\n\nThe present perfect was traditionally just called the perfect.\n\nThe distinction between the past (\"I did\") and the present perfect (\"I have done\") can be subtle. In general, the present perfect occurs in cases where there is an explicitly or implicitly established present frame of reference. When the frame of reference is explicit, such as in the sentence \"Whenever I get home, usually John has already arrived\", the usage of the present perfect is clear, but in other cases it is less obvious.\n\n\nThis construction indicates that a past event has one of a range of possible relationships to the present. This relationship may involve a focus on present result: \"He has written a very fine book\" (and look, here it is, we have it now). Alternatively, it may indicate a period which includes the present: \"I have lived here since my youth\" (and I still do). Compare: \"Have you written a letter this morning?\" (it is still morning) with \"Did you write a letter this morning?\" (it is now afternoon). The perfect construction is frequently used with the adverbs \"already\" or \"recently\" or with \"since\" clauses. The present perfect can identify habitual and continuing actions (\"I have written letters since I was ten years old.\"), continuous and ongoing actions (\"I have lived here for fifteen years.\"), or completed actions that still affect the present situation (\"I have visited Paris twice\" (and the memory of the experience is still with me)).\n\nIn addition to these normal uses where the event is viewed from the present, the “have done” construct is used with a future perspective in temporal clauses where other languages would use the future perfect: \"When you have written it, show it to me\".\n\nThe term \"perfect\" was first applied in discussions of Latin grammar, to refer to a tense which expresses a completed action (\"perfect\" in the sense of \"finished\"). It was then applied to a French tense which has a similar use to the Latin perfect, and then was transferred to the English tense which looks morphologically something like the French perfect. In fact, the English perfect is often used precisely in situations where Latin would use the imperfect — for past actions which are not finished but continue into the present.\n\nIn colloquial English, particularly British English, the present perfect of the verb \"get\", namely \"have got\" or \"has got\", is frequently used in place of the simple present indicative of \"have\" (i.e. \"have\" or \"has\") when denoting possession, broadly defined. For example:\nNote that in American English, the form \"got\" is used in this idiom, even though the standard past participle of \"get\" is \"gotten\".\n\nThe same applies in the expression of present obligation: \"I've got to go now\" may be used in place of \"I have to (must) go now\".\n\nIn very informal registers, the contracted form of \"have\" or \"has\" may be omitted altogether: \"I got three brothers\".\n\nThe past perfect is also known as the pluperfect; it is formed by combining the preterite of \"to have\" with the past participle of the main verb:\n\nThe past perfect is used when the action occurred in the past before another action in the past. It is used when speaking of the past to indicate the relative time of two past actions, one occurring before the other; i.e. a \"past before the past\".\n\nThe past time of perspective could be stated explicitly:\n\nor it can be understood from previous information:\n\nThe past time of perspective can simply be implied by the context:\n\nIt is sometimes possible to use the simple past instead of the past perfect, but only where there is no ambiguity in the meaning. For instance, the second example above could be written:\n\nUnderstood within the above context, this still means that I first invited Jim then later ate the meal (without him).\n\nHowever, concurrent past events are also possible, indicated by dual simple past tenses in both verbs. Consider the following:\n\nThis means both past events happened at the same time: he left at the same time as we arrived.\n\nThe past perfect can also be used to express a counterfactual statement about the past:\n\nHere, the first clause refers to an unreal state in the past (without any comparison of the timing of multiple past events), and the entire construction is a conditional sentence.\n\nThe future perfect is formed by combining, in this order, \"will\" or \"shall\", the auxiliary verb \"have\", and the past participle of the main verb. It indicates an action that either is completed sometime prior to a future time of perspective or an ongoing action that continues to a future time of perspective:\n\nThe conditional perfect construction is used for conditional situations occurring in the past; it expresses thoughts which are or may be contrary to present fact:\n\nSome varieties of English regularly use \"would have\" (often shortened to \"(I)'d have\") in \"if\" clauses, but this is often non-standard: \"If you (would)'ve told me, we could've done something about it\". Such use of \"would\" is widespread especially in spoken US English in all sectors of society, but is incorrect and is not usually used in more formal writing. (See note and sources at end of section on conditional above.)\n\nThere are exceptions, however, where \"would\" is used in British English too in seemingly counterfactual conditions, but these can usually be interpreted as a modal use of \"would\": \"If you would have listened to me once in a while, you might have learned something\". In cases in which the action in the \"if\" clause takes place after that in the main clause, use of \"would\" in \"if\" clauses is however considered standard and correct usage in even formal UK and US usage: \"If it would have made Bill happy, I'd [I would] have given him the money.\" (See note and sources at end of section on conditional above.)\n\nPerfect progressive constructions (or perfect continuous constructions) are used to express ongoing activity that extends to a certain point in time.\n\nFor passive voice clauses, the present participle (\"writing\") is replaced with \"being\" followed by the past participle (\"being written\").\n\nIt is used for unbroken action in the past which continues right up to the present. \"I have been writing this paper all morning\" (and still am).\n\nThe present perfect progressive is used for denoting the action which was in progress and has just finished or is still going on.\nFor example,\n\nSentences referring to an expanse of time use the present perfect continuous if ongoing action (not a static situation) is referred to. For example,\nHowever, with stative verbs (such as see, want, like, etc.), or if the situation is considered permanent, the present perfect non-progressive construction is used.\nFor example,\n\nThus, if the whole period is referred to, \"for\" is used, but when the reference is to the starting point of the action, \"since\" is used.\n\nThe construction \"It has been being written\", while following the usual pattern for the formation of the passive voice, is very rarely used. Occasionally, when it is desired to express the receiving of an action in the past and continuing to the present, the phrasal construction \"It has been in the process of being written\" is used. Here the present perfect construction is applied to \"to be\", and the continuity and the passive voice are applied to the main verb in non-finite form in a noun phrase.\n\nThe past perfect progressive is also known as the pluperfect progressive , the past perfect continuous, and the pluperfect continuous. It is formed by combining, in this order, the preterite of \"to have\", the past participle of \"to be\", and the present participle of the main verb.\n\nThe past perfect progressive relates to the past perfect as the present perfect progressive relates to the present perfect.\n\nThe construction \"It had been being written\" is very rarely used. To convey the past perfect progressive in the passive voice, the construction \"It had been in the process of being written\" can be used.\n\nThe future perfect progressive, also called the future perfect continuous, is formed by combining, in this order, \"will\" or \"shall\", the auxiliary \"have\", the past participle \"been\", and the present participle of the main verb.\n\nThis construction is used for an event that will still be in progress at a certain point in the future: \"By 8:00 he will have been writing for five hours\" (and will still be doing so).\n\nThe construction \"It will have been being written\" is never used. The construction \"It will have been in the process of being written\" can be used to indicate the continuous receiving of an action prior to some time in the future.\n\nRather than the very rarely used awkward construction \"It would have been being written\", the conditional perfect progressive can be expressed in the passive voice as in \"It would have been in the process of being written.\"\n\nThe past subjunctive is used to express hypotheses about the present or future: it is used to describe unreal or hypothetical conditions. It consists of the verb \"were\" in all persons and numbers (including the first and third persons singular), either as the main verb or as a helping verb combined with the infinitive of the main verb.\n\nIt usually appears in \"\"if\" clauses\" of conditional sentences.\nExamples include:\n\nEspecially in formal usage, \"if\" may be omitted and the order of the subject and \"were\" inverted:\n\nWhen \"if\" means \"when\" (a fact) then the indicative is used. Compare\n\n\nThe imperfect subjunctive is also used in \"\"that\" clauses\" after a wish:\n\nThis last example can be contrasted with \"I want her to be here\", in which the indicative rather than the subjunctive is used because there is a substantial possibility that the hypothesis is (or will be) true.\n\nThe imperfect subjunctive can be written in the passive voice as in\n\nor\n\nA future subjunctive for use in \"\"if\" clauses\" can be constructed using the conjugated form of the verb \"to be\" plus the infinitive (including the particle \"to\") or by using the modal auxiliary verb \"should\" (though the \"should\" form is very unusual in American English):\n\nThese constructions can alternatively be expressed with inversion of the order of \"were\" or \"should\" and the subject, with \"if\" omitted:\n\nIf the \"were to\" construction is used in the \"\"if\" clause\", the word \"would\" is used in the main clause; if the \"should\" form is used in the \"\"if\" clause\", either \"will\" or \"would\" can be used in the main clause, depending on whether the event is very hypothetical (leading to the use of \"would\") or is quite possible (permitting the use of \"will\").\n\nThe passive voice can be applied to the future subjunctive as in any of the following:\n\nor\n\nThe various types of non-finite clauses described above have a number of uses besides the constructions with auxiliaries already described.\n\nAn infinitive phrase begins with the base form of the verb. Infinitive phrases can be viewed as part of finite clauses where they are introduced in verb catenae by an auxiliary verb or by a certain limited class of main verbs. They are also often frequently introduced by a main verb followed by the particle \"to\". Further, infinitives introduced by \"to\" can function as noun phrases, or even as modifiers of nouns. The following table illustrates these environments:\n\nAn infinitive phrase begins with the bare form of the first verb, and is usually co-ordinated by the word \"to\":\n\nWhen the semantic agent of the verb phrase occurs as the object in the co-ordinating clause, \"to\" does not occur:\n\nInfinitive phrases are used after particular verbs such as \"want\" or \"need\".\n\nThe placement of an adverbial modifier directly after the \"to\" of an infinitive phrase (\"to slowly drift away\") is called a split infinitive, and is sometimes regarded as a grammatical or stylistic error.\n\nA present participle phrase uses the present participle form of the verb, ending in \"-ing\".\n\nIt may be used in progressive constructions:\n\nThe present participle may be used in non-finite constructions such as the following:\n\nThe present participle form of a verb may function as a noun, in which case it is referred to as a gerund. Gerunds typically appear as subject or object noun phrases, or even as the object of a preposition:\n\nOften distinguishing between a gerund and a progressive active participle is not easy; the line between the two non-finite verb forms is not clear.\n\nA present participle may function as an adjective modifying a noun, in which case it is known as a gerundive: \"The dancing girls\".\n\nThe past participles of strong verbs in Germanic languages are irregular (e.g. \"driven\"); their form is idiosyncratic. The past participles of weak verbs, in contrast, are regular; their form is formed with the suffix \"-ed\" (e.g. \"fixed\", \"supported\", \"opened\").\n\nPast participles are used in perfect and passive constructions:\n\nPast participles occur in a rare construction in English which may be compared with the ablative absolute construction in Latin:\n\nAs with present participles, past participles may function as adjectives: \"the burnt logs\".\n"}
{"id": "44410336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44410336", "title": "Evolution of snake venom", "text": "Evolution of snake venom\n\nVenom in snakes and some lizards is a form of saliva that has been modified into venom over its evolutionary history. In snakes, venom has evolved to kill or subdue prey, as well as to perform other diet-related functions. The evolution of venom is thought to be responsible for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe.\n\nThe evolutionary history of snake venom is a matter of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet.\n\nThe single-origin hypothesis suggests that the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits. Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages, proteins that pre-digest prey, and a method to track down prey after a bite. These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable debate about the definition of venom and venomous snakes.\n\nThe idea that venom had a single evolutionary origin has been called into question by a 2015 study, which found that venom proteins had homologs in many other tissues in the Burmese python. The study therefore suggested that venom had evolved independently in a number of snake lineages.\n\nThe origin of venom is thought to have provided the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the Cenozoic period, particularly to the Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes that are also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, calcium channel blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.\n\nUntil the use of gene sequencing to create phylogenetic trees became practical, phylogenies were created on the basis of morphology. Such traditional phylogenies suggested that venom originated in multiple branches among Squamata approximately 100 million years ago. More recent studies using nuclear gene sequences found the presence of similar venom proteins in several lizards within a clade that was named \"Toxicofera\". This led to the theory that venom originated only once within the entire lineage approximately 170 million years ago. This ancestral venom consisted of a very simple set of proteins, assembled in a pair of glands. The venoms of the different lineages then diversified and evolved independently, along with their means of injecting venom into prey. This diversification included the independent evolution of front-fanged venom delivery from the ancestral rear-fanged venom delivery system. The single origin hypothesis also suggests that venom systems subsequently atrophied, or were completely lost, independently in a number of lineages. The American “rat snakes,” such as \"Pantherophis guttatus\", lost their venom following the evolution of constriction as a means of prey capture. The independent evolution of constriction in the fish-eating aquatic genus \"Acrochordus\" also saw the degradation of the venom system. Two independent lineages, one terrestrial and one marine, that shifted to an egg-based diet, also possess the remnants of an atrophied venom system.\n\nThe view that venom evolved just once has recently been called into doubt. A study performed in 2014 found that homologs of 16 venom proteins, which had been used to support the single origin hypothesis, were all expressed at high levels in a number of body tissues. The authors therefore suggested that previous research, which had found venom proteins to be conserved across the supposed Toxicoferan lineage, might have misinterpreted the presence of more generic \"housekeeping\" genes across this lineage, as a result of only sampling certain tissues within the reptiles' bodies. Therefore, the authors suggested that instead of evolving just once in an ancestral reptile, snake venom evolved independently in a number of lineages. A 2015 study found that homologs of the so-called \"toxic\" genes were present in numerous tissues of a non-venomous snake, the Burmese python. Castoe stated that the team had found homologs to the venom genes in many tissues outside the oral glands, where venom genes might be expected. This demonstrated the weaknesses of only analyzing transcriptomes (the total messenger RNA in a cell). The team suggested that pythons represented a period in snake evolution before major venom development. The researchers also found that the expansion of venom gene families occurred mostly in highly venomous caenophidian snakes (also referred to as \"colubroidian snakes\"), thus suggesting that most venom evolution took place after this lineage diverged from other snakes.\n\nThe primary mechanism for the diversification of venom is thought to be the duplication of gene coding for other tissues, followed by their expression in the venom glands. The proteins then evolved into various venom proteins through natural selection. This process, known as the birth-and-death model, is responsible for several of the protein recruitment events in snake venom. These duplications occurred in a variety of tissue types with a number of ancestral functions. Notable examples include 3FTx, ancestrally a neurotransmitter found in the brain, which has adapted into a neurotoxin that binds and blocks acetylcholine receptors. Another example is phospholipase A2 (PLA2) type IIA, ancestrally involved with inflammatory processes in normal tissue, which has evolved into venom capable of triggering lipase activity and tissue destruction. The change in function of PLA2, in particular, has been well documented; there is evidence of several separate gene duplication events, often associated with the origin of new snake species. Non-allelic homologous recombination (or recombination between DNA sequences that are similar, but not alleles) has been proposed as the mechanism of duplication of PLA2 genes in rattlesnakes, as an explanation for its rapid evolution. These venom proteins have also occasionally been recruited back into tissue genes. Protein recruitment events have occurred at different points in the evolutionary history of snakes. For example, the 3FTX protein family is absent in the viperid lineage, suggesting that it was recruited into snake venom after the viperid snakes branched off from the remaining colubroidae.\n\nThere have been debates about whether the original gene duplication events occurred in a salivary gland or in body tissues themselves. The prevailing idea for many years is the birth-and-death model described above, in which genes in other body tissues are duplicated and then recruited to the venom gland before natural selection for toxicity. However, in 2014 a new model was proposed in which salivary protein genes are duplicated and then restricted to the venom gland. This model does away with the recruitment hypothesis and cites the homology between certain venom and body genes as unrelated in the linear fashion described in the traditional birth-and-death model.\n\nGene duplication is not the only way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake \"Bungarus fasciatus\", for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic \"Crotalus\" species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.\n\nSome traditional hypotheses of snake venom evolution have supported the idea that most snakes inject far more venom into their prey than is required to kill them; thus, venom composition would not be subject to natural selection. This is known as the \"overkill\" hypothesis. However, recent studies of the molecular history of snake venom have contradicted this, instead finding evidence of rapid adaptive evolution in many different clades, including the carpet vipers, \"Echis\", the ground rattlesnakes, \"Sistrurus\", and the Malayan pit viper, as well as generally in the diversification of PLA2 proteins. There is phylogenetic evidence of positive selection and rapid rates of gene gain and loss in venom genes of \"Sistrurus\" taxa feeding on different prey. Several studies have found evidence that venom and resistance to venom in prey species have evolved in a coevolutionary arms race. For example, wood rats of the genus \"Neotoma\" have a high degree of resistance to the venom of rattlesnakes, suggesting that the rats have evolved in response to the snake venom, thus renewing selection pressure upon the snakes. The selection pressure on snake venom is thought to be selecting for functional diversity within the proteins in venom, both within a given species, and across species. The genes that code for venom proteins in some snake genera have a proportion of synonymous mutations that is lower than would be expected if venom were evolving through neutral evolutionary processes. In addition, snake venom is metabolically costly for a snake to produce, which scientists have suggested as further evidence that a selection pressure exists on snake venom (in this case, to minimize the volume of venom required). The use of model organisms, rather than snakes' natural prey, to study prey toxicity, has been suggested as a reason why the \"overkill\" hypothesis may have been overemphasized. However, the pitviper genus \"Agkistrodon\" has been found to be an exception to this; the composition of venom in \"Agkistrodon\" has been found to be related to the position of the species within the phylogeny, suggesting that those venoms have evolved mostly through neutral processes (mutation and genetic drift), and that there may be significant variation in the selection pressure upon various snake venoms.\n\nSnakes use their venom to kill or subdue prey, as well as for other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current scientific theory suggests that snake venom is not used for defense or for competition between members of the same species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.\n\nVenom that is toxic only to a certain taxon, or strongly toxic only to a certain taxon, has been found in a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake \"Boiga dendrophila\", which has a venom specifically toxic to birds, as well as in the genera \"Echis\" and \"Sistrurus\", and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly toxic to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are toxic to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly toxic to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.\n\nThe natural diets of snakes in the widespread viper genus \"Echis\" are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, as well as vertebrates. Various \"Echis\" species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various \"Echis\" species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related to an increase in the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all \"Echis\" snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming \"Echis\" species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.\n\nA 2009 study of the venom of four \"Sistrurus\" pit viper species found significant variation in the toxicity to mice. This variation was related to the proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species. The idea that \"Sistrurus\" venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for the difference in toxicity was the difference in muscle physiology in the various prey animals. Two lineages of elapid snakes, common sea snakes and \"Laticauda\" sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on teleosts, or ray-finned fish. A 2005 study found that both these lineages have a much simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the Australian continent, which have a more varied and complex diet. These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of \"Toxicocalamus longissimus\", a terrestrial species, and \"Hydrophis cyanocinctus\", a marine species, both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the marine species had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins. The venoms of the sea snakes are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since sea snakes are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.\n\nThe various subspecies of the rattlesnake genus \"Crotalus\", produce venoms that carry out two conflicting functions. The venom immobilizes prey after a bite, and also helps digestion by breaking down tissues before the snake eats its prey. As with other members of the family Viperidae, the venoms of \"Crotalus\" disrupt the homeostatic processes of prey animals. However, there is a wide variety of venom compositions among the species of \"Crotalus\". A 2010 study found a 100-fold difference in the amount of metalloproteinase activity among the various snakes, with \"Crotalus cerberus\" having the highest activity and \"Crotalus oreganus concolor\" having the lowest. There was also a 15-fold variation in the amount of protease activity, with \"C. o. concolor\" and \"C. cerberus\" having the highest and lowest activities, respectively.\n\nMetalloproteinase activity causes hemorrhage and necrosis following a snake bite, a process which aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The study found that the venoms of \"Crotalus\" fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.\n\nAnother example of an adaptive function other than prey immobilization is the role of viperid venom in allowing the snake to track a prey animal it has bitten, a process known as \"prey relocalization.\" This important adaptation allowed rattlesnakes to evolve the strike-and-release bite mechanism, which provided a huge benefit to snakes by minimizing contact with potentially dangerous prey animals. However, this adaptation then requires the snake to track down the bitten animal in order to eat it, in an environment full of other animals of the same species. A 2013 study found that western diamondback rattlesnakes (\"Crotalus atrox\") responded more actively to mouse carcasses that had been injected with crude rattlesnake venom. When the various components of the venom were separated out, the snakes responded to mice injected with two kinds of disintegrins. The study concluded that these disintegrin proteins were responsible for allowing the snakes to track their prey, by changing the odor of the bitten animal.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom in a number of lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, \"Aipysurus eydouxii\" found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater \"Dasypeltis scabra\", whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.\n\nVenom atrophication has also occurred following the evolution of constriction as a method of prey capture that does not require venom. Constriction is hypothesized to have evolved independently in several lineages. North American ‘rat snakes’ such as the Corn snake \"Pantherophis guttatus\" use constriction to trap and kill their rodent prey, and do not possess functional venom. A similar process has occurred in the African colubrid lineage Lamprophiidae, such as \"Pseudaspis cana\", as well as in the genus \"Acrochordus\".\n\n"}
{"id": "55174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55174", "title": "Falun Gong", "text": "Falun Gong\n\nFalun Gong (, ) or Falun Dafa (; Standard Mandarin Chinese: ; literally, \"Dharma Wheel Practice\" or \"Law Wheel Practice\") is a Chinese spiritual practice that combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and (). The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions. Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\nFalun Gong was first taught publicly in Northeast China in 1992 by Li Hongzhi. It emerged toward the end of China's \"\"qigong\" boom\"—a period that saw a proliferation of similar practices of meditation, slow-moving energy exercises and regulated breathing. It differs from other \"qigong\" schools in its absence of fees or formal membership, lack of daily rituals of worship, its greater emphasis on morality, and the theological nature of its teachings. Western academics have described Falun Gong as a qigong discipline, a \"spiritual movement\", a \"cultivation system\" in the tradition of Chinese antiquity, or as a form of Chinese religion.\n\nThe practice initially enjoyed support from Chinese officialdom, but by the mid to late 1990s, the Communist Party and public security organizations increasingly viewed Falun Gong as a potential threat due to its size, independence from the state, and spiritual teachings. By 1999, government estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million. During that time, negative coverage of Falun Gong began to appear in the state-run press, and practitioners usually responded by picketing the source involved. Most of the time, the practitioners succeeded, but controversy and tension continued to build. The scale of protests grew until April 1999, when over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered near the central government compound in Beijing to request legal recognition and freedom from state interference. This demonstration is widely seen as catalyzing the persecution that followed.\n\nOn 20 July 1999, the Communist Party leadership initiated a nationwide crackdown and multifaceted propaganda campaign intended to eradicate the practice. It blocked Internet access to websites that mention Falun Gong, and in October 1999 it declared Falun Gong a \"heretical organization\" that threatened social stability. Falun Gong practitioners in China are reportedly subject to a wide range of human rights abuses: hundreds of thousands are estimated to have been imprisoned extrajudicially, and practitioners in detention are subject to forced labor, psychiatric abuse, torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities. As of 2009, human rights groups estimated that at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners had died as a result of abuse in custody. One observer reported that tens of thousands may have been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry (see Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China). In the years since the persecution began, Falun Gong practitioners have become active in advocating for greater human rights in China.\n\nFalun Gong founder Li Hongzhi has lived in the United States since 1996, and Falun Gong has a sizable global constituency. Inside China, estimates suggest that tens of millions continued to practice Falun Gong in spite of the persecution. Hundreds of thousands are estimated to practice Falun Gong outside China in over 70 countries worldwide.\n\nFalun Gong is most frequently identified with the qigong movement in China. \"Qigong\" is a modern term that refers to a variety of practices involving slow movement, meditation, and regulated breathing. Qigong-like exercises have historically been practiced by Buddhist monks, Daoist martial artists, and Confucian scholars as a means of spiritual, moral, and physical refinement. \nThe modern qigong movement emerged in the early 1950s, when Communist cadres embraced the techniques as a way to improve health. The new term was constructed to avoid association with religious practices, which were prone to being labeled as \"feudal superstition\" and persecuted during the Maoist era. Early adopters of qigong eschewed its religious overtones and regarded qigong principally as a branch of Chinese medicine. In the late 1970s, Chinese scientists purported to have discovered the material existence of the qi energy that qigong seeks to harness. In the spiritual vacuum of the post-Mao era, tens of millions of mostly urban and elderly Chinese citizens took up the practice of qigong, and a variety of charismatic qigong masters established practices. At one time, over 2,000 disciplines of qigong were being taught. The state-run China Qigong Science Research Society (CQRS) was established in 1985 to oversee and administer the movement.\n\nOn 13 May 1992, Li Hongzhi gave his first public seminar on Falun Gong (alternatively called Falun Dafa) in the northeastern city of Changchun. In his hagiographic spiritual biography, Li Hongzhi is said to have been taught ways of \"cultivation practice\" by several masters of the Buddhist and Daoist traditions, including Quan Jue, the 10th Heir to the Great Law of the Buddha School, and a master of the Great Way School with the Taoist alias of \"True Taoist\" from the Changbai Mountains. Falun Dafa is said to be the result of his reorganizing and writing down the teachings that were passed to him.\n\nLi presented Falun Gong as part of a \"centuries-old tradition of cultivation\", and in effect sought to revive the religious and spiritual elements of qigong practice that had been discarded in the earlier Communist era. David Palmer writes that Li \"redefined his method as having entirely different objectives from qigong: the purpose of practice should neither be physical health nor the development of extraordinary powers, but to purify one's heart and attain spiritual salvation.\"\n\nFalun Gong is distinct from other qigong schools in that its teachings cover a wide range of spiritual and metaphysical topics, placing emphasis on morality and virtue and elaborating a complete cosmology. The practice identifies with the Buddhist School (\"Fojia\") but also draws on concepts and language found in Taoism and Confucianism. This has led some scholars to label the practice as a syncretic faith.\n\nFalun Gong aspires to enable the practitioner to ascend spiritually through moral rectitude and the practice of a set of exercises and meditation. The three central tenets of the belief are Truthfulness (真, Zhēn), Compassion (善, Shàn), and Forbearance (忍, Rěn). Together these principles are regarded as the fundamental nature of the cosmos, the criteria for differentiating right from wrong, and are held to be the highest manifestations of the Tao, or Buddhist Dharma. Adherence to and cultivation of these virtues is regarded as a fundamental part of Falun Gong practice. In Zhuan Falun (转法轮), the foundational text published in 1995, Li Hongzhi writes \"It doesn't matter how mankind's moral standard changes ... The nature of the cosmos doesn't change, and it is the only standard for determining who's good and who's bad. So to be a cultivator you have to take the nature of the cosmos as your guide for improving yourself.\"\n\nPractice of Falun Gong consists of two features: performance of the exercises, and the refinement of one's \"xinxing\" (moral character, temperament). In Falun Gong's central text, Li states that xinxing \"includes virtue (which is a type of matter), it includes forbearance, it includes awakening to things, it includes giving up things—giving up all the desires and all the attachments that are found in an ordinary person—and you also have to endure hardship, to name just a few things.\" The elevation of one's moral character is achieved, on the one hand, by aligning one's life with truth, compassion, and tolerance; and on the other, by abandoning desires and \"negative thoughts and behaviors, such as greed, profit, lust, desire, killing, fighting, theft, robbery, deception, jealousy, etc.\"\n\nAmong the central concepts found in the teachings of Falun Gong is the existence of 'Virtue' ('德, \"Dé\") and 'Karma' ('業, \"Yè\"). The former is generated through doing good deeds and suffering, while the latter is accumulated through doing wrong deeds. A person's ratio of karma to virtue is said to determine his or her fortunes in this life or the next. While virtue engenders good fortune and enables spiritual transformation, an accumulation of karma results in suffering, illness, and alienation from the nature of the universe. Spiritual elevation is achieved through the elimination of negative karma and the accumulation of virtue. Practitioners believe that through a process of moral cultivation, one can achieve Tao and obtain special powers and a level of divinity.\n\nFalun Gong's teachings posit that human beings are originally and innately good—even divine—but that they descended into a realm of delusion and suffering after developing selfishness and accruing karma. The practice holds that reincarnation exists and that different people's reincarnation processes are overseen by different gods. To re-ascend and return to the \"original, true self,\" Falun Gong practitioners are supposed to assimilate themselves to the qualities of truthfulness, compassion and tolerance, let go of \"attachments and desires\" and suffer to repay karma. The ultimate goal of the practice is enlightenment or spiritual perfection (\"yuanman\"), and release from the cycle of reincarnation, known in Buddhist tradition as \"samsara\".\n\nTraditional Chinese cultural thought and modernity are two focuses of Li Hongzhi's teachings. Falun Gong echoes traditional Chinese beliefs that humans are connected to the universe through mind and body, and Li seeks to challenge \"conventional mentalities\", concerning the nature and genesis of the universe, time-space, and the human body. The practice draws on East Asian mysticism and traditional Chinese medicine, criticizes the purportedly self-imposed limits of modern science, especially evolution, and views traditional Chinese science as an entirely different, yet equally valid ontological system.\n\nIn addition to its moral philosophy, Falun Gong consists of four standing exercises and one sitting meditation. The exercises are regarded as secondary to moral elevation, though is still an essential component of Falun Gong cultivation practice.\n\nThe first exercises, called \"Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms\", are intended to facilitate the free flow of energy through the body and open up the meridians. The second exercise, \"Falun Standing Stance\", involves holding four static poses—each of which resembles holding a wheel—for an extended period. The objective of this exercise is to \"enhances wisdom, increases strength, raises a person's level, and strengthens divine powers\". The third, \"Penetrating the Cosmic Extremes\", involves three sets of movements, which aim to enable the expulsion of bad energy (e.g., pathogenic or black qi) and the absorption of good energy into the body. Through practice of this exercise, the practitioner aspires to cleanse and purify the body. The fourth exercise, \"Falun Cosmic Orbit\", seeks to circulate energy freely throughout the body. Unlike the first through fourth exercises, the fifth exercise is performed in the seated lotus position. Called \"Reinforcing Supernatural Powers\", it is a meditation intended to be maintained as long as possible.\n\nFalun Gong exercises can be practiced individually or in group settings, and can be performed for varying lengths of time in accordance with the needs and abilities of the individual practitioner. Porter writes that practitioners of Falun Gong are encouraged to read Falun Gong books and practice its exercises on a regular basis, preferably daily. Falun Gong exercises are practiced in group settings in parks, university campuses, and other public spaces in over 70 countries worldwide, and are taught for free by volunteers. In addition to five exercises, in 2001 another meditation activity was introduced called \"sending righteous thoughts,\" which is intended to reduce persecution on the spiritual plane.\n\nA pilot study involving genomic profiling of six Falun Dafa practitioners indicated that, \"changes in gene expression of [Falun Gong] practitioners in contrast to normal healthy controls were characterized by enhanced immunity, downregulation of cellular metabolism, and alteration of apoptotic genes in favor of a rapid resolution of inflammation.\"\n\nIn addition to the attainment of physical health, many Buddhist and Daoist meditation systems aspire to transform the physical body and cultivate a variety of supernatural capabilities (\"shentong\"), such as telepathy and divine sight. Discussions of supernatural skills also feature prominently within the qigong movement, and the existence of these skills gained a level mainstream acceptance in China’s scientific community in the 1980s. Falun Gong’s teachings hold that practitioners can acquire supernatural skills through a combination of moral cultivation, meditation and exercises. These include—but are not limited to—precognition, clairaudience, telepathy, and divine sight (via the opening of the third eye or celestial eye). However, Falun Gong stresses that these powers can be developed only as a result of moral practice, and should not be pursued or casually displayed. According to David Ownby, Falun Gong teaches that “Pride in one's abilities, or the desire to show off, are marks of dangerous attachments,” and Li warns his followers not to be distracted by the pursuit of such powers.\n\nFalun Gong differentiates itself from Buddhist monastic traditions in that it places great importance on participation in the secular world. Falun Gong practitioners are required to maintain regular jobs and family lives, to observe the laws of their respective governments, and are instructed not to distance themselves from society. An exception is made for Buddhist monks and nuns, who are permitted to continue a monastic lifestyle while practicing Falun Gong.\n\nAs part of its emphasis on ethical behavior, Falun Gong's teachings prescribe a strict personal morality for practitioners. They are expected to act truthfully, do good deeds, and conduct themselves with patience and forbearance when encountering difficulties. For instance, Li stipulates that a practitioner of Falun Gong must \"not hit back when attacked, not talk back when insulted.\" In addition, they must \"abandon negative thoughts and behaviors,\" such as greed, deception, jealousy, etc. The teachings contain injunctions against smoking and the consumption of alcohol, as these are considered addictions that are detrimental to health and mental clarity. Practitioners of Falun Gong are forbidden to kill living things—including animals for the purpose of obtaining food—though they are not required to adopt a vegetarian diet.\n\nIn addition to these things, practitioners of Falun Gong must abandon a variety of worldly attachments and desires. In the course of cultivation practice, the student of Falun Gong aims to relinquish the pursuit of fame, monetary gain, sentimentality, and other entanglements. Li's teachings repeatedly emphasize the emptiness of material pursuits; although practitioners of Falun Gong are not encouraged to leave their jobs or eschew money, they are expected to give up the psychological attachments to these things. Similarly, sexual desire and lust are treated as attachments to be discarded, but Falun Gong students are still generally expected to marry and have families. All sexual relations outside the confines of monogamous, heterosexual marriage are regarded as immoral. Although gays and lesbians may practice Falun Gong, homosexual conduct is said to generate karma, and is therefore viewed as incompatible with the goals of the practice.\n\nFalun Gong's cosmology includes the belief that different ethnicities each have a correspondence to their own heavens, and that individuals of mixed race lose some aspect of this connection. Nonetheless, Li maintains that being of mixed race does not affect a person's soul, nor hinder their ability to practice cultivation. The practice does not have any formal stance against interracial marriage, and many Falun Gong practitioners have interracial children.\n\nFalun Gong doctrine counsels against participation in political or social issues. Excessive interest in politics is viewed as an attachment to worldly power and influence, and Falun Gong aims for transcendence of such pursuits. According to Hu Ping, \"Falun Gong deals only with purifying the individual through exercise, and does not touch on social or national concerns. It has not suggested or even intimated a model for social change. Many religions ... pursue social reform to some extent ... but there is no such tendency evident in Falun Gong.\"\n\nThe first book of Falun Gong teachings was published in April 1993. Called \"China Falun Gong\", or simply \"Falun Gong\", it is an introductory text that discusses \"qigong\", Falun Gong's relationship to Buddhism, the principles of cultivation practice and the improvement of moral character (xinxing). The book also provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises and meditation.\n\nThe main body of teachings is articulated in the book \"Zhuan Falun\", published in Chinese in January 1995. The book is divided into nine \"lectures\", and was based on edited transcriptions of the talks Li gave throughout China in the preceding three years. Falun Gong texts have since been translated into an additional 40 languages. In addition to these central texts, Li has published several books, lectures, articles, books of poetry, which are made available on Falun Gong websites.\n\nThe Falun Gong teachings use numerous untranslated Chinese religious and philosophical terms, and make frequent allusion to characters and incidents in Chinese folk literature and concepts drawn from Chinese popular religion. This, coupled with the literal translation style of the texts, which imitate the colloquial style of Li's speeches, can make Falun Gong scriptures difficult to approach for Westerners.\n\nThe main symbol of the practice is the \"Falun\" (Dharma wheel, or \"Dharmacakra\" in Sanskrit). In Buddhism, the Dharmacakra represents the completeness of the doctrine. To \"turn the wheel of dharma\" (\"Zhuan Falun\") means to preach the Buddhist doctrine, and is the title of Falun Gong's main text. Despite the invocation of Buddhist language and symbols, the law wheel as understood in Falun Gong has distinct connotations, and is held to represent the universe. It is conceptualized by an emblem consisting of one large and four small (counter-clockwise) Swastika symbols, representing the Buddha, and four small Taiji (yin-yang) symbols of the Daoist tradition.\n\nLi situates his teaching of Falun Gong amidst the \"Dharma-ending period\" (\"Mo Fa\", 末法), described in Buddhist scriptures as an age of moral decline when the teachings of Buddhism would need to be rectified. The current era is described in Falun Gong's teachings as the \"Fa rectification\" period (\"zhengfa\", which might also be translated as \"to correct the dharma\"), a time of cosmic transition and renewal. The process of Fa rectification is necessitated by the moral decline and degeneration of life in the universe, and in the post-1999 context, the persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese government has come to be viewed as a tangible symptom of this moral decay. Through the process of the Fa rectification, life will be reordered according to the moral and spiritual quality of each, with good people being saved and ascending to higher spiritual planes, and bad ones being eliminated or cast down. In this paradigm, Li assumes the role of rectifying the Dharma by disseminating through his moral teachings.\n\nSome scholars, such as Maria Hsia Chang and Susan Palmer, have described Li's rhetoric about the \"Fa rectification\" and providing salvation \"in the final period of the Last Havoc\", as apocalyptic. However, Benjamin Penny argues that Li's teachings are better understood in the context of a \"Buddhist notion of the cycle of the Dharma or the Buddhist law\". Richard Gunde notes that unlike apocalyptic groups in the West, Falun Gong does not fixate on death or the end of the world, and instead \"has a simple, innocuous ethical message\". Li Hongzhi does not discuss a \"time of reckoning\", and has rejected predictions of an impending apocalypse in his teachings.\n\nFalun Gong is a multifaceted discipline that means different things to different people, ranging from a set of physical exercises for the attainment of better health and a praxis of self-transformation, to a moral philosophy and a new knowledge system. Scholars and journalists have adopted a variety of terms and classifications in describing Falun Gong, some of them more precise than others.\n\nIn the cultural context of China, Falun Gong is generally described either as a system of qigong, or a type of \"cultivation practice\" (\"xiulian\"). Cultivation is a Chinese term that describes the process by which an individual seeks spiritual perfection, often through both physical and moral conditioning. Varieties of cultivation practice are found throughout Chinese history, spanning Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian traditions. Benjamin Penny, a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University, writes \"the best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system. Cultivation systems have been a feature of Chinese life for at least 2,500 years.\" Qigong practices can also be understood as a part of a broader tradition of \"cultivation practice\".\n\nIn the West, Falun Gong is frequently classified as a religion on the basis of its theological and moral teachings, its concerns with spiritual cultivation and transformation, and its extensive body of scripture. Human rights groups report on the persecution of Falun Gong as a violation of religious freedom, and in 2001, Falun Gong was given an International Religious Freedom Award from Freedom House. Falun Gong practitioners themselves have sometimes disavowed this classification, however. This rejection reflects the relatively narrow definition of \"religion\" (\"zongjiao\") in contemporary China. According to David Ownby, religion in China has been defined since 1912 to refer to \"world-historical faiths\" that have \"well-developed institutions, clergy, and textual traditions\"—namely, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism. Falun Gong lacks these features, having no temples, rituals of worship, clergy or formal hierarchy. Moreover, if Falun Gong had described itself as a religion in China, it likely would have invited immediate suppression. These historical and cultural circumstances notwithstanding, the practice has often been described as a form of Chinese religion.\n\nAlthough it is often referred to as such in journalistic literature, Falun Gong does not satisfy the definition of a \"sect\" or \"cult.\" A sect is generally defined as a branch or denomination of an established belief system or mainstream church. Although Falun Gong draws on both Buddhist and Daoist ideas and terminology, it claims no direct relationship or lineage connection to these religions. Sociologists regard sects as exclusive groups that exist within clearly defined boundaries, with rigorous standards for admission and strict allegiances. However, as noted by Noah Porter, Falun Gong does not share these qualities: it does not have clearly defined boundaries, and anyone may practice it. Cheris Shun-ching Chan likewise writes that Falun Gong is \"categorically not a sect\": its practitioners do not sever ties with secular society, it is \"loosely structured with a ﬂuctuating membership and tolerant of other organizations and faiths,\" and it is more concerned with personal, rather than collective worship.\n\nAs a matter of doctrinal significance, Falun Gong is intended to be \"formless\", having little to no material or formal organization. Practitioners of Falun Gong cannot collect money or charge fees, conduct healings, or teach or interpret doctrine for others. There are no administrators or officials within the practice, no system of membership, and no churches or physical places of worship. In the absence of membership or initiation rituals, Falun Gong practitioners can be anyone who chooses to identify themselves as such. Students are free to participate in the practice and follow its teachings as much or as little as they like, and practitioners do not instruct others on what to believe or how to behave.\n\nSpiritual authority is vested exclusively in the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi. But organizationally Falun Gong is decentralized, and local branches and assistants are afforded no special privileges, authority, or titles. Volunteer \"assistants\" or \"contact persons\" do not hold authority over other practitioners, regardless of how long they have practiced Falun Gong. Li's spiritual authority within the practice is absolute, yet the organization of Falun Gong works against totalistic control, and Li does not intervene in the personal lives of practitioners. Falun Gong practitioners have little to no contact with Li, except through the study of his teachings. There is no hierarchy in Falun Gong to enforce orthodoxy, and little or no emphasis is given on dogmatic discipline; the only thing emphasized is the need for strict moral behavior, according to Craig Burgdoff, a professor of religious studies.\n\nTo the extent that organization is achieved in Falun Gong, it is accomplished through a global, networked, and largely virtual online community. In particular, electronic communications, email lists and a collection of websites are the primary means of coordinating activities and disseminating Li Hongzhi's teachings.\n\nOutside Mainland China, a network of volunteer 'contact persons', regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exist in approximately 80 countries. Li Hongzhi's teachings are principally spread through the Internet. In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read Li Hongzhi's writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours. Group study sessions typically take place in the evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as \"the closest thing to a regular 'congregational experience'\" that Falun Gong offers. Individuals who are too busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately. When there are expenses to be covered (such as for the rental of facilities for large-scale conferences), costs are borne by self-nominated and relatively affluent individual members of the community.\n\nIn 1993, the Beijing-based Falun Dafa Research Society was accepted as a branch of the state-run China Qigong Research Society (CQRS), which oversaw the administration of the country's various qigong schools, and sponsored activities and seminars. As per the requirements of the CQRS, Falun Gong was organized into a nationwide network of assistance centers, \"main stations\", \"branches\", \"guidance stations\", and local practice sites, mirroring the structure of the qigong society or even of the Communist Party itself. Falun Gong assistants were self-selecting volunteers who taught the exercises, organized events, and disseminated new writings from Li Hongzhi. The Falun Dafa Research Society provided advice to students on meditation techniques, translation services, and coordination for the practice nationwide.\n\nFollowing its departure from the CQRS in 1996, Falun Gong came under increased scrutiny from authorities and responded by adopting a more decentralized and loose organizational structure. In 1997, the Falun Dafa Research Society was formally dissolved, along with the regional \"main stations.\" Yet practitioners continued to organize themselves at local levels, being connected through electronic communications, interpersonal networks and group exercise sites. Both Falun Gong sources and Chinese government sources claimed that there were some 1,900 \"guidance stations\" and 28,263 local Falun Gong exercise sites nationwide by 1999, though they disagree over the extent of vertical coordination among these organizational units. In response to the persecution that began in 1999, Falun Gong was driven underground, the organizational structure grew yet more informal within China, and the internet took precedence as a means of connecting practitioners.\n\nFollowing the persecution of Falun Gong in 1999, Chinese authorities sought to portray Falun Gong as a hierarchical and well-funded organization. James Tong writes that it was in the government's interest to portray Falun Gong as highly organized in order to justify its repression of the group: \"The more organized the Falun Gong could be shown to be, then the more justified the regime's repression in the name of social order was.\" He concluded that Party's claims lacked \"both internal and external substantiating evidence\", and that despite the arrests and scrutiny, the authorities never \"credibly countered Falun Gong rebuttals\".\n\nPrior to July 1999, official estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million nationwide, rivaling membership in the Communist Party. By the time of the persecution on 22 July 1999, most Chinese government numbers said the population of Falun Gong was between 2 and 3 million, though some publications maintained an estimate of 40 million. Most Falun Gong estimates in the same period placed the total number of practitioners in China at 70 to 80 million. Other sources have estimated the Falun Gong population in China to have peaked between 10 and 70 million practitioners. The number of Falun Gong practitioners still practicing in China today is difficult to confirm, though some sources estimate that tens of millions continue to practice privately.\n\nDemographic surveys conducted in China in 1998 found a population that was mostly female and elderly. Of 34,351 Falun Gong practitioners surveyed, 27% were male and 73% female. Only 38% were under 50 years old. Falun Gong attracted a range of other individuals, from young college students to bureaucrats, intellectuals and Party officials. Surveys in China from the 1990s found that between 23–40% of practitioners held university degrees at the college or graduate level—several times higher than the general population.\n\nFalun Gong is practiced by tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands outside China, with the largest communities found in Taiwan and North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York and Toronto. Demographic surveys by Palmer and Ownby in these communities found that 90% of practitioners are ethnic Chinese. The average age was approximately 40. Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master's degrees, and 24% had a bachelor's degree.\n\nThe most commonly reported reasons for being attracted to Falun Gong were intellectual content, cultivation exercises, and health benefits. Non-Chinese Falun Gong practitioners tend to fit the profile of \"spiritual seekers\"—people who had tried a variety of qigong, yoga, or religious practices before finding Falun Gong. According to Richard Madsen, Chinese scientists with doctorates from prestigious American universities who practice Falun Gong claim that modern physics (for example, superstring theory) and biology (specifically the pineal gland's function) provide a scientific basis for their beliefs. From their point of view, \"Falun Dafa is knowledge rather than religion, a new form of science rather than faith\".\n\nLi Hongzhi introduced Falun Gong to the public on 13 May 1992, in Changchun, Jilin Province. Several months later, in September 1992, Falun Gong was admitted as a branch of qigong under the administration of the state-run China Qigong Scientific Research Society (CQRS). Li was recognized as a qigong master, and was authorized to teach his practice nationwide. Like many \"qigong\" masters at the time, Li toured major cities in China from 1992 to 1994 to teach the practice. He was granted a number of awards by PRC governmental organizations.\n\nAccording to David Ownby, Professor of History and Director of the Center for East Asian Studies at the Université de Montréal, Li became an \"instant star of the qigong movement\", and Falun Gong was embraced by the government as an effective means of lowering health care costs, promoting Chinese culture, and improving public morality. In December 1992, for instance, Li and several Falun Gong students participated in the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, where he reportedly \"received the most praise [of any qigong school] at the fair, and achieved very good therapeutic results\", according to the fair's organizer. The event helped cement Li's popularity, and journalistic reports of Falun Gong's healing powers spread. In 1993, a publication of the Ministry of Public Security praised Li for \"promoting the traditional crime-fighting virtues of the Chinese people, in safeguarding social order and security, and in promoting rectitude in society.\"\n\nFalun Gong had differentiated itself from other \"qigong\" groups in its emphasis on morality, low cost, and health benefits. It rapidly spread via word-of-mouth, attracting a wide range of practitioners from all walks of life, including numerous members of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994, Li did charge fees for the seminars he was giving across China, though the fees were considerably lower than those of competing qigong practices, and the local qigong associations received a substantial share. Li justified the fees as being necessary to cover travel costs and other expenses, and on some occasions, he donated the money earned to charitable causes. In 1994, Li ceased charging fees altogether, thereafter stipulating that Falun Gong must always be taught for free, and its teachings made available without charge (including online). Although some observers believe Li continued to earn substantial income through the sale of Falun Gong books, others dispute this, noting that most Falun Gong books in circulation were bootleg copies.\nWith the publication of the books \"Falun Gong\" and \"Zhuan Falun\", Li made his teachings more widely accessible. \"Zhuan Falun\", published in January 1995 at an unveiling ceremony held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Public Security, became a best-seller in China.\n\nIn 1995, Chinese authorities began looking to Falun Gong to solidify its organizational structure and ties to the party-state. Li was approached by the Chinese National Sports Committee, Ministry of Public Health, and China Qigong Science Research Association (CQRS) to jointly establish a Falun Gong association. Li declined the offer. The same year, the CQRS issued a new regulation mandating that all qigong denominations establish a Communist Party branch. Li again refused.\n\nTensions continued to mount between Li and the CQRS in 1996. In the face of Falun Gong's rise in popularity—a large part of which was attributed to its low cost—competing \"qigong\" masters accused Li of undercutting them. According to Schechter, the \"qigong\" society under which Li and other \"qigong\" masters belonged asked Li to hike his tuition, but Li emphasized the need for the teachings to be free of charge.\n\nIn March 1996, in response to mounting disagreements, Falun Gong withdrew from the CQRS, after which time it operated outside the official sanction of the state. Falun Gong representatives attempted to register with other government entities, but were rebuffed. Li and Falun Gong were then outside the circuit of personal relations and financial exchanges through which masters and their \"qigong\" organizations could find a place within the state system, and also the protections this afforded.\n\nFalun Gong's departure from the state-run CQRS corresponded to a wider shift in the government's attitudes towards qigong practices. As qigong's detractors in government grew more influential, authorities began attempting to rein in the growth and influence of these groups, some of which had amassed tens of millions of followers. In the mid-1990s the state-run media began publishing articles critical of qigong.\n\nFalun Gong was initially shielded from the mounting criticism, but following its withdrawal from the CQRS in March 1996, it lost this protection. On 17 June 1996, the \"Guangming Daily\", an influential state-run newspaper, published a polemic against Falun Gong in which its central text, \"Zhuan Falun\", was described as an example of \"feudal superstition.\" The author wrote that the history of humanity is a \"struggle between science and superstition,\" and called on Chinese publishers not to print \"pseudo-scientific books of the swindlers.\" The article was followed by at least twenty more in newspapers nationwide. Soon after, on 24 July, the Central Propaganda Department banned all publication of Falun Gong books (though the ban was not consistently enforced). The state-administered Buddhist Association of China also began issuing criticisms of Falun Gong, urging lay Buddhists not to take up the practice.\n\nThe events were an important challenge to Falun Gong, and one that practitioners did not take lightly. Thousands of Falun Gong followers wrote to \"Guangming Daily\" and to the CQRS to complain against the measures, claiming that they violated Hu Yaobang's 1982 'Triple No' directive, which prohibited the media from either encouraging or criticizing qigong practices. In other instances, Falun Gong practitioners staged peaceful demonstrations outside media or local government offices to request retractions of perceived unfair coverage.\n\nThe polemics against Falun Gong were part of a larger movement opposing qigong organizations in the state-run media. Although Falun Gong was not the only target of the media criticism, nor the only group to protest, theirs was the most mobilized and steadfast response. Many of Falun Gong's protests against negative media portrayals were successful, resulting in the retraction of several newspaper stories critical of the practice. This contributed to practitioners' belief that the media claims against them were false or exaggerated, and that their stance was justified.\n\nIn June 1998, He Zuoxiu, an outspoken critic of qigong and a fierce defender of Marxism, appeared on a talk show on Beijing Television and openly disparaged \"qigong\" groups, making particular mention of Falun Gong. Falun Gong practitioners responded with peaceful protests and by lobbying the station for a retraction. The reporter responsible for the program was reportedly fired, and a program favorable to Falun Gong was aired several days later. Falun Gong practitioners also mounted demonstrations at 14 other media outlets.\n\nIn 1997, The Ministry of Public Security launched an investigation into whether Falun Gong should be deemed xie jiao (邪教, \"heretical teaching\"). The report concluded that \"no evidence has appeared thus far\". The following year, however, on 21 July 1998, the Ministry of Public Security issued Document No. 555, \"Notice of the Investigation of Falun Gong\". The document asserted that Falun Gong is a \"heretical teaching\", and mandated that another investigation be launched to seek evidence in support of the conclusion. Falun Gong practitioners reported having phone lines tapped, homes ransacked and raided, and Falun Gong exercise sites disrupted by public security agents.\nIn this time period, even as criticism of qigong and Falun Gong mounted in some circles, the practice maintained a number of high-profile supporters in the government. In 1998, Qiao Shi, the recently retired Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, initiated his own investigation into Falun Gong. After months of investigations, his group concluded that \"Falun Gong has hundreds of benefits for the Chinese people and China, and does not have one single bad effect.\" In May of the same year, China's National Sports Commission launched its own survey of Falun Gong. Based on interviews with over 12,000 Falun Gong practitioners in Guangdong province, they stated that they were \"convinced the exercises and effects of Falun Gong are excellent. It has done an extraordinary amount to improve society's stability and ethics.\"\n\nThe practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, was largely absent from the country during the period of rising tensions with the government. In March 1995, Li had left China to first teach his practice in France and then other countries, and in 1998 obtained permanent residency in the United States.\n\nBy 1999, estimates provided by the State Sports Commission suggested there were 70 million Falun Gong practitioners in China. An anonymous employee of China's National Sports Commission, was at this time quoted in an interview with U.S. News & World Report as speculating that if 100 million had taken up Falun Gong and other forms of qigong there would be a dramatic reduction of health care costs and that \"Premier Zhu Rongji is very happy about that.\"\n\nBy the late 1990s, the Communist Party's relationship to the growing Falun Gong movement had become increasingly tense. Reports of discrimination and surveillance by the Public Security Bureau were escalating, and Falun Gong practitioners were routinely organizing sit-in demonstrations responding to media articles they deemed to be unfair. The conflicting investigations launched by the Ministry of the Public Security on one side and the State Sports Commission and Qiao Shi on the other spoke of the disagreements among China's elites on how to regard the growing practice.\n\nIn April 1999, an article critical of Falun Gong was published in Tianjin Normal University's \"Youth Reader\" magazine. The article was authored by physicist He Zuoxiu who, as Porter and Gutmann note, is a relative of Politburo member and public security secretary Luo Gan. The article cast qigong, and Falun Gong in particular, as superstitious and harmful for youth. Falun Gong practitioners responded by picketing the offices of the newspaper requesting a retraction of the article. Unlike past instances in which Falun Gong protests were successful, on 22 April the Tianjin demonstration was broken up by the arrival of three hundred riot police. Some of the practitioners were beaten, and forty-five arrested. Other Falun Gong practitioners were told that if they wished to appeal further, they needed to take the issue up with the Ministry of Public Security and go to Beijing to appeal.\nThe Falun Gong community quickly mobilized a response, and on the morning of 25 April, upwards of 10,000 practitioners gathered near the central appeals office to demand an end to the escalating harassment against the movement, and request the release of the Tianjin practitioners. According to Benjamin Penny, practitioners sought redress from the leadership of the country by going to them and, \"albeit very quietly and politely, making it clear that they would not be treated so shabbily.\" Journalist Ethan Gutmann wrote that security officers had been expecting them, and corralled the practitioners onto Fuyou Street in front of Zhongnanhai government compound. They sat or read quietly on the sidewalks surrounding the Zhongnanhai.\n\nFive Falun Gong representatives met with Premier Zhu Rongji and other senior officials to negotiate a resolution. The Falun Gong representatives were assured that the regime supported physical exercises for health improvements and did not consider the Falun Gong to be anti-government. Upon reaching this resolution, the crowd of Falun Gong protesters dispersed.\n\nParty General Secretary Jiang Zemin was alerted to the demonstration by CPC Politburo member Luo Gan, and was reportedly angered by the audacity of the demonstration—the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests ten years earlier. Jiang called for resolute action to suppress the group, and reportedly criticized Premier Zhu for being \"too soft\" in his handling of the situation. That evening, Jiang composed a letter indicating his desire to see Falun Gong \"defeated\". In the letter, Jiang expressed concerns over the size and popularity of Falun Gong, and in particular about the large number of senior Communist Party members found among Falun Gong practitioners. He noted the possibility of foreign forces behind Falun Gong's protests (the practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, had emigrated to the United States), and expressed concern about their use of the internet to coordinate a large-scale demonstration. Jiang also intimated that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was at odds with the atheist values of Marxist–Leninism, and therefore constituted a form of ideological competition.\n\nJiang is held by Falun Gong to be personally responsible for this decision to persecute Falun Gong. Peerman cited reasons such as suspected personal jealousy of Li Hongzhi; Saich points to Jiang's anger at Falun Gong's widespread appeal, and ideological struggle as causes for the crackdown that followed. Willy Wo-Lap Lam suggests Jiang's decision to suppress Falun Gong was related to a desire to consolidate his power within the Politburo. According to Human Rights Watch, Communist Party leaders and ruling elite were far from unified in their support for the crackdown.\n\nOn 20 July 1999, security forces abducted and detained thousands of Falun Gong practitioners that they identified as leaders. Two days later, on 22 July, the PRC Ministry of Civil Affairs outlawed the Falun Dafa Research Society as an illegal organization \"engaged in illegal activities, advocating superstition and spreading fallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability\". The same day, the Ministry of Public Security issued a circular forbidding citizens from practicing Falun Gong in groups, possessing Falun Gong's teachings, displaying Falun Gong banners or symbols, or protesting the ban.\n\nThe ensuing campaign aimed to \"eradicate\" the group through a combination of propaganda, imprisonment, and coercive thought reform of practitioners, sometimes resulting in deaths. In October 1999, four months after the ban, legislation was created to outlaw \"heterodox religions\" and sentence Falun Gong devotees to prison terms.\nHundreds of thousands are estimated to have been imprisoned extrajudicially, and practitioners in detention are reportedly subjected to forced labor, psychiatric abuse, torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities. The U.S. Department of State and Congressional-Executive Commission on China cite estimates that as much as half of China's reeducation-through-labor camp population is made up of Falun Gong practitioners. Researcher Ethan Gutmann estimates that Falun Gong represents an average of 15 to 20 percent of the total \"laogai\" population, which includes reeducation through labor camps as well as prisons and other forms of administrative detention. Former detainees of the labor camp system have reported that Falun Gong practitioners are one of the largest groups of prisoners; in some labor camp and prison facilities, they comprise the majority of detainees, and are often said to receive the longest sentences and the worst treatment. A 2013 report by Amnesty International on labor reeducation camps found that Falun Gong practitioners \"constituted on average from one third to in some cases 100 per cent of the total population\" of certain camps.\n\nAccording to Johnson, the campaign against Falun Gong extends to many aspects of society, including the media apparatus, police force, military, education system, and workplaces. An extra-constitutional body, the \"610 Office\" was created to \"oversee\" the effort. Human Rights Watch (2002) noted that families and workplaces were urged to cooperate with the government.\n\nForeign observers have attempted to explain the Party's rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming from a variety of factors. These include Falun Gong's popularity, China's history of quasi-religious movements that turned into violent insurrections, its independence from the state and refusal to toe the party line, internal power politics within the Communist Party—and Falun Gong's moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with aspects of the official Marxist ideology.\nXinhua News Agency, the official news organization of the Communist Party, declared that Falun Gong is \"opposed to the Communist Party of China and the central government, preaches idealism, theism and feudal superstition.\" Xinhua also asserted that \"the so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve\", and argued that it was necessary to crush Falun Gong to preserve the \"vanguard role and purity\" of the Communist Party. Other articles appearing in the state-run media in the first days and weeks of the ban posited that Falun Gong must be defeated because its \"theistic\" philosophy was at odds with the Marxist–Leninism paradigm and with the secular values of materialism.\n\nWilly Wo-Lap Lam writes that Jiang Zemin's campaign against Falun Gong may have been used to promote allegiance to himself; Lam quotes one party veteran as saying \"by unleashing a Mao-style movement [against Falun Gong], Jiang is forcing senior cadres to pledge allegiance to his line.\" \"The Washington Post\" reported that sources indicated not all of the standing committee of the Politburo shared Jiang's view that Falun Gong should be eradicated, but James Tong suggests there was not substantial resistance from the Politburo.\n\nHuman Rights Watch notes that the crackdown on Falun Gong reflects historical efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to eradicate religion, which the government believes is inherently subversive. The Chinese government protects five \"patriotic\", Communist Party-sanctioned religious groups. Unregistered religions that fall outside the state-sanctioned organizations are thus vulnerable to suppression. \"The Globe and Mail\" wrote : \"... any group that does not come under the control of the Party is a threat\". Craig S. Smith of \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote that the party feels increasingly threatened by any belief system that challenges its ideology and has an ability to organize itself. That Falun Gong, whose belief system represented a revival of traditional Chinese religion, was being practiced by a large number of Communist Party members and members of the military was seen as particularly disturbing to Jiang Zemin; according to Julia Ching, \"Jiang accepts the threat of Falun Gong as an ideological one: spiritual beliefs against militant atheism and historical materialism. He [wished] to purge the government and the military of such beliefs.\"\nYuezhi Zhao points to several other factors that may have led to a deterioration of the relationship between Falun Gong and the Chinese state and media. These included infighting within China's qigong establishment, the influence of qigong opponents among Communist Party leaders, and the struggles from mid-1996 to mid-1999 between Falun Gong and the Chinese power elite over the status and treatment of the movement. According to Zhao, Falun Gong practitioners have established a \"resistance identity\"—one that stands against prevailing pursuits of wealth, power, scientific rationality, and \"the entire value system associated with China's project of modernization.\" In China the practice represented an indigenous spiritual and moral tradition, a cultural revitalization movement, and drew a sharp contrast to \"Marxism with Chinese characteristics\".\n\nVivienne Shue similarly writes that Falun Gong presented a comprehensive challenge to the Communist Party's legitimacy. Shue argues that Chinese rulers historically have derived their legitimacy from a claim to possess an exclusive connection to the \"Truth\". In imperial China, truth was based on a Confucian and Daoist cosmology, where in the case of the Communist Party, the truth is represented by Marxist–Leninism and historical materialism. Falun Gong challenged the Marxist–Leninism paradigm, reviving an understanding based on more traditionally Buddhist or Daoist conceptions. David Ownby contends that Falun Gong also challenged the Communist Party's hegemony over Chinese nationalist discourse: \"[Falun Gong's] evocation of a different vision of Chinese tradition and its contemporary value is now so threatening to the state and party because it denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chinese nationalism, and perhaps of Chineseness.\"\n\nMaria Chang noted that since the overthrow of the Qin Dynasty, \"Millenarian movements had exerted a profound impact on the course of Chinese history,\" cumulating in the Chinese Revolutions of 1949, which brought the Chinese Communists to power. Patsy Rahn (2002) describes a paradigm of conflict between Chinese sectarian groups and the rulers they often challenge. According to Rahn, the history of this paradigm goes back to the collapse of the Han dynasty: \"The pattern of ruling power keeping a watchful eye on sectarian groups, at times threatened by them, at times raising campaigns against them, began as early as the second century and continued throughout the dynastic period, through the Mao era and into the present.\"\n\nAccording to James Tong, the regime aimed at both coercive dissolution of the Falun Gong denomination and \"transformation\" of the practitioners. By 2000, the Party upped its campaign by sentencing \"recidivist\" practitioners to \"re-education through labor\", in an effort to have them renounce their beliefs and \"transform\" their thoughts. Terms were also arbitrarily extended by police, while some practitioners had ambiguous charges levied against them, such as \"disrupting social order\", \"endangering national security\", or \"subverting the socialist system\". According to Bejesky, the majority of long-term Falun Gong detainees are processed administratively through this system instead of the criminal justice system. Upon completion of their re-education sentences, those practitioners who refused to recant were then incarcerated in \"legal education centers\" set up by provincial authorities to \"transform minds\".\n\nMuch of the conversion program relied on Mao-style techniques of indoctrination and thought reform, where Falun Gong practitioners were organized to view anti-Falun Gong television programs and enroll in Marxism and materialism study sessions. Traditional Marxism and materialism were the core content of the sessions.\nThe government-sponsored image of the conversion process emphasizes psychological persuasion and a variety of \"soft-sell\" techniques; this is the \"ideal norm\" in regime reports, according to Tong. Falun Gong reports, on the other hand, depict \"disturbing and sinister\" forms of coercion against practitioners who fail to renounce their beliefs. 14,474 cases are classified by different methods of torture, according to Tong (Falun Gong agencies document over 63,000 individual cases of torture). Among them are cases of severe beatings; psychological torment, corporal punishment and forced intense, heavy-burden hard labor and stress positions; solitary confinement in squalid conditions; \"heat treatment\" including burning and freezing; electric shocks delivered to sensitive parts of the body that may result in nausea, convulsions, or fainting; \"devastative\" forced feeding; sticking bamboo strips into fingernails; deprivation of food, sleep, and use of toilet; rape and gang rape; asphyxiation; and threat, extortion, and termination of employment and student status.\n\nThe cases appear verifiable, and the great majority identify (1) the individual practitioner, often with age, occupation, and residence; (2) the time and location that the alleged abuse took place, down to the level of the district, township, village, and often the specific jail institution; and (3) the names and ranks of the alleged perpetrators. Many such reports include lists of the names of witnesses and descriptions of injuries, Tong says. The publication of \"persistent abusive, often brutal behavior by named individuals with their official title, place, and time of torture\" suggests that there is no official will to cease and desist such activities.\n\nDue to the difficulty in corroborating reports of torture deaths in China, estimates on the number of Falun Gong practitioners killed under persecution vary widely. In 2009, the New York Times reported that, according to human rights groups, the repressions had claimed \"at least 2,000\" lives.\nAmnesty International said at least 100 Falun Gong practitioners had reportedly died in the 2008 calendar year, either in custody or shortly after their release. Falun Gong sources have documented over 3,700 deaths. Investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann estimated 65,000 Falun Gong were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008 based on extensive interviews, while researchers David Kilgour and David Matas reported, \"the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained\".\n\nChinese authorities do not publish statistics on Falun Gong practitioners killed amidst the crackdown. In individual cases, however, authorities have denied that deaths in custody were due to torture.\n\nIn 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry. These allegations prompted an investigation by former Canadian Secretary of State David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas.\n\nThe Kilgour-Matas report was published in July 2006, and concluded that \"the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centers and 'people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience.\" The report, which was based mainly on circumstantial evidence, called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—noting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. It also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponding with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year. Kilgour and Matas also presented self-accusatory material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors, and transcripts of interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs.\nIn May 2008 two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated requests for the Chinese authorities to respond to the allegations, and to explain a source for the organs that would account for the sudden increase in organ transplants in China since 2000. Chinese officials have responded by denying the organ harvesting allegations, and insisting that China abides by World Health Organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors. Responding to a U.S. House of Representatives Resolution calling for an end to abusing transplant practices against religious and ethnic minorities, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said \"the so-called organ harvesting from death-row prisoners is totally a lie fabricated by Falun Gong.\" In August 2009, Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, said, \"The Chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent ... It remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in Chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999, while there are never that many voluntary donors available.\"\n\nIn 2014, investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann published the result of his own investigation. Gutmann conducted extensive interviews with former detainees in Chinese labor camps and prisons, as well as former security officers and medical professionals with knowledge of China's transplant practices. He reported that organ harvesting from political prisoners likely began in Xinjiang province in the 1990s, and then spread nationwide. Gutmann estimates that some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008.\n\nIn a 2016 report, David Kilgour found that he had underestimated. In the new report he found that the government's official estimates for the volume of organs harvested since the persecution of Falun Gong began to be 150,000 to 200,000. Media outlets have extrapolated from this study a death toll of 1,500,000. Ethan Gutmann estimated from this update that 60,000 to 110,000 organs are harvested in China annually noting it is (paraphrasing): \"difficult but plausible to harvest 3 organs from a single body\" and also calls the harvest \"a new form of genocide using the most respected members of society.\"\n\nThe Chinese government's campaign against Falun Gong was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspapers, radio and internet. \nWithin the first month of the crackdown, 300–400 articles attacking Falun Gong appeared in each of the main state-run papers, while primetime television replayed alleged exposés on the group, with no divergent views aired in the media. The propaganda campaign focused on allegations that Falun Gong jeopardized social stability, was deceiving and dangerous, was \"anti-science\" and threatened progress, and argued that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was incompatible with a Marxist social ethic.\n\nChina scholars Daniel Wright and Joseph Fewsmith asserted that for several months after Falun Gong was outlawed, China Central Television's evening news contained little but anti-Falun Gong rhetoric; the government operation was \"a study in all-out demonization\", they wrote. Falun Gong was compared to \"a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts out to squash\" by \"Beijing Daily\"; other officials said it would be a \"long-term, complex and serious\" struggle to \"eradicate\" Falun Gong.\n\nState propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in \"complete opposition to science\" and communism. For example, the \"People's Daily\" asserted on 27 July 1999, that the fight against Falun Gong \"was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism.\" Other editorials declared that Falun Gong's \"idealism and theism\" are \"absolutely contradictory to the\nfundamental theories and principles of Marxism,\" and that the \"'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve.\" Suppressing Falun Gong was presented as a necessary step to maintaining the \"vanguard role\" of the Communist Party in Chinese society.\n\nDespite Party efforts, initial charges leveled against Falun Gong failed to elicit widespread popular support for the persecution of the group. In the months following July 1999, the rhetoric in the state-run press escalated to include charges that Falun Gong was colluding with foreign, \"anti-China\" forces. In October 1999, three months after the persecution began, the People Daily newspaper claimed Falun Gong as a \"xiejiao\". A direct translation of that term is \"heretical teaching\", but during the anti-Falun Gong propaganda campaign was rendered as \"evil cult\" in English. In the context of imperial China, the term \"xiejiao\" was used to refer to non-Confucian religions, though in the context of Communist China, it has been used to target religious organizations that do not submit to Communist Party authority.\n\nIan Johnson argued that applying the 'cult' label to Falun Gong effectively \"cloaked the government's crackdown with the legitimacy of the West's anticult movement.\" He notes, however, that Falun Gong does not satisfy common definitions of a cult: \"its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs, do not live isolated from society, do not believe that the world's end is imminent and do not give significant amounts of money to the organisation ... it does not advocate violence and is at heart an apolitical, inward-oriented discipline, one aimed at cleansing oneself spiritually and improving one's health.\" David Ownby similarly wrote that \"the entire issue of the supposed cultic nature of Falun Gong was a red herring from the beginning, cleverly exploited by the Chinese state to blunt the appeal of Falun Gong.\". According to John Powers and Meg Y. M. Lee, because the Falun Gong was categorized in the popular perception as an \"apolitical, qigong exercise club,\" it was not seen as a threat to the government. The most critical strategy in the Falun Gong suppression campaign, therefore, was to convince people to reclassify the Falun Gong into a number of \"negatively charged religious labels\", like \"evil cult\", \"sect\", or \"superstition\". The group's silent protests were reclassified as creating \"social disturbances\". In this process of relabelling, the government was attempting to tap into a \"deep reservoir of negative feelings related to the historical role of quasi-religious cults as a destabilising force in Chinese political history.\"\n\nA turning point in the propaganda campaign came on the eve of Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001, when five people attempted to set themselves ablaze on Tiananmen Square. The official Chinese press agency, Xinhua News Agency, and other state media asserted that the self-immolators were practitioners, though the Falun Dafa Information Center disputed this, on the grounds that the movement's teachings explicitly forbid suicide and killing, further alleging that the event was \"a cruel (but clever) piece of stunt-work.\" The incident received international news coverage, and video footage of the burnings were broadcast later inside China by China Central Television (CCTV). The broadcasts showed images of a 12-year-old girl, Liu Siying, burning, and interviews with the other participants in which they stated a belief that self-immolation would lead them to paradise. But one of the CNN producers on the scene did not even see a child there. Falun Gong sources and other commentators pointed out that the main participants' account of the incident and other aspects of the participants' behavior were inconsistent with the teachings of Falun Dafa. Media Channel and the International Education Development (IED) agree that the supposed self-immolation incident was staged by CCP to \"prove\" that Falun Gong brainwashes its followers to commit suicide and has therefore to be banned as a threat to the nation. IED's statement at the 53rd UN session describes China's violent assault on Falun Gong practitioners as state terrorism and that the self-immolation \"was staged by the government.\" \"Washington Post\" journalist Phillip Pan wrote that the two self-immolators who died were not actually Falun Gong practitioners. On March 21, 2001, Liu Siying suddenly died after appearing very lively and being deemed ready to leave the hospital to go home. \"Time\" reported that prior to the self-immolation incident, many Chinese had felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat, and that the state's crackdown had gone too far. After the event, however, the mainland Chinese media campaign against Falun Gong gained significant traction. As public sympathy for Falun Gong declined, the government began sanctioning \"systematic use of violence\" against the group.\n\nIn February, 2001, the month following the Tiananmen Square incident, Jiang Zemin convened a rare Central Work Conference to stress the importance of continuity in the anti-Falun Gong campaign and unite senior party officials behind the effort. Under Jiang's leadership, the crackdown on Falun Gong became part of the Chinese political ethos of \"upholding stability\" – much the same rhetoric employed by the party during Tiananmen in 1989. Jiang's message was echoed at the 2001 National People's Congress, where the Falun Gong's eradication was tied to China's economic progress. Though less prominent on the national agenda, the persecution of Falun Gong has carried on after Jiang was retired; successive, high-level \"strike hard\" campaigns against Falun Gong were initiated in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a three-year campaign was launched to renew attempts at the coercive \"transformation\" of Falun Gong practitioners.\n\nAnti-Falun Gong propaganda efforts have also permeated the Chinese education system. Following Jiang Zemin's 1999 ban of Falun Gong, then-Minister of Education Chen Zhili launched an active campaign to promote the Party's line on Falun Gong within all levels of academic institutions, including graduate schools, universities and colleges, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. Her efforts included a \"Cultural Revolution-like pledge\" in Chinese schools that required faculty members, staff, and students to publicly denounce Falun Gong. Teachers who did not comply with Chen's program were dismissed or detained; uncooperative students were refused academic advancement, expelled from school, or sent to \"transformation\" camps to alter their thinking. Chen also worked to spread the anti-Falun Gong academic propaganda movement overseas, using domestic educational funding to donate aid to foreign institutions, encouraging them to oppose Falun Gong.\n\nFalun Gong's response to the persecution in China began in July 1999 with appeals to local, provincial, and central petitioning offices in Beijing. It soon progressed to larger demonstrations, with hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveling daily to Tiananmen Square to perform Falun Gong exercises or raise banners in defense of the practice. These demonstrations were invariably broken up by security forces, and the practitioners involved were arrested—sometimes violently—and detained. By 25 April 2000, a total of more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested on the square; seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the square on 1 January 2001. Public protests continued well into 2001. Writing for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Ian Johnson wrote that \"Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule.\"\n\nBy late 2001, demonstrations in Tiananmen Square had become less frequent, and the practice was driven deeper underground. As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground \"material sites,\" which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media. Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door. Falun Gong sources estimated in 2009 that over 200,000 such sites exist across China today. The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong practitioners.\n\nIn 2002, Falun Gong activists in China tapped into television broadcasts, replacing regular state-run programming with their own content. One of the more notable instances occurred in March 2002, when Falun Gong practitioners in Changchun intercepted eight cable television networks in Jilin Province, and for nearly an hour, televised a program titled \"Self-Immolation or a Staged Act?\". All six of the Falun Gong practitioners involved were captured over the next few months. Two were killed immediately, while the other four were all dead by 2010 as a result of injuries sustained while imprisoned.\n\nOutside China, Falun Gong practitioners established international media organizations to gain wider exposure for their cause and challenge narratives of the Chinese state-run media. These include The Epoch Times newspaper, New Tang Dynasty Television, and Sound of Hope radio station. According to Zhao, through \"The Epoch Times\" it can be discerned how Falun Gong is building a \"de facto media alliance\" with China's democracy movements in exile, as demonstrated by its frequent printing of articles by prominent overseas Chinese critics of the PRC government. In 2004, \"The Epoch Times\" published a collection of nine editorials that presented a critical history of Communist Party rule. This catalyzed the Tuidang movement, which encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. \"The Epoch Times\" claims that tens of millions have renounced the Communist Party as part of the movement, though these numbers have not been independently verified.\nIn 2006, Falun Gong practitioners in the United States formed Shen Yun Performing Arts, a dance and music company that tours internationally.\n\nFalun Gong software developers in the United States are also responsible for the creation of several popular censorship-circumvention tools employed by internet users in China.\n\nFalun Gong Practitioners outside China have filed dozens of lawsuits against Jiang Zemin, Luo Gan, Bo Xilai, and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity. According to \"International Advocates for Justice\", Falun Gong has filed the largest number of human rights lawsuits in the 21st century and the charges are among the most severe international crimes defined by international criminal laws. As of 2006, 54 civil and criminal lawsuits were under way in 33 countries. In many instances, courts have refused to adjudicate the cases on the grounds of sovereign immunity. In late 2009, however, separate courts in Spain and Argentina indicted Jiang Zemin and Luo Gan on charges of \"crimes of humanity\" and genocide, and asked for their arrest—the ruling is acknowledged to be largely symbolic and unlikely to be carried out. The court in Spain also indicted Bo Xilai, Jia Qinglin and Wu Guanzheng.\n\nFalun Gong practitioners and their supporters also filed a lawsuit in May 2011 against the technology company Cisco Systems, alleging that the company helped design and implement a surveillance system for the Chinese government to suppress Falun Gong. Cisco denied customizing their technology for this purpose.\n\nLi Hongzhi began teaching Falun Gong internationally in March 1995. His first stop was in Paris where, at the invitation of the Chinese ambassador, he held a lecture seminar at the PRC embassy. This was followed by lectures in Sweden in May 1995. Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore.\n\nFalun Gong's growth outside China largely corresponded to the migration of students from Mainland China to the West in the early- to mid-1990s. Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses. Falun Gong volunteer instructors and Falun Dafa Associations are currently found in 80 countries outside China.\n\nTranslations of Falun Gong teachings began appearing in the late 1990s. As the practice began proliferating outside China, Li Hongzhi was beginning to receive recognition in the United States and elsewhere in the western world. In May 1999, Li was welcomed to Toronto with greetings from the city's mayor and the provincial lieutenant governor, and in the two months that followed also received recognition from the cities of Chicago and San Jose.\n\nAlthough the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency in the 1990s, it remained relatively unknown outside China until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and Communist Party authorities became a subject of international media coverage. With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China. Following the launch of the Communist Party's suppression campaign against Falun Gong, the overseas presence became vital to the practice's resistance in China and its continued survival. Falun Gong practitioners overseas have responded to the persecution in China through regular demonstrations, parades, and through the creation of media outlets, performing arts companies, and censorship-circumvention software mainly intended to reach Mainland Chinese audiences.\n\nA body of scholarly work has been published on Falun Gong ever since it began. Most of these have been created by social scientists, who investigate the social conditions that lead to the creation of the movement.\n\nSince 1999, numerous Western governments and human rights organizations have expressed condemnation of the Chinese government's suppression of Falun Gong. Since 1999, members of the United States Congress have made public pronouncements and introduced several resolutions in support of Falun Gong. In 2010, U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 605 called for \"an immediate end to the campaign to persecute, intimidate, imprison, and torture Falun Gong practitioners,\" condemned the Chinese authorities' efforts to distribute \"false propaganda\" about the practice worldwide, and expressed sympathy to persecuted Falun Gong practitioners and their families.\nFrom 1999 to 2001, Western media reports on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By the latter half of 2001, however, the volume of media reports declined precipitously, and by 2002, major news organizations like the \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\" had almost completely ceased their coverage of Falun Gong from China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human rights groups. Adam Frank writes that in reporting on the Falun Gong, the Western tradition of casting the Chinese as \"exotic\" took dominance, and that while the facts were generally correct in Western media coverage, \"the normalcy that millions of Chinese practitioners associated with the practice had all but disappeared.\" David Ownby noted that alongside these tactics, the \"cult\" label applied to Falun Gong by the Chinese authorities never entirely went away in the minds of some Westerners, and the stigma still plays a role in wary public perceptions of Falun Gong.\n\nTo counter the support of Falun Gong in the West, the Chinese government expanded their efforts against the group internationally. This included visits to newspaper officers by diplomats to \"extol the virtues of Communist China and the evils of Falun Gong\", linking support for Falun Gong with \"jeopardizing trade relations,\" and sending letters to local politicians telling them to withdraw support for the practice. According to Perry Link, pressure on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong could result in a denial of visa for fieldwork in China; or exclusion and discrimination from business and community groups who have connections with China and fear angering the Communist Party.\n\nAlthough the persecution of Falun Gong has drawn considerable condemnation outside China, some observers note that Falun Gong has failed to attract the level of sympathy and sustained attention afforded to other Chinese dissident groups. Katrina Lantos Swett, vice chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, notes that most Americans are aware of the suppression of \"Tibetan Buddhists and unregistered Christian groups or pro-democracy and free speech advocates such as Liu Xiaobo and Ai Weiwei,\" and yet \"know little to nothing about China’s assault on the Falun Gong.\"\n\nEthan Gutmann, a journalist reporting on China since the early 1990s, has attempted to explain this apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, \"Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum\", Gutmann writes. Moreover, practitioners' attempts at getting their message across carried some of the uncouthness of Communist party culture, including a perception that practitioners tended to exaggerate, create \"torture tableaux straight out of a Cultural Revolution opera\", or \"spout slogans rather than facts\". This is coupled with a general doubtfulness in the West of persecuted refugees. Gutmann also notes that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC governments vehement attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.\n\nRichard Madsen writes that Falun Gong lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom. For instance, Falun Gong's conservative moral beliefs have alienated some liberal constituencies in the West (e.g. its teachings against promiscuity and homosexual behavior). Christian conservatives, by contrast, don't accord the practice the same space as persecuted Chinese Christians. Madsen charges that the American political center does not want to push the human rights issue so hard that it would disrupt commercial and political relations with China. Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to suppression.\n\nIn August 2007 at the request of the Falun Gong, the newly reestablished Rabbinic Sanhedrin deliberated persecution of the movement by Chinese government.\n\n\n\n"}

The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may use some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame or misrepresent the truth.\n\nThe purpose and or consequence of a half-truth is to make something that is really only a belief appear to be knowledge, or a truthful statement to represent the whole truth, or possibly lead to a false conclusion. According to the justified true belief theory of knowledge, in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe in the relevant true proposition, but one must also have a good reason for doing so. A half-truth deceives the recipient by presenting something believable and using those aspects of the statement that can be shown to be true as good reason to believe the statement is true in its entirety, or that the statement represents the whole truth. A person deceived by a half-truth considers the proposition to be knowledge and acts accordingly.\n\n\nSome forms of half-truths are an inescapable part of politics in representative democracies. The reputation of a political candidate can be irreparably damaged if they are exposed in a lie, so a complex style of language has evolved to minimise the chance of this happening. If someone has not said something, they cannot be accused of lying. As a consequence, politics has become a world where half-truths are expected, and political statements are rarely accepted at face value.\n\nWilliam Safire defines a half-truth, for political purposes, as \"a statement accurate enough to require an explanation; and the longer the explanation, the more likely a public reaction of half-belief\".\n\nIn his 1990 work \"The Magic Lantern: The Revolution of 1989 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, and Prague\", Timothy Garton Ash responded to Václav Havel's call for \"living in truth\":\nPhilosopher Alfred North Whitehead was quoted as saying: \"There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil\". If this is true, statements, or truths, which according to Whitehead are all half-truths, are susceptible to creating deceptive and false conclusions.\n\nRichard Brodie links half-truths to memes \"the truth of any proposition depends on the assumptions you make in considering it—the distinct memes you use in thinking about it\". Brodie considers half-truths a necessary part of human interaction because they allow practical application of ideas when it is impractical to convey all the information needed to make a fully informed decision, although some half-truths can lead to a false conclusions or inferences in the world of logic.\n\nThe notion of half-truths has existed in various cultures, giving rise to several epigrammatic sayings.\n\n\n"}

He was first and foremost a scholar and, even if Greek, he was an adherent of the Latin church.\n\nAristippus was an envoy to Constantinople (1158-1160) when he received from the emperor Manuel I Comnenus a Greek copy of Ptolemy's \"Almagest\". A student of the Schola Medica Salernitana tracked down Aristippus and his copy on Mount Etna (observing an eruption) and proceeded to give a Latin translation. Though this was the first translation of the \"Almagest\" into Latin, it was not as influential as a later translation into Latin made by Gerard of Cremona from the Arabic.

He may have helped himself to some of the royal concubines during the rebellion of 1161. He does not seem to have been a particularly effective administrator.

{"id": "98996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98996", "title": "Herman of Carinthia", "text": "Herman of Carinthia\n\nHerman of Carinthia (c. 1100 – c. 1160), also nicknamed \"Hermannus Dalmata\" (\"the Dalmatian\"), \"Sclavus\" (\"the Slav\") or \"Secundus\" (\"the Second\"), was an Istrian philosopher, astronomer, astrologer, mathematician, translator and author.\n\nAmong Adelard of Bath, John of Seville, Gerard of Cremona (1114–1187) and Plato of Tivoli (1134–1145) Herman is the most important translator of Arabic astronomical works in 12th century and populariser of Arabic culture in Europe. The influence of his translations on the development of medieval European astronomy was especially large.\n\nIn his own account he was born in \"central Istria\" circa 1100, then part of the Duchy of Carinthia. He died circa 1160.\n\nMost likely he went to a Benedictine monastic school in Istria. He went on to study in France. It was probably in France that Herman's attention was drawn to the classical texts which were becoming available via Arabic sources. This was before the time of the first university in France, but at Chartres he attended one of the cathedral schools which were the predecessors of universities and he also studied in Paris in the 1130s.\nThe teachers at Chartres included Thierry of Chartres to whom Herman was to dedicate a translation in 1143. The school of Chartres was known for its interests in Christian platonism and the natural sciences.\n\nOne of Herman's fellow students in France was Robert of Ketton with whom he travelled for four years in the Eastern Mediterranean. Both men became translators from the Arabic. At Constantinople and Damascus Herman took note of the Arabic science of that period. Circa 1138 he returned to Europe, and was active as a scholar in Spain (an important country for translations from the Arabic) and southern France. A huge part of his work remained anonymous.\n\nIn 1142 Herman was in Spain and became involved in an important project to translate Islamic texts.\nPeter the Venerable recruited a team, including Herman, to translate five texts about Islam into Latin. Different members of the team appear to have concentrated on different works, and Herman is credited as the main translator of two of them: \"De generatione Muhamet et nutritura eius\" and \"Doctrina Muhamet\".\n\nThe most significant translation in the collection was that of the Qur'an. This was entitled Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete and was the first known translation of the Qur'an into a European language. Robert of Ketton was its principal translator, according to most sources (including the \"Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete\" itself). However, Herman may have had some input, given the team nature of the project.\nDespite being an imperfect translation, \"Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete\" remained the standard one for centuries, circulating in manuscript before being printed in the 1543 edition published in Basel by Theodor Bibliander. In this edition both Herman's above-mentioned translations of treatises about Islam appeared together with a preface by Martin Luther.\n\nHerman translated it from an Arabic translation from the Greek (jointly with commentaries of Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti, who worked in Córdoba in the 10th century). Western European scholastics became aware of Ptolemy's astronomical views via this translation dedicated to Thierry of Chartres. (This translation was for a long time believed to be the only surviving link to Ptolemy's original. Later another Arabic translation was found to have been preserved in Istanbul).\n\nHerman also translated Ptolemy's \"Canon\" (Canon of Kings). For long many thought that Ptolemy was translated by German Herman Contractus and not by Herman of Carinthia.\n\nHerman's first known translation was the sixth book of an astrological treatise \"Liber sextus astronomie\" by the Jewish writer Sahl ibn Bishr. It was released in Spain in 1138 under the title \"Zaelis fatidica\" (\"Prophesy\"). Sahl ibn Bishr had been writing in the Greek astrological tradition. Ibn Bishr's first five books were preserved in the translation of John of Seville (Johannes Hispanus) (circa 1090 – circa 1150). The sixth book deals with three thematic topics regarding the influences on the world and its inhabitants. The work contains divinations based on the movements of the planets and comets.\n\nCirca 1140 Herman translated into Latin the astronomical work of Abu Ma'shar \"Kitab al-madkhal ila ilm ahkam al nujum\" (\"Introduction to Astronomy\"). The work contains problems from Greek philosophy, Arabic astronomy and Eastern astrology, and was first translated into Latin by John of Seville in 1133. Herman's less literal translation was published several times under the title \"Liber introductorius in astronomiam Albumasaris, Abalachii\" (Augusta Vindelicorum, Augsburg 1489; Venice 1495 and 1506). A large part of Herman's translation was copied into Roger of Hereford's \"Book of Astronomical Judgements\".\n\nHerman produced a version of Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī's astronomical tables (\"zij\") – they were also translated in 1126 by Adelard of Bath (1075–1164).\n\nCharles Burnett (2001) postulates that Herman collaborated with Robert of Ketton and Hugo of Santalla on the \"Liber novem iudicum\" (the Book of Nine Judges), a collection of translations of Arabic astrologers, notably al-Kindi. Their project may have been to supplant the current superstitious Latin astrology with Arabic astronomical science. Arabic texts cite often Hermes as an authority. Burnett postulates that Renaissance magi merely continued this Hermetic tradition begun by Herman, Robert and Hugh. Herman shares technical terminology with Hugh and a penchant for evocation of the \"Asclepius\", most notably in \"De essentiis\" (see below)\n\nHis original contribution to philosophy was \"De essentiis\" (\"On essences\"). In this work Herman deals with five Aristotelian categories (causa, motus, spatium, tempus, habitudo). He started to write this treatise in 1143 in Toulouse and he completed it the same year in Béziers. In 1982 this book was reprinted in Germany.\n\nSome other works are believed to be Herman's:\nIn the text (or \"a manuscript\", the syntax of this article was not clear) of \"De indagatione cordis\" there are many names of scientists and scholars whose work Herman knew and used: Abu Mas'har (787–886), Sahl ibn Bishr, Aomar Tiberia, Abu al-Kindi (801–873), the eighth-century Jewish astrologer Al Batrig Mashallah (Messahalla), Hermes, and Dorotheos of Sidon.\n\nMany medieval authors refer to Herman's work, for instance Albert the Great (Albert von Bollstädt, Albertus Magnus), instructor to Thomas Aquinas, in his work \"Speculum astronomiae\".\n\nDe Essentiis, A Critical Edition with Translation and Commentary by Charles Burnett.

{"id": "14570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14570", "title": "Intension", "text": "Intension\n\nIn linguistics, logic, philosophy, and other fields, an intension is any property or quality connoted by a word, phrase, or another symbol. In the case of a word, the word's definition often implies an intension. For instance, the intensions of the word \"plant\" include properties including \"being composed of cellulose\", \"alive\", and \"organism\", among others. A \"comprehension\" is the collection of all such intensions.\n\nThe meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between the \"idea the word means\" and the \"physical form of the word\". Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) contrasts three concepts:\n\n\nWithout intension of some sort, a word has no meaning. For instance, the terms \"rantans\" or \"brillig\" have no intension and hence no meaning. Such terms may be suggestive, but a term can be \"suggestive\" without being meaningful. For instance, \"ran tan\" is an archaic onomatopoeia for chaotic noise or din and may suggest to English speakers a din or meaningless noise, and \"brillig\" though made up by Lewis Caroll may be suggestive of 'brilliant' or 'frigid'. Such terms, it may be argued, are always intensional since they connote the property 'meaningless term', but this is only an apparent paradox and does not constitute a counterexample to the claim that without intension a word has no meaning. Part of its intension is that it has no extension. Intension is analogous to the signified in the Saussurean system, extension to the referent.\n\nIn philosophical arguments about dualism versus monism, it is noted that thoughts have intensionality and physical objects do not (S. E. Palmer, 1999), but rather have extension in space and time.\n\nA statement-form is simply a form obtained by putting blanks into a sentence where one or more expressions with extensions occur—for instance, \"The quick brown ___ jumped over the lazy ___'s back.\" An instance of the form is a statement obtained by filling the blanks in.\n\nAn \"intensional statement-form\" is a statement-form with at least one instance such that substituting co-extensive expressions into it does not always preserve logical value. An \"intensional statement\" is a statement that is an instance of an intensional statement-form. Here co-extensive expressions are expressions with the same extension.\n\nThat is, a statement-form is intensional if it has, as one of its instances, a statement for which there are two co-extensive expressions (in the relevant language) such that one of them occurs in the statement, and if the other one is put in its place (uniformly, so that it replaces the former expression wherever it occurs in the statement), the result is a (different) statement with a different logical value. An intensional statement, then, is an instance of such a form; it has the same form as a statement in which substitution of co-extensive terms fails to preserve logical value.\n\n\nTo see that these are intensional, make the following substitutions: (1) \"Mark Twain\" → \"The author of 'Corn-pone Opinions'\"; (2) \"Aristotle\" → \"the tutor of Alexander the Great\"; (3) can be seen to be intensional given \"had a sister\" → \"had a female sibling.\"\n\nIt will be noted that the intensional statements above feature expressions like \"knows\", \"possible\", and \"pleased\". Such expressions always, or nearly always, produce intensional statements when added (in some intelligible manner) to an extensional statement, and thus they (or more complex expressions like \"It is possible that\") are sometimes called \"intensional operators\". A large class of intensional statements, but by no means all, can be spotted from the fact that they contain intensional operators.\n\nAn \"extensional\" statement is a non-intensional statement. Substitution of co-extensive expressions into it always preserves logical value. A language is intensional if it contains intensional statements, and extensional otherwise. All natural languages are intensional. The only extensional languages are artificially constructed languages used in mathematical logic or for other special purposes and small fragments of natural languages.\n\n\nNote that if \"Samuel Clemens\" is put into (1) in place of \"Mark Twain\", the result is as true as the original statement. It should be clear that no matter what is put for \"Mark Twain\", so long as it is a singular term picking out the same man, the statement remains true. Likewise, we can put in place of the predicate any other predicate belonging to Mark Twain and only to Mark Twain, without changing the logical value. For (2), likewise, consider the following substitutions: \"Aristotle\" → \"The tutor of Alexander the Great\"; \"Aristotle\" → \"The author of the 'Prior Analytics'\"; \"had a sister\" → \"had a sibling with two X-chromosomes\"; \"had a sister\" → \"had a parent who had a non-male child\".\n\nIntensional languages cannot be given an adequate semantics in terms of the extensions of expressions in them, since the extensions themselves do not suffice to determine a logical value. (If they did, then one could not change the logical value by substituting co-extensive expressions.) On the other hand, for the first half of the 20th century the only known systems of formal semantics worked by assigning extensions to expressions and used a Tarski-style truth-definition of statements constructed from the primitive expressions of the language under analysis. Hence, these semantical methods were pathetically inadequate for understanding the semantics of any but a few small artificial languages or mutilated fragments of natural languages.\n\nThis situation changed in the 1960s with the invention of possible-world or \"intensional\" semantics, the main form of which is due to Saul Kripke. Though this has enabled improvements in the semantic modelling of natural languages, much work remains to be done.\n\n\n\n"}

Could not the undesirables be got rid of and the desirables multiplied?” This concept of eugenics - a term he introduced - soon won many adherents, notably in North America and England. First practical steps were taken in the United States of America. The government under Theodore Roosevelt created a national Heredity Commission that was charged to investigate the genetic heritage of the country and to “(encourage) the increase of families of good blood and (discourage) the vicious elements in the cross-bred American civilization”. Charles Davenport supported by the Carnegie Institution established the Eugenics Record Office. Further significant funding for the eugenics movement came from E. H. Harriman and Vernon Kellogg. In an effort to eradicate unfit offspring sterilization laws were passed, the first one in Indiana (1907), then in other states, many strictly for eugenic reasons, \"to better the race,\" allowing for compulsory sterilization. Other eugenic laws limited the right to marry.\n\nThe \"First International Eugenics Congress\" took place in London on July 24–29, 1912. It was organized by the British Eugenics Education Society and dedicated to Galton who had died the year prior. Major Leonard Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, was presiding. The five-day meeting saw about 400 delegates at the Hotel Cecil in London. Luminaries included Winston Churchill, First Lord of the British Admiralty and Lord Alverstone, the Chief Justice, Lord Balfour, as well as the ambassadors of Norway, Greece, and France. In his opening address Darwin indicated that the introduction of principles of better breeding procedures for humans would require moral courage. The American exhibit was sponsored by the American Breeders' Association and demonstrated the incidence of hereditary defects in human pedigrees. A report by Bleeker van Wagenen presented information about American sterilization laws and propagated compulsory sterilization as the best method to cut off “defective germ-plasm”. In the final address, Major Darwin extolled eugenics as the practical application of the principle of evolution.\n\nThe second Congress, originally scheduled for New York in 1915, met at the American Museum of Natural History in New York on September 25–27, 1921 with Henry Fairfield Osborn presiding. Alexander Graham Bell was the honorary president. The State Department mailed the invitations around the world. Under American leadership and dominance - forty-one out of fifty-three scientific papers - the work of the eugenicists disrupted by World War I in Europe was to resume. Delegates participated not only from Europe and North America, but also from Latin America (Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Uruguay), and Asia (Japan, India, Siam). The major guest speaker, Major Darwin, advocated eugenic measures that needed to be taken, namely the \"elimination of the unfit\", the discouragement of large families in the \"ill-endowed\", and the encouragement of large families in the \"well-endowed\".\n\nThe third meeting was arranged at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City August 22–23, 1932, dedicated to Mary Williamson Averell who had provided significant financial support, and presided by Davenport. Osborn's address emphasized birth selection over birth control as the method to better the offspring. F. Ramos from Cuba proposed that immigrants should be carefully checked for harmful traits, and suggested deportations of their descendants if inadmissible traits would become later apparent. Major Darwin, now 88 years old, was unable to attend but sent a report presented by Ronald Fisher predicting the doom of civilization unless eugenic measures were implemented. Ernst Rüdin was unanimously elected president of the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations (IFEO).\n\nThe congress published \"A Decade of Progress in Eugenics\", Scientific Papers of the Third International Congress of Eugenics.\n\nA Fourth International Eugenics Conference was not convened. The IFEO held two more international meetings, one at Zurich in 1934 and the last one at Scheveningen in 1936.\n\nIn 1932, Hermann Joseph Muller gave a speech to the Third International Eugenics Congress, and stated \"eugenics might yet perfect the human race but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.\n\n\n"}

(From \"Stein\", meaning \"stone\" in German, are derived his translated Latinized surname \"Lapideus\" and Gallicized surnames \"La Pierre\" or \"à Lapide\".) On the completion of his academic studies in Germany, presumably at Leipzig and Freiburg, he proceeded to Paris to pursue the study of philosophy and theology. In Paris, he came in contact with the foremost representatives of Realism, who, recognizing Heynlin's abilities and probable future influence, exerted their powers to the utmost to mould his mind after their own and thus make him like themselves a bitter opponent of Nominalism. Their efforts were successful.\n\nIn 1464, Heynlin went to the University of Basel and applied for admission to the professorial faculty of arts. The old controversy regarding the nature of Universals had not yet subsided, and in the university of Basel Nominalism held sway. Hence in view of this and the maintenance of peace within the institution, the admission of Heynlin to the faculty was not accomplished without a most vigorous opposition.\n\nOnce a member of the faculty, he hoped to rid it of all Nominalistic tendencies, nor was he disappointed in his expectation. In 1465, he became dean of the faculty of arts and in this capacity he revised the university statutes and thus brought about a firmly established curriculum of studies. In 1466, he returned to Paris, obtained the doctorate in theology, was in 1469 elected rector of the university and became professor of theology at the Sorbonne.\n\nHeynlin's most noteworthy achievement was the establishment of the first printing-press in Paris. Heynlin worked closely with Guillaume Fichet (1433-ca. 1480), another professor at the Sorbonne, who had also come from abroad: from Le Petit-Bornand-les-Glières, in Savoy.\n\nHeynlin brought Swiss workmen to install this press in the buildings of the Sorbonne at the end of 1469 or the beginning of 1470: Ulric Gering (Guerinch or Guernich) (1445-1510), Michel Friburger, and Martin Crantz (or Krantz). Ulric Gering may have come from Münster, Friburger from Colmar, and Crantz may have also come from Münster or Strasbourg. Heynlin gave valuable pecuniary aid to their undertakings, especially for the printing of the works of the Church Fathers. King Louis XI granted letters of naturalization to all three workmen in 1475.\n\nTheir first publication with this press, and the first book printed in France, was a collection of letters by the fifteenth century grammarian Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparin de Pergame). The \"Epistolae Gasparini\" (1470) were intended to provide an exemplar for students for the writing of artful and elegant Latin. Their second work was a translation of Sallust (1470-1471), the third the \"Orationes\" of Bessarion (1471), and the fourth was Fichet's own \"Rhetorica\" in 1471. The number of the works which they published from 1470 to 1472 amounts to some thirty works.\n\nAt the end of 1472 or at the beginning of 1473, Heynlin and Fichet left the Sorbonne to settle on Rue Saint-Jacques. Two of their apprentices, Pierre de Kaysere (Petrus Caesaris) and Jean Stoll, established around the same time and on the same street their own competing printing press, with the emblem of the \"Soufflet-Vert\".\n\nThe German humanist Johann Reuchlin attached himself to Heynlin, whom he followed to the young University of Basel in 1474.\n\nIn 1478, he was called to teach theology in the newly founded University of Tübingen, where his learning, eloquence and reputation secured for him the same year the rectorship. The opposition, however, he met from the Nominalists Gabriel Biel, Paul Scriptoris, and others, rendered his service here of short duration. He severed his connexion with the university, proceeded to Baden-Baden and thence to Berne, where he engaged in preaching. Dissatisfied with Berne, he returned to Basel, and tired of wandering, he entered in 1487 the Carthusian monastery of St. Margarethenthal to spend his declining years in prayer and literary work.\n\n\n"}

He taught over 56 years at the University of Texas at El Paso before becoming professor emeritus in philosophy upon his retirement in 2013. His best known books were \"Vasconcelos of Mexico: Philosopher and Prophet\", and \"Antonio Caso: Philosopher of Mexico\", both of which were published by the University of Texas Press. He also wrote extensively on Chicano and Native American thought.\n\nKnown internationally for his efforts to promote peace and human rights, Haddox worked with many organizations over the years, including the American Friends Service Committee and the student organization MEChA. He lectured in Brasília, Brazil, at the National University of Mexico, at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the UK, at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, and at universities and academic meetings throughout the United States. He was appointed by Pope Paul VI Knight of the Order of St Gregory the Great. Haddox was a close friend and collaborator with Mexican pacifist and diplomat Heberto Sein during his later years.\n\nJohn Haddox was born in Pawnee, Oklahoma. He served in the U.S. military during the Korean War, and met his wife, Carmen (Mendoza) Haddox, while stationed at William Beaumont Army Medical Center. They raised eleven children.\n\nHaddox received his doctorate from the University of Notre Dame, where he came under the influence of Jacques Maritain and the \"new scholasticism.\" With a strong background in science (he had originally intended to study medicine), and influenced by Alexander Ivanovich Oparin and his ideas concerning abiogenesis as well as scholastic ideas of universal order, he championed teleology in biology. When he began teaching in a bicultural environment, his focus changed from the philosophy of science to ethics and social philosophy. John Haddox has been called a \"religious existentialist\" and a \"personalist.\" He argued for the need to include Latin American philosophers, and especially Mexican philosophers, into the philosophical canon. He made the case that worldviews emerging from the \"territorial minorities\" in the United States, Chicanos and Native Americans, constitute unique and fully developed philosophical positions as well. Out of his interest in Latin American philosophers such as Bartolomé de las Casas, José Enrique Rodó, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Leopoldo Zea, José Vasconcelos and Antonio Caso, who were fully involved in the social, political and educational movements of their time, Haddox developed a philosophy of activism. The duty of the philosopher is to be engaged in society, from an ethical perspective, and to form through education conscientious citizens. The teaching of social ethics awakens the human conscience, replacing the instinctive with altruism. These ideas are embodied in his famous paraphrase of Caso: \"The properly and distinctively human feature of man is his ability to say to others ‘take,’ ‘take of my time,’ ‘take of my concern,’ ‘take of my interest,’ 'take of my possessions,' even, ‘take of \"me\".'\"\n"}

His life was spent in teaching, first in the \"lycées \"and then in the Ecole Normale Supérieure from 1875.\n\nAs Frédéric Ozanam had been a Catholic professor of history and foreign literature in the university, Ollé-Laprune's aim was to be a Catholic professor of philosophy there. Theodore de Regnon, the Jesuit theologian, wrote to him:\n\nThe Government of the Third Republic was now and then urged by a certain section of the press to punish the \"clericalism\" of Ollé-Laprune, but the repute of his philosophical teaching protected him. For one year only (1881–82), after organizing a manifestation in favour of the expelled congregations, he was suspended from his chair by Jules Ferry, and the first to sign the protest addressed by his students to the minister on behalf of their professor was the future socialist deputy Jean Jaurès, then a student at the Ecole Normale Supérieure.\n\nThe Academy of Moral and Political Sciences elected him a member of the philosophical section in 1897, to succeed Vacherot. Some months after his death William P. Coyne called him \"the greatest Catholic layman who has appeared in France since Ozanam\" (\"New Ireland Review\", June, 1899, p. 195).\n\nOllé-Laprune's first important work was \"La Philosophie de Malebranche\" (1870). Ten years later to obtain the doctorate he defended before the Sorbonne a thesis on moral certitude. As against Cartesian rationalism and positivistic determinism, he investigated the part of the will and the heart in the phenomenon of belief. This work resembles in many respects John Henry Newman's \"Grammar of Assent\".\n\nIn his \"Essai sur la morale d'Aristote\" (1881) Ollé-Laprune defended the \"Eudaemonism\" of the Greek philosopher against the Kantian theories; and in \"La philosophie et le temps présent\" (1890) he vindicated, against deistic spiritualism, the right of the Christian thinker to go beyond the data of \"natural religion\" and illuminate philosophy by the data of revealed religion.\n\nOne of his most influential works was the \"Prix de la vie\" (1894), wherein he shows why life is worth living. The advice given by Pope Leo XIII to the Catholics of France found in Ollé-Laprune an active champion. His brochure \"Ce qu'on va chercher à Rome\" (1895) was one of the best commentaries on the papal policy.\n\nHis articles and conferences attest his growing influence in Catholic circles. He became a leader of Christian activity, consulted and heard by all until his premature death when he was about to finish a book on Jouffroy (Paris, 1899). Many of his articles have been collected by Goyau under the title \"La Vitalité chrétienne\" (1901). Here will also be found a series of his unedited meditations, \"Omnia instaurare in Christo\". Professor Delbos of the University of Paris published in 1907 the course which Ollé-Laprune had given on reason and rationalism (\"La raison et le rationalisme\").\n\n\n"}

Only eighteen people were granted this honor; they are called the \"Eighteen Sages of Korea\" or the \"Eighteen Confucian Scholars of the East\" (, ). It is located in central Seoul, South Korea, at 53 Myeongnyun-dong 3(sam)-ga, Jongno District, on the campus of Sungkyunkwan University.\n\nMunmyo houses a shrine to Confucius known as Daeseongjeon, or \"Hall of Great Achievement.\" The main gate leading to the shrine Sinsammun, literally \"Spirit Three Gate\", is open only on special occasions such as Seokjeon Daeje. The central gate is reserved for the spirit of Confucius and his disciple, and no one else may enter through this gate.

Temples dedicated to Confucius and other disciples called \"temples of Confucius\" became widespread during the Tang dynasty. This idea was brought to Korea where it was adopted. The Munmyo was begun during the Later Silla, but it wasn't fully developed and completed until 1398 under Taejo of Joseon. Notable scholars of Joseon, Silla and Goryeo were added to the temple.

A biological incident has the potential to cost thousands of lives, cause significant panic, and greatly impact travel and trade. Biological threats, whether they come from nature or are deliberately created, are among the most serious threats facing the US and the international community. Outbreaks of disease caused catastrophic harm to the countries in which they are present.\n\nThe National Biodefense Strategy lays out the President's path to protecting the American people and the American way of life, and lays out a plan and set of objectives to counter the threats that can occur from naturally occurring events, accidental events, and deliberate biological terrorism events. The strategy is more than just a federal government strategy; is a call to action for all levels of government as well as physicians, scientists, educators, and is industry.\n\nThe strategy was required by Congress. President Trump said that his plan takes bio defense in a new direction that has a more coordinated, centralized approach based on lessons that were learned from past biological incidents such as the west Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014.\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", \"A privately sponsored group that has studied biodefense issues since 2014 applauded the White House's strategy. The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense has warned that the U.S. is dangerously vulnerable to a large-scale biological attack and has urged Washington to develop a more comprehensive strategy.\"\n\nIn mid-September 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump implemented a new national biodefense strategy. His new strategy wiped away those of Barack Obama and George W. Bush. The main thrust of the strategy is that a Department of Health and Human Services led committee will survey all the gaps in biodefense within the government and all the agencies that work on it. The committee will include high-level officials from the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Homeland Security. The group will focus on both man-made threats and naturally occurring biological threats. The survey, in turn, will determine funding levels for various agencies for biodefense.\n\nHistorically, biological warfare agents that have concerned security officials have included a relatively select group of pathogens and toxins, referred to as \"traditional BW agents.\"\n\nMany of the national discussions regarding putting together a national biodefense plan, unfortunately have only taken into account a more narrow vision of what type of toxins would be used in a biological warfare event - those \"traditional BW agents.\" Although the traditional agents will likely remain the main threat over the next decade, the applications of current and emerging technologies that are developing novel biological warfare agents should also be considered and factored into any long-term bow defense strategy.\n\nInternational agreements, such as the Biological Weapons and Toxins Convention have really not done a lot to stop countries from obtaining and pursuing biological warfare programs. Ironically, following ratification of the agreement, the Soviet Union's technology in biological warfare was at its height.\n\nThe mission of the Federal Government during a biological incident is to:\n\n\nThe push for increased federal funding in biodefense began during President George W. Bush's term in office. For example, in 2006, President Bush, in his annual budget request, requested a total of $5.1 billion for civilian biodefense. This number was a decrease of $2.5 billion from the previous year's budget. The drop was primarily attributed to the absence of Project BioShield money in 2006; the money for that year was already allocated the previous year. Overall, the 2006 request contained incremental increases for all agencies involved in biodefense.\n\nMultidisciplinary technology that's been created in the biological sciences arena will have a huge effect globally. They will have the power to completely revolutionize biological warfare because they will be releasing an entirely new class of engineered agents referred to as \"advanced biological warfare\" (ABW) agents. Future agents could even be engineered to target specific systems within the human body at the molecular level.\n\nAccording to the academic journal \"Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science\", advanced biological warfare agents will continue to evolve and develop due to technological innovation. At the same time, due to advances in science regarding biology, biological agents will also evolve and get worse. Although advanced biological warfare agents will not replace the traditional threats posed by agents such as smallpox and anthrax, the advanced biological warfare agents can become a novel approach to counter proliferation, medical countermeasures, and detection.\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton said that biological and chemical weapons \"are often referred to as the poor man’s nuclear weapon, so they are particularly attractive to terrorist groups.\"\n\nOn September 18, 2018, in conjunction with his release of the National Biodefense Strategy, President Trump issued a memorandum on his biodefense strategy to his cabinet and heads of major relevant agencies. The memorandum dictates the policy of the United States with regards to biodefense. It officially forms a new committee, which is chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Several other high-level cabinet members will sit on the committee, and it will be the committee's charge to implement the National Biodefense Strategy. In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must establish a new special team of people from across different agencies to carry out the plan.\n\nThe official vision of the National Biodefense Strategy is as follows: \"The United States actively and effectively prevents, prepares for, responds to, recovers from, and mitigates risk from natural, accidental, or deliberate biological threats.\"\n\nAccording to \"Politico\", \"Senior administration officials later said threats could be better addressed by streamlining processes for biotech companies to work with the HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports private sector development of vaccines and drugs.\"\n\nOne official from the Trump Administration said that the government's accounting requirements have made it difficult and undesirable for many companies to participate.\n\nHHS Assistant Secretary Robert Kadlec said that one of his top priorities was to get a decade-long extension of the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund. The government can use that fund to buy countermeasures like vaccines, medication, and diagnostic tools. The fund was first authorized under President George W. Bush in 2004.\n"}

{"id": "958627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=958627", "title": "Persuasive definition", "text": "Persuasive definition\n\nA persuasive definition is a form of stipulative definition which purports to describe the 'true' or 'commonly accepted' meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an uncommon or altered use, usually to support an argument for some view, or to create or alter rights, duties or crimes.\nThe terms thus defined will often involve emotionally charged but imprecise notions, such as \"freedom\", \"terrorism\", \"democracy\", etc. In argumentation the use of a persuasive definition is sometimes called \"definist fallacy\". (The latter sometimes more broadly refers to a fallacy of a definition based on improper identification of two distinct properties.)\nExamples of persuasive definitions (definist fallacies) include: \n\nPersuasive definitions commonly appear in controversial topics such as politics, sex, and religion, as participants in emotionally charged exchanges will sometimes become more concerned about swaying people to one side or another than expressing the unbiased facts. A persuasive definition of a term is favorable to one argument or unfavorable to the other argument, but is presented as if it were neutral and well-accepted, and the listener is expected to accept such a definition without question.\n\nThe term \"persuasive definition\" was introduced by philosopher C.L. Stevenson as part of his emotive theory of meaning.\n\nLanguage can simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings (expressive). Unlike other common types of definitions in logic, persuasive definitions focus on the expressive use of language to affect the feelings of readers and listeners ultimately with an aim to change their behavior. With this fundamentally different purpose, persuasive definitions are evaluated not on their truth or falsehood but rather on their effectiveness as a persuasive device. \nStevenson showed how these two dimensions are combined when he investigated the terms he called \"ethical\" or emotive. He noted that some words, such as 'peace' or 'war', are not simply used to describe reality by modifying the cognitive response of the interlocutor. They have also the power of directing the interlocutor's attitudes and suggesting a course of action. For this reason, they evoke a different kind of reaction, emotive in nature. As Stevenson put it \"Instead of merely describing people's interests, they change and intensify them. They recommend an interest in an object, rather than state that the interest already exists.\" These words have the tendency to encourage future actions, to lead the hearer towards a decision by affecting his or her system of interests. Stevenson distinguished between the use of a word (a stimulus) and its possible psychological effects on the addressee's cognitive and the emotive reactions by labeling them as \"descriptive meaning\" and \"emotive meaning\". Applying this distinction reveals how the redefinition of an ethical word is transformed into an instrument of persuasion, a tool for redirecting preferences and emotions:\n\nIn persuasive definitions the evaluative component associated with a concept is left unaltered while the descriptive meaning is modified. In this fashion, imprisonment can become \"true freedom\", and massacres \"pacification\". Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while keeping the original evaluations that the use of a word evokes. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the emotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define a word by qualifying the \"definiendum\" without setting forth what the term actually means. For instance, we can consider the following quasi-definition taken from Casanova's Fuga dai Piombi. In this example (1), the speaker, Mr. Soradaci, tries to convince his interlocutor (Casanova) that being a \"sneak\" is an honorable behavior:\n\nThis quasi-definition employed in case 1 underscores a fundamental dimension of the \"emotive\" meaning of a word, namely its relationship with the shared values, which are attacked as \"prejudices.\" This account given by the spy shows how describing the referent based on a different hierarchy of values can modify emotive meaning. The value of trust is not denied, but is placed in a hierarchy where the highest worth is given to the State.Stevenson provides us with two definitions of the word culture in order to illustrate what a persuasive definition can accomplish:\n\nBoth carry with them the positive emotive meaning of culture; it is still a good thing to be cultured no matter which definition is used. What they change is what exactly it means to be called \"cultured.\" Because being cultured is a positive trait, the society views being well read and acquainted with the arts as positive traits to have. By promoting a persuasive definition of \"imaginative sensitivity\" the society begins to views those qualities positively because they are attached to a word with a positive emotive meaning.\n\nUnclear, figurative language is often used in persuasive definitions. Although several techniques can be used to form such a definition, the genus and difference technique is the usual one applied. Both definitions in the taxation example above agree that the genus is a procedure relating to governance but disagree on the difference. Persuasive definitions combine elements of stipulative definitions, lexical definitions, and sometimes theoretical definitions.\n\nPersuasive definitions commonly appear in political speeches, editorials and other situations where the power to influence is most in demand. They have been dismissed as serving only to confuse readers and listeners without legitimate purpose. Critical scrutiny is often necessary to identify persuasive definitions in an argument as they are meant to appear as honest definitions.\n\n\n"}

The opposite developmental strategy is called \"altricial,\" where the young are born or hatched helpless. These categories form a continuum, without distinct gaps between them. Precocial species are normally nidifugous, meaning that they leave the nest shortly after birth or hatching.\n\nThe span between precocial and altricial species is particularly broad in birds. Precocial birds hatch with their eyes open and are covered with downy feathers that are soon replaced by adult-type feathers. Birds of this kind can also swim and run much sooner after hatching than altricial young, such as songbirds. Very precocial birds can be ready to leave the nest in a short period of time following hatching (e.g. 24 hours). Many precocial chicks are not independent in thermoregulation (the ability to regulate their own body temperatures), and they depend on the attending parent(s) to brood them with body heat for a short period of time. Precocial birds find their own food, sometimes with help or instruction from the parents. Examples of precocial birds include the domestic chicken, many species of ducks and geese, waders, rails, and the hoatzin.\nPrecociality is found in many other animal groups. Familiar examples of precocial mammals are most ungulates, the guinea pig, and most species of hare. This last example is significant as it illustrates that precociality is not a particularly conservative characteristic, in the evolutionary sense, since the closely related rabbit is highly altricial.\n\nPrecocial species typically have a longer gestation or incubation period than related altricial species, and smaller litters or clutches, since each offspring has to be brought to a relatively advanced (and large) state before birth or hatching.\n\nThe phenomenon of imprinting studied by Konrad Lorenz is characteristic of precocial birds.\n\nExtremely precocial species are called \"superprecocial\". Examples are the Megapode birds, which have full flight feathers and which, in some species, can fly on the same day they hatch from their eggs.\n\nAnother example is the blue wildebeest, whose calves can stand within an average of six minutes from birth and walk within thirty minutes; they can outrun a hyena within a day. Such behavior gives them an advantage over other herbivore species; they are 100 times more abundant in the Serengeti ecosystem than hartebeests, their closest taxonomic relative. Hartebeest calves are not as precocial as wildebeest calves and take up to thirty minutes or more before they stand, and as long as forty-five minutes before they can follow their mothers for short distances. They are unable to keep up with their mothers until they are more than a week old.\n\nThe word \"precocial\" is derived from the same root as \"precocious\", implying in both cases early maturity.\n\nPrecociality is thought to be ancestral in birds. Thus, altricial birds tend to be found in the most derived groups. There is some evidence for precociality in Protobirds and Troodontids.\n\n\n"}

Putin was also Prime Minister for three months in 1999 and served a full term from 2008 to 2012. During Putin's presidency, he has been a member of the Unity party and the United Russia party. He is also affiliated with the People’s Front, a group of supporters that Putin organized in 2011 to help improve the public's perception of United Russia. His political ideology, priorities and policies are sometimes referred to as Putinism ().\n\nPutin has enjoyed very high domestic approval ratings and in 2007 was \"Time\" magazine's Person of the Year. In 2015, he was designated No. 1 in \"Time\" 100, \"Time\" magazine's list of the top 100 most influential people in the world. In 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, he was designated No. 1 on the \"Forbes\" list of The World’s Most Powerful People. The Russian economy and standard of living grew rapidly during the early period of Putin's regime, fueled largely by a boom in the oil industry. However, lower oil prices and sanctions for Russia's annexation of Crimea led to recession and stagnation in 2015 that has persisted into the present day.. Political freedoms have been sharply curtailed, leading to widespread condemmnation from human rights groups.\nThe political system under Putin has been described as incorporating some elements of economic liberalism, a lack of transparency in governance, cronyism, nepotism and pervasive corruption. This view has been supported by many, but it has also been characterized as \"a systemic and institutionalized form\" by others, notably Boris Nemtsov. Between 1999 and 2008, the Russian economy grew at a steady pace, which some experts attribute to the sharp rouble devaluation of 1998, Boris Yeltsin-era structural reforms, rising oil prices and cheap credit from Western banks. In former Ambassador Michael McFaul's opinion (June 2004), Russia's \"impressive\" short-term economic growth \"came simultaneously with the destruction of free media, threats to civil society and an unmitigated corruption of justice\".\n\nDuring Putin's first two terms as President, he signed into law a series of liberal economic reforms, such as the flat income tax of 13 percent, reduced profits-tax and new land and civil codes. Within this period, poverty in Russia reduced by more than half and real GDP has grown rapidly.\n\nIn foreign affairs, the Putin government seeks to emulate the former Soviet Union's grandeur, belligerence and expansionism. In November 2007, Simon Tisdall of \"The Guardian\" pointed out that \"just as Russia once exported Marxist revolution, it may now be creating an international market for Putinism\" as \"more often than not, instinctively undemocratic, oligarchic and corrupt national elites find that an appearance of democracy, with parliamentary trappings and a pretense of pluralism, is much more attractive, and manageable, than the real thing\".\n\nIn September 2007, American economist Richard W. Rahn called Putinism \"a Russian nationalistic authoritarian form of government that pretends to be a free market democracy\" and which \"owes more of its lineage to fascism than communism\", noting that \"Putinism depended on the Russian economy growing rapidly enough that most people had rising standards of living and, in exchange, were willing to put up with the existing soft repression\". He predicted that \"as Russia's economic fortunes changed, Putinism was likely to become more repressive\". After Rahn's remarks Putin took actions to lessen democracy, promote conservative beliefs and values; and silence opposition to his policies and administration.\n\nRussian historian Andranik Migranyan saw the Putin regime as restoring what he viewed as the natural functions of a government after period of the 1990s, when oligopolies expressing only their own narrow interests allegedly ruled Russia. Migranyan said: \"If democracy is the rule by a majority and the protection of the rights and opportunities of a minority, the current political regime can be described as democratic, at least formally. A multiparty political system exists in Russia, while several parties, most of them representing the opposition, have seats in the State Duma\".\n\nThe terms \"Putinism\" and \"Putinist\" often have negative connotations when used in Western media to reference the Russian government under Putin where , the military-security establishment, allegedly control much of the political and financial power. Many are Putin's personal friends or previously worked with him in state security and intelligence agencies, such as the , the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the military.\n\nCassiday and Johnson argue that since taking power in 1999, \"Putin has inspired expressions of adulation the likes of which Russia has not seen since the days of Stalin. Tributes to his achievements and personal attributes have flooded every possible media\". Ross says the cult emerged quickly by 2002 and emphasizes Putin's \"iron will, health, youth and decisiveness, tempered by popular support\". Ross concludes: \"The development of a Putin mini cult of personality was based on a formidable personality at its heart\".\n\nOn 31 December 1999, President Boris Yeltsin resigned. Under the Constitution of Russia, the then Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin became Acting President.\n\nThe day before, a program article signed by Putin \"Russia at the turn of the millennium\" was published on the government web site. The potential head of the state expressed his views on the past and problems of the country. The first task in Putin's view was consolidation of Russia's society: \"The fruitful and creative work, which our country needs so badly, is impossible in a divided and internally atomised society\". However, the author stressed: \"There should be no forced civil accord in a democratic Russia. Social accord can only be voluntary\".\n\nThe author stressed the importance of strengthening the state: \"The key to Russia’s recovery and growth today lies in the state-political sphere. Russia needs strong state power and must have it\". Detailing on his view Putin emphasized: \"Strong state power in Russia is a democratic, law-based, workable federal state\".\n\nRegarding the economic problems, Putin pointed out the need to significantly improve economic efficiency, the need of carrying out the coherent and result-based social policy aimed to battle the poverty and the need to provide the stable growth of people's well-being.\n\nThe article stated the importance of government support of science, education, culture, health care since \"[a] country in which the people are not healthy physically and psychologically, are poorly educated and illiterate, will never rise to the peaks of world civilisation\".\n\nThe article concluded with an alarmist statement that Russia was in the midst of one of the most difficult periods in its history: \"For the first time in the past 200–300 years, it is facing the real threat of slipping down to the second, and possibly even third, rank of world states\". To avoid that, there's a need of tremendous effort of all the intellectual, physical and moral forces of the nation because \"[e]verything depends on us, and us alone, on our ability to recognise the scale of the threat, to unite and apply ourselves to lengthy and hard work\".\n\nAs stated in the history course by Russian Doctors of History Barsenkov and Vdovin, the basic ideas of the article were represented in the election platform of Vladimir Putin and supported by the majority of country's citizens, leading to the victory of Vladimir Putin in the first round of the 2000 election, with 52 per cent of the votes cast.\n\nThe outline of Russia's foreign policy was presented by Vladimir Putin in his Address to Russia's Federal Assembly in April 2002: \"We are building constructive, normal relations with all the world's nations—I want to emphasise, with all the world's nations. However, I want to note something else: the norm in the international community, in the world today, is also harsh competition—for markets, for investment, for political and economic influence. And in this fight, Russia needs to be strong and competitive\". \"I want to stress that Russian foreign policy will in the future be organized in a strictly pragmatic way, based on our capabilities and national interests: military and strategic, economic and political. And also taking into account the interests of our partners, above all in the CIS\".\n\nIn his 2008 book, the Russian political commentator, the retired KGB lieutenant-general Nikolai Leonov, noted that Putin's program article was barely noticed then and never revisited later—a fact that Leonov regretted, because \"its content is most important for contrasting against his [Putin's] subsequent actions\" and thus figuring out Putin's pattern, under which \"words, more often than not, do not match his actions\".\n\nAccording to Dr. Mark Smith (March 2003), some of the main features of Putin's regime were the development of a corporatist system by pursuing close ties with business organizations, social stability and co-optation of opposition parties. He determined three main groupings in Putin's early leadership: 1) the \"siloviki\", 2) economic liberals and 3) supporters of \"the Family\", i.e. those who were close to Yeltsin.\n\nOlga Kryshtanovskaya, who carried out a sociological survey in 2004, put the relative number of \"siloviki\" in the Russian political elite at 25%. In Putin's \"inner circle\" which constitutes about 20 people, amount of \"siloviki\" rises to 58% and fades to 18–20% in parliament and 34% in the government. According to Kryshtanovskaya, there was no capture of power as Kremlin bureaucracy has called siloviks in order to \"restore order\". The process of \"siloviki\" coming into power has allegedly started since 1996, Boris Yeltsin's second term. \"Not personally Yeltsin, but the whole elite wished to stop the revolutionary process and consolidate the power\". When \"silovik\" Putin was appointed Prime Minister in 1999, the process boosted. According to Olga: \"Yes, Putin has brought siloviks with him. But that's not enough to understand the situation. Here's also an objective aspect: the whole political class wished them to come. They were called for service... There was a need of a strong arm, capable from point of view of the elite to establish order in the country\".\n\nKryshtanovskaya noted that there were also people who had worked in structures believed to be affiliated with the KGB/FSB, such as the Soviet Union Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Governmental Communications Commission, Ministry of Foreign Trade, Press Agency \"News\" and others. The work \"per se\" in such agencies would not necessarily involve contacts with security services, but would make it likely. Summing up the numbers of official and affiliated \"siloviki\", she came up with an estimate of 77% of such in the power.\n\nAccording to a Russian Public Opinion Foundation 2005 investigation, 34% of respondents think \"there is a lack of democracy in Russia because democratic rights and freedoms are not observed\" and also point on the lack of law and order. In the same time, 21% of respondents are sure there's too much of democracy in Russia and many of them point on the same drawbacks as the previous group: \"[T]he lack of law and order, irresponsibility and non-accountability of politicians\". According to the Foundation: \"As we can see, Russians' negative opinions about democracy are based on their dissatisfaction with contemporary conditions, while some respondents think the democratic model is not suitable in principal\". Considering the modern regime: \"It is interesting that most respondents think Putin's government marks the most democratic epoch in Russian history (29%), while second place goes to Brezhnev's times (14%). Some people mentioned Gorbachev and Yeltsin in this context (11% and 9%, respectively)\".\n\nAt the end of 2008, Lev Gudkov, based on the Levada Center polling data, pointed out the near-disappearance of public opinion as a socio-political institution in Putin's Russia and its replacement with the still-efficacious state propaganda.\n\nOn 9 July 2000 while speaking to the Russian Parliament, Putin advocated an economy policy which would have introduced a flat tax rate of 13% and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 24 percent. Putin also intended for small businesses to get better treatment under this economic reform package. Under Putin, the old system which included high tax rates has been replaced with a new system where companies can choose either a 6 percent tax on gross revenue or a 15 percent tax on profits.\n\nIn February 2009, Putin called for a single VAT rate to be \"as low as possible\" (at the time it stood at an average rate of 18 percent), which could be reduced to between 12 percent and 13 percent. The overall tax burden was lower in Russia under Putin than in most European countries.\n\nIn 2005, Putin launched National Priority Projects in the fields of health care, education, housing and agriculture. In his May 2006 annual speech, Putin proposed increasing maternity benefits and prenatal care for women. Putin was strident about the need to reform the judiciary considering the present federal judiciary \"Sovietesque\", wherein many of the judges hand down the same verdicts as they would under the old Soviet judiciary structure and preferring instead a judiciary that interpreted and implemented the code to the current situation. In 2005, responsibility for federal prisons was transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe most high-profile change within the national priority project frameworks was probably the 2006 across-the-board increase in wages in healthcare and education as well as the decision to modernise equipment in both sectors in 2006 and 2007.\n\nDuring Putin's government, poverty was cut more than half and real GDP has grown rapidly.\n\nIn 2006, chief of \"Business Week\"s Moscow bureau Jason Bush commented on the condition of Russian middle class: \"This group has grown from just 8 million in 2000 to 55 million today and now accounts for some 37% of the population, estimates Expert, a market research firm in Moscow. That's giving a lift to the mood in the country. The share of Russians who think life is 'not bad' has risen to 23% from just 7% in 1999, while those who find living conditions 'unacceptable' has dropped to 29% from 53%, according to a recent poll\". However, \"[n]ot everyone has shared in the prosperity. Far from it. The average Russian earns $330 a month, just 10% of the U.S. average. Only a third of households own a car, and many—particularly the elderly—have been left behind\".\n\nAt the end of Putin's second term, Jonathan Steele has commented on Putin's legacy: \"What, then, is Putin's legacy? Stability and growth, for starters. After the chaos of the 90s, highlighted by Yeltsin's attack on the Russian parliament with tanks in 1993 and the collapse of almost every bank in 1998, Putin has delivered political calm and a 7% annual rate of growth. Inequalities have increased and many of the new rich are grotesquely crass and cruel, but not all the Kremlin's vast revenues from oil and gas have gone into private pockets or are being hoarded in the government's \"stabilisation fund\". Enough has gone into modernising schools and hospitals so that people notice a difference. Overall living standards are up. The second Chechen war, the major blight on Putin's record, is almost over\".\n\nAccording to Dr Mark Smith (March 2003), Putin's regime had developed a \"corporatist system\" in the sense that under him the Kremlin was interested in close ties with business organizations such as the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Delovaya Rossiya and the trade union federation (FNPR). This was a part of the regime's attempts to involve broad sectors of society in the making and implementation of policy.\n\nThere is a school of thought which says that a number of Putin's steps in the economy (notably the fate of Yukos) were signs of a shift toward a system normally described as state capitalism, where \"the entirety of state-owned and controlled enterprises are run by and for the benefit of the cabal around Putin—a collection of former KGB colleagues, Saint Petersburg lawyers, and other political cronies\".\n\nAccording to Andrey Illarionov, advisor of Putin until 2005, Putin's regime was a new socio-political order \"distinct from any seen in our country before\" as members of the Corporation of Intelligence Service Collaborators had taken over the entire body of state power, followed an \"omertà\"-like behavior code and were \"given instruments conferring power upon others—membership \"perks\", such as the right to carry and use weapons\". According to Illarionov, this \"Corporation has seized key government agencies—the Tax Service, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Parliament, and the government-controlled mass media—which are now used to advance the interests of [Corporation] members. Through those agencies, every significant resource in the country—security/intelligence, political, economic, informational and financial—is being monopolized in the hands of Corporation members\". Members of the Corporation formed an isolated caste and according to an anonymous former KGB general cited by \"The Economist\", “[a] Chekist is a breed ... A good KGB heritage—a father or grandfather, say, who worked for the service—is highly valued by today's siloviki. Marriages between siloviki clans are also encouraged.\n\nJason Bush, chief of the Moscow bureau of the magazine \"Business Week\" has commented in December 2006 on troubling growth of government's role: \"The Kremlin has taken control of some two dozen Russian companies since 2004, including oil assets from Sibneft and Yukos, as well as banks, newspapers, and more. Despite his sporadic support for pro-market reforms, Putin has backed national champions such as energy concerns Gazprom and Rosneft. The private sector's share of output fell from 70% to 65% last year, while state-controlled companies now represent 38% of stock market capitalization, up from 22% a year ago\".\n\nOn 20 September 2008 and when the late 2000s recession had started to hit the well-being of Russia's top tycoons, the \"Financial Times\" said that \"Putinism was built on the understanding that if tycoons played by Kremlin rules they would prosper\".\n\nAlthough Russia's state intervention in the economy had been usually criticized in the West, a study by Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition (BOFIT) in 2008 showed that state intervention had had a positive impact on the corporate governance of many companies in Russia as the formal indications of the quality of corporate governance in Russia were higher in companies with state control or with a stake held by the government.\nIn June 2008, a group of Finnish economists wrote that the 2000s had so far been an economic boon for Russia, with GDP rising about 7% a year and by the beginning of 2008 Russia had become one of the ten largest economies in the world.\n\nIn Putin's first term, many new economic reforms were implemented along the lines of the \"Gref program\". The multitude of reforms ranged from a flat income tax to bank reform, from land ownership to improvements in conditions for small businesses.\n\nIn 1998, over 60% of industrial turnover in Russia was based on barter and various monetary surrogates. The use of such alternatives to money now today fallen out of favour, which has boosted economic productivity significantly. Besides raising wages and consumption, Putin's government has received broad praise also for eliminating this problem.\n\nIn the opinion of the Finnish researchers, the most high-profile change within the national priority project frameworks was probably the 2006 across-the-board increase in wages in healthcare and education as well as the decision to modernise equipment in both sectors in 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe rise in the overall living standards further deepened Russia's social and geographical discrepancies. In July 2008, Edward Lucas of \"The Economist\" wrote: \"The colossal bribe-collecting opportunities created by Putinism have heightened the divide between big cities (particularly Moscow) and the rest of the country\".\n\nIn November 2008, the retired KGB lieutenant-general Nikolai Leonov, in assessing the overall results of Putin's economic policies for the period of 8 years, said that [w]ithin this period, there has only been one positive thing, if you leave aside the trivia. And that thing is the price of oil and natural gas\". In the closing paragraphs of his 2008 book, the retired general said: \"Behind the gilded facade of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, there lies a demolished country that, under the current characteristics of those in power, has no chance to restore itself as one of the developed states of the world\".\n\nOn 29 November 2008, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of Russian Federation (the largest opposition group within Russia with its 13% of seats in the national Parliament), in his speech before the 13th Party Congress lamented that due to \"heroic efforts\" of the \"Yeltsinites\" the country has lost 5 out of the 22 million square kilometers of its \"historical territory\" and that Russia faces de-industrialization, de-population and mental debilitation. The ruling group has in his opinion no notable successes to boast of, no clear plan of action and is only focussed on staying in power at all costs.\n\nTo characterize the kind of state Putin had built in socio-economic terms, in early 2008 professor Marshall I. Goldman coined the term \"petrostate\" in \"Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia\", where he \"inter alia\" argued that while Putin had followed the advice of economic advisers in implementing reforms such as a 13 percent flat tax and creating a stabilization fund to lessen inflationary pressure, his main personal contribution was the idea of creating \"national champions\" and the renationalization of major energy assets. In his June 2008 interview, Marshall Goldman said that in his opinion Putin had created a new class of oligarchs, whom some called \"silogarchs\", Russia having come in second in the \"Forbes\" magazine list of the world's billionaires after only the United States.\n\nIn December 2008, Anders Åslund pointed out that Putin’s chief project had been \"to develop huge, unmanageable state-owned mastodons, considered “national champions”\", which had \"stalemated large parts of the economy through their inertia and corruption while impeding diversification\".\n\nThe concept of \"Putinism\" was described in a positive sense by Russian political scientist Andranik Migranyan. According to Migranyan, Putin came into office when the worst regime was established: the economy was \"totally decentralized\" and \"the state had lost central authority while the oligarchs robbed the country and controlled its power institutions\". In two years, Putin has restored hierarchy of power, ending the omnipotence of regional elites as well as destroying political influence of \"oligarchs and oligopolies in the federal center\". Boris Yeltsin-era non-institutional center of power commonly called \"The Family\" was ruined, which according to Migranyan in turn undercut the positions of the actors such as Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, who had sought to privatize the Russian state \"with all of its resources and institutions\".\n\nMigranyan said that Putin began establishing common rules of the game for all actors and started with an attempt to restore the role of the government as the institution expressing combined interests of the citizens and \"capable of controlling the state’s financial, administrative and media resources\". According to Migranyan: \"Naturally, in line with Russian traditions, any attempt to increase the state’s role causes an intense repulsion on the part of the liberal intellectuals, not to mention a segment of the business community that is not interested in the strengthening of state power until all of the most attractive state property has been seized\". Migranyan claimed that oligopolies' view of democracy was set on a premise of whether they were close to the center of power, rather than \"objective characteristics and estimates of the situation in the country\". Migranyan said \"free\" media, owned by e.g. Berezovsky and Gusinsky, were nothing similar to free media as understood by the West, but served their only economic and political interests while \"all other politicians and analysts were denied the right to go on the air\".\n\nMigranyan sees enhancement of the role of the law enforcement agencies as a trial to set barriers against criminals, \"particularly those in big business\".\n\nMigranyan sees in 2004 fruition of the social revolution initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, whose aims were to rebuild the social system, saying that \"the absolute dominance of private ownership in Russia, recognized by all political forces today, has been the greatest achievement and result of this social revolution\".\n\nAccording to Migranyan, the major trouble of Russian democracy is inability of civil society to rule the state, underdevelopment of public interests. He sees that as the consequence of Yeltsin's era family-ruled state being unable to pursue \"a favorable environment for mid-sized and small businesses\". Migranyan sees modern Russia as democracy, at least formally. While \"the state, having restored its effectiveness and control over its own resources, has become the largest corporation responsible for establishing the rules of the game\". Migranyan wonders how much might this influence extend in future. In 2004, he saw two possibilities for the Putin regime: either transformation into a consolidated democracy, either bureaucratic authoritarianism. However, \"if Russia is lagging behind the developed capitalist nations in regard to the consolidation of democracy, it is not the quality of democracy, but rather its amount and the balance between civil society and the state\".\n\nThe report by Andrew C. Kuchins in November 2007 said that \"Russia today is a hybrid regime that might best be termed “illiberal internationalism”, although neither word is fully accurate and requires considerable qualification. From being a weakly institutionalized, fragile, and in many ways distorted proto-democracy in the 1990s, Russia under Vladimir Putin has moved back in the direction of a highly centralized authoritarianism, which has characterized the state for most of its 1,000-year history. But it is an authoritarian state where the consent of the governed is essential. Given the experience of the 1990s and the Kremlin’s propaganda emphasizing this period as one of chaos, economic collapse, and international humiliation, the Russian people have no great enthusiasm for democracy and remain politically apathetic in light of the extraordinary economic recovery and improvement in lifestyles for so many over the last eight years. The emergent, highly centralized government, combined with a weak and submissive society, is the hallmark of traditional Russian paternalism\".\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Der Spiegel\", Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn commented on the Putin regime: \"Putin has inherited plundered and downtrodden country with demoralized and grown poor majority of the population. And he took on its possible — to be noted, gradual, slow — recovering. These efforts were not right at the moment noticed, not speaking about being appreciated. And can you point on examples in history when measures for recovering strength of governmental management would be benevolently met from beyond the country?\".\n\nAccording to a 2007 article of Dimitri Simes published in \"Foreign Affairs:\" \"With high energy prices, sound fiscal policies, and tamed oligarchs, the Putin regime no longer needs international loans or economic assistance and has no trouble attracting major foreign investment despite growing tension with Western governments. Within Russia, relative stability, prosperity, and a new sense of dignity have tempered popular disillusionment with growing state control and the heavy-handed manipulation of the political process\".\n\nBBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall in her 2007 article and after describing the \"scarred decade\" of the 1990s with \"rampant hyperinflation\" harsh Yeltsin's policies, population decrease rate like that for a nation in a war, the country turning \"from superpower into beggar\", wonders: \"So who can blame Russians for welcoming the relative stability Putin has presided over during the past seven years, even if other aspects of his rule have cast an authoritarian shadow? In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided\".\n\nIn June 2000, Putin's decree was approved by the \"Concept of the Russian Federation's foreign policy\". According to this document, the main objectives of foreign policy are the following:\n\nIn a 2010 article in the German newspaper \"Sueddeutsche Zeitung\" dedicated to the participation in the annual economic forum it was proposed to create a European economic alliance stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon. As steps towards the creation of the alliance indicates a possible unification of customs tariffs and technical regulations, the abolition of the visa regime with the European Union.\n\nIn August 2013, according to experts the Russian-American relations have reached their lowest point since the end of the Cold War era. The September President Barack Obama's visit to Moscow and his talks with Putin were canceled due to temporary asylum in Russia, a former employee of the CIA Edward Snowden, disagreements on the situation in Syria and the problems with human rights in Russia.\n\nOn 11 September 2013, \"The New York Times\" published an article by Putin \"Russia calls for caution\". It is written in the form of an open letter to the American people, containing an explanation of the Russian political line against the Syrian conflict. It is also the Russian president warns against President Obama's thesis \"About the exclusivity of the American nation\". The article caused a mixed reaction of the world community.\n\nIn 2013, Putin won the first place in the annual ranking of most influential people in the world by \"Forbes\". In 2014, the result of repeated.\n\nIn September 2015, Putin spoke for the first time in 10 years at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York City. In his speech, he urged to form a broad anti-terrorist coalition to combat ISIS and blamed the events in Ukraine on \"external forces\", warned the West against unilateral sanctions, attempts to push Russia from the world market and export of color revolutions. For the first time, he also held a meeting with President Obama for two years to discuss the situation in Syria and Ukraine, but in the outcome of the negotiations and despite the persistence of deep contradictions the experts saw a faint hope for a compromise and the warming of relations between the two countries.\n\nRussian politician Boris Nemtsov and commentator Kara-Murza define Putinism in Russia as \"a one party system, censorship, a puppet parliament, ending of an independent judiciary, firm centralization of power and finances, and hypertrophied role of special services and bureaucracy, in particular in relation to business\".\n\nRussia's nascent middle class showed few signs of political activism under the regime as Masha Lipman reported: \"As with the majority overall, those in the middle-income group have accepted the paternalism of Vladimir Putin's government and remained apolitical and apathetic\".\n\nIn December 2007, the Russian sociologist Igor Eidman (VCIOM) categorized the Putin regime as \"the power of bureaucratic oligarchy\" which had \"the traits of extreme right-wing dictatorship — the dominance of state-monopoly capital in the economy, \"silovoki\" structures in governance, clericalism and statism in ideology\".\n\nIn August 2008, \"The Economist\" wrote about the virtual demise of both Russian and Soviet intelligentsia in post-Soviet Russia and noted: \"Putinism was made strong by the absence of resistance from the part of society that was meant to provide intellectual opposition\".\n\nIn early February 2009, Aleksander Auzan, an economist and board member at a research institute set up by Dmitry Medvedev, said that in the Putin system \"there is not a relationship between the authorities and the people through Parliament or through nonprofit organizations or other structures. The relationship to the people is basically through television. And under the conditions of the crisis, that can no longer work\".\n\nAbout the same time, Vladimir Ryzhkov pointed out that a bill Medvedev had sent to the State Duma in late January 2009, when signed into law, will allow Kremlin-friendly regional legislatures to remove opposition mayors who were elected by popular vote: \"It is no coincidence that Medvedev has taken aim at the country's mayors. Mayoral elections were the last bastion of direct elections after the Duma cancelled the popular vote for governors in 2005. Independent mayors were the only source of political competition against governors who were loyal to the Kremlin and United Russia. Now one of the few remaining checks and balances against the monopoly on executive power in the regions will be removed. After the law is signed by Medvedev, the power vertical will be extended one step further to reach every mayor in the country\".\n\nIt is claimed that Putin models himself on the Tsar Peter the Great, whose reign is reminiscent of a Russian imperial greatness which the Kremlin is keen to promote. A presidential commission asked Putin in 2003 to grant the request of one of Nicholas II's last surviving relatives to rehabilitate the House of Romanov. Willing to regain the imperial grandeur of Russia, Putin invited the Romanov royal family to return to Russia in July 2015. According to the presidential commission, this move would represent a significant final step in Russia's journey to embrace its imperial history.\n\nAn alliance has been forged between the Church and the Kremlin since Putin became President of the Russian Federation. An adherent of the Russian Orthodox Church, Putin has allowed the regaining by the Orthodox Church of much of the importance that the Church had enjoyed in the Russian Empire and has won the enthusiastic support of its religious leaders.\n\nThe first politically controversial step made by Putin, then the FSB Director, was restoring in June 1999 a memorial plaque to Yuri Andropov on the facade of the building, where the KGB had been headquartered.\n\nIn late 2000, Putin submitted a bill to the State Duma to use the Soviet anthem as Russia's national anthem. The Duma voted in favor. The music remained identical, but new lyrics were written.\n\nIn April 2005 during his formal address to Russia's Parliament, President Putin said: \"Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and compatriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself\".\n\nIn September 2003, Putin was quoted as saying: \"The Soviet Union is a very complicated page in the history of our peoples. It was heroic and constructive, and it was also tragic. But it is a page that has been turned. It's over, the boat has sailed. Now we need to think about the present and the future of our peoples\".\n\nIn February 2004, Putin said: \"It is my deep conviction that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale. I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems.\" He went on to say, \"Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward\". In December 2007, he said in the interview to the \"Time\" magazine: \"Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I think that to a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people\".\nIn August 2008, \"The Economist\" claimed: \"Russia today is ruled by the KGB elite, has a Soviet anthem, servile media, corrupt courts and a rubber-stamping parliament. A new history textbook proclaims that the Soviet Union, although not a democracy, was 'an example for millions of people around the world of the best and fairest society'\".\n\nPutin has said that Joseph Stalin's legacy cannot be judged in black and white in 2009. Although Putin's policies have been likened to the Soviet era, he has received a lukewarm response by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF). On the other hand, Roger Boyes considers him more of a latter-day Brezhnev than a clone of Stalin.\n\nIn November, 2008, \"International Herald Tribune\" stated:\nThe Kremlin in the Putin era has often sought to maintain as much sway over the portrayal of history as over the governance of the country. In seeking to restore Russia's standing, Putin and other officials have stoked a nationalism that glorifies Soviet triumphs while playing down or even whitewashing the system's horrors. As a result, throughout Russia, many archives detailing killings, persecution and other such acts committed by the Soviet authorities have become increasingly off-limits. The role of the security services seems especially delicate, perhaps because Putin is a former KGB agent who headed the agency's successor, the FSB, in the late 1990s.\n\nIn August 2014, he rejected Vladimir Zhirinovsky's proposal to return the Imperial flag and anthem.\n\nShortly after the Beslan terror act in September 2004, Putin enhanced a Kremlin-sponsored program aimed at \"improving Russia's image\" abroad. According to an unnamed former Duma deputy, there existed a classified article in the RF federal budget that provided for financing measures to this purpose.\n\nOne of the major projects of the program was the creation in 2005 of \"Russia Today\"—a rolling English-language TV news channel providing 24-hour news coverage, modeled on CNN. Towards its start-up budget, $30 million of public funds were allocated. A CBS News story on the launch of Russia Today quoted Boris Kagarlitsky as saying it was \"very much a continuation of the old Soviet propaganda services\". In 2007, \"Russia Today\" employed nearly 100 English-speaking special correspondents worldwide.\n\nRussia's deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin said in August 2008 in the context of the Russia-Georgia conflict: \"Western media is a well-organized machine, which is showing only those pictures that fit in well with their thoughts. We find it very difficult to squeeze our opinion into the pages of their newspapers\". Similar views were expressed by some Western commentators.\n\nWilliam Dunbar, who was reporting then for \"Russia Today\" from Georgia, said he had not been on air since he mentioned Russian bombing of targets inside Georgia on 9 August 2008 and had to resign over what he claimed was biased coverage by the outlet.\n\nThe public relations efforts notwithstanding, according to an opinion poll released in February 2009 by the BBC World Service Russia's image around the world had taken a dramatic dive in 2008: forty-two percent of respondents said they had a \"mainly negative\" view of Russia, according to the poll, which surveyed more than 13,000 people in 21 countries in December and January.\n\nIn June 2007, \"Vedomosti\" reported that the Kremlin had been intensifying its official lobbying activities in the United States since 2003, among other things hiring such companies as Hannaford Enterprises and Ketchum.\n\nThe 2008 power-switching operation between Putin and Medvedev was widely seen as a \"pro forma\" action after the constitution did not allow Putin to be reelected for a third term in the 2008 presidential election. Both scholars and the Russian population disagree on whether the \"Putin-Medvedev tandemocracy\" represented the paramount leadership of Putin, with Medvedev being just a mascot, or if the power was shared.\n\nIn June 2001, the BBC noted that a year after Putin took office, the Russian media had been reflecting on what some saw as a growing personality cult around him: Russia's TV-6 television had shown a vast choice of portraits of Putin on sale at a shopping mall in an underground passage near Moscow's Park of Culture.\n\nIn October 2007, some scenes at the United Russia congress caused Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who was allied to Russia within the \"Union State\", to recall the Soviet times, complete with the official adoration towards the Communist Party leader and talking to Russia's regional press representatives he said that in Russia Putin's personality cult was being created.\n\nIn 2008, the Paris-based AFP reported that ahead of the December parliamentary and March presidential elections, in which despite being required by the constitution to leave office Putin was widely expected to find some way to retain power as his personality cult was gathering pace.\n\nAfter Medvedev was elected President in March 2008, United States government-funded Radio Liberty reported that during his eight-year presidency Putin had managed to build a personality cult around himself similar to those created by Soviet leaders. Although there had not been giant statues of Putin put up across the country (like those of Stalin before), he had the honor of being the only Russian leader to have had a pop song written about him: \"I want a man like Putin\", which hit the charts in 2002.\n\nAccording to some scholars, Russia under Putin has been transformed into an \"FSB state\".\n\nShortly after becoming Russian Prime Minister, Putin was reported to have joked to a group of his KGB associates: \"A group of FSB colleagues dispatched to work undercover in the government has successfully completed its first mission\".\n\nThe former Securitate Lieutenant General and defector Ion Mihai Pacepa said in his interview for conservative \"FrontPage Magazine\" in 2006 that \"former KGB officers are running\" Russia and that FSB, which he called \"the KGB successor\" had the right to monitor the population electronically, control political process, search private property, cooperate with employees of the federal government, create front enterprises, investigate cases and run its own prisons.\n\nVarious 2006 estimates showed that Russia had above 200,000 members of the FSB, or one FSB employee for every 700 citizens of Russia (the exact number of the overall FSB staff is classified). The Russian Armed Forces General Staff as well as its subordinate structures, such as the Russian Strategic Missile Troops headquarters, are not submitted to the Federal Security Service, but the FSB might be interested in monitoring such structures as they intrinsically involve state secrets and various degrees of admittance to them. The Law on Federal Security Service which defines its functions and establishes its structure does not involve such tasks as managing strategic branches of national industry, controlling political groups, or infiltrating the federal government.\n\nIn 2006, political scientist Julie Anderson wrote: \"Under Russian Federation President and former career foreign intelligence officer Vladimir Putin, an 'FSB State' composed of chekists has been established and is consolidating its hold on the country. Its closest partners are organized criminals. In a world marked by a globalized economy and information infrastructure, and with transnational terrorism groups utilizing all available means to achieve their goals and further their interests, Russian intelligence collaboration with these elements is potentially disastrous\".\n\nRussian historian Yuri Felshtinsky compared the takeover of the Russian state by the \"siloviki\" to an imaginary scenario of the Gestapo coming to power in Germany after World War II. He pointed out a fundamental difference between the secret police and ordinary political parties, even totalitarian ones, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, i.e. Russia's secret police organizations are wont to employ the so-called active measures and extrajudicial killings, hence they killed Alexander Litvinenko and directed Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their political objectives, according to Felstinsky.\n\nIn April 2006, Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former Middle East specialist at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), presented a list of those who had \"mysteriously\" died during Putin's presidency and wrote: \"Vladimir Putin's Russia is a new phenomenon in Europe: a state defined and dominated by former and active-duty security and intelligence officers. Not even fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union – all undoubtedly much worse creations than Russia – were as top-heavy with intelligence talent. [...] There is no historical precedent for a society so dominated by former and active-duty internal-security and intelligence officials – men who rose up in a professional culture in which murder could be an acceptable, even obligatory, business practice. [...] Those who operated within the Soviet sphere were the most malevolent in their practices. These men mentored and shaped Putin and his closest friends and allies. It is therefore unsurprising that Putin's Russia has become an assassination-happy state where detention, interrogation, and torture – all tried and true methods of the Soviet KGB – are used to silence the voices of untoward journalists and businessmen who annoy or threaten Putin's FSB state\".\n\nOne of the leading members of Putin's ruling elite, Nikolai Patrushev, Director of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (August 1999–May 2008) and subsequently Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, was known for his propagation of the idea of \"chekists\" as \"neo-aristocrats\" ().\n\nA report by Andrew C. Kuchins in November 2007 said: \"The predominance of the intelligence services and mentality is a core feature of Putin’s Russia that marks a major and critical discontinuity from not only the 1990s but all of Soviet and Russian history. During the Soviet period, the Communist Party provided the glue holding the system together. During the 1990s, there was no central organizing institution or ideology. Now, with Putin, it is “former” KGB professionals who dominate the Russian ruling elite. This is a special kind of brotherhood, a mafia-like culture in which only a few can be trusted. The working culture is secretive and nontransparent\".\n\nIn 2000, Russia's political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky called Putinism \"the highest and culminating stage of bandit capitalism in Russia\". He said that \"Russia is not corrupt. Corruption is what happens in all countries when businessmen offer officials large bribes for favors. Today’s Russia is unique. The businessmen, the politicians, and the bureaucrats are the same people. They have privatized the country’s wealth and taken control of its financial flows\". According to scholar Karen Dawisha, 110 of Putin's cronies control 35% of Russia's wealth.\n\nIn concluding her book \"A Russian Diary\" (2007), the Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya said: \"Our state authorities today are only interested in making money. That is literally all they are interested in\".\n\nSuch views were shared by politologist Julie Anderson who said the same person can be a Russian intelligence officer, an organized criminal and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: \"I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to strike up a conversation with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants to talk to you about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement\".\n\nAccording to the political scientist Dmitri Glinsky, \"[t]he idea of Russia, Inc.—or better, Russia, Ltd.—derives from the Russian brand of libertarian anarchism viewing the state as just another private armed gang claiming special rights on the basis of its unusual power\", \"this is a state conceived as a stationary bandit imposing stability by eliminating the roving bandits of the previous era\".\n\nIn April 2006, Putin himself expressed extreme irritation about the \"de facto\" privatization of the customs sphere, where smart officials and entrepreneurs \"merged in ecstasy\".\n\nAccording to the estimates published in \"Putin and Gazprom\" by Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Milov, Putin and his friends pilfered assets of $80 billion from Gazprom during his second term as president.\n\nOn 29 February 2009, Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev claimed that Prime Minister Putin's strategy for economic recovery was based on cronyism and was fueling corruption and also said: \"We have two Putins. There are lots of words, but the system doesn't work\".\n\nThe Panama Papers revealed a network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn (£1.4bn) that seem to lay a trail to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The transactions include fake share deals; multimillion-dollar charges for vague \"consultancy\" services; and repeated payments of large sums in \"compensation\" for allegedly cancelled share deals and a $200m loan for $1. Though his name does not appear in any of the records, the data shows how deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage made members of his close circle fabulously wealthy.\n\nPolitical scientist Irina Pavlova said that chekists were not merely a corporation of people united to expropriate financial assets as they had long-standing political objectives of transforming Moscow to the Third Rome and an ideology of \"containing\" the United States. Columnist George Will emphasized in 2003 the nationalistic nature of Putinism: \"Putinism is becoming a toxic brew of nationalism directed against neighboring nations, and populist envy, backed by assaults of state power, directed against private wealth. Putinism is a form of national socialism without the demonic element of its pioneer\". According to Illarionov, the ideology of chekists is nashism (\"ours-ism\"), the selective application of rights.\n\nAccording to Dmitri Trenin (2004), Head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, the then Russia was one of the least ideological countries around the world: \"Ideas hardly matter, whereas interests reign supreme. It is not surprising then that the worldview of Russian elites is focused on financial interests. Their practical deeds in fact declare In capital we trust\". Trenin described Russia's elite involved in the process of policy-making as people who largely owned the country. Most of them were not public politicians, but the majority were bureaucratic capitalists. According to Trenin, \"having survived in a ruthless domestic business and political environment, Russian leaders are well adjusted to rough competition and will take that mindset to the world stage\". However, Trenin called Russian-Western relations, from Moscow's perspective, \"competitive, but not antagonistic\". He said that \"Russia does not crave world domination, and its leaders do not dream of restoring the Soviet Union. They plan to rebuild Russia as a great power with a global reach, organized as a supercorporation\".\n\nAccording to Trenin, Russians \"no longer recognize U.S. or European moral authority\". He said that \"from the Russian perspective, there is no absolute freedom anywhere in the world, no perfect democracy, and no government that does not lie to its people. In essence, all are equal by virtue of sharing the same imperfections. Some are more powerful than others, however, and that is what really counts\".\n\nIn May 2000, \"The Guardian\" wrote: \"When a band of former Soviet dissidents declared in February that Putinism was nothing short of modernised Stalinism, they were widely dismissed as hysterical prophets of doom. 'Authoritarianism is growing harsher, society is being militarised, the military budget is increasing,' they warned, before calling on the West to 're-examine its attitude towards the Kremlin leadership, to cease indulging it in its barbaric actions, its dismantlement of democracy and suppression of human rights.' In the light of Putin's actions during his first days in power, their warnings have gained an uneasy new resonance\".\n\nIn February 2007, Arnold Beichman, a conservative research fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote in \"The Washington Times\" that \"Putinism in the 21st century has become as significant a watchword as Stalinism was in the 20th\".\n\nAlso in 2007, Lionel Beehner, formerly a senior writer for the Council on Foreign Relations, maintained that on Putin's watch nostalgia for Stalin had grown even among young Russians and Russians' neo-Stalinism manifesting itself in several ways.\n\nIn February 2007, responding to a listener's assertion that \"Putin had steered the country to Stalinism\" and \"all entrepreneurs\" were being jailed in Russia, the Russian opposition radio host Yevgeniya Albats said: \"Come on, this is not true; there is no Stalinism, no concentration camps—thankfully\". She went on to say that if citizens of the country would not be critical of what was occurring around them, referring to the \"orchestrated, or genuine\" calls for the \"tsar to stay on\", that \"could blaze the trail for very ugly things and a very tough regime in our country\".\n\nPutin has said that Stalin's legacy cannot be judged in black and white in 2009. Although Putin's policies have been likened to the Soviet era, he has received a lukewarm response by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party (KPRF). Roger Boyes considers Putin more of a latter-day Leonid Brezhnev than a clone of Stalin.\n\nWhile some might argue that Putin’s leadership does not reflect an ideology, Chris Miller has discerned three beliefs which are consistent with Putin’s announcements and account for his actions. This 3-part ideology must be understood in the context of the history of Russia and of Putin himself. When Putin began his political career the Soviet Union was unable to effectively collect taxes or provide services, in part, due to inadequate governmental control of the empire. Putin believed that the government needed to first establish strong centralized control of the empire. To maintain that central control has always been his highest priority. Second, to keep the populace supportive of his government and thus to prevent revolt, Putin believes that the key is rising wages and pensions. In that way he maintains enough of a popular base that the populace tends to tolerate other problems. Third, economic progress depends heavily on private enterprises but only so long as those enterprises do not interfere with either central government control or rising salaries and pensions. When a private enterprise threatens either belief one or two, then the government takes control of the enterprise so that the enterprise supports beliefs one and two. Of course, these three beliefs are not followed without some compromises, but Miller well argues that these beliefs help explain the behavior of Putin.\n\n\n"}

He is considered a jurist of the class of Shaykh Tusi.\n\nAbu Ali Hamzeh Ibn Abdul Aziz, known as Sallar Deylami (died in 448 or 463 Lunar Hijrah) was a Shia Jurist and religious scholar during the fifth lunar hijrah. He was born in the last half of fourth lunar hijrah, in Deylaman. He was the candidate of Shaykh Mufid and Sharif al-Murtaza in the affairs of teaching and education. He was versed in different disciplines and subjects but his dominance in fiqh is more prevalent. He is considered to be an eminent pupil of Shaykh Mufid and Sayyed Murtaza. He is also considered to be an important religious scholar after the occultation of Imam Mahdi the twelfth Shia Imam. His title, Abu Ya'li, designates dignity and superiority. The name \"Sallar\" may be an Arabized form of the Persian \"Salar\".\n\nAllameh Hilli considered Sallar among the eminent Shia jurists and writers. Abul Qasem khoei knows Sallar as trustworthy and reliable in tradition and jurisprudence. Some scholars like Soyuti count Sallar among the men of knowledge of Nahv (the grammar of the Arabic language). He also counted among ten \"Al-Marāsim al-‘Alawīyah fī al-aḥkām al-Nabawīyah\". This book is considered among the early books on Shia jurisprudence. The part on peace is an independent section in Al-Marasem.\n\nThere are two eminent works by him written about shia jurisprudence. One of them is Tatmīm al-mulakhkhaṣ considered as a glossary on the book of Sharif Murtaza's \"al-Mulakhkhaṣ\". The book of Tatmim is lost. The other eminent book is called \"Kitāb al-marāsim\" many times published.\n\nHe believed in the prohibition of creating sculpture. In addition, he divided criminals according to their intention of causing harm or not, into intentional, deliberate action and quasi-delibrate. Also he believes in legality of praying on Friday provided that the presence of infallible Imam or someone on behalf of him is included.\n\nIn 2013, a congress was held for the sake of his place in Shia jurisprudence at the University of Tabriz in Iran. Some Mujtahid such as Ayatollah Nouri Hamedany and Jafar Sobhany delivered messages to this conference.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2314552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2314552", "title": "Saneatsu Mushanokōji", "text": "Saneatsu Mushanokōji\n\nBorn in Kōjimachi, Chiyoda, Tokyo Saneatsu was the eighth son of Viscount Mushanokōji Saneyo, who died when Saneatsu was age two. Raised mostly by his mother. Saneatsu was a frail and sickly youth, unable to compete in the physical activities at the Gakushūin Peers' School. To compensate, he developed his debating skills and developed an interest in literature. During his time at this school he became friends with Naoya Shiga, and was introduced by his uncle to the Bible and the works of Tolstoy. Saneatsu enrolled in the sociology department of Tokyo Imperial University, but left without graduating in 1907 to form a literary group with Kinoshita Rigen, Shiga Naoya, Arishima Takeo, and Ogimachi Kinkazu (). They named the group \"Jūyokkakai\" (\"The Fourteenth Day Club\"). This group evolved into the \"Shirakaba\" (\"White Birch\") literary coterie, and began publishing a literary magazine of the same name in 1910. In 1913, Saneatsu married Fusako Miyagi, a woman to whom he had earlier been introduced by Kokichi Otake. Both Miyagi and Otake were members of the women's literary association (and publishers of the journal of the same name), \"Bluestocking\".\n\nAs a key member of \"Shirakaba\", Mushanokōji in 1910 published his work in its magazine. This was followed by , in 1912. Through the medium of \"Shirakaba\", Mushanokōji began moving away from the Tolstoy ideal of self-sacrifice, and promoted his philosophy of humanism as an alternative to then-popular form of naturalism. While his humanism borrowed some elements from naturalism, he in general believed that humanity controlled its own destiny through the assertion of will, whereas the naturalists tended to see the individual as powerless and desperate against forces beyond personal control.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Mushanokōji turned again to Tolstoy for inspiration and for the further development of his humanitarianism philosophy. During this time, he published (1915), a play involving a choice between self-love and love for mankind. He relocated to what is now part of Abiko, Chiba in 1916, together with Shiga Naoya and Yanagi Sōetsu.\n\nIn 1918, Mushanokōji took the next step in the development of his philosophy by moving to the mountains of Kijō, Miyazaki in Kyūshū, and establishing a quasi-socialistic utopian commune, Atarashiki-mura (New Village) along vaguely Tolstoyan lines. Soon afterwards, he published (1919), a novel presenting his image of the ideal human; and (1920), a novel portraying the victory of humanism over ego. His idealism appears in his autobiographical novel (1923), and in the play (1922). \nThe commune also published its own literary magazine, \"Atarashiki-mura\". In the 1920s, while running the commune, Mushanokōji was very prolific in his literary output. However, Mushanokōji tired of the social experiment and left the village in 1926; a dam project forced it to relocate to Saitama Prefecture in 1939, where it still exists.\n\nAfter the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, Mushanokōji returned to Tokyo to run an art gallery, and started to sell his own paintings, mostly still lifes depicting pumpkins and other vegetables. Publication of \"Shirakaba\" was suspended after the earthquake, but Mushanokōji went on to bring out the literary magazine, \"Fuji\", with the novelist and playwright Nagayo Yoshirō. During this period, he turned his attention to writing historical novels or biographical novels, such as \"Ninomiya Sontoku,\" about the 19th century farm technologist and agricultural philosopher.\n\nThrough the 1930s and 1940s, he faded from the literary world. Encouraged by his older brother Kintomo Mushanokōji, who was the Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany, he traveled throughout Europe in 1936. In 1946, he was appointed to a seat in the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan. However, four months later he was purged from public office by the American Occupation authorities, due to his (1942), supporting the actions of the Japanese government in World War II.\n\nMushanokōji made a literary comeback with his novel (1949–1950). He was awarded the Order of Culture in 1951, and became a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1952.\n\nMushanokōji lived to the age of 90. He died at the Jikei University School of Medicine Hospital in Komae, Tokyo of uremia. His grave is at the Chūō Reien in the city of Hachiōji, close to Tokyo. His home in Chōfu, Tokyo, where he lived from 1955 to 1976 has been turned into a memorial museum.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "327350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327350", "title": "Taiji (philosophy)", "text": "Taiji (philosophy)\n\nTaiji () is a Chinese cosmological term for the \"Supreme Ultimate\" state of undifferentiated absolute and infinite potential, the oneness before duality, from which Yin and Yang originate, can be compared with the old \"Wuji\" (無極, \"without ridgepole\").\n\nThe term \"Taiji\" and its other spelling \"T'ai chi\" (using Wade–Giles as opposed to Pinyin) are most commonly used in the West to refer to \"Taijiquan\" (or \"T'ai chi ch'uan\", 太極拳), an internal martial art, Chinese meditation system and health practice. This article, however, refers only to the use of the term in Chinese philosophy and Taoist spirituality.\n\nThe word 太極 comes from \"I Ching\": \"易有太極，是生兩儀，兩儀生四象，四象生八卦，八卦定吉凶，吉凶生大業。\"\n\n\"Taiji\" () is a compound of \"tai\" \"great; grand; supreme; extreme; very; too\" (a superlative variant of \"da\" \"big; large; great; very\") and \"ji\" \"pole; roof ridge; highest/utmost point; extreme; earth's pole; reach the end; attain; exhaust\". In analogy with the figurative meanings of English \"pole\", Chinese \"ji\" 極 \"ridgepole\" can mean \"geographical pole; direction\" (e.g., \"siji\" 四極 \"four corners of the earth; world's end\"), \"magnetic pole\" (\"Beiji\" 北極 \"North Pole\" or \"yinji\" 陰極 \"negative pole; cathode\"), or \"celestial pole\" (\"baji\" 八極 \"farthest points of the universe; remotest place\"). Combining the two words, means \"the source, the beginning of the world\".\n\nCommon English translations of the cosmological \"Taiji\" are the \"Supreme Ultimate\" (Le Blanc 1985, Zhang and Ryden 2002) or \"Great Ultimate\" (Chen 1989, Robinet 2008); but other versions are the \"Supreme Pole\" (Needham and Ronan 1978), \"Great Absolute\", or \"Supreme Polarity\" (Adler 1999).\n\n\"Taiji\" references are found in Chinese classic texts associated with many schools of Chinese philosophy.\n\nZhang and Ryden explain the ontological necessity of \"Taiji\".\nAny philosophy that asserts two elements such as the \"yin-yang\" of Chinese philosophy will also look for a term to reconcile the two, to ensure that both belong to the same sphere of discourse. The term 'supreme ultimate' performs this role in the philosophy of the \"Book of Changes\". In the Song dynasty it became a metaphysical term on a par with the Way. (2002:179) \n\nThe Daoist classic \"Zhuangzi\" introduced the \"Taiji\" concept. One of the (ca. 3rd century BCE) \"Inner Chapters\" contrasts \"Taiji\" 太極 \"great ultimate\" (tr. \"zenith\") and \"Liuji\" 六極 \"six ultimates; six cardinal directions\" (tr. \"nadir\").\nThe Way has attributes and evidence, but it has no action and no form. It may be transmitted but cannot be received. It may be apprehended but cannot be seen. From the root, from the stock, before there was heaven or earth, for all eternity truly has it existed. It inspirits demons and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It lies above the zenith but is not high; it lies beneath the nadir but is not deep. It is prior to heaven and earth, but is not ancient; it is senior to high antiquity, but it is not old. (tr. Mair 1994:55) \n\nThe (2nd century BCE) \"Huainanzi\" mentions a Daoist \"Zhenren\" \"true person; perfected person\" and the \"Taiji\" \"Supreme Ultimate\" that transcends categories like yin and yang, exemplified with the \"yinyang\" \"fusui\" and \"fangzhu\" mirrors.\nThe \"fu-sui\" 夫煫 (burning mirror) gathers fire energy from the sun; the \"fang-chu\" 方諸 (moon mirror) gathers dew from the moon. What are [contained] between Heaven and Earth, even an expert calculator cannot compute their number. Thus, though the hand can handle and examine extremely small things, it cannot lay hold of the brightness [of the sun and moon]. Were it within the grasp of one's hand (within one's power) to gather [things within] one category from the Supreme Ultimate (\"t'ai-chi\" 太極) above, one could immediately produce both fire and water. This is because \"Yin\" and \"Yang\" share a common \"ch'i\" and move each other. (tr. Le Blanc 1985:120-1) \n\n\"Taiji\" also appears in the Xìcí 繫辭 \"Appended Judgments\" commentary to the \"I Ching,\" a late section traditionally attributed to Confucius but more likely dating to about the 3rd century B.C.E.\nTherefore there is in the Changes the Great Primal Beginning. This generates the two primary forces. The two primary forces generate the four images. The four images generate the eight trigrams. The eight trigrams determine good fortune and misfortune. Good fortune and misfortune create the great field of action. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967:318-9) \nThis sequence of powers of two includes Taiji → Yin and Yang (two polarities) → \"Sixiang\" (Four Symbols) → Bagua (eight trigrams).\n\nRichard Wilhelm and Cary F. Baynes explain.\nThe fundamental postulate is the \"great primal beginning\" of all that exists, \"t'ai chi\" – in its original meaning, the \"ridgepole\". Later Indian philosophers devoted much thought to this idea of a primal beginning. A still earlier beginning, \"wu chi\", was represented by the symbol of a circle. Under this conception, \"t'ai chi\" was represented by the circle divided into the light and the dark, yang and yin, . This symbol has also played a significant part in India and Europe. However, speculations of a Gnostic-dualistic character are foreign to the original thought of the \"I Ching\"; what it posits is simply the ridgepole, the line. With this line, which in itself represents oneness, duality comes into the world, for the line at the same time posits an above and a below, a right and left, front and back – in a word, the world of the opposites. (1967:lv) \n\nThe Song Dynasty philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073 CE) wrote the \"Taijitu shuo\" 太極圖說 \"Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\", which became the cornerstone of Neo-Confucianist cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of Chinese Buddhism and Daoism with metaphysical discussions in the \"I ching\".\n\nZhou's key terms Wuji and Taiji appear in the opening line 無極而太極, which Adler notes could also be translated \"The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar!\".\nNon-polar (\"wuji\") and yet Supreme Polarity (\"taiji\")! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates \"yang\"; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates \"yin\"; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing \"yin\" and \"yang\", the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of \"yang\" and \"yin\" generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] \"qi\" harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply \"yin\" and \"yang\"; \"yin\" and \"yang\" are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature. (tr. Adler 1999:673-4) \nInstead of usual \"Taiji\" translations \"Supreme Ultimate\" or \"Supreme Pole\", Adler uses \"Supreme Polarity\" (see Robinet 1990) because Zhu Xi describes it as the alternating principle of \"yin\" and \"yang\", and …\ninsists that \"taiji\" is not a thing (hence \"Supreme Pole\" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, \"taiji\" is the \"yin-yang\" principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic \"first principle.\" \"Wuji\" as \"non-polar\" follows from this. \n\nTaiji is understood to be the highest conceivable principle, that from which existence flows. This is very similar to the Daoist idea \"reversal is the movement of the Dao\". The \"supreme ultimate\" creates yang and yin: movement generates yang; when its activity reaches its limit, it becomes tranquil. Through tranquility the supreme ultimate generates yin. When tranquility has reached its limit, there is a return to movement. Movement and tranquility, in alternation, become each the source of the other. The distinction between the yin and yang is determined and the two forms (that is, the yin and yang) stand revealed. By the transformations of the yang and the union of the yin, the 5 elements (Qi) of water, fire, wood, metal and earth are produced. These 5 Qi become diffused, which creates harmony. Once there is harmony the 4 seasons can occur. Yin and yang produced all things, and these in their turn produce and reproduce, this makes these processes never ending. (Wu, 1986)\nTaiji underlies the practical Taijiquan (T'ai Chi Ch'uan) – A Chinese internal martial art based on the principles of Yin and Yang and Taoist philosophy, and devoted to internal energetic and physical training. Taijiquan is represented by five family styles: Chen, Yang, Wu(Hao), Wu and Sun. There are also several offshoots of the five families as well as more recent simplified and combined styles for competition.\n\n\n"}

In the opening essay \"A critical awareness of science\" he suggests adopting the perspective of the poor, and considering where science has failed them. \n\nIn the essay on \"Francis Bacon and the Reform of Philosophy\" Ravetz argues that Bacon's audacious reform programme owed much more to his religion views, hopes and expectation than is normally accounted for. The Chapter \"Ideological Commitment in the Philosophy of Acience' offers Ravetz's first hand reading of the relevance of ideology in the philosophies of science of Karl Popper, \nThomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend. \n\nThe book has detailed discussions of risks and regulation and science's role therein, and a critique of 'reckless' science (\"Hardware and Fantasy in Military Technology\"). Ravetz also presents his insight on the use of ignorance (\"Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance: Incomplete Science with Policy Implications\"), the Gaia hypothesis, how to constructively tackle the problems of quality control of quantitative information, and the need for \"A new social contract for science\". For Carrozza (2015) this book (p. 284) investigates the two interrelated processes\nof the scientization of politics and of the politicization of expertise \"in the spirit of a general call for renewing\nthe social contract between science and society\". \n\nTwo reviews are available, one on American Scientist and another on \nNew Scientist \n\n"}

Any part of a microsporophyll that bears microsporangia is called an anther. Most anthers are formed on the apex of a filament. An anther and its filament together form a typical (or filantherous) stamen, part of the male floral organ.\n\nThe typical anther is bilocular, i.e. it consists of two thecae. Each theca contains two microsporangia, also known as pollen sacs. The microsporangia produce the microspores, which for seed plants are known as pollen grains. \n\nIf the pollen sacs are not adjacent, or if they open separately, then no thecae are formed. In Lauraceae, for example, the pollen sacs are spaced apart and open independently. \n\nThe tissue between the locules and the cells is called the \"connective\" and the parenchyma. Both pollen sacs are separated by the stomium. When the anther is dehiscing, it opens at the stomium. \n\nThe outer cells of the theca form the epidermis. Below the epidermis, the somatic cells form the tapetum. These support the development of microspores into mature pollen grains. However, little is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms, which play a role in male sporo- and gametogenesis.\n\nThe thecal arrangement of a typical stamen can be as follows: \n\n\nIn biology, the theca of follicle can also refer to the site of androgen production in females.

He was a world authority on animal behavior, ecology, and evolution, and, together with his Cornell colleague Jerrold Meinwald, was one of the pioneers of chemical ecology, the discipline dealing with the chemical interactions of organisms. He was author or co-author of some 400 scientific articles and seven books.\n\nThomas Eisner was born on June 25, 1929, in Berlin, Germany. His father, Hans Eisner, was a chemist of Jewish origin, and a coworker of Fritz Haber at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Electrochemistry in Berlin; he later held a chair for chemistry at Cornell. His mother, Margarete Heil-Eisner, was an artist. Escaping the Nazi regime, the family moved to Barcelona and, following the Spanish Civil War, to Uruguay. The Eisners came to the U.S. in 1947.\n\nThomas Eisner became a naturalized American citizen, and applied to Cornell University as an undergraduate, but was rejected. He received his B.S. and PhD degrees from Harvard University, and joined Cornell's entomology faculty in 1957. He married Maria Eisner, who was a member of his lab. In 1964, he helped found the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, where he worked until his death.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, he was a passionate nature photographer and videographer. His film \"Secret Weapons\" won the Grand Award at the New York Film Festival and was named Best Science Film by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also an avid pianist and occasional conductor. Eisner died on March 25, 2011, of Parkinson's disease.\n\nHe was an atheist.\n\nEisner's main body of work was in chemical ecology, primarily studying the chemical defenses of insects against predation. Some of his most famous work was conducted on the bombardier beetle, which he discovered creates a chemical reaction within its body to shoot a boiling noxious liquid from a nozzle in its abdomen.\n\nA field biologist with working experience on four continents, he was also an active conservationist. He served on the Board of Directors of the National Audubon Society, the National Scientific Council of the Nature Conservancy, and the World Resources Institute Council. He was a past president of the American Society of Naturalists, and chairman of the Biology Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He played a key role in initiating the Congressional Fellow Program in Washington DC, and in efforts to preserve wilderness areas in Florida and Texas.\n\nEisner was furthermore a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He received numerous honors, including the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, the Harvard Centennial Medal, the 1994 National Medal of Science and the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science. He also held honorary degrees from universities in Sweden, Germany, Switzerland and the United States, and was a foreign fellow of the Royal Society.

{"id": "666212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666212", "title": "Zygmunt Bauman", "text": "Zygmunt Bauman\n\nZygmunt Bauman (; 19 November 1925 – 9 January 2017) was a Polish sociologist and philosopher. He was driven out of Poland by a political purge in 1968 engineered by the Communist government of the Polish People's Republic and forced to give up his Polish citizenship to move to Israel. Three years later he moved to the United Kingdom. He resided in England from 1971 and became Professor of Sociology at the University of Leeds, later Emeritus. Bauman was one of the world's most eminent social theorists, writing on issues as diverse as modernity and the Holocaust, postmodern consumerism and liquid modernity.\n\nBauman was born to non-observant Polish Jewish parents in Poznań, Poland, in 1925. When Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and by the Soviet Union, in 1939, his family escaped eastwards into the USSR. Bauman then enlisted in the Soviet-controlled First Polish Army, working as a political instructor. He took part in the battles of Kolberg (now Kołobrzeg) and of Berlin. In May 1945 he was awarded the Military Cross of Valour. After World War II he became one of the Polish Army's youngest majors.\n\nAccording to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, from 1945 to 1953 Bauman was a political officer in the Internal Security Corps (KBW), a military unit formed to combat Ukrainian nationalist insurgents and part of the remnants of the Polish Home Army. Later Bauman worked for military intelligence from 1945 to 1948. However, the nature and extent of his collaboration remain unknown, as well as the exact circumstances under which it was terminated.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Guardian\", Bauman confirmed he had been a committed communist during and after World War II and had never made a secret of it. He admitted that joining the military intelligence service at age 19 was a mistake although he had a \"dull\" desk-job and did not remember informing on anyone. While serving in the KBW, Bauman first studied sociology at the Warsaw Academy of Political and Social Science. In the KBW Bauman, already in the rank of major, was suddenly dishonourably discharged in 1953, after his father had approached the Israeli embassy in Warsaw with a view to emigrating to Israel. As Bauman did not share his father's Zionist tendencies and was indeed strongly anti-Zionist, his dismissal caused a severe, though temporary estrangement from his father. During the period of unemployment that followed, he completed his M.A. and in 1954 became a lecturer at the University of Warsaw, where he remained until 1968.\n\nDuring a spell at the London School of Economics, where his supervisor was Robert McKenzie, he prepared a comprehensive study on the British socialist movement, his first major book. Published originally in Polish in 1959, a revised edition appeared in English in 1972. Bauman went on to publish other books, including \"Socjologia na co dzień\" (\"Everyday Sociology\", 1964), which reached a large popular audience in Poland and later formed the foundation for the English-language text-book \"Thinking Sociologically\" (1990). Initially, Bauman remained close to orthodox Marxist doctrine, but influenced by Antonio Gramsci and Georg Simmel, he became increasingly critical of Poland's Communist government. Owing to this he was never awarded a professorship even after he completed his habilitation but, after his former teacher, Julian Hochfeld, was made vice-director of UNESCO's Department for Social Sciences in Paris in 1962, Bauman did in fact inherit Hochfeld's chair.\n\nFaced with increasing political pressure connected with a political purge led by Mieczysław Moczar, the Chief of the Polish Communist Security Police, Bauman renounced his membership of the governing Polish United Workers' Party in January 1968. The March 1968 events culminated in a purge that drove many remaining Communist Poles of Jewish descent out of the country, including those intellectuals who had fallen from grace with the communist government. Bauman, who had lost his chair at the University of Warsaw, was among them. Having had to give up Polish citizenship to be allowed to leave the country, he first went to Israel to teach at Tel Aviv University, before accepting the chair of sociology at the University of Leeds, where he intermittently also served as head of department. After his appointment, he published almost exclusively in English, his third language, and his reputation grew. Indeed, from the late 1990s, Bauman exerted a considerable influence on the anti- or alter-globalization movement.\n\nIn a 2011 interview in the Polish weekly, \"Polityka\", Bauman criticised Zionism and Israel, saying Israel was not interested in peace and that it was \"taking advantage of the Holocaust to legitimize unconscionable acts\". He compared the Israeli West Bank barrier to the walls of the Warsaw Ghetto where hundreds of thousands of Jews had died in the Holocaust. The Israeli ambassador to Warsaw, Zvi Bar, called Bauman's comments \"half truths\" and \"groundless generalizations.\"\n\nBauman was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.\n\nBauman was married to writer Janina Bauman, née Lewinson; 18 August 1926 – 29 December 2009. They had three daughters, painter Lydia Bauman, architect Irena Bauman, and professor Anna Sfard, a leading theorist of education at the University of Haifa. His grandson Michael Sfard is a prominent civil rights lawyer and author in Israel. Zygmunt Bauman died in Leeds on 9 January 2017.\n\nBauman's published work extends to 57 books and well over a hundred articles. Most of these address a number of common themes, among which are globalisation, modernity and postmodernity, consumerism, and morality.\n\nBauman's earliest publication in English is a study of the British labour movement and its relationship to class and social stratification, originally published in Poland in 1960. He continued to publish on the subject of class and social conflict until the early 1980s. His last book was on the subject of \"Memories of Class\". Whilst his later books do not address issues of class directly, he continued to describe himself as a socialist, and he never rejected Marxism entirely. The post-Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci in particular remained one of his most profound influences along with sociologist, Georg Simmel.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s Bauman published a number of books that dealt with the relationship between modernity, bureaucracy, rationality and social exclusion. Bauman, following Freud, came to view European modernity as a trade off: European society, he argued, had agreed to forego a level of freedom to receive the benefits of increased individual security. Bauman argued that modernity, in what he later came to term its 'solid' form, involved removing unknowns and uncertainties. It involved control over nature, hierarchical bureaucracy, rules and regulations, control and categorisation — all of which attempted to remove gradually personal insecurities, making the chaotic aspects of human life appear well-ordered and familiar. \n\nLater in a number of books Bauman began to develop the position that such order-making never manages to achieve the desired results. When life becomes organised into familiar and manageable categories, he argued, there are always social groups who cannot be administered, who cannot be separated out and controlled. In his book \"Modernity and Ambivalence\" Bauman began to theorise about such indeterminate persons in terms of an allegorical figure he called, 'the stranger.' Drawing upon Georg Simmel's sociology and the philosophy of Jacques Derrida, Bauman came to write of the stranger as the person who is present yet unfamiliar, society's \"undecidable\". In \"Modernity and Ambivalence\" Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar. Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled or ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is a constant threat.\n\nBauman's most famous book, \"Modernity and the Holocaust\", is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of those kinds of fears. Drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno's books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman developed the argument that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he argued, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorisation of different species, and the tendency to view obedience to rules as morally good, all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass. He argued that for this reason modern societies have not fully grasped the lessons of the Holocaust; it tends to be viewed—to use Bauman's metaphor—like a picture hanging on the wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis the Jews became 'strangers' \"par excellence\" in Europe. The Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempt made by society to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements that exist within it. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Bauman began to explore \"postmodernity\" and \"consumerism\". He posited that a shift had taken place in modern society in the latter half of the 20th century. It had changed from a society of producers into a society of consumers. According to Bauman, this change reversed Freud's \"modern\" tradeoff—i.e., security was given up in exchange for more freedom, freedom to purchase, consume, and enjoy life. In his books in the 1990s Bauman wrote of this as being a shift from \"modernity\" to \"post-modernity\". \n\nSince the turn of the millennium, his books have tried to avoid the confusion surrounding the term \"postmodernity\" by using the metaphors of \"liquid\" and \"solid\" modernity. In his books on modern consumerism, Bauman still writes of the same uncertainties that he portrayed in his writings on \"solid\" modernity; but in these books he writes of fears becoming more diffuse and harder to pin down. Indeed, they are, to use the title of one of his books, \"liquid fears\" – fears about paedophilia, for instance, which are amorphous and have no easily identifiable reference.\n\nBauman is credited with coining the term allosemitism to encompass both philo-Semitic and anti-Semitic attitudes towards Jews as the other. Bauman reportedly predicted the negative political effect that social media have on voter's choice by denouncing them as 'trap' where people only 'see reflections of their own face'.\n\nBauman was awarded the European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences in 1992 and the Theodor W. Adorno Award of the city of Frankfurt in 1998. He was awarded in 2010, jointly with Alain Touraine, the \"Príncipe de Asturias Prize\" for Communication and the Humanities.\n\nThe University of Leeds established 'The Bauman Institute' within its School of Sociology and Social Policy in his honour in September 2010. The University of Lower Silesia, a small private higher education institution in Lower Silesia, Poland, planned to award Bauman an honorary doctorate in October 2013. However, as a reaction to a major anti-communist and what Bauman supporters allege \"anti-semitic\" uproar against him, he eventually rejected the award.\n\nIn 2015 the University of Salento awarded Bauman an honorary degree in Modern Languages, Literature and Literary Translation.\n\nIn 2014, Peter Walsh, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, accused Bauman of plagiarism from several websites, including Wikipedia, in his book \"Does the Richness of the Few Benefit Us All?\" (2013). In this book Bauman is said to have copied verbatim paragraphs from Wikipedia articles on Slow Food and steady-state economy, along with their bibliography, without attributing sources, authors or the fact that they were copied from Wikipedia. He did use a paragraph from the article on the golden handshake, but this citation was properly attributed to Wikipedia.\n\nIn a response Bauman suggested that \"obedience\" to \"technical\" rules was unnecessary, and that he \"never once failed to acknowledge the authorship of the ideas or concepts that I deployed, or that inspired the ones I coined\". In a detailed critique of Walsh and co-author David Lehmann, cultural critics Brad Evans and Henry A. Giroux concluded: \"This charge against Bauman is truly despicable. It's a reactionary ideological critique dressed up as the celebration of method and a back-door defence of a sterile empiricism and culture of positivism. This is a discourse that enshrines data, correlations, and performance, while eschewing matters of substance, social problems, and power.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
