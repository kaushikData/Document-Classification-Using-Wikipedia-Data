His thought combines elements of pantheism and millenarism, an ethic of renunciation (like in Buddhism or Franciscanism), and a belief in freedom as the most important feature of man. Anti-dogmatic, he asserts that truth is only found in the sum of all conflicting hypothesis (in paradox). He may be considered a \"practical philosopher\", living and working for a change in society, according to his beliefs.\n\nHe is part of a tradition of visionary thought that includes Father António Vieira and the poets Luís de Camões and Fernando Pessoa. Like Joachim de Fiore, he speaks of the coming of one (last?) age in History, the Age of the Holy Spirit, in which mankind and society attain perfection. To Agostinho da Silva, this means the absence of economy, brought about by technological evolution, and the absence of government. It also means that the nature of mankind and the nature of God will become the same. In this sense his philosophy is both an eschatology and an utopy.\n\n\"(translated and adapted from: Romana Brázio Valente, \"Agostinho da Silva: Síntese Biográfica\")\"\n\nGeorge Agostinho Baptista da Silva was born in Porto on 1906, and later in the same year moved to Barca d'Alva (Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo), where he lived until about 6 years old. From 1924 to 1928 he takes Classical Philology at the Faculdade de Letras of University of Porto. After graduation he starts writing in the Seara Nova magazine (a collaboration that will continue until 1938).\n\nBy 1931, as a scholarship student, he attends Sorbonne and Collége de France (Paris). Since 1933 he works as a teacher in the Aveiro high school but in 1935 is discharged for refusing to sign a statement (then mandatory to all civil servants) declaring no participation in secret (thus subversive) organizations.\n\nHe creates the Núcleo Pedagógico Antero de Quental in 1939 and in 1940 starts publishing \"Iniciação: cadernos de informação cultural\". Arrested by the secret police in 1943, leaves the country the following year.\n\nHe lived in Brazil, from 1947 to 1969, due to his opposition to the authoritarian regime of the \"Estado Novo\" (New State) led teaches at Faculdade Fluminense de Filosofia and collaborates with Jaime Cortesão in a research about Alexandre de Gusmão (18th century diplomat). From 1952 to 1954, he teaches at Federal University of Paraíba in João Pessoa and also in Pernambuco.\n\nIn 1954, again with Jaime Cortesão, he helps organize the 4th Centennial Exhibition of São Paulo. He was one of the founders of University of Santa Catarina, created the Centro de Estudos Afro-Orientais (Afro-Oriental Studies Center), taught Theater Philosophy at University of Bahia, and, in 1961, became an external policy adviser to the Brazilian president Jânio Quadros. He helped to create the Universidade de Brasília and its Centro de Estudos Portugueses (Portuguese Studies Center), in 1962, and, two years later, he creates the Casa Paulo Dias Adorno in Cachoeira and idealizes the Museu do Atlântico Sul in Salvador.\n\nHe comes back to Portugal in 1969, after Salazar's illness and replacement by Marcello Caetano, which originated some political and cultural opening in the regime. From then on he, among many other things, continued to write, teach at Portuguese universities, direct the Centro de Estudos Latinoamericanos (Latin-American Studies Center) at Technical University of Lisbon, and acted as a consultant to Instituto de Cultura e Língua Portuguesa (ICALP, Portuguese Culture and Language Institute).\n\nIn 1990, the Portuguese public television channel, RTP1 broadcast a series of thirteen interviews with him, called \"Conversas Vadias\". He died, at the São Francisco de Xavier Hospital, in Lisbon, in 1994.\n\nA documentary, named \"Agostinho da Silva: Um Pensamento Vivo\", directed by João Rodrigues Mattos, was released by Alfândega Filmes, in 2004. There is an unreleased interview, by António Escudeiro, called \"Agostinho por Si Próprio\", in which he talks about the worship of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe's revered as one of the leading Portuguese intellectual personalities of the 20th century. Among the books he wrote, there are biographies of Michelangelo, Pasteur and St. Francis of Assisi, and his most influential book is, probably, \"Sete Cartas a Um Jovem Filósofo\" (\"Seven Letters to a Young Philosopher\").\n\nHe was a vegetarian.\n\n\"(translated from: Silva, Agostinho da, \"Educação de Portugal\". Lisboa: Ulmeiro, 1989. )\"\n\na) \"... that each man is different from myself and unique in the universe; that I am not the one, consequently, that must reflect instead of him, [...] that knows what is best for him, [...] that must point his way. Towards him I have only one right: helping him to be himself; as my essential duty to myself is being who I am, as uncomfortable as that may be [...]\"\n\nb) \"... loving others and wanting their good has been the reason of much oppression and much death [...]; essentially, you must not love in others anything but freedom, theirs and yours. They must, for love, cease being slaves, as must we, for love, cease being slave owners.\"\n\nc) \"And it is the child the one that must be considered the noble savage, spoiling her, mis-shaping her [...] the least we possibly can [...]\"\n\nd) \"Believing, thus, that man is born good, which means on my regard that he is born a brother to the world, not its owner and destroyer, I think that education [...] has not been much else than the system through which this fraternity is transformed in domination.\"\n\nAccording to Agostinho da Silva, some of the most relevant aspects that shaped the nature of the Portuguese people and influenced the culture of Portuguese-speaking nations are: its popular religiousness, with strong elements of millenarism and mysticism; a tradition of participatory democracy and autonomy based on small local communities; a tendency towards cultural miscegenation and cosmopolitanism in balance with a nostalgia for the homeland and its cultural heritage; a slow and difficult adaptation to modernity, namely to illuminist ideas and capitalist economy.\n\n"}

{"id": "5709846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5709846", "title": "Artistic inspiration", "text": "Artistic inspiration\n\nInspiration (from the Latin \"inspirare\", meaning \"to breathe into\") is an unconscious burst of creativity in a literary, musical, or other artistic endeavour. The concept has origins in both Hellenism and Hebraism. The Greeks believed that inspiration or \"enthusiasm\" came from the muses, as well as the gods Apollo and Dionysus. Similarly, in the Ancient Norse religions, inspiration derives from the gods, such as Odin. Inspiration is also a divine matter in Hebrew poetics. In the \"Book of Amos\" the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak. In Christianity, inspiration is a gift of the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn the 18th century philosopher John Locke proposed a model of the human mind in which ideas associate or resonate with one another in the mind. In the 19th century, Romantic poets such as Coleridge and Shelley believed that inspiration came to a poet because the poet was attuned to the (divine or mystical) \"winds\" and because the soul of the poet was able to receive such visions. In the early 20th century, Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed himself to have located inspiration in the inner psyche of the artist. Psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung's theory of inspiration suggests that an artist is one who was attuned to racial memory, which encoded the archetypes of the human mind.\n\nThe Marxist theory of art sees it as the expression of the friction between economic base and economic superstructural positions, or as an unaware dialog of competing ideologies, or as an exploitation of a \"fissure\" in the ruling class's ideology. In modern psychology inspiration is not frequently studied, but it is generally seen as an entirely internal process.\n\nIn Greek thought, inspiration meant that the poet or artist would go into ecstasy or \"furor poeticus,\" the divine frenzy or poetic madness. He or she would be transported beyond his own mind and given the gods' or goddesses own thoughts to embody.\n\nInspiration is prior to consciousness and outside of skill (\"ingenium\" in Latin). Technique and performance are independent of inspiration, and therefore it is possible for the non-poet to be inspired and for a poet or painter's skill to be insufficient to the inspiration. In Hebrew poetics, inspiration is similarly a divine matter. In the \"Book of Amos\", 3:8 the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak. However, inspiration is also a matter of revelation for the prophets, and the two concepts are intermixed to some degree. Revelation is a conscious process, where the writer or painter is aware and interactive with the vision, while inspiration is involuntary and received without any complete understanding.\n\nIn Christianity, inspiration is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Saint Paul said that all scripture is given by inspiration of God (\"2 Timothy\") and the account of Pentecost records the Holy Spirit descending with the sound of a mighty wind. This understanding of \"inspiration\" is vital for those who maintain Biblical literalism, for the authors of the scriptures would, if possessed by the voice of God, not \"filter\" or interpose their personal visions onto the text. For church fathers like Saint Jerome, David was the perfect poet, for he best negotiated between the divine impulse and the human consciousness.\n\nIn northern societies, such as Old Norse, inspiration was likewise associated with a gift of the gods. As with the Greek, Latin, and Romance literatures, Norse bards were inspired by a magical and divine state and then shaped the words with their conscious minds. Their training was an attempt to learn to shape forces beyond the human. In the Venerable Bede's account of Cædmon, the Christian and later Germanic traditions combine. Cædmon was a herder with no training or skill at verse. One night, he had a dream where Jesus asked him to sing. He then composed \"Cædmon's Hymn,\" and from then on was a great poet. Inspiration in the story is the product of grace: it is unsought (though desired), uncontrolled, and irresistible, and the poet's performance involves his whole mind and body, but it is fundamentally a gift.\n\nThe Greco-Latin doctrine of the divine origin of poetry was available to medieval authors through the writings of Horace (on Orpheus) and others, but it was the Latin translations and commentaries by the neo-platonic author Marsilio Ficino of Plato's dialogues \"Ion\" and (especially) \"Phaedrus\" at the end of the 15th century that led to a significant return of the conception of \"furor poeticus\". Ficino's commentaries explained how gods inspired the poets, and how this frenzy was subsequently transmitted to the poet's auditors through his rhapsodic poetry, allowing the listener to come into contact with the divine through a chain of inspiration. Ficino himself sought to experience ecstatic rapture in rhapsodic performances of Orphic-Platonic hymns accompanied by a lyre.\n\nThe doctrine was also an important part of the poetic program of the French Renaissance poets collectively referred to as \"La Pléiade\" (Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, etc.); a full theory of divine fury / enthusiasm was elaborated by Pontus de Tyard in his \"Solitaire Premier, ou Prose des Muses, et de la fureur poétique\" (Tyard classified four kinds of divine inspiration: (1) poetic fury, gift of the Muses; (2) knowledge of religious mysteries, through Bacchus; (3) prophecy and divination through Apollo; (4) inspiration brought on by Venus/Eros.)\n\nIn the 18th century in England, nascent psychology competed with a renascent celebration of the mystical nature of inspiration. John Locke's model of the human mind suggested that ideas associate with one another and that a string in the mind can be struck by a resonant idea. Therefore, inspiration was a somewhat random but wholly natural association of ideas and sudden unison of thought. Additionally, Lockean psychology suggested that a natural sense or quality of mind allowed persons to see unity in perceptions and to discern differences in groups. This \"fancy\" and \"wit,\" as they were later called, were both natural and developed faculties that could account for greater or lesser insight and inspiration in poets and painters.\n\nThe musical model was satirized, along with the \"afflatus,\" and \"fancy\" models of inspiration, by Jonathan Swift in \"A Tale of a Tub.\" Swift's narrator suggests that madness is contagious because it is a ringing note that strikes \"chords\" in the minds of followers and that the difference between an inmate of Bedlam and an emperor was what pitch the insane idea was. At the same time, he satirized \"inspired\" radical Protestant ministers who preached through \"direct inspiration.\" In his prefatory materials, he describes the ideal dissenter's pulpit as a barrel with a tube running from the minister's posterior to a set of bellows at the bottom, whereby the minister could be inflated to such an extent that he could shout out his inspiration to the congregation. Furthermore, Swift saw fancy as an antirational, mad quality, where, \"once a man's fancy gets astride his reason, common sense is kick't out of doors.\"\n\nThe divergent theories of inspiration that Swift satirized would continue, side by side, through the 18th and 19th centuries. Edward Young's \"Conjectures on Original Composition\" was pivotal in the formulation of Romantic notions of inspiration. He said that genius is \"the god within\" the poet who provides the inspiration. Thus, Young agreed with psychologists who were locating inspiration within the personal mind (and significantly away from the realm either of the divine or demonic) and yet still positing a supernatural quality. Genius was an inexplicable, possibly spiritual and possibly external, font of inspiration. In Young's scheme, the genius was still somewhat external in its origin, but Romantic poets would soon locate its origin wholly within the poet. Romantic writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson (\"The Poet\"), and Percy Bysshe Shelley saw inspiration in terms similar to the Greeks: it was a matter of madness and irrationality.\n\nInspiration came because the poet tuned himself to the (divine or mystical) \"winds\" and because he was made in such a way as to receive such visions. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's accounts of inspiration were the most dramatic, and his \"The Eolian Harp\" was only the best of the many poems Romantics would write comparing poetry to a passive reception and natural channelling of the divine winds. The story he told about the composition of \"Kubla Khan\" has the poet reduced to the level of scribe. William Butler Yeats would later experiment and value automatic writing. Inspiration was evidence of genius, and genius was a thing that the poet could take pride in, even though he could not claim to have created it himself.\n\nSigmund Freud and other later psychologists located inspiration in the inner psyche of the artist. The artist's inspiration came out of unresolved psychological conflict or childhood trauma. Further, inspiration could come directly from the unconscious. Like the Romantic genius theory and the revived notion of \"poetic phrenzy,\" Freud saw artists as fundamentally special, and fundamentally wounded. Because Freud situated inspiration in the unconscious mind, Surrealist artists sought out this form of inspiration by turning to dream diaries and automatic writing, the use of Ouija boards and found poetry to try to tap into what they saw as the true source of art. Carl Gustav Jung's theory of inspiration reiterated the other side of the Romantic notion of inspiration indirectly by suggesting that an artist is one who was attuned to something impersonal, something outside of the individual experience: racial memory.\n\nMaterialist theories of inspiration again diverge between purely internal and purely external sources. Karl Marx did not treat the subject directly, but the Marxist theory of art sees it as the expression of the friction between economic base and economic superstructural positions, or as an unaware dialog of competing ideologies, or as an exploitation of a \"fissure\" in the ruling class's ideology. Therefore, where there have been fully Marxist schools of art, such as Soviet Realism, the \"inspired\" painter or poet was also the most class-conscious painter or poet, and \"formalism\" was explicitly rejected as decadent (e.g. Sergei Eisenstein's late films condemned as \"formalist error\"). Outside of state-sponsored Marxist schools, Marxism has retained its emphasis on the class consciousness of the inspired painter or poet, but it has made room for what Frederic Jameson called a \"political unconscious\" that might be present in the artwork. However, in each of these cases, inspiration comes from the artist being particularly attuned to receive the signals from an external crisis.\n\nIn modern psychology, inspiration is not frequently studied, but it is generally seen as an entirely internal process. In each view, however, whether empiricist or mystical, inspiration is, by its nature, beyond control. \n\nAn example of a modern study on inspiration is one that was conducted by Takeshi Okada and Kentaro Ishibashi, published in 2016 in the multidisciplinary journal, \"Cognitive Science.\" In this three-part study, groups of Japanese undergraduate art students were observed to determine whether copying or simply musing upon example artworks that served as their inspiration would increase their creative output. The results of the first and second experiment revealed that copying artwork enabled the students to produce creative drawings that were qualitatively different, but only when the example—the inspiration—featured a style that was unfamiliar to the students. The third experiment revealed that only musing upon the unfamiliar inspiration produced the same effect as copying it. Okada and Ishibashi suggest that these unfamiliar examples were able to facilitate the creativity of the students because they challenged the students' perspectives on drawing. They admit, however, that it is unclear whether their results can be generalized to professional artists as well, but they cite examples of artists, namely Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh, who extensively imitated the work of other artists, which might suggest that \"imitation is an effective driver of creativity, even for experts.\"\n\n\n"}

There are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite supply of \"one\" of the three ingredients — one smoker has an infinite supply of tobacco, another has paper, and the third has matches.\n\nThere is also a non-smoking agent who enables the smokers to make their cigarettes by arbitrarily (non-deterministically) selecting two of the supplies to place on the table. The smoker who has the third supply should remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a while. Once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two new random items on the table. This process continues forever.\n\nThree semaphores are used to represent the items on the table; the agent increases the appropriate semaphore to signal that an item has been placed on the table, and smokers decrement the semaphore when removing items. Also, each smoker has an associated semaphore that they use to signal to the agent that they are done smoking; the agent has a process that waits on each smoker's semaphore to let it know that it can place the new items on the table.\n\nA simple pseudocode implementation of the smoker who has the supply of tobacco might look like the following:\ndef tobacco_smoker():\nHowever, this can lead to deadlock; if the agent places paper and tobacco on the table, the smoker with tobacco may remove the paper, leaving the smoker with matches unable to make their cigarette. The problem is to define additional processes and semaphores that prevent deadlock, without modifying the agent.\n\nPatil placed the following constraints on the cigarette smokers problem:\n\n\nPatil used a proof in terms of Petri nets to claim that a solution to the cigarette smokers problem using Edsger Dijkstra's semaphore primitives is impossible, and to suggest that a more powerful primitive is necessary. However, David Parnas demonstrated that Patil's proof is inadequate if arrays of semaphore are used, offering a solution that uses helper processes that do arithmetic to signal the appropriate smoker to proceed.\n\nAccording to Allen B. Downey, the first restriction makes sense, because if the agent represents an operating system, it would be unreasonable or impossible to modify it every time a new application came along. However, Parnas argues that the second restriction is unjustified:\n\nThe limitations reported by Patil are limitations of his primitives, but they are not limitations on the primitives described by Dijkstra. … It is important, however, that such an investigation [of Dijkstra primitives] not investigate the power of these primitives under artificial restrictions. By artificial we mean restrictions which cannot be justified by practical considerations. In this author's opinion, restrictions prohibiting either conditionals or semaphore arrays are artificial.\n"}

Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning.\nCleanliness is a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: \"cleanliness is next to godliness\", and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as 'health' and 'beauty'.\n\nIn emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from purity, which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension, or implies a system of interactions. \"Cleanliness,\" observed Jacob Burckhardt, \"is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection.\" A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but not ordinarily purity; cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying.\n\nOn a practical level, cleanliness is thus related to hygiene and disease prevention. Washing is one way of achieving physical cleanliness, usually with water and often some kind of soap or detergent. Cleaning procedures are of the utmost importance in many forms of manufacturing.\n\nAs an assertion of Moral superiority or respectability, cleanliness has played a role in establishing cultural values in relation to social class, humanitarianism, and cultural imperialism.\n\nCleanliness is linked with proper hygiene. A person who is said to be clean usually depicts cleanliness.\n\nThe Bible has many rituals of purification relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, skin disease, death, and animal sacrifices. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes several kinds of hand washing for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. The women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.\n\nChristianity has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene, Despite the denunciation of the mixed bathing style of Roman pools by early Christian clergy, as well as the pagan custom of women naked bathing in front of men, this did not stop the Church from urging its followers to go to public baths for bathing, which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the Church Father, Clement of Alexandria. The Church also built public bathing facilities that were separate for both sexes near monasteries and pilgrimage sites; also, the popes situated baths within church basilicas and monasteries since the early Middle Ages. Pope Gregory the Great urged his followers on value of bathing as a bodily need.\n\nIn Hinduism, cleanliness is an important virtue and the \"Bhagavad Gita\" describes it as one of the divine qualities which one must practice. The Sanskrit word for cleanliness is 'Śaucam'. The \"Bhagavad Gita\" repeats this word in five slokas at 13.8, 16.3, 16.7, 17.14 and 18.42. \"Śrīmad Bhāgavatam\" mentioned 'Śaucam' at 1.16.26, 1.17.24 (as one of the four legs of Satya Yuga or Golden Age), 1.17.42, 3.28.4 (as spiritual practice), 3.31.33 (those who are addicted to sex life will not understand cleanliness), 4.29.84 (purity of Atman), 7.11.8-12 (one of the thirty qualities to be acquired), 7.11.21 (cleanliness as a characteristic of a Brahmin), 7.11.24 (cleanliness is a quality of the best worker), 11.3.24 (one should learn cleanliness to serve his or her Guru), 11.17.16 (cleanliness is a natural quality of a Brahmin), 11.18.36 (cleanliness as a virtue among those who has realised God), 11.18.43 (quality to be practiced by a householder), 11.21.14 (means of cleansing one body and mind), 11.19.36-39 (cleanliness means detachment from desire-prompted actions) 12.2.1 (effects of Kali Yuga on cleanliness). \n\n\"Srimad Bhagavatam\" also recognises cleanliness as one of the thirty qualities which one must acquire to obtain the grace of God and identifies internal and external cleanliness among the twelve regular duties. Cleanliness is also an exalted quality which characterises the Satya Yuga (Golden Age) in Hinduism. As stated by many Hindu scriptures that cleanliness is a way of relative to God.\n\nCleanliness or Śaucam is both internal and external. Hinduism extols not only external cleanliness but also internal cleanliness or purity. Since their minds are constantly absorbed in the all-pure Lord, devotees become internally cleansed from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, ego, etc. In this state of mind, they naturally prefer to keep the external body and environment pure as well. Thus, in accordance with the old saying, “Cleanliness is next to Godliness,” they are also externally pure. \n\nCleanliness is also a virtue which has to be cultivated by Vedic students and spiritual aspirants.\n\n\"Srimad Bhagavatam\" also explains the internal and external cleanliness as \"My dear Uddhava, general cleanliness, washing the hands, bathing, performing religious services at sunrise, noon and sunset, worshiping Me, visiting holy places, chanting japa, avoiding that which is untouchable, uneatable or not to be discussed, and remembering My existence within all living entities as the Paramatman — these principles should be followed by all members of society through regulation of the mind, words and body.\" \n\nAll Hindus must make a visit to the seven sacred rivers. Bathing in these rivers will purify the mind and increase their good merits. Therefore, to invoke the presence of the holy rivers, the following Mantra is chanted before daily bath: \n\"AUM gaṇge ca yamune caiva godāvarī sarasvatī | narmade siṇdhu kāverī jalesmin saṃnidhim kuru\"\nIn this water, I invoke the presence of holy waters from the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu and Kaveri.\n\nAll Hindus must have taken a bath before entering temples in order to seek blessings. They also wash their feet before entering the temple. In some Orthodox Hindu households, taking a bath after visiting a funeral is required as some hindus believe that it is an inauspicious thing to witness and the in-auspiciousness would follow. This is also related to the pollution of the River Ganges.\n\nHindus also clean their homes particularly well in preparing to celebrate Diwali each year as they believe that it brings good luck. Most Hindus also believe that keeping your house clean and great devotion are gestures to welcome the Goddess Lakshmi to their abode to stay. Some orthodox Hindus refrain from cleaning their houses on a Friday as it is a day dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi and cleaning homes on that day is considered inauspicious, so they are allowed to clean their homes on the rest of the days. Tamil people also keep their homes clean in preparation for Diwali, Pongal or Bhol.\n\nHinduism also gives a deeper meaning to cleanliness. In \"Srimad Bhagavatam\" 11.19.36-39, cleanliness is also defined as detachment from activities prompted by desire. Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment, not merely to frequently rinse one's skin with water.\n\nThere are many verses in the Quran which discuss cleanliness. For example, “…Truly, Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He 'loves those who keep themselves pure and clean” (2:222). And, “…In mosque there are men who love to be clean and pure. Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure” (9:108).\n\nFirst lessons in Islamic manuals of catechism are matters of cleanliness. Subjects taught first in the book of cleanliness include: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what people need to be cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean. Muslims are required to perform ablution (\"wudu\") before every prayer, and are recommended to stay in the state of ablution at all times. A ritual bath (\"ghusl\") is performed on Fridays before the Friday Prayer (\"Juma\"). Ritual baths are recommended for spiritual purity, also after committing a sin, and are necessary for those who have washed a funeral. Special attention is given to cleaning homes before the arrival of guests or before feasts (Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha), and holy days and nights.\n\nSince the germ theory of disease, cleanliness has come to mean an effort to remove germs and other hazardous materials. A reaction to an excessive desire for a germ-free environment began to occur around 1989, when David Strachan put forth the \"hygiene hypothesis\" in the \"British Medical Journal.\" In essence, this hypothesis holds that environmental microbes play a useful role in developing the immune system; the fewer germs people are exposed to in early childhood, the more likely they are to experience health problems in childhood and as adults. The valuation of cleanliness, therefore, has a social and cultural dimension beyond the requirements of hygiene for practical purposes.\n\nIn industry, certain processes such as those related to integrated circuit manufacturing, require conditions of exceptional cleanliness which are achieved by working in cleanrooms. Cleanliness is essential to successful electroplating, since molecular layers of oil can prevent adhesion of the coating. The industry has developed specialized techniques for parts cleaning, as well as tests for cleanliness. The most commonly used tests rely on the wetting behaviour of a clean hydrophilic metal surface. Cleanliness is also important to vacuum systems to reduce outgassing. Cleanliness is also crucial for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n"}

He is best known for his biography of Serbian despot Stefan Lazarević, which George Ostrogorsky described as \"the most important historical work of old Serbian literature\", and for writing the first Serbian philological study, \"Skazanije o pismenah\" (A History on the Letters). He was following the writing style of the Old Serbian \"Vita\", first made popular in the Serbian scriptoriums of the 12th century.\n\nConstantine was born in Bulgaria, probably in the town of Kostenets. In his youth, he attended school in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria, and was taught by Andronik, a pupil of Patriarch Evtimiy of Bulgaria. He continued his studies on Mount Athos and in Constantinople. The Ottoman conquest of Tarnovo in 1393 drove him away and he settled in Stefan Lazarević's Serbian Despotate, probably around 1402. He was warmly welcomed by the Despot, also a man of letters and a benefactor of education, and was given the position of educator at his palace in Belgrade. Constantine also frequented the Manasija monastery, where he helped establish the Serbian \"Resava School\" of literature. His high education, life experience and traveling earned him the nickname of \"Filozof\" (Philosopher), after Saint Cyril the Philosopher. On top of the travels in his youth, he traveled to the Holy Land and, judging by his description of three missions to the palaces of eastern rulers (Timur, Musa and Mehmed I), he may also have participated.\n\nAfter the Despot's death in 1427, Constantine left Belgrade and entered into the service of \"kesar\" Uglješa Vlatković, in the area of Vranje, where he later died.\n\nConstantine's work had a tremendous impact on medieval Serbian literature and education. He introduced many classical Greek elements of literature and philosophy. His frequent citing of ancient philosophers and comparisons of the Despot in the Biography caused many to consider him a precursor to the Renaissance which, due to Ottoman conquest, never occurred in Serbian culture.\n\nAfter Despot Stefan's death in 1427, the Serbian Patriarch Nikon ordered Constantine to write the Despot's biography. That order was only fulfilled four years later, after Stefan himself allegedly appeared in Constantine's dream and restated Nikon's order. The biography is one of the most interesting in the old Serbian literature because it contains not only facts about the Despot's life, but also geographic information and thorough descriptions of numerous historical events. He was apparently inspired by the imperial chronicles of Byzantine historians. The Biography of Despot Stefan Lazarević (Житија деспота Стефана Лазаревића) begins with a geographic description of Serbia's natural beauties, going on to describe its residents, praising their character but also mourning their forthcoming fall to the Turks. An exhaustive story of court events and the Despot's life follows, with numerous Biblical and classical references, as well with numerous historical data which have proven invaluable to later historians. On several occasions, Constantine used acrostics, with three masterpiece instances: in the introduction verses, in the titles of central chapters, and finally, in the verses telling of his sorrow for the deceased Despot.\n\nConstantine of Kostenets, Pachomius the Serb, Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev, and Gregory Tsamblak were able to continue their literary activities virtually unhampered by any linguistic barrier when moving from the Balkans to Imperial Russia, no different than the role of Latin literature in the Roman Catholic part of medieval Europe. Constantine spoke and write a language which could not be identified with either the Bulgarian or Serbian vernaculars. Therefore, it was only natural for medieval Serbian biographers to turn for models to the body of existing \"vitae\" written in either Slavonic-Serbian or Church Slavonic language.\n\n\n\n"}

Courtesy literature can be traced back to 13th century German and Italian writers.\n\nCourtesy books formed part of the didactic literature of the Middle Ages, covering topics from religion and ethics to social awareness and social conduct. While firmly normative in their bent, they also showed an awareness of the human realities that did not fit neatly under the rubric of their precepts. Such books appealed both to an aristocratic readership and to aspiring urban middle classes.\n\nThe oldest known courtesy book from Germany is the mid-thirteenth century \"Tannhäuser\" Book of Manners.\n\nAnother of the oldest known courtesy books of Germany, is the learning-poems of \"Winsbecke\" and \"Winsbeckin\", written around 1220 by an anonymous author. \n\nThe oldest known courtesy book from Italy is the 1215/16 \"Der Wälsche Gast\" by Thomasin von Zirclaere, speaking to a German audience.\n\nThe Renaissance saw the re-emergence of urban civilisation in the Italian city-states, drawing on the earlier urban civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, but developing new ideals of manners and courtesy. Three sixteenth century Italian texts on courtly manners and morals – Baldassarre Castiglione's \"Il Cortegiano\" (1528); Giovanni della Casa's \"Il Galateo\" (1558) and Stefano Guazzo's \"La Civil Conversazione\" (1574) in four volumes – had an especially wide influence both south and north of the Alps. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, apparently had at his bedside three books: the Bible, Nicolò Machiavelli's \"The Prince\", and \"Il Cortegiano\" (\"The Courtier \"). Through Castiglione's writings, the Italian ideals of Neo-Platonism, beauty and symmetry, and the amateur author, reached a wide humanist audience, as did the new Italianate emphasis on the self in society and the importance of social appearances.\n\nThe norms for personal boundaries and social proxemics established by figures such as della Casa still influence the Western world almost a half millennium later.\n\nIn 1561, Thomas Hoby published \"The Courtyer\", his translation of \"Il Cortegiano\", (although he had made the translation a decade earlier). The work was read widely and influenced the writings of Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser and Ben Jonson. Robert Peterson's translation of \"Il Galateo\" appeared in 1576. George Pettie translated the first three books of Guazzo's work into \"The Civil Conversation\" in 1581; the fourth and last volume from \"La Civil Conversazione\" appeared five years later in a translation by Bartholomew Yonge. \n\nA well-known English example of the genre is Henry Peacham's \"The Compleat Gentleman\" of 1622.\n\nCourtesy books continued to be written into the 1700s, the last traditional English one being Lord Chesterfield's \"Letters to His Son\" – memorably described by Samuel Johnson as teaching \"the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing-master\". However they took on a new form in the fiction of the time, much of it (like the work of Sir Charles Grandison) filling a similar normative role.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24035991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24035991", "title": "Divine providence in Judaism", "text": "Divine providence in Judaism\n\nDivine providence ( \"Hashgochoh Protis\" or \"Hashgaha Peratit\", lit. divine supervision of the individual) is discussed throughout Rabbinic literature, by the classical Jewish philosophers, and by the tradition of Jewish mysticism.\n\nThe discussion brings into consideration the Jewish understanding of nature, and its reciprocal, the miraculous. This analysis thus underpins much of Orthodox Judaism's world view, particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world.\n\nDivine providence is discussed by all of the major Jewish philosophers, but its extent and nature is a matter of dispute. There are, broadly, two views, differing largely as to the frequency with which God intervenes in the natural order. The first view admits a frequency of miracles. Here there is a stability of the natural order which nevertheless allows for the interference of God in the regulation of human events, or even in disturbing the natural order on occasion. The second, rationalist view does not deny the occurrence of miracles, but attempts to limit it, and will rationalize the numerous miraculous events related in the Bible and bring them within the sphere of the natural order.\n\nThe teachings of Nachmanides are largely representative of the first view. He holds that the Creator endowed the universe with physical properties, and sustains the natural order, and that any act of providence involves, by definition, an intrusion into the laws of nature. In the absence of providential interference, cause and effect governs the affairs of the universe. In Ramban's view, reward and punishment — as well as guidance of the fate of Israel — are the typical expressions of such providence (see Ramban: \"Torat Hashem Temimah\"). In this sense there is no difference between God causing it to rain (as a reward) and his separating the waters of the Red Sea. Both are the result of Divine intervention.\n\nAll events (natural or providential) are the result of the direct will of God, and, as such, the seemingly natural order of the world is an illusion. At the same time, any (obvious) breach in the chain of causality involves a \"compromise\" in the default cause and effect nature of the universe — providence is thus exercised sparingly, and in a \"seemingly natural\" manner (Genesis 6:19 ad loc). Thus, whereas the fate of the Jews as a nation is guided by providence, individuals do not enjoy the same providential relationship with the Almighty. Only the righteous and the wicked can expect providential treatment. The fate of more “average” individuals is primarily guided by natural law (Deuteronomy 11:13 ad loc).\n\nMaimonides is representative of the rationalist school. He holds that the pattern of nature is basically immutable. \"This Universe remains perpetually with the same properties with which the Creator has endowed it ... none of these will ever be changed except by way of miracle in some individual instances\", (\"The Guide for the Perplexed\", 2:29). This notwithstanding, Maimonides believes that God rewards and punishes appropriately.\n\nTo some extent, Maimonides reconciles the two views by defining providence as an essentially natural process. Here individual providence depends on the development of the human mind: that is, the more a man develops his mind the more he is subject to the providence of God. Providence is, in fact, a function of intellectual and spiritual activity: it is the activity, not the person that merits providence. \"Divine Providence is connected with Divine intellectual influence, and the same beings which are benefited by the latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of Divine Providence, which examines all their deeds in order to reward or punish them.\" (The Guide for the Perplexed 3:17).\n\nFurther, by defining providence as function of human activity, Maimonides avoids the problem of how God can be affected by events on Earth, lessening any implication of change within God and the resultant implication of a lack of perfection (see Divine simplicity). Maimonides views \"reward and punishment\" as manifesting in the World to Come as opposed to in this world (see Talmud, \"Kiddushin\" 39b; \"Pirkei Avot\" 2:16) — he therefore defines divine providence as that which facilitates intellectual attainment as opposed to as an instrument of reward and punishment.\n\nBoth of the above approaches continue to influence contemporary Orthodox Judaism. In general, Nachmanides' view is influential in Haredi Judaism, while Maimonides' view — in addition to Nachmanides' — underpins much of Modern Orthodox thought. Note that the Hassidic approach departs somewhat from these; see detail below.\n\nThe difference between the approaches of Nachmanides and Rambam manifests particularly in the importance assigned to, and attitudes toward, three areas:\n\nThe view of Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler is representative of the Haredi approach. To generalise, Rabbi Dessler (along with the Chazon Ish) teaches that given the illusory \"nature of nature\", each individual must find their appropriate balance between personal effort (\"hishtadlus\" / \"hishtadlut\" השתדלות) and trust (\"bitochon\" / \"bitachon\" ביטחון). \"Rav Dessler\", relatedly, often repeated the idea that every object and circumstance in the material world should be viewed as a means of serving Hashem (God).\n\nJoseph B. Soloveitchik echoes Maimonides’ teaching. He writes that \"the fundamental of providence is ... transformed into a concrete commandment, an obligation incumbent upon man. Man is obliged to broaden the scope and strengthen the intensity of the individual providence that watches over him. Everything is dependent on him; it is all in his hands\" (\"Halakhic Man\", p. 128).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the new discipline in Rabbinic Judaism of classic, Medieval Jewish rationalistic philosophy arose, exemplified by its leading figure Maimonides. It sought to bring the tradition in Western Philosophy of independent thinking from first principles, in support and harmony with rabbinic theology of the Talmud. In Rabbinic Judaism, this approach, which had its supporters and detractors, was called \"hakirah\" (\"investigation\") to distinguish from other traditions in Jewish thought. \n\nAnother parallel tradition of \"kabbalah\" expressed a mystical exegesis of biblical and rabbinic texts, and a metaphysical theology. Both became part of the canon of Rabbinic literature. The classic figure in Jewish thought, Nachmanides, was one of the early exponents of kabbalah, though his Bible commentary avoids using the direct terminology of kabbalah. As the tradition of kabbalah developed it evolved through the successive stages of medieval kabbalah, exemplified in the Zohar, the 16th-century rational synthesis of Cordoveran Kabbalah, the subsequent new paradigm of cosmic rectification in Lurianic Kabbalah and the 18th-century popularisation of Jewish mysticism in Hasidism.\nThe teachings of Hasidic philosophy sought the inner divinity within the esoteric structures of kabbalah, by relating them to their internal correspondence in the daily spiritual life of man. It sought to awaken a personal, psychological perception of godliness in dveikut (mystical joy and cleaving to God). The interpretations of Judaism and Jewish philosophy in Hasidism taught new dimensions of divine unity, omnipresence and individual divine providence. In the new teaching of Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, divine providence governs every detail of Creation. He taught that \"the movement of a leaf in the wind\" is a part of the Divine purpose of Creation. Based on the Cosmic \"Tikkun\" (Rectification) of Lurianic Kabbalah, everything in creation is part of this messianic rectification, and if it were to be missing, then the rectification would be incomplete. The meaning of this can be understood by considering its background in the esoteric structures of kabbalah, especially the teachings of Isaac Luria. In these new doctrines, our physical world and all its details, take on cosmic significance in the divine scheme of creation. Every action and each person is significant, as it relates to the overall redemption of the fallen \"nitzutzot\" (divine sparks from the primordial catastrophe of the \"Shattering of the Vessels\" of the world of \"Tohu\"). The rectification can only be achieved in this lowest realm. This explains that the reason that most of the \"mitzvot\" of Judaism involve action is their metaphysical role in achieving the redemption of the hidden divinity in creation. In the words of Luria, every animate and inanimate object has a spiritual form of \"soul\" within its physical form, which is its continual creating source in the Divine Light. Even a stone would have this level of a \"soul\" though this is not like the living soul of a plant, the conscious soul of an animal, or the intelligent soul of man. It is rather its animating existence in the Divine Will, as in Jewish mysticism, creation is continuous and would revert to nothingness without the constant divine animation within it. Accordingly, in the words of Luria, \"every leaf contains a soul that came into the world to receive a Rectification\". \"Gilgul\" (the kabbalistic process of reincarnation), the rectification of an individual soul, becomes a microcosmic reflection in Lurianic Kabbalah, to the macrocosmic divine rectification. In Hasidism, the structural dynamics of this cosmic scheme are followed, but instead are related to their inner Divine dimensions in the direct psychological perception and life of man:\nThe Hasidic relation of the Jewish mystical tradition, to the daily life of the common folk, sanctified the world of the \"shtetl\" in the popular imagination. Its charismatic adaptions of the profound thought of Hasidic philosophy, entered Yiddish literature, where the ideas of \"gilgul\" and \"dybuk\", and the direct immanent Presence of God, affected secular Jewish culture.\n\nThis mystical interpretation of particular Divine Providence is part of the wider Hasidic interpretation of God's Unity. The second section of the Hasidic text the Tanya by Schneur Zalman of Liadi (\"Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah-Gate of Unity and Faith\"), brings the mystical panentheism of the Baal Shem Tov into philosophical explanation. It explains the Hasidic interpretation of God's Unity in the first two lines of the \"Shema\", based upon their interpretation in kabbalah. The emphasis on divine omnipresence and immanence lies behind Hasidic joy and \"deveikut\", and its stress on transforming the material into spiritual worship. In this internalisation of kabbalistic ideas, the Hasidic follower seeks to reveal the unity of hidden divinity in all activities of life. Nachman of Breslov teaches that big part of choices needs faith or, in other words, good relations are supported by faith. \n\nMedieval, Rationalist Jewish Philosophers, such as Maimonides, describe Biblical monotheism to mean that there is only one God, and his essence is a unique, simple, infinite unity. Jewish mysticism gives a further explanation, by distinguishing between God's essence and emanation. In kabbalah and especially Hasidism, God's unity means that there is nothing independent of his essence. The new doctrine in Lurianic Kabbalah of God's \"tzimtzum\" (\"withdrawal\"), received different interpretations after Isaac Luria, from the literal to the metaphorical. To Hasidism and Schneur Zalman, it is unthinkable for the withdrawal of God that \"makes possible\" creation to be taken literally. \"Tzimtzum\" only relates to the \"Ohr Ein Sof\" (\"infinite light\"), not the Ein Sof (divine essence) itself, and involved only apparent concealment, not actual concealment. God's unbounded essence is revealed in both complimentary infinitude (infinite light) and finitude (finite light). The withdrawal was only the illusion of concealment of the infinite light into the essence of God, to allow the latent potentially finite light to emerge apparent to creation after the \"tzimtzum\". God himself remains unaffected (\"For I, the Lord, I have not changed\" Malachi 3:6). His essence was one, alone, before creation, and still one, alone, after creation, without any change. As the \"tzimtzum\" was only the illusion of concealment, therefore God's unity is omnipresent. In the Baal Shem Tov's new interpretation, divine providence affects every detail of creation, as everything is part of the unfolding divine unity, and is a necessary part of the kabbalistic messianic rectification. This awareness of the loving purpose and significance of each individual, awakens mystical love and awe of God (\"deveikut\").\n\nSchneur Zalman explains that God's unity has two levels, that are both paradoxically true. The main text of Kabbalah, the Zohar, describes the first verse of the \"shema\" as the \"Upper level Unity\", and the second line (\"Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever\") as the \"Lower level Unity\". Schneur Zalman gives the Hasidic explanation of this. In kabbalah, all creation is dependent on the immanent, potentially finite, \"Light that Fills all Worlds\", that each creation receives continually. Creation is a continuous process, as without the downward flow of spiritual light from God's will, creation would revert to nothingness. Lurianic Kabbalah extends the divine unity in this, by describing the particular \"nitzot\" (divine spark) enclothed within, that gives life to each entity. The Baal Shem Tov's Hasidic panentheism describes the further, complete unity of God with creation. In his interpretation, quoted by Schneur Zalman, the creative words of God of Genesis, through innumerable permutations of their Hebrew letters, themselves become each spiritual and physical entity of creation. This extends Luria's divine immanence to complete unity. Isaac Luria's doctrine of the \"tzimtzum\" (withdrawal of God), that made a \"vacuum\" within which finite creation could take place, is therefore not literal. It is only a concealment of God's creating light, and only from the perspective of creation. God remains in the vacuum exactly as before creation. In reality all creation is completely \"bittul\"-nullified to God's light, even though in our realm this utter dependence is presently concealed. From this perspective, of God knowing the creation on its own terms, creation exists, but the essence of anything is only the divine light that continuously recreates it from nothing. God is one, as creation takes place within God. \"There is nothing outside of Him.\" This is the \"Lower Level Unity\".\n\nIn relation to God's essence, creation affects no change or withdrawal in the divine. \"There is nothing but God\". The ability to create can only come from the divine \"atzmut\"(essence), whose power of infinitude is described by the Tetragrammaton (name of God). However, \"It is not the essence of the Divine to create Worlds and sustain them\", as this ability is only external to the infinite essence. Creation only derives from God's revelatory \"speech\" (as in Genesis 1) and even this is unlike the external speech of Man, as it too remains \"within\" God. From the upper perspective of God knowing himself on his own terms, creation does not exist, as it is as nothing in relation to God's essence. This monistic acosmism is the \"Upper Level Unity\", as from this perspective, only God exists. The illusionism of this is not absolute, as the paradox means that both contradictory upper and lower levels of unity are true.\n\nThe school of Habad Hasidism sought to articulate Hasidic philosophy in intellectual systemisation. This was exemplified by the aim of the 5th Rebbe, Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, that his \"yeshiva\" academies should study Hasidic thought with the logical method of \"pilpul\", traditionally used in Talmudic study. In the Hasidic teachings of Habad, this approach was used by each Rebbe in their public discourses and talks, with each successive leader aiming to bring down the philosophy of Hasidism into greater grasp and articulation. The 7th leader, Menachem Mendel Schneerson typically addressed Hasidic philosophy most often in informal, analytical talks. This approach to Hasidic mysticism enabled it to study the integration of other aspects of Jewish thought, into the Hasidic explanations. In Hasidic terminology, it takes a higher spiritual source in divinity to unite opposing, lower opinions. In Hasidic thought, Talmudic legislation, midrashic imagination, rationalist descriptions and kabbalistic structures are seen to reflect lower dimensions of a higher, essential Divine Unity. This method was used by the 7th Rebbe to address the topic of divine providence. In a series of talks, translated and published in English, the Lubavitcher Rebbe addresses the resolution between the Hasidic conception of divine providence, and its previous formulations in medieval Jewish philosophy and kabbalah. It sees the views of Maimonides and others as part of the new conception of the Baal Shem Tov.\n\n\n"}

In contrast, the other doctrines may be vulnerable to contractual disclaimers or evidence of intent not to grant intellectual property rights.

{"id": "102062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102062", "title": "Dominator culture", "text": "Dominator culture\n\nDominator culture refers to a model of society where fear and force maintain rigid understandings of power and superiority within a hierarchical structure. Futurist and writer Riane Eisler first popularized this term in her book \"The Chalice and the Blade\" (Harper Collins San Francisco, 1987). In it, Eisler positions the dominator model in contrast to the partnership model, a more egalitarian structure of society founded on mutual respect among its inhabitants. In dominator culture, men rule over women, whereas partnership culture values men and women equally. Other theorists, including Terence McKenna and bell hooks, have expanded on the implications and impact of dominator culture. They, among others, argue that adherence to the dominator model over the partnership model denies the possibility of a more equal society, systematically allowing for the persecution of those who are “dominated”—including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBT people, and women.\n\nRiane Eisler presents dominator culture as a cultural construction of the roles and relations of women and men, where men “dominate,” or are in control within society. Regardless of the location, time period, religious beliefs, or advancements in technology, a society might follow the dominator culture model. Eisler characterizes dominator culture as featuring four core elements:\nThe dominator model is framed in contrast to the partnership model. In a sort of reversal of the elements of dominator culture, the partnership model is characterized by:\nBy juxtaposing dominator culture with partnership culture, Eisler creates a continuum between the two. She argues that where a society falls on this spectrum influences its culture, beliefs, and actions. Adherence to dominator culture affects people from a personal to a public level, as seen in its societal impact.\n\nThe prevalence of dominator culture has shifted over time. Eisler claims that, in the prehistory of humans, partnership used to be the norm. In both the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods, there are examples of matriarchal societies preceding patriarchies. British archeologist James Mellaart, for example, reported a Neolithic site with many female images and no signs of destructive warfare for almost 1000 years. For thousands of years, people lived in these peaceful partnership societies, until warlike nomadic tribes disrupted the balance with their dominator cultures. Since then, fluctuations between dominator and partnership societies have occurred over time, but the primary shift has been towards dominator culture.\n\nDominator culture impacts the way a society appears and functions. Riane Eisler posits that “narratives about our cultural origins,” like dominator culture, “reflect and guide how we think, feel, and act.” Though no culture is fully dominator or fully partnership in its construction, the degree to which it aligns with one of these models impacts the beliefs, institutions, and relationships of that society.\n\nThe main distinction between the dominator and partnership models, according to Eisler, is their treatment of the relationships between men and women. She argues that, historically, men have been the dominators, leading to patriarchal society that upholds constricting, traditional gender roles. Surveys by anthropologists Peggy R. Sanday and Scott Coltrane support this connection, showing the correlation between a society’s structure and the expectations for men and women. They found that greater equality between men and women led to greater male involvement in childcare. However, because dominator culture upholds a harsh division between masculinity and femininity, it dissociates masculinity from anything stereotypically feminine—even at the expense of benefits such as those reported by Sanday and Coltrane. Accordingly, in these societies that prize domination and power, the societal value for qualities like empathy, caregiving, and nonviolence diminishes. Instead, by viewing femininity as undesirable and inferior, these dominator societies accept and perpetuate violent and inequitable behavior.\n\nIn dominator culture, society reinforces such hierarchies by presenting the dominator model as the natural order of society. According to Eisler, some sociobiologists and psychologists claim that male dominance is inherent in human genes and a product of evolution, demonstrating dominator thinking. Theorist bell hooks has expanded on this, indicating that dominator culture “teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role.” By accepting male dominance as a genetic imperative, society justifies a dominator structure. Consequently, this situates the desire to overpower and control others as part of human identity, according to hooks.\n\nThis hierarchical disparity is not only explained genetically but societally reinforced, extending to “power” more generally. Although Eisler often distinguishes between the two models on the basis of gender, she also applies these hierarchies more broadly to other societal constructions of power, like race, class, and age. Terence McKenna, a friend of Eisler’s and fellow writer, asserts that Eisler's book \"The Chalice and the Blade\" “de-genderized the terminology,” framing it as a contrast between dominator and partnership ideologies, rather than just an indictment of patriarchy. Supporting this interpretation, Eisler argues that society’s requirement of children to be submissive and obedient to their parents reflects the influence of dominator culture. Dominator culture encourages the ideology, from childhood, that one either dominates or is dominated. Accordingly, dominator culture not only equates the difference between men and women to superiority and inferiority, but rather “frame[s] all relationships as power struggles.\"\n\nDominator culture has had varying manifestations in society throughout the course of human history, from the prehistoric warlike tribes of the Neolithic era to present-day displays. The dominator structure of society dictates and shapes the culture that accompanies it. Other authors have used, expanded on, and interpreted Riane Eisler’s idea of dominator culture to apply it to a wide range of fields, as far-reaching as nursing, war, language learning, economics, and ecofeminism.\n\nAuthor Malcolm Hollick cites Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Islamic fundamentalist states as modern, though severe, examples of dominator societies. The Nazi claim to power, for example, was also accompanied by the call for women’s return to “traditional,” or subservient, places in family structures. However, manifestations of dominator culture are not always so extreme; the effects of dominator culture often manifest in pervasive and subtle ways in society. In the United States, the wars on terror, drugs, and crime perpetuate the use of force to achieve an end and indicate a lessening of certain freedoms. On a larger scale, sex-slavery, forced marriage, and the acceptance of wife-beating persist around the world. Though the Western world has made considerable strides towards a more partnership society in the past few centuries—Western society boasts of freedom of speech, access to education, political participation, gay rights, and women in the workforce—the shift towards the partnership model is neither universal nor complete.\n\nSimilarly, dominator culture threatens the preservation of the environment. Hierarchical societies that value claiming control justify humans' claims of dominion over nature. Terence McKenna expanded on Eisler’s work, using the idea of dominator culture to illuminate the character of what he sees as Western patriarchal culture—indicating, for example, his claims that it perennially lacks social conscience and lacks concern for the environment. He argues that, “The entire structure of dominator culture… is based upon our alienation from nature, from ourselves, and from each other.” As a result, dominator culture not only accepts but justifies the pollution and destruction of the environment. Daniel Quinn, a philosophical and environmental writer, takes on these issues in his novel \"Ishmael\", characterizing dominator culture as Taker culture and detailing its incompatibility with the environment.\n\nThe term has been used and expanded upon by other writers, such as\n\nDespite the stability and fairness characteristic of partnership society, dominator culture often still takes precedence. Eisler argues that blindly accepting dominator culture as part of the genetic, natural order of the world excuses human responsibility. When people understand dominator culture as a genetic imperative, they ignore environmental influences, including parenting. This perpetuates the cycle of dominator culture and ignores scientific findings that contradict the supposedly genetic nature of violence. By accepting dominator culture as the norm, people discount their own claim to agency. However, in her article “Love as the Practice of Freedom,” bell hooks offers a potential counter to dominator culture. She states that love—the “longing to connect with someone radically different”—led people to overcome dominator thinking in action, whether the issue was “ending racism, sexism, homophobia, or class elitism.” Ultimately, Eisler acknowledges that cultural transformation does not happen on its own; however, she asserts, “Many of us worldwide are working for cultural transformation, for a shift to a more peaceful, equitable, and sustainable way of relating to one another and our Mother Earth.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2043056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2043056", "title": "Ecopsychology", "text": "Ecopsychology\n\nEcopsychology studies the relationship between human beings and the natural world through ecological and psychological principles. The field seeks to develop and understand ways of expanding the emotional connection between individuals and the natural world, thereby assisting individuals with developing sustainable lifestyles and remedying alienation from nature. Theodore Roszak is credited with coining the term in his 1992 book, \"The Voice of the Earth,\" although a group of psychologists and environmentalists in Berkeley, including Mary Gomes and Allen Kanner, were independently using the term to describe their own work at the same time. Roszak, Gomes and Kanner later expanded the idea in the 1995 anthology \"Ecopsychology.\" Two other books were especially formative for the field, Paul Shepard's 1982 volume, \"Nature and Madness,\" which explored the effect that our ever-diminishing engagement with wild nature had upon human psychological development, and philosopher David Abram's \"The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,\" published in 1996. The latter was the first widely read book to bring phenomenology to bear on ecological and ecopsychological issues, examining in detail the earthly dimensions of sensory experience, and disclosing the historical effect of formal writing systems upon the human experience of nature's agency, voice, and interiority.\n\nA central premise of ecopsychology is that while today the human mind is affected and shaped by the modern social world, its deep structure is inevitably adapted to, and informed by, the more-than-human natural environment in which it evolved. According to the biophilia hypothesis of biologist E.O. Wilson, human beings have an innate instinct to connect emotionally with nature, particularly the aspects of nature that recall what evolutionary psychologists have termed the environment of evolutionary adaptiveness, the natural conditions that the human species evolved to inhabit.\n\nThe field of ecopsychology extends beyond the conventional purview of psychology, which had traditionally considered the psyche to be a matter of relevance to humans alone. Ecopsychology examines why people continue environmentally damaging behaviour, and to develop methods of positive motivation for adopting sustainable practices. Evidence suggests that many environmentally damaging behaviours are addictive at some level, and thus are more effectively addressed through positive emotional fulfillment rather than by inflicting shame. Other names used to refer to ecopsychology include depth ecology, Gaia psychology, psychoecology, ecotherapy, environmental psychology, green psychology, transpersonal ecology, global therapy, green therapy, Earth-centered therapy, reearthing, nature-based psychotherapy, shamanic counselling, ecosophy and sylvan therapy.\n\nCertain researchers propose that an individual's connection to nature can improve their interpersonal relationships and emotional wellbeing. An integral part of this practice is to remove psychotherapy, and the individual, from the interior of office buildings and homes and place them outdoors. According to the precepts of ecopsychology, a walk in the woods or a city park is refreshing because it is what humans evolved to do. Psychologists such as Roger Ulrich, Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, Frances Kuo and others have studied the beneficial effects of inhabiting natural settings and of looking at pictures of landscapes on the human psyche. Richard Louv's \"Last Child in the Woods: Saving our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder\" discusses in detail how the exposure of children to nature can assist in treating mental disorders, including attention deficit disorder. Community psychologist Guy Holmes' Walk and Talk groups have helped people with serious mental health diagnoses alongside other members of the general public to access the benefits of walking in green spaces in UK towns and cities.\n\nGardening is one way to experience the practical benefits of connecting with nature, particularly in the contexts of stress reduction, restoration, and awareness. Initial experimental research about stress-relieving effects showed subjects who gardened after situations of acute stress were able to fully recover from the event and their cortisol level measurements indicated positive mood increases after gardening. The psychological benefits of interactions with nature appear intensified at a smaller, more compressed scale in gardens, offering an accessible, fast-paced view of plant life cycles. Also, the practice of domestic gardening can improve sense of self-efficacy across ages, particularly among the elderly. Psychologists are also interested in the ways plants influence attention and healing. Plants are attributed as sources of positive distraction, shifting the focus from sensations of discomfort to aesthetic properties of plants, which creates perceived alleviation of pain. Individuals who have the opportunity to reconnect with nature through horticultural practices and in the wilderness can restore perceived sense of social connection, joy, and health. Interacting with nature is a practical preventative measure against mental-health issues that stem from rumination. When a group of participants in one study went on a walk in nature they expressed lower levels of rumination and showed diminished neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex, an area tied to mental illness, while participants who walked through urban settings experienced no changes in either respect. \n\nAnother premise of ecopsychology is that steps taken to accept and notice nature can sharpen the senses and help people cultivate new skills. For example, the ability to track and navigate through a wilderness is improved if nature is noticed and accepted rather than feared. Similarly, ecopsychology proposes that sailors who appreciate the sea gain a keen sense for breeze directions. Psychologists have explored how senses subtly influence the brain in natural environments and impact a person's subjective well-being. Plants in the visual sphere affect the brain whether or not they are the object of focus and the blue and green hues of nature may contribute to low-anxiety psychological states.\n\nEcopsychology explores how to develop emotional bonds with nature. It considers this to be worthwhile because when nature is explored and viewed without judgement, it gives the sensations of harmony, balance, timelessness and stability. Ecopsychology largely rejects reductionist views of nature that focus upon rudimentary building blocks such as genes, and that describe nature as selfish and a struggle to survive. Ecopsychology considers that there has been insufficient scientific description and exploration of nature, in terms of wildness, parsimony, spirituality and emotional ties. For example, parsimony is the best way to produce an evolutionary tree of the species (cladistics), suggesting that parsimonious adaptations are selected. Yet today, the brain is often seen as complicated and governed by inherited mind modules, rather than being a simple organ that looks for parsimony within the influences of its surroundings, resulting in the compaction in minds of a great diversity of concepts.\n\nIn its exploration of how to bond with nature, ecopsychology is interested in the examples provided by a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures that have histories of embracing nature. Examples include aboriginal, pagan, Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu cultures, as well as shamanism and the more recent hesychast tradition. Of interest is how identity becomes entwined with nature, so that loss of those sacred places is far more devastating to indigenous people than often understood. Native American stories, in particular, illustrate a socially recognized sense of community between humans and the natural landscape. The Māori philosophy, and practice of kaitiakitanga, or eco-guardianship, and preservation emphasizes a deep connect between humans, and their environment. Eastern Orthodox monks led a contemplative life deeply intertwined with nature. Other lessons include how to live sustainably within an environment and the self-sacrifices made to tolerate natural limits, such as population control or a nomadic existence that allows the environment to regenerate. Moreover, certain indigenous cultures have developed methods of psychotherapy involving the presence of trees, rivers, and astronomical bodies.\n\nEcopsychologists have begun detecting unspoken grief within individuals, an escalation of pain and despair, felt in response to widespread environmental destruction. The field of ecopsychology intends to illustrate how environmental disconnection functions as an aspect of existing pathologies, without creating a new category. The contention is that if a culture is disconnected from nature, then various aspects of an individual's life will be negatively impacted. It also believes that without the influence of nature, humans are prone to a variety of delusions, and that to some degree life in the wild forms the basis for human sanity and optimal psychological development. The topic is explored in detail Paul Shepard's book \"Nature and Madness\". It is also proposed that separation from outdoor contact causes a loss of sensory and information-processing ability that was developed over the course of human evolution, which was spent in direct reciprocity with the environment.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52936102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52936102", "title": "Environmental justice and coal mining in Appalachia", "text": "Environmental justice and coal mining in Appalachia\n\nEnvironmental justice and coal mining in Appalachia is the study of environmental justice – the interdisciplinary body of social science literature studying theories of the environment and justice; environmental laws, policies, and their implementations and enforcement; development and sustainability; and political ecology – in relation to Coal mining in Appalachia.\n\nThe Appalachian region of the Southeastern United States is a leading producer of coal in the country. Research shows that people who live in close proximity to mountaintop removal (MTR) mines have higher mortality rates than average, and are more likely to live in poverty be exposed to harmful environmental conditions than people in otherwise comparable parts of the region.\n\nIn the late 1990s, several Appalachian women, including Julia Bonds, began to speak out against MTR and its effects on the people and environment of mining communities. Research has shown that MTR is causing \"irreparable\" environmental damage in Appalachia. The blasting of mountaintops has polluted stream and water supplies have been contaminated by toxic waste from coal processing called slurry ponds. Scientists have noted an increase in respiratory and heart problems among area residents, including lung cancer. Mortality rates and birth defect rates are higher in the areas surrounding surface mining locations.\n\nCoal mining production in Appalachia declined from 1990 to 2015, but there is some debate over why. Cited factors include a rising demand for clean energy, environmental policies and regulations set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and globalization. The number of coal mining jobs in the region remained steady from 2000 to 2010, but declined by 37% between 2011 and 2015. Less production is responsible for much of this job loss, but improved mining techniques like mountain-top removal also contributed. Discourse around coal in the area has sparked a debate in academia over whether it creates wealth or poverty. The core debate centers around coal production's impact on local and national economy.\n\nAppalachia is one of three coal-mining regions in the United States; the others are the Interior coal region, and the Western coal region, which includes the Powder River Basin. Eight states lie in the Appalachian coal region: Alabama, eastern Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. West Virginia is the largest coal-producing state in Appalachia, and the second-largest coal-producing state in the United States, accounting for about 11% of the nation's total coal production in 2014 (the largest coal-producing state is Wyoming, which lies in the Western coal region and accounts for 40% of U.S. coal production). Two other states in the Appalachian coal region, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, account for 8% and 6% of U.S. coal production, respectively.\n\nThe coal industry in Appalachia has changed over time. According to U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration data, Central Appalachia—consisting of southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, and eastern Tennessee—made up almost 29% of U.S. coal production in the U.S. in 1990, but only about 13% by 2013. By contrast, coal production in Northern Appalachian has remained relatively stable, going from 16% in 1990 to 12.5% in 2013. As a result, \"both regions account for nearly the same share of U.S. coal production\" .\n\nIn the Appalachian coal region, 72% of coal produced came from underground mines. This is a much higher percentage than in the Western coal region, where 90% of all coal produced comes from surface mines.\n\nHistorically, \"the building of coal towns began in the 1880s, peaked in the 1920s, and virtually ended with the coming of the Great Depression\" when the availability of other forms of energy—namely, oil, gas, and hydroelectricity—reduced demand for coal. The company town was particularly dominant in southern Appalachia; in 1925, almost 80% of West Virginia coal miners lived in company towns, while an average of 64.4% of coal miners in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee lived in company towns.\n\nSince 1995, the Appalachian region has produced about half of the United States' coal. Although Appalachia has played a large role in contributing to the coal supply of the United States, the communities surrounding such mining practices have suffered immensely. Several studies have shown disparities between mining communities and non-mining communities in terms of public health, environmental degradation, pollution, and overall quality of life in Appalachia. Variations of surface coal mining techniques in the Appalachia include contour, area, high-wall, auger, and mountaintop removal mining (MTR).\n\nThe damage caused by mountaintop removal strip mining has had a calculable effect on the environment and communities in Appalachia. The resource rich region remains economically deprived and suffers from the externalities of coal mining, including the health problems caused by coal pollution. The Office of Surface Mining (OSM) is the federal agency tasked with regulating strip-mining under the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). According to OSM, \"[t]o the extent that low income populations are prevalent in the coalfields, the impacts of mountaintop mining are felt disproportionately by these environmental justice populations\".\n\nMost local residents are unable to see the extent of the damage that has been caused by surface mining. Geologist Sean P. Bemis investigated claims by local residents that the extent of the damage was not easily visible. In interviews with the research team, former miner Chuck Nelson stated that the extent of the destruction is only clearly visible from a plane. Coalfield resident activist Maria Gunnoe gave a similar account to the researchers, saying \"I never realized it was so bad. My first fly-over with South Wings [non-profit aviation organization], and that right there is what really fired me up. When I got off the plane that day, I cried all the way across the tarmac, all the way home ...\" The Government Accountability Office (GAO) confirmed this in a 2009 report: \n\nThere are no official records of the total number of \"disturbed acres\" that have resulted from surface mining, but geospatial analysis has shown that between 1.05million and 1.28million acres of land and more than 500 mountains in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia have been surface mined.\n\nSeveral studies have found that communities within the Appalachian region surrounding coal mining practices disproportionately experience negative health effects than communities with no coal mining. Such health disparities are largely attributed to the contamination of water and land associated with coal surface mining. MTR has increased salinity, metals, magnesium, and sulfates within Appalachian watersheds, threatening human health. Sixty-three percent of stream beds near coalfields within the Appalachia mountains have been identified as \"impaired\" due to high toxic chemical and metal contamination. In West Virginia, 14 counties are experiencing water that exceeds safe drinking water standards by seven times more than non-mining counties. Combustion waste and fly ash from MTR lend to toxic dusts pollute the surrounding air and have contributed to increased levels of cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and kidney disease. Public health costs of pollution in the Appalachia are upwards of 75 billion dollars a year. In a comparative analysis of health-related quality of residences in counties with and without coal mining Appalachia \"reported significantly fewer healthy days for both physical and mental health\". The same study highlights strong correlations between heavy coal mining counties and a greater risk of depression and severe psychological distress. Areas in the Appalachia with coal surface mining exhibit greater rates of adverse health effects and reduced self-rated health in comparison to the national average. In addition, studies from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have concluded a high \"relationship between surface coal mining jobs and the prevalence of pneumoconiosis\". Lastly, through examination of mortality rates, county-level poverty rates, and coal mining within counties of the Appalachia, it was identified that coal mining areas of Appalachia experienced higher mortality rates then counties with no coal mining.\n\nCoal surface mining has heavily altered the hydrological cycle and landscape of the Appalachia causing environmental degradation and contributing to ecosystem damages beyond repair. Surface coal mining in the Appalachian has contributed to the destruction of over 500 mountain tops. In addition, it has led to the clearance of over 1 million acres of forests and contributed to the degradation or permanent loss of over 12000 miles of streams crucial to the Appalachia watershed from 1985- 2001. Increased salinity and metal contamination of the Appalachian streams have led to toxic effects of fish and bird species. Mountaintop removal, or MTR, is a type of surface mining that has played a major role in negatively impacting the Appalachian environment. When MTR is used, it causes much of the contaminants from the process to be emptied into surrounding valleys which, oftentimes, make their way into nearby streams. These wastes are disposed in \"valley fills\" which have collapsed and produced heavy flash floods in Appalachia. The Environmental Protection Agency approximates that between 1985 and 2001, over 700 miles worth of streams in the Appalachians were covered by these \"valley fills\" due to mountaintop removal coal mining.\n\nAppalachia has historically been one of the most impoverished regions of the country.\n\nThere is a debate about whether coal production is a source of wealth or poverty in Appalachia. The U.S. geological survey and the U.S. bureau of mines states that there is a coal-wealth paradox in Appalachia. Appalachia is home to some of the largest coal mines yet the average per capita income is only about 68% of the national per capita income. However, work done by Black and Sanders shows that between 1970 and 1980 the increase in coal production substantially boosted the pay of low skilled workers in Appalachia and likely caused a decrease in income inequality.\n\nAlthough coal mining industries are often associated with increased jobs and economic growth, this association does not hold for Appalachia, where two-thirds of the counties have higher levels of unemployment than the nation and per capita personal wages falling 20% lower than the nation. More specifically, in Hendryx and Zullig's comparative analysis of Appalachia counties, those with coal mining had greater economic disparities and more poverty than those without industry. The shift towards coal surface mining from underground mining led to a 50% decline in mining jobs from 1985 to 2005, and competition from cheap natural gas also decreased demand for coal, leading some mines to close or reduce extraction, which further increased unemployment. From 2014 to 2015, overall mining employment for Appalachia has dropped by 15.9%. A NASA study states that promises of beneficial post-mining development in the Appalachian region have yet to materialize. A 2017 study found that neighborhoods closest to coal impoundments are \"slightly more likely to have higher rates of poverty and unemployment, even after controlling for rurality, mining-related variables, and spatial dependence\".\n\nIn 1972, a slurry pond built by Pittson Coal Company collapsed. In what is known as the Buffalo Creek disaster 130 million gallons of sludge flooded Buffalo Creek. More recently, a waste impoundment owned by Massey burst in Kentucky, flooding nearby streams with 250 tons of coal slurry.\n\nThe 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) created two programs: one for regulating active coal mines and a second for reclaiming abandoned mine lands.\n\nIn the view of Jedediah Purdy, The Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act improved the quality of air and water for much of America, but created \"sacrificial zones\" in America, including coal mining communities in Appalachia, that hid the environmental effects of industry and agriculture from people in suburbs but increased exposure to danger for people who lived near sites of pollution.\n\nThese laws, along with the National Environmental Policy Act form the basis in law for regulation of coal mining, including mountaintop removal mining.\nRegulations issued on the basis of these laws focus on issuing or withholding permits for new mining operations; the regulations themselves have been contested.\n, these laws did not take into account direct effects on communities near mines nor economic or racial disparities in those communities, and regulations and executive orders issued that attempted to address such environmental justice concerns had been struck down, and legal challenges based on potential effects on local communities generally failed, since neither the law nor regulations were written to address these concerns and judges ruled based on what the law and regulations actually said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is a federal government health care law; it includes provisions that amend the Black Lung Benefits program. The Black Lung Benefits program details the extent to which coal miners have their medical coverage compensated by the federal government. The ACA provisions that amend the Black Lung Benefits program are commonly known as the Byrd Amendments taking its name from the late West Virginia Congressman Robert Byrd. The Byrd Amendments are found in Section 1556 of the ACA. Among the many protections the Byrd Amendments provides coal miners, it covers medical expenses for coal miners who worked at least 15 years underground (or comparable surface mining) and who have a totally disabling respiratory impairment. Further, it shifts the burden of proof of disability due to \"black lung disease\" from these coal miners back to the coal companies. Pneumoconiosis or \"black lung disease\" can be a common health problem faced by retired coal miners.\n\nEarly attempts to regulate strip-mining on the state level were largely unsuccessful due to lax enforcement. The Appalachian Group to Save the Land and the People was founded in 1965 to stop surface mining. In 1968, Congress held the first hearings on strip mining. Ken Hechler introduced the first strip-mining abolition bill in Congress in 1971. Though this bill was not passed, provisions establishing a process to reclaim abandoned strip mines and allowing citizens to sue regulatory agencies became parts of SMCRA.\n\nSMCRA also created the Office of Surface Mining, an agency within the Department of the Interior, to promulgate regulations, to fund state regulatory and reclamation efforts, and to ensure consistency among state regulatory programs.\n\nThe study of justice has often been defined by the theories of John Rawls. Justice theory has focused on the principles by the which to distribute goods in a society. The defining arguments of the environmental justice movement were about patterns that violated some of these distributive principles of justice theory. Several contemporary scholars have developed theories of justice that are broader then the distributional theory of justice.\n\nThe study of justice theory, as applied to the environmental justice, has primarily focused on \"maldistribution\". In other words, this area of study has concentrated on the fact that poor communities, indigenous communities and communities of color are often disproportionately impacted by environmentally-related negative externalities and receive less environmental protection.\n\nEnvironmental justice has been identified by scholars as a movement that acknowledged the disproportionate effects of environmental damage and toxic contamination on the poor and people of color. It has also been noted that the race and class of the parties effects the community's chances of success in enacting reforms. Environmental justice groups were community grassroots organizations that combined environmentalism with issues of race a class equality. These groups organized in opposition to the disproportionate threat mountain communities faced from health hazards like acid mine drainage.\n\nSave Our Cumberland Mountains (SOCM, pronounced \"sock 'em\") was founded when thirteen residents of the Tennessee coalfields petitioned their state government to make coal landholders pay a fair share of taxes. SOCM later grew into one of most significant community organizations in the region and went on to lead a major legislative campaign against employers who replaced their permanent employees with long-term temporary workers.\n\nJ.W. Bradley was the president of SOCM for its first five years. He had worked in the deep mines and was outspoken about what he called the \"evils of strip mining.\" He believed in using litigation to pursue reform. In 1974, SOCM established the East Tennessee Research Corporation as a public interest law firm. By 1976, SOCM was trying to ban strip mining and targeting individual strip mining operations.\n\nAn attorney who worked with SOCM in the 1970s has written that very few people of color were involved with SOCM in the early years. He highlights the importance of regional organizations like the Highlander Research and Education Center that \"seek to bring together diverse communities to share their knowledge about the inner dynamics of environmental justice issues\".\n\nMountain Justice began in 2005 as a summer-long campaign for the abolition of MTM. The organization was started after a 2004 mining accident in Virginia. A three year old was killed when a boulder rolled off a MTM site above his home. The first MJ meeting took place in Knoxville, Tennessee and included activists from Coal River Mountain Watch (CRMW), the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, and Katuah Earth First (KEF!). Their mission statement includes a commitment to non-violence.\n\n"}

In many places, there is a convention that people should stand on one particular side of an escalator to allow other people to walk on the other side.\n\nA 2015 experiment by Transport for London has suggested that such a convention sometimes reduces the efficiency of escalators: the number of people carried can increase if people stand on both sides.\n\nThe first escalators installed in the London Underground at Earl's Court station used the design patented by Charles Seeberger. These did not let the passengers dismount in the direction of travel, as currently. Instead, a diagonal partition shunted them off to one side while the stairs disappeared under the partition. The side chosen for disembarkation was the left hand side and this is the origin of their convention that riders should stand on the right, so that the walking riders would not have to cut into a standing line of people to exit. Locations such as Hong Kong and Belgium also follow this convention.\n\nHowever certain countries, for instance Australia, Singapore, most of Japan, and New Zealand, riders stand on the left and walk on the right, following the road rules.\n\n"}
{"id": "886036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=886036", "title": "Ethical intuitionism", "text": "Ethical intuitionism\n\nEthical intuitionism (also called moral intuitionism) is a family of views in moral epistemology (and, on some definitions, metaphysics). At minimum, ethical intuitionism is the thesis that our intuitive awareness of value, or intuitive knowledge of evaluative facts, forms the foundation of our ethical knowledge.\n\nThe view is at its core a foundationalism about moral knowledge: it is the view that some moral truths can be known non-inferentially (i.e., known without one needing to infer them from other truths one believes). Such an epistemological view implies that there are moral beliefs with propositional contents; so it implies cognitivism. As such, ethical intuitionism is to be contrasted with coherentist approaches to moral epistemology, such as those that depend on reflective equilibrium.\n\nThroughout the philosophical literature, the term \"ethical intuitionism\" is frequently used with significant variation in its sense. This article's focus on foundationalism reflects the core commitments of contemporary self-identified ethical intuitionists.\n\nSufficiently broadly defined, ethical intuitionism can be taken to encompass cognitivist forms of moral sense theory. It is usually furthermore taken as essential to ethical intuitionism that there be self-evident or \"a priori\" moral knowledge; this counts against considering moral sense theory to be a species of intuitionism. (see the Rational intuition versus moral sense section of this article for further discussion).\n\nWhile there were ethical intuitionists in a broad sense at least as far back as Thomas Aquinas, the philosophical school usually labelled as ethical intuitionism developed in Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries. Early intuitionists like John Balguy, Ralph Cudworth, and Samuel Clarke were principally concerned with defending moral objectivism against the theories of Thomas Hobbes. Later, their views would be revived and developed by Richard Price and pitted against the moral sense theory of Francis Hutcheson, himself sometimes considered a sentimentalist intuitionist. Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy would be received in Britain as a German analog to Price, though according to R. M. Hare it is questionable whether Kant is an intuitionist.\n\nIn the 19th century, ethical intuitionism was considered by most British philosophers to be a philosophical rival of utilitarianism, until Henry Sidgwick showed there to be several logically distinct theories, both normative and epistemological, sharing the same label. Sidgwick would furthermore argue that utilitarianism could be justified on the basis of a rational intuitionist epistemology. Inspired by this, 20th century philosopher C.D. Broad would coin the term \"deontological ethics\" to refer to the normative doctrines associated with intuitionism, leaving the phrase \"ethical intuitionism\" free to refer to the epistemological doctrines.\n\nEthical intuitionism was popular in the early twentieth century, particularly among British analytic philosophers. H.A. Prichard gave a defense of the view in his \"Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?\" (1912), wherein he contended that moral philosophy rested chiefly on the desire to provide arguments starting from non-normative premises for the principles of obligation that we pre-philosophically accept, such as the principle that one ought to keep one's promises or that one ought not to steal. This is a mistake, Prichard argued, both because it is impossible to derive any statement about what one ought to do from statements not concerning obligation (even statements about what is \"good\"), and because there is no need to do so since common sense principles of moral obligation are self-evident.\n\nPrichard was influenced by G.E. Moore, whose \"Principia Ethica\" (1903) argued famously that \"goodness\" was an indefinable, non-natural property of which we had intuitive awareness. Moore originated the term \"the naturalistic fallacy\" to refer to the (alleged) error of confusing goodness with some natural property, and he deployed the Open Question Argument to show why this was an error. Unlike Prichard, Moore thought that one could derive principles of obligation from propositions about what is good.\n\nEthical intuitionism suffered a dramatic fall from favor by the middle of the century, due in part to the influence of logical positivism, in part to the rising popularity of naturalism in philosophy, and in part to philosophical objections based on the phenomenon of widespread moral disagreement. C. L. Stevenson's emotivism would prove especially attractive to Moorean intuitionists seeking to avoid ethical naturalism. In the later parts of the 20th century, intuitionism would have few adherents to speak of; in Bernard Williams' words: \"This model of intuition in ethics has been demolished by a succession of critics, and the ruins of it that remain above ground are not impressive enough to invite much history of what happened to it.\"\n\nSome recent work suggests the view may be enjoying a resurgence of interest in academic philosophy. Robert Audi is one of the main supporters of ethical intuitionism in our days. His 2005 book, \"The Good in the Right\", claims to update and strengthen Rossian intuitionism and to develop the epistemology of ethics. Michael Huemer's book \"Ethical Intuitionism\" (2005) also provides a recent defense of the view. Furthermore, authors writing on normative ethics often accept \"methodological intuitionism\" as they present allegedly obvious or intuitive examples or thought experiments as support for their theories.\n\nBecause it was not until Sidgwick that it was clear there were several distinct theses sharing the label \"ethical intuitionism\", the term has developed many different connotations. This is liable to cause confusion; for example, G.E. Moore's \"Principia Ethica\" is often considered a \"locus classicus\" defense of ethical intuitionism, yet Moore explicitly refuses the label because of the large number of differences between his own views and traditional intuitionists.\n\nTraditionally, intuitionism was often understood as having several other commitments:\n\nHowever, none of these positions are essential to the view; most ethical intuitionists (such as G.E. Moore and W.D. Ross) simply happen to have held those views as well.\n\nFurthermore, intuitionists are often understood to be essentially committed to the existence of a special psychological faculty that reliably produces true moral intuitions. Few intuitionists, however, have explicitly required such a faculty exist, and some, such as Richard Price, would have explicitly denied it exists.\n\nSecondly, sometimes the term \"ethical intuitionism\" is associated with a pluralistic, deontological position in normative ethics, a position defended by most ethical intuitionists, with Henry Sidgwick and G.E. Moore being notable exceptions.\n\nRobert Audi (2004, Ch. 1) points out that in applied ethics, philosophers frequently appeal to intuitions to justify their claims, even though they do not call themselves intuitionists. Audi hence uses the label \"intuitivists\" to refer to people who are intuitionists without labeling themselves as such.\n\nOn this broad understanding of intuitionism, there are only a few ways someone doing moral philosophy might \"not \"count as an intuitionist. First, they might really refrain from relying on intuitions in moral philosophy altogether (say, by attempting to derive all moral claims from claims about what certain individuals desire). Second, they might deny foundationalism in favor of (say) coherentism. Third, they might be non-cognitivists, holding that moral \"beliefs\" aren't really beliefs at all.\n\nSome use the term \"ethical intuitionism\" in moral philosophy to refer to the general position that we have some non-inferential moral knowledge (see Sinnott-Armstrong, 2006a and 2006b)—that is, basic moral knowledge that is not inferred from or based on any proposition. However, it is important to distinguish between empiricist versus rationalist models of this. Some, thus, reserve the term \"ethical intuitionism\" for the rationalist model and the term \"moral sense theory\" for the empiricist model (see Sinnott-Armstrong, 2006b, pp. 184–186, especially fn. 4). However, the terminology is not ultimately important, so long as one keeps in mind the relevant differences between these two views.\n\nGenerally speaking, rationalist ethical intuitionism models the acquisition of such non-inferential moral knowledge on \"a priori\", non-empirical knowledge, such as knowledge of mathematical truths; whereas moral sense theory models the acquisition of such non-inferential moral knowledge on empirical knowledge, such as knowledge of the colors of objects (see moral sense theory).\n\nThe rationalist version of ethical intuitionism models ethical intuitions on \"a priori\", non-empirically-based intuitions of truths, such as basic truths of mathematics. Take for example the belief that two minus one is one. This piece of knowledge is often thought to be non-inferential in that it is not grounded in or justified by some other proposition or claim. Rather, one who understands the relevant concepts involved in the proposition that two minus one is one has what one might call an \"intuition\" of the truth of the proposition. One intuits the truth of the proposition, rather than inferring it. Likewise, the ethical intuitionist claims that basic moral truths—whether they are principles (such as \"don't kill people\") or judgments (such as \"it is wrong to kill people\")—are known without inference, and in particular they are known via one's rational intuition.\n\nSome rationalist ethical intuitionists characterize moral \"intuitions\" as a species of belief (for example, Audi, 2005, pp. 33–6) that are \"self-evident\" in that they are justified simply by virtue of one's understanding of the proposition believed. Others characterize \"intuitions\" as a distinct kind of mental state, in which something \"seems\" to one to be the case (whether one believes it or not) as a result of intellectual reflection. Michael Huemer (2005), for example, defines \"intuition\" as a sort of seeming:\n\nReasoning sometimes changes how things seem to us. But there is also a way things seem to us prior to reasoning; otherwise, reasoning could not get started. The way things seem prior to reasoning we may call an 'initial appearance'. An initial, \"intellectual\" appearance is an 'intuition'. That is, an intuition that \"p\" is a state of its seeming to one that \"p\" that is not dependent on inference from other beliefs and that results from thinking about \"p\", as opposed to perceiving, remembering, or introspecting. An ethical intuition is an intuition whose content is an evaluative proposition. (§5.2)\n\nRegardless of one's definition of rational intuition, intuitionists all agree that rational intuitions are not justified by inference from a separate belief.\n\nAnother version—what one might call the empiricist version—of ethical intuitionism models non-inferential ethical knowledge on sense perception. This version involves what is often called a \"moral sense\". According to moral sense theorists, certain moral truths are known via this moral sense simply on the basis of experience, not inference.\n\nOne way to understand the moral sense is to draw an analogy between it and other kinds of senses. Beauty, for example, is something we see in some faces, artworks and landscapes. We can also hear it in some pieces of music. We clearly do not need an independent aesthetic sense faculty to perceive beauty in the world. Our ordinary five senses are quite enough to observe it, though merely observing something beautiful is no guarantee that we can observe its beauty. In the same way, a color-blind person is not necessarily able to perceive the green color of grass although he is capable of vision. Suppose we give a name to this ability to appreciate the beauty in things we see: one might call it the \"aesthetic sense\". This aesthetic sense does not come automatically to all people with perfect vision and hearing, so it is fair to describe it as something extra, something not wholly reducible to vision and hearing. As the aesthetic sense informs us about what is beautiful, we can analogically understand the \"moral sense\" as informing us of what is good. People with a functioning moral sense get a clear impression of wrongness when they see puppies being kicked, for example.\n\nMany people think that beauty is subjective, that it is \"in the eye of the beholder.\" They would claim there are really no objective facts about what is and is not beautiful, only facts about what people prefer. Because of the close analogies between the moral and the aesthetic sense, parity of reasoning suggests that we should see the difference between right and wrong as also being merely in the eye of the beholder. Though ethical intuitionists insist on the analogy, they equally insist that the facts about right and wrong are perfectly objective. How can they have it both ways?\n\nEthical intuitionists could respond by arguing that the moral-aesthetic analogy is merely used to illustrate the fact that not all senses are limited to the five physical senses. However, this doesn't necessarily imply any further connection between the moral and aesthetic senses.\n\nThe problem is made worse by the fact that there is so much widespread and apparently irresolveable disagreement about moral values. Why do these not get settled through the careful use of the moral sense? There are no long disputes about whether some object is green – these would be quickly settled if we just invited the disputing parties to look. Why does the moral sense not settle moral disagreements in a similarly simple way?\n\nEthical intuitionists could respond by pointing to numerous long-standing debates in philosophy and science. There are no long disputes about whether some object is green because that's simply a matter of observation, whereas metaphysics, epistemology, evolution, and quantum mechanics require reason, which is prone to human error. A similar analogy could be made about moral sense, which might give us a clear idea of what \"rightness\" is, but perhaps doesn't grant us direct knowledge of normative ethics.\n\nIt is undeniable that humans experience a feeling of right and wrong, but are these feelings evidence of an independent feature of the world? The principle of Occam's razor suggests that we postulate only those entities which are necessary to best explain our observations. The existence of an objective wrongness is not necessary to explain our queasy and resentful feelings. Thus, according to the principle, we should say there is no such thing as wrongness, and perhaps looks toward an explanation such as emotivism to explain the meanings of our sentences about wrongness.\n\nA counter-objection is that the very fact we do postulate the independent feature regarding morals is indicative, and the fact we do not feel the need to do this for queasiness is itself an argument for objective morality. Moral sense might inform us of the existence of objective morality, just as eyesight informs us of the existence of colors. Occam's razor wouldn't dismiss the existence of eyesight or colors, but would require the simplest explanation of how they work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5378848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5378848", "title": "Formal ontology", "text": "Formal ontology\n\nIn philosophy, the term formal ontology is used to refer to an ontology defined by axioms in a formal language with the goal to provide an unbiased (domain- and application-independent) view on reality, which can help the modeler of domain- or application-specific ontologies (information science) to avoid possibly erroneous ontological assumptions encountered in modeling large-scale ontologies.\n\nBy maintaining an independent view on reality a formal (upper level) ontology gains the following properties:\n\nTheories on how to conceptualize reality date back as far as Plato and Aristotle. The term 'formal ontology' itself was coined by Edmund Husserl in the second edition of his \"Logical Investigations\" (1913/1921), where it refers to an ontological counterpart of formal logic. Formal ontology for Husserl embraces an axiomatized mereology and a theory of dependence relations, for example between the qualities of an object and the object itself. 'Formal' signifies not the use of a formal-logical language, but rather: non-material, or in other words domain-independent (of universal application). Husserl's ideas on formal ontology were developed especially by his Polish student Roman Ingarden in his \"Controversy over the Existence of the World\". The relations between the Husserlian tradition of formal ontology and the Polish tradition of mereology are set forth in \"Parts and Moments. Studies in Logic and Formal Ontology\", edited by Barry Smith. Smith's work on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) (see below) arises out of this tradition.\n\n\nThe differences in terminology used between separate formal upper-level ontologies can be quite substantial, but most formal upper-level ontologies apply one foremost dichotomy: that between endurants and perdurants.\n\nAlso known as continuants, or in some cases as \"substance\", endurants are those entities that can be observed-perceived as a complete concept, at no matter which given snapshot of time.\nWere we to freeze time we would still be able to perceive/conceive the entire endurant.\n\nExamples include material objects (such as an apple or a human), and abstract \"fiat\" objects (such as an organization, or the border of a country).\n\nAlso known as occurrents, accidents or happenings, perdurants are those entities for which only a part exists if we look at them at any given snapshot in time.\nWhen we freeze time we can only see a part of the perdurant. Perdurants are often what we know as processes, for example: \"running\". If we freeze time then we only see a part of the running, without any previous knowledge one might not even be able to determine the actual process as being a process of running. Other examples include an activation, a kiss, or a procedure.\n\nIn a broad sense, qualities can also be known as properties or tropes.\n\nQualities do not exist on their own, but they need another entity (in many formal ontologies this entity is restricted to be an endurant) which they occupy. Examples of qualities and the values they assume include colors (red color), or temperatures (warm).\n\nMost formal upper-level ontologies recognize qualities, attributes, tropes, or something related, although the exact classification may differ. Some see qualities and the values they can assume (sometimes called quale) as a separate hierarchy besides endurants and perdurants (example: DOLCE). Others classify qualities as a subsection of endurants, e.g. the dependent endurants (example: BFO). Others consider property-instances or tropes that are single characteristics of individuals as the atoms of the ontology, the simpler entities of which all other entities are composed, so that all the entities are sums or bundles of tropes.\n\nIn information science an ontology is formal if it is specified in a formal language, otherwise it is informal.\n\nIn philosophy, a separate distinction between formal and nonformal ontologies exists, which does not relate to the use of a formal language.\n\nAn ontology might contain a concept representing 'mobility of the arm'. In a nonformal ontology a concept like this can often be classified as for example a 'finding of the arm', right next to other concepts such as 'bruising of the arm'. This method of modeling might create problems with increasing amounts information, as there is no foolproof way to keep hierarchies like this, or their descendant hierarchies (one is a process, the other is a quality) from entangling or knotting.\n\nIn a formal ontology, there is an optimal way to properly classify this concept, it is a kind of 'mobility', which is a kind of quality/property (see above). As a quality, it is said to \"inhere\" in \"independent\" endurant entities (see above), as such, it cannot exist without a bearer (in the case the arm).\n\nHaving a formal ontology at your disposal, especially when it consists of a Formal upper layer enriched with concrete domain-independent 'middle layer' concepts, can really aid the creation of a domain specific ontology.\nIt allows the modeller to focus on the content of the domain specific ontology without having to worry on the exact higher structure or abstract philosophical framework that gives his ontology a rigid backbone. Disjoint axioms at the higher level will prevent many of the commonly made ontological mistakes made when creating the detailed layer of the ontology.\n\nAligning terminologies and ontologies is not an easy task. The divergence of the underlying meaning of word descriptions and terms within different information sources is a well known obstacle for direct approaches to data integration and mapping. One single description may have a completely different meaning in one data source when compared with another. This is because different databases/terminologies often have a different viewpoint on similar items. They are usually built with a specific application-perspective in mind and their hierarchical structure represents this.\n\nA formal ontology, on the other hand, represents entities without a particular application scope. Its hierarchy reflects ontological principles and a basic class-subclass relation between its concepts. A consistent framework like this is ideal for crossmapping data sources.\nHowever, one cannot just integrate these external data sources in the formal ontology. A direct incorporation would lead to corruption of the framework and principles of the formal ontology.\n\nA formal ontology is a great crossmapping hub only if a complete distinction between the content and structure of the external information sources and the formal ontology itself is maintained. This is possible by specifying a mapping relation between concepts from a chaotic external information source and a concept in the formal ontology that corresponds with the meaning of the former concept.\n\nWhere two or more external information sources map to one and the same formal ontology concept a crossmapping/translation is achieved, as you know that those concepts—no matter what their phrasing is—mean the same thing.\n\nIn ontologies designed to serve natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) systems, ontology concepts are usually connected and symbolized by terms. This kind of connection represents a linguistic realization. \nTerms are words or a combination of words (multi-word units), in different languages, used to describe in natural language an element from reality, and hence connected to that formal ontology concept that frames this element in reality.\n\nThe lexicon, the collection of terms and their inflections assigned to the concepts and relationships in an ontology, forms the ‘ontology interface to natural language’, the channel through which the ontology can be accessed from a natural language input.\n\nThe great thing about a formal ontology, in contrast to rigid taxonomies or classifications, is that it allows for indefinite expansion. Given proper modeling, just about any kind of conceptual information, no matter the content, can find its place.\n\nTo disambiguate a concept's place in the ontology, often a context model is useful to improve the classification power. The model typically applies rules to surrounding elements of the context to select the most valid classification.\n\n"}
{"id": "178777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178777", "title": "Francis Schaeffer", "text": "Francis Schaeffer\n\nFrancis August Schaeffer (January 30, 1912 – May 15, 1984) was an American Evangelical Christian theologian, philosopher, and Presbyterian pastor. He is best known for establishing the L'Abri community in Switzerland. Opposed to theological modernism, Schaeffer promoted a more historic Protestant faith and a presuppositional approach to Christian apologetics, which he believed would answer the questions of the age.\n\nSchaeffer's wife, Edith (Seville) Schaeffer, became a prolific author in her own right. Schaeffer was the father of the author, film-maker, and painter Frank Schaeffer.\n\nSchaeffer was born on January 30, 1912, in Germantown, Pennsylvania, to Franz A. Schaeffer III and Bessie Williamson. He was of German and English ancestry.\n\nIn 1935, Schaeffer graduated \"magna cum laude\" from Hampden–Sydney College. The same year he married Edith Seville, the daughter of missionary parents who had been with the China Inland Mission founded by Hudson Taylor. Schaeffer then enrolled at Westminster Theological Seminary in the fall and studied under Cornelius Van Til (presuppositional apologetics) and J. Gresham Machen (doctrine of inerrancy).\n\nIn 1937, Schaeffer transferred to Faith Theological Seminary, graduating in 1938. This seminary was newly formed as a result of a split between the Presbyterian Church of America (now the Orthodox Presbyterian Church) and the Bible Presbyterian Church, a Presbyterian denomination more identified with Fundamentalist Christianity and premillennialism. Schaeffer was the first student to graduate and the first to be ordained in the Bible Presbyterian Church. He served pastorates in Pennsylvania (Grove City and Chester) and St. Louis, Missouri. Schaeffer eventually sided with the Bible Presbyterian Church Columbus Synod following the BPC Collingswood and BPC Columbus Split and became a member of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod when the Bible Presbyterian Church's Columbus Synod merged with the Reformed Presbyterian Church's Columbus Synod in 1965, a denomination which would merge with the Presbyterian Church in America, in 1982.\n\nIn 1948, the Schaeffer family moved to Switzerland and in 1955 established the community called \"L'Abri\" (French for \"the shelter\"). Serving as both a philosophy seminar and a spiritual community, L'Abri attracted thousands of young people, and was later expanded into Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nSchaeffer received numerous honorary degrees. In 1954, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Highland College in Long Beach, California. In 1971, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts. In 1982, John Warwick Montgomery nominated Schaeffer for an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, which was conferred in 1983 by the Simon Greenleaf School of Law, Anaheim, California in recognition of his apologetic writings and ministry.\n\nSchaeffer died of lymphoma on May 15, 1984, in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nIn contrast to Schaeffer's own experience as a single child of a father with a third-grade education and a depressed mother, he grew up with a drive to understand reality in its complexity, including the glorious and tragic human realities. He was deeply engaged in the lives of each of his four children, continuously available to them, showing and explaining art, history, city and country life, philosophy, Roman ruins and medieval and Renaissance efforts to civilize a damaged human history. He enjoyed watching people, engaging them in conversation and showing his children the joy and tragedy of human existence. He laid out for them the philosophic foundations of societies without being idealistic about any of them.\n\nIn \"Crazy for God\", Schaeffer's son Frank presents a portrait of his father that is far more nuanced and multi-dimensional than was suggested by his public persona. He states, for example, that Schaeffer's primary passions in life were not the Bible and theology but rather art and culture. \"And what moved him was not theology but beauty\". Schaeffer's son claims he had frequent bouts with depression and a verbally and physically abusive relationship with his wife, Edith. Those in the inner circle at L'Abri challenge Frank's account. Os Guinness, who lived with the Schaeffers and was a close friend of both the younger and elder Schaeffer, described \"Crazy for God\" as a \"scurrilous caricature\" and said, \"[N]o one should take Frank's allegations at face value.\"\n\nFrank Schaeffer initially supported his father's ideas and political program, but has since distanced himself from many of those views, first converting to the Eastern Orthodox Church and later becoming a liberal and a self described \"atheist who believes in God.\"\n\nSchaeffer's approach to Christian apologetics was primarily influenced by Herman Dooyeweerd, Edward John Carnell, and Cornelius Van Til, but he was not known to be a strict presuppositionalist in the Van Tillian tradition. His approach to culture was heavily influenced by his friendship with Hans Rookmaaker. In a 1948 article in \"The Bible Today\", Schaeffer explained his own apologetics and how he walked a middle path between evidentialism and presuppositionalism, noting that \"If the unsaved man was consistent he would be an atheist in religion, an irrationalist in philosophy (including a complete uncertainty concerning 'natural laws'), and completely a-moral in the widest sense.\" J. Budziszewski summarizes the article about this \"middle path\" approach by writing:\n\nSchaeffer came to use this \"middle path\" as the basis for his method of evangelism which he called \"Taking the roof off\". An example of \"Taking the roof off\" in written form can be found in Schaeffer's work entitled \"Death in the City.\" Nancy Pearcey also describes two books by Schaeffer, \"Escape From Reason\" and \"The God Who Is There\" in this way:\n\nIn the 1960s Schaeffer read the works of Reconstructionist theologian Rousas John Rushdoony with appreciation, and according to Barry Hankins, \"it is quite likely that Schaeffer's belief that the United States was founded on a Christian base came in part from Rushdoony.\" Schaeffer later lost this fervor because Rushdoony was a postmillennialist (holding the doctrine that the kingdom of God will be built on earth before the second coming of Jesus) while Schaeffer was a premillennialist (holding that the kingdom of God will only be ushered in with the second coming). Further Schaeffer thought that Rushdoony's system would require a merger of church and state, which he opposed. He held that the principles, not the actual details, of Old Testament civil law were applicable under the New Covenant of Jesus. He wrote \"The moral law [of the Old Testament], of course, is constant, but the civil law only was operative for the Old Testament theocracy. I do not think there is any indication of a theocracy in the New Testament until Christ returns as king.\"\n\nThe Francis A. Schaeffer Foundation in Gryon, Switzerland is led by one of his daughters and sons-in-law as a small-scale alternative to the original L'Abri Fellowship International, which is still operating in nearby Huemoz-sur-Ollon and other places in the world. Covenant Theological Seminary has established the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute directed by a former English L'Abri member, Jerram Barrs. The purpose of the school is to train Christians to demonstrate compassionately and defend reasonably what they see as the claims of Christ on all of life.\n\nAccording to Michael Hamilton of \"Christianity Today\", \"Perhaps no intellectual save C. S. Lewis affected the thinking of evangelicals more profoundly [than Francis Schaeffer]; perhaps no leader of the period save Billy Graham left a deeper stamp on the movement as a whole.\"\n\nIn 1978, Schaeffer asked a group of Reformed Episcopal Clergy to research his thoughts and current trends, forming a church guild called \"The Society of Reformed Philosophical Thinkers\". This was merged in 1988 with \"Into Thy Word Ministries\", which was then transformed into \"The Francis A. Schaeffer Institute of Church Leadership Development\" in 1998. Its purpose is to strategize how to reach and train pastors and church leaders to focus on Christ centered principles. Its aim is to point the church back to \"true-Truth\" and \"true spirituality\". The foundation develops comprehensive curriculum for pastors, church planters and church leaders.\n\nFrancis Schaeffer is credited with helping spark a return to political activism among Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially in relation to the issue of abortion. In his memoir \"Crazy for God,\" Schaeffer's son Frank takes credit for pressing his father to take on the abortion issue, which Schaeffer initially considered \"too political\". Schaeffer called for a challenge to what he saw as the increasing influence of secular humanism. Schaeffer's views were expressed in two works, his book entitled \"A Christian Manifesto\", as well as the book and film series, \"Whatever Happened to the Human Race?\".\n\nSchaeffer's book \"A Christian Manifesto\" was published in 1981 and later delivered as a sermon in 1982. It was intended as a Christian answer to \"The Communist Manifesto\" of 1848 and the \"Humanist Manifesto\" documents of 1933 and 1973. Schaeffer's diagnosis is that the decline of Western Civilization is due to society having become increasingly pluralistic, resulting in a shift \"away from a world view that was at least vaguely Christian in people's memory... toward something completely different.\" Schaeffer argues that there is a philosophical struggle between the people of God and the secular humanists. In the sermon version of the book, Schaeffer defines secular humanism as the worldview where \"man is the measure of all things\". He claims that critics of the Christian right miss the mark by confusing the \"humanist religion\" with humanitarianism, the humanities, or love of humans. He describes the conflict with secular humanism as a battle in which \"these two religions, Christianity and humanism, stand over against each other as totalities.\" He writes that the decline of commitment to objective truth that he perceives in the various institutions of society is \"not because of a conspiracy, but because the church has forsaken its duty to be the salt of the culture.\"\n\nHe then suggests that similar tactics be used to stop abortion. But Schaeffer argues he is not talking about a theocracy:\n\nChristian Reconstructionists Gary North and David Chilton were highly critical of \"A Christian Manifesto\" and Schaeffer.\n\nTheir critical comments were prompted, they wrote, by the popularity of Schaeffer's book. They suggested that Schaeffer supports pluralism because he sees the First Amendment as freedom of religion for all; and they themselves reject pluralism. Pointing out negative statements Schaeffer made about theocracy, North and Chilton then explain why they promote it. They extend their criticism of Schaeffer:\n\nChristian conservative leaders such as Tim LaHaye have credited Schaeffer for influencing their theological arguments urging political participation by evangelicals.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, critics began exploring the intellectual and ideological connection between Schaeffer's political activism and writings of the early 1980s to contemporary religious-political trends in the Christian Right, sometimes grouped under the name Dominionism, with mixed conclusions.\n\nSara Diamond and Frederick Clarkson have written articles tracing the activism of numerous key figures in the Christian Right to the influence of Francis Schaeffer. According to Diamond: \"The idea of taking dominion over secular society gained widespread currency with the 1981 publication of...Schaeffer's book \"A Christian Manifesto\". The book sold 290,000 copies in its first year, and it remains one of the movement's most frequently cited texts.\"\nDiamond summarizes the book and its importance to the Christian Right:\n\nFrederick Clarkson explains that this had practical applications:\n\nAnalyses of Schaeffer as the major intellectual influence on Dominionism can be found in the works of authors such as Diamond and Chip Berlet. Other authors argue against a close connection with dominionism, for example Irving Hexham of the University of Calgary, who maintains that Schaeffer's political position has been misconstrued as advocating the Dominionist views of R. J. Rushdoony, who is a Christian Reconstructionist. Hexham indicates that Schaeffer's essential philosophy was derived from Herman Dooyeweerd, not Rushdoony, and that Hans Rookmaaker introduced Schaeffer to his writings. Dooyeweerd was a Dutch legal scholar and philosopher, following in the footsteps of Neo-Calvinist Abraham Kuyper.\n\nCongresswoman and 2012 United States presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has cited Schaeffer's documentary series \"How Should We Then Live?\" as having a \"profound influence\" on her life and that of her husband Marcus.\n\nFrancis A. Schaeffer wrote twenty-two books, which cover a range of spiritual issues. They can be roughly split into five sections, as in the edition of his \"Complete Works\" ():\n\n\nIn addition to his books, one of the last public lectures Schaeffer delivered was at the Law Faculty, University of Strasbourg. It was published as \"Christian Faith and Human Rights\", \"The Simon Greenleaf Law Review\", 2 (1982–83) pp. 3–12. Most of his writings during his Bible Presbyterian days have not been collected, nor reprinted in decades.\n\nIn addition to the five volume \"Complete Works\" listed above there were also two books by Dr. Schaeffer published after his death:\n\n\nSchaeffer was eventually persuaded to adapt his book \"How Should We Then Live? The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture\" to film by Gospel Films, Inc. by CEO and executive evangelical media producer Billy Zeoli who pitched the idea of hiring Schaeffer's then recently married son, teenage father, and painter Frank Schaeffer as a producer for the film project. Zeoli was instrumental in providing the Schaeffers with introductions to wealthy American evangelicals who would eventually bankroll the \"How We Should Then Live\" film project. This book is still being read and used today in American Universities as well as in various small group studies to help shed light on the contemporary cultural problems of the past and how they have led to many of the issues that America is facing today. Issues such as race, apathy, abortion, and the non-compassionate use of wealth are topics still relevant today. Schaeffer argues that the humanist base for morals is fundamentally a weak base upon which to build a moral framework for society. By contrast, the Bible, understood as the revealed revelation from God is able to provide a fundamentally sound basis for societal norms as well as a base for science. The president of Christian Leaders Institute (CLI), Henry Reyenga Jr., secured rights to post this film series in an ethics class at CLI.

{"id": "4736129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4736129", "title": "Gim Busik", "text": "Gim Busik\n\nKim Busik (1075–1151) was a statesman, general, Confucian scholar and writer during Korea's Goryeo period. A scion of the Silla royalty and a member of the Gyeongju Kim clan, he was the supreme chancellor in 1136-1142 and was in charge of suppression of the Myo Cheong rebellion. Kim is best known for supervising the compilation of the Samguk Sagi, the oldest extant written Korean history.\n\nGyeongju Kim clan were direct descendants of the last Silla king, Kim Pu. The clan seat (\"bongwan\") name derives from Kim’s great grandfather, a member of the royal Kim clan, who became the administrator in charge of the former Silla capital (renamed Gyeongju at the beginning of the Goryeo period). The first Goryeo king Taejo married into the Gyeongju Kim, and the clan played a leading role in early Goryeo politics. Three of its members were the officials of the first and second rank during 981-1069.\n\nKim’s father Kim Kun was an official (reached the junior 3rd rank) and a famous poet. When he was a member of an embassy to the Song court, he and the fellow envoy Pak Illyang published a collection of poems that made a deep impression on Song\nscholars. \"The allusions in the poems were so intricate that the most renowned\ncourt scholars had to study them in detail before being able to\nunderstand them.\"\n\nThe oldest son Kim Bu-pil (? -?) reached the senior 5th rank in 1102, but these were the three younger sons, Kim Bu-il (1071–1132), Kim Busik, and Kim Bu-cheol, also known as Kim Puǔi, (1079-1136) that played an important role in politics and culture of Goryeo. Kim Kun died when Gim Busik was about thirteen, and his widow raised and supervised the education of her younger sons. Later King Yejong rewarded her with a yearly allowance, noting in particular her merit in\nassisting each of her sons to pass the state examination.\n\nKim himself passed the civil service examination in 1096 on the Book of Documents and was appointed as an official in the Anseo prefecture. Subsequently he was selected for a position at the Hallimwon (Academy of Letters), that was also responsible for drafting foreign correspondence. \nThe Kim brothers steadily raised through the ranks of the civil service. In 1115 Kim Busik was appointed to the Office of Remonstrance. Despite their relatively junior ranks, both Kim Busik (senior 6th rank) and Kim Bu-il (junior 5th rank) participated in the meetings of the Privy Council (\"Chae Chu\").\n\nThe increasing literary and scholarly reputation of the Kim brothers made them popular lectures on the Confucian classics. In 1116, King Yejong instituted the royal lecture (\"kyeongyeon\") by designating a lecture hall and making a number of appointments to the position of a royal lecturer. Under him and his successor Injong the lectures were held regularly. Such a lecture was a Confucian ritual in which the ruler paid homage to Confucian teachings. Many of the royal lecturers belonged to the Han An-in faction that opposed Yi Cha-gyeom. Both Kim Bu-cheol and Kim Busik delivered royal lectures, expounding the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Kim Busik lectured on the Book of History and the Book of Changes.\n\nThese lectures became a scene of rivalry between Kim Busik and Yun Oni, son of the famous general Yun Gwan. Yun was an influential Confucian scholar and a future supporter of the and Myo Cheong. His attacks on Kim may have roots in Yun Gwan's fall and disgrace (1108-1109) that was at least partially precipitated by the court machinations, or in an incident when Gim Busik rewrote a memorial plaque written by the general. During Kim’s lessons on various historical topics Yun Oni posed difficult questions, apparently trying to embarrass him and discredit his scholarship.\nAfter 1121 Kim Busik was appointed as Royal Diarist, or \"ji\", to the court of Yejong. By 1122 Kim Busik became an executive at the Ministry of Rites (\"Yebu Sirang\"), typically an appointment of the 3rd junior rank.\n\nThe years 1114-1128 saw a major change in the balance of power in North-East Asia. Around the year 1100 the dominant regional power was the Khitan state of Liao. Emperors of Liao and of Song China were officially considered equals. However, Song had to pay an annual tribute (that was not named as such) of 200,000 taels of silver and 300,000 bolts of silk, that was equivalent to several percent of the Song government revenues. Goryeo was a vassal state of Liao, even if the tribute was not paid since 1054. Jurchen tribes were vassals of Liao, that exercised a variable degree of control over their tribal groupings. Jurchen had complicated relationships with Goryeo. These ranged from a tributary status and mercenary service to cross-border warfare and informal alliances, particularly during the reign of King Yejong.\n\nBasic tenets of Goryeo’s political theory were expressed in the Ten Injunctions of Taejo. This document advised a cautious following of the Chinese practices, and expressed abhorrence of Khitan, and by extension, other nomadic `barbarians’. The status of Goryeo rulers can be roughly summarized as \"naeje oewang\" (emperor at home and king abroad). They were titled kings, were vassals of Khitan Liao dynasty, and were careful to keep these convention in the correspondence with the suzerains. On the other hand, many aspects of the government were fashioned after following the imperial conventions. A majority view of the scholars-officials, including the Kim brothers, was that Goryeo was a realm in itself and thus “a possible center of the world”. During this period Gim Busik drafted a significant portion of the diplomatic correspondence with both Liao and Song.\n\nThroughout their careers Kim brothers demonstrated a pragmatic approach both domestically and internationally. At the beginning of the century the Liao Dynasty appeared strong and Kim Bu-il congratulated Emperor Tianzuo of Liao as a ruler who “developed and enlarged [his] territory and made both Chinese and barbarians follow [him] peacefully.\" In a letter to the Song court Kim Busik derived the Goryeo legitimacy as successors of Jizi (Giji, a semi-legendary sage who is said to have ruled Gojoseon in the 11th century BCE), who was enfeoffed by the Chinese Son of Heaven. After a long and mutually complementary discourse Busik \"concluded by stating that it was the barbarians who stood between Goryeo and\nthe Song, literally and figuratively.\" This letter was written\njust before Gim Busik finally ensured the recognition by Goryeo of the Jin dynasty ruler as the Son of Heaven in 1126.\n\nJurchen leader Wanyan Aguda started a successful rebellion against Liao in 1114. While majority of the Goryeo officials were anti-Jurchen, both king's father-in-law Yi Cha-gyeom and Kim Busik aimed to keep Goryeo out of the fray and benefit from the changing geopolitical situation. For example, the first Liao request for help was debated (8th month of the 10th year of Yejong’s reign, July 1115) at the extended meeting of the Privy Council that included also the top military commanders. The majority of officials supported sending the troops. The opposition was voiced by a relatively junior associate of Yi Cha-gyeom and by Kim Bu-il and Kim Busik, who argued that `sending troops for another country could be the cause of trouble and would undoubtedly be dangerous for the future’. They succeeded in stalling the motion. At approximately the same time Kim Busik acknowledged the increasing strength of the Jurchen in the official letters to the Liao court, but swear that Goryeo is loyal to Liao; if not, “may the gods destroy it”.\n\nWanyan Aguda scored a number of victories over Liao; and proclaimed the establishment of the Jin dynasty with himself as its first emperor in 1115. In 1116-1117 Gim Busik was part of the embassy to the Song court. Goryeo consistently refused a military help to Liao and in the wake of the Jurchen advances recaptured the Uiju (Poju) area and once again established the Yalu River as its border. While the majority of the Yenjong’s officials believed in the eventual Liao downfall, a crisis in the relationship with the Jurchen was precipitated by the request of Taizu of Jin to be recognized as the ‘elder brother’ of the Goryeo king in 1117. Majority of the officials opposed this request and even considered beheading the envoy. The factions of Yi Cha-gyeom and Gim Busik factions stalled the rush moves, but the formal submission of Goryeo to Jin was made only during the reign of Injong.\n\nIn fact, Kim Bu-cheol (voicing a position of Gim Busik who was at the time in China) submitted a memorandum proposing to accede to the demands of Emperor Taizu of Jin, giving the following rational: “Now even the great Song calls itself the younger brother of the Khitan and they have gotten along peacefully for generations. And although there is nothing under heaven that can measure up to the dignity of the Son of Heaven [of Goryeo], submitting to and obeying the barbarians like this is the proper policy, one that the sages called ‘the temporarily putting aside of one’s principles as circumstances demand it’ and ‘the protection of the whole country.’\" Later Gim Busik himself provided an example of temporizing in the correspondence with the Jin, arguing why Goryeo cannot be its vassal.\n\nIn his book \"Gaoli tujing\" Xu Jing (1091-1153), a member of the Song mission to Goryeo in 1122-1123, mentions Gim Busik.\n\nEarly ears of the reign of Injong (1122-1126) were dominated by Yi Cha-gyeom, his maternal grandfather. Shortly after Injong took the throne, Kim was an executive, and in 1124 was promoted to the position of the fourth secretary in the Ministry of Rites (\"Yebu Sirang\"). Using his position Kim opposed Yi Cha-gyeom hold on power, aiming at Yi's attempts to enhance his public image. Already in 1122 Kim argued against giving special recognition to Yi Cha-gyeom as king’s grandfather. Later he questioned the appropriateness of calling Yi’s birthday \"Insujel\" (Celebrating Humaneness and Longevity), and a planned performance of the ritual music at the Yi’s family graves. Nevertheless, after a failed coup against Yi in early 1126 Gim Busik not only remained in power, but was promoted to the position of the Chief Censor. \n\nThe role of Gim Busik in toppling Yo Cha-gyeom is unknown. Kim Bu-il, on the other hand, was one of the intermediaries between Injong and Yi‘s military supporters, inducing them to defect.\n\nAfter 1126 Kim brothers advanced through the Security Council into the highest offices. \n\nIn 1135-1136 Kim Busik was in charge of suppressing the rebellion of Myo Cheong and rooting out his adherents in Kaesong He became the supreme chancellor in 1136 and dominate the Goryeo government till his official retirement in 1142.\n\nIn 1142, Injong ordered the compilation of the \"Samguk Sagi\", a chronicle of events in the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla. Using Chinese histories (particularly Shiji by Sima Qian), Gim Busik at the head of the fourteen-author team compiled the oldest extant source on Korean history. It was submitted to Injong in late 1145 or early 1146.\n\nSamguk Sagi(“The History of the Three Kingdoms of Korea”) is the oldest extant work of Korean history and often the only written source of information about the Three kingdoms and Unified Silla periods\n\nIdeological and religious opinions of Gim Busik fell into the spectrum of practices of the upper strata of the Goryeo society. Confucianism was primarily a state ideology, aimed at social cohesion and state administration. Kim was one of the most prominent Confucian scholars of his time.\n\nBy the twelfth century Buddhism was a religion of both elites and common people. It enjoyed royal and aristocratic patronage and the Buddhist hierarchy was integrated into the state bureaucracy. Kim Busik was a practicing Buddhist. He established a family temple complex Kwallan-sa. This temple also inspired Kim's poem \"At Kwallan\". Kim is an author of the inscription honoring a Buddhist monk Uicheon (the son of King Munjong and the National Preceptor, one of the three highest Buddhist hierarchs of the country). There he recalls their only meeting, when as a boy he visited his brother in a monastery. In retirement Kim became a lay monk (\"keosa\"). \n\nWorship of native spirits and guardian spirits was widely practiced by populace and part of the royal rituals prescribed by the Ten Injunctions of Taejo. During the Myo Cheong rebellion in 1135-1136 Kim Busik is recorded as swearing an oath “by the heaven and the earth, the mountains and streams and the gods and spirits”. He made a sacrifice to the guardian deities of the Western Capital following its capture from the rebels.\n"}

He first distinguished himself as professor of philosophy and theology in various houses of the Province of Lombardy, whence he was advanced to a professorship in the more important theological school at Bologna. He was approved by the general chapter of his Order held in Paris, 1611, and raised to the mastership and doctorate. He was then performing the duties of general censor for the tribunal of the Inquisition established at Mantua, for which reason he is said eventually to have secured the transfer of his affiliation to the convent of that place (1618). \n\nHis career ended in 1622. It had been marked by a studious application to the doctrines of Aquinas. Just as the Paris chapter was acknowledging his intellectual ability, he completed the first part of his \"Summae theologiae S. Thomae Aquinatis doctoris angelici formalis explicatio\". In this work he puts into syllogistic form the whole Summa Theologica, aimed primarily at the enlightenment of beginners.

He was the adversary of Bartolomé de las Casas in the Valladolid Controversy in 1550 concerning the justification of the Spanish Conquest of the Indies. Sepúlveda was the defender of the Spanish Empire's right of conquest, of colonization, and of evangelization in the so-called New World. He argued on the base of natural law philosophy and developed a position which was different from the position of the School of Salamanca, as represented famously by Francisco de Vitoria. \n\nSepúlveda translated several of Aristotle's works into Latin (e.g. \"Parva naturalia\" 1522, \"Politics\" or \"De re publica\" 1548).\n\nThe Valladolid Controversy was organized by King Charles V (grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella) to give an answer to the question whether the indigenous peoples of the Americas were capable of self-governance, during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. \n\nSepúlveda defended the position of the colonists, although he had never been to America, claiming that some Amerindians were \"natural slaves\" as defined by Aristotle in Book I of \"Politics\". \"Those whose condition is such that their function is the use of their bodies and nothing better can be expected of them, those, I say, are slaves of nature. It is better for them to be ruled thus.\" He said these natives are \"as children to parents, as women are to men, as cruel people are from mild people\". These assertions in regard to some but not all Amerindians were made in \"Democrates alter de justis belli causis apud Indos\" (\"A Second Democritus: on the just causes of war with Indians\") Rome, 1550.

According to Bartolomé de las Casas, Jesus had power over all people in the world, including those who had never heard of Christianity. However, he thought that Christianity should be presented to natives as a religious option, not an obligation as Sepulveda believed. Las Casas said that Amerindians ought to enjoy the same freedoms as any other people because, in his view, no Amerindians lacked the ability to rule themselves.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "285073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285073", "title": "Kobayashi Maru", "text": "Kobayashi Maru\n\nThe Kobayashi Maru is a training exercise in the fictional \"Star Trek\" universe designed to test the character of Starfleet Academy cadets in a no-win scenario. The Kobayashi Maru test was first depicted in the opening scene of the film \"\" and also appears in the 2009 film \"Star Trek\". Screenwriter Jack B. Sowards is credited with inventing the test. The test's name is occasionally used among \"Star Trek\" fans or those familiar with the series to describe a no-win scenario, a test of one's character or a solution that involves redefining the problem and managing an insurmountable scenario gracefully.\n\nThe notional primary goal of the exercise is to rescue the civilian vessel \"Kobayashi Maru\" in a simulated battle with the Klingons. The disabled ship is located in the Klingon Neutral Zone, and any Starfleet ship entering the zone would cause an interstellar border incident. The approaching cadet crew must decide whether to attempt rescue of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" crew—endangering their own ship and lives—or leave the \"Kobayashi Maru\" to certain destruction. If the cadet chooses to attempt rescue, the simulation is designed to guarantee that the cadet's ship is destroyed with the loss of all crew members.\n\nIn \",\" the simulation takes place on a replica of a starship bridge, with the test-taker as captain and other Starfleet members, officers or other cadets, in other key positions. In the scenario of the 2280s, the cadet receives a distress signal stating that the civilian freighter \"Kobayashi Maru\" has struck a gravitic mine in the Klingon Neutral Zone and is rapidly losing power, hull integrity and life support. Sensor readings are indeterminate and there is no way to verify the distress signal. There are no other vessels nearby. The cadet must quickly make a decision:\n\n\nIf the cadet chooses to rescue the \"Kobayashi Maru\"s crew and passengers, the scenario progresses quickly. The bridge officers notify the cadet that they are in violation of the treaty between the Federation and the Klingons, giving the cadet a chance to turn back before finally committing to this dangerous action. As the starship enters the Neutral Zone, the communications officer loses contact with the crippled vessel. Klingon warships then quickly appear on an intercept course. Attempts to contact them are met with radio silence; indeed, their only response is to open fire with devastating results. No defense is sufficient against the Klingons and the cadet's ship is eventually defeated (and destroyed if the scenario plays out fully).\n\nNot depicted on film are the possible consequences of rejecting the rescue appeal. These are discussed at length in novels and video games and include mutiny of the crew over being asked to abandon civilians to die; violations of Starfleet policy regarding rendering of aid to distressed vessels; Klingon incursion into Federation territory responding to \"provocation\" by the \"Kobayashi Maru\"; or the weight on the cadet's conscience caused by refusing to render aid.\n\nThe objective of the test is not for the cadet to outfight or outplan the opponent but rather to force the cadet into a no-win situation and simply observe how he or she reacts.\n\nThe opening of \"\" is itself a \"Kobayashi Maru\" test, but this is not revealed until after the end of the scene, leading the audience to believe that this is a genuine combat scenario involving the USS \"Enterprise\". The test-taker, Saavik (Kirstie Alley), is in command of the simulated USS \"Enterprise\". During the test, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) serves as science officer and second-in-command, Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is standing by on the bridge, Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) as communications officer, and Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) as helm officer; cadets are at other positions. After the distress call is received, Saavik orders Sulu to plot an intercept course with the imperiled ship. Sulu warns Saavik against violating the Neutral Zone but she overrules him. Contact with the \"Kobayashi Maru\" is lost, and three Klingon battle cruisers appear on an intercept course. Outgunned and in violation of the Federation–Klingon treaty, Saavik orders a retreat, but the Klingon ships quickly overtake and cripple the \"Enterprise\". Further attacks kill Sulu, Uhura, McCoy, and Spock. Mr. Scott reports that the \"Enterprise\" is dead in space. Saavik orders that a log buoy be launched, and that the crew abandon ship.\n\nAdmiral James Kirk, who had been monitoring the situation from a control room, halts the simulation. All the \"deceased\" officers rise, and Spock (now revealed as the cadets' instructor) orders the trainees to the briefing room. Saavik protests being subjected to a no-win scenario, opining that it does not properly reflect her command abilities. Kirk explains that the test is meant to reveal how the subject deals with a no-win scenario, and that how one deals with death is as important as how one deals with life. Later in the film, after repeated inquiries from Saavik, Kirk says that the exercise is a true no-win scenario because there is no correct resolution—it is a test of character.\n\nThe scene used the same set as the bridge of the \"Enterprise\" (shown later in the film). The test is a vehicle to introduce the concept of the no-win scenario as presented to cadets. The main plot of the film deals with James Kirk's response when finally forced to face such a scenario in real life.\n\nJames T. Kirk took the test three times while at Starfleet Academy. Before his third attempt, Kirk surreptitiously reprogrammed the simulator so that it was possible to rescue the freighter. Despite having cheated, Kirk was awarded a commendation for \"original thinking\". This fact is revealed in \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\", as Kirk, Saavik and others are marooned. Saavik accuses Kirk of never having faced the no-win scenario. Kirk replies that he does not believe in it.\n\nThe 2009 J. J. Abrams film depicts cadet James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) reprogramming the test so the Klingon ships' shields suddenly drop, allowing all five to be destroyed with ease so the safe rescue of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" can commence. This incident earns him the ire of Spock, who is an Academy instructor maintaining the simulation and creator of the test.\n\nDuring a disciplinary hearing, Spock and Kirk meet for the first time and say many of the same lines that their characters originally used in \"The Wrath of Khan\". Kirk argues that the test itself is a cheat, since the program is unwinnable, and thus cheating is the only solution. Spock counters that the point of the test is not to win, but to face fear and accept the possibility of death, like Kirk's father did. Due to an attack on Vulcan by the film's villain Nero, the hearing is put on hold and left unresolved.\n\nIn the novelization of the film, the last chapter reveals that the information Kirk used to defeat the test was obtained during his trysts with an Orion female fellow cadet, who talked in her sleep.\n\nAs Spock had not entered Starfleet Academy as a command-track cadet, he did not take the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test while there. In his death scene at the conclusion of \"The Wrath of Khan\", he describes his sacrifice as his solution to the no-win scenario.\n\nDepictions of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test are a fairly popular subject in \"Star Trek\" literature. Non-canonical examples of \"Kobayashi Maru\" tests have been described in many \"Star Trek\" novels. Much like Kirk, characters are frequently depicted as coming up with innovative or surprising ways of handling the situation.\n\n\"The Kobayashi Maru\" (1989) by Julia Ecklar tells how each of these officers faced the problem:\n\nIn the novel \"Dreadnought\" by Diane Carey, the protagonist, Piper, a recent academy graduate, manages to crash the entire simulator by attempting to improvise an engineering solution to the problem through an unorthodox series of computer commands and jury-rigging, essentially tricking the computer into fighting itself. Her instructors admit that her solution might theoretically have been successful.\n\nIn A.C. Crispin's novel \"Sarek\", Peter Kirk, James T. Kirk's nephew, uses his experiences throughout the novel to come up with another way to defeat the unwinnable scenario, this time against Romulan opponents. Upon entering the Romulan Neutral Zone, he provokes the Romulans, who are expected to destroy the \"Enterprise\". Before the Romulans open fire, Peter challenges the Romulan commander to a ritual fight to the death (using an obscure but still valid Romulan law predating their schism with the Vulcans), in which actual battle is prohibited until the contest is resolved. As Peter leaves the bridge to go to the simulation transporter room, he instructs the crew to beam aboard the \"survivors\" and escape, leaving him to certain death.\n\nThe simulation ends with the supervising instructor ending the test in confusion. Upon learning of Peter's trick, he promises to change the scenario to prevent it from being re-used. Peter is credited, however, with coming up with an actual \"winning\" solution: saving the \"Kobayashi Maru\" and his own ship by sacrificing himself. This echoes Spock's description of his own sacrifice depicted in \"The Wrath of Khan\" as his resolution of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test.\n\nIn William Shatner's novel \"Avenger\", Captain Christine McDonald of the USS \"Tobias\" tells Captain Kirk that in her time, the \"Kobayashi Maru\" scenario is no longer used to test character, but rather to evaluate the \"original thinking\" for which Kirk had received a commendation. In the new version of the scenario, cadets are charged with coming up with ways to outsmart the simulation by reprogramming it to counter various moves made by the more advanced AI of the computer.\n\nIn his \"\" novels, Peter David suggests that future versions of the scenario would involve the Romulans.\n\nIn \"Stone and Anvil\", Mackenzie Calhoun realizes that it is impossible to rescue the \"Kobayashi Maru\". He uses the unorthodox solution of destroying the \"Kobayashi Maru\" itself. He determines that a rescue attempt will be unsuccessful, would likely end in failure and would probably also result in his own ship being destroyed or captured. His reasoning is that it is more merciful to kill the civilians outright rather than let them be captured (and likely tortured) by the Romulans. Alternatively, he proposes the possibility that the entire scenario is a Romulan trap and the \"Kobayashi Maru\" is in league with the Romulans, so destruction of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" is a valid attack on an enemy.\n\nThree short stories in the \"\" anthologies series have also tackled the test. In \"The Bottom Line\" by Andrew Morby (\"Strange New Worlds III\", 2000) and Shawn Michael Scott's \"Best Tools Available\" (\"Strange New Worlds VI,\" 2003), cadet Nog solves the scenario in two entirely different (and thoroughly Ferengi) manners.\n\nKevin Lauderdale's \"A Test of Character\" (\"Strange New Worlds VII\", 2004) depicts a different version of Kirk's solution from Ecklar's, in which Kirk's tampering is \"cheating without cheating,\" since he merely creates a level playing field where success is not necessarily guaranteed.\n\nIn this novel by Andy Mangels and Michael A. Martin, the scenario occurs as an actual plot event instead of a training exercise. The \"Kobayashi Maru\" is a retrofitted Klingon cargo vessel under Earth control and with a human crew. When the ship is struck by a gravitic mine, Captain Jonathan Archer and the crew of the \"Enterprise\" are sent to assist. Though forewarned that the \"Enterprise\" is entering a trap set by the Romulans, Archer attempts to rescue the crew and passengers of the \"Kobayashi Maru\". At this point three Klingon cruisers being controlled by remote Romulan telepresence systems drop out of warp and begin attacking the \"Enterprise\". As the ship's systems begin to fail from Romulan attempts to capture \"Enterprise\" via the same telepresence systems, Archer is forced to withdraw, preventing the capture of \"Enterprise\" but leaving the \"Kobayashi Maru\" to be destroyed.\n\nIn the video game \"\", one of the missions assigned to the player is the \"Kobayashi Maru\" scenario. The player – who controls the character of Cadet David Forrester – has a choice to make before the test. The player can have Forrester face the unaltered version of the test, or have Forrester reprogram the computer as Captain Kirk did, altering the scenario in one of three ways. He can reprogram the Klingon AI, making them fight poorly (they do not fire at all), reprogram the strength of the Klingon ships by making them easier to beat (in addition, their weapons cause no damage), or make the Klingon captains fear and respect him personally (Kirk's solution from the novel).\n\nIf the player cheats by altering the battle itself, he is treated to two larger waves of Klingon D7 cruisers after destroying the initial wave of three. After destroying those waves, the simulator computer crashes with a Guru Meditation error, and in debriefing the commandant remarks that he would be impressed were it not for the impossibility of such a feat.\n\nIf the player cheats by instilling fear and respect into the Klingon captains, he is able to hail the Klingons during the scenario. The Klingon captain extols Forrester's prowess, and agrees to help him rescue the freighter instead. This allows the scenario to complete successfully, and the commandant seems truly impressed in debriefing. No matter how the player cheats, if he chooses this option the cheating is detected by Academy staff, and Forrester is offered a chance to avoid punishment by helping the authorities with an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nIf the player decides to face the unaltered version, the ship is swiftly destroyed by the first wave of D7 cruisers, or if they opt to not rescue the ship, they are forced to listen to the crew of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" die. It is possible to defeat the Klingons in the unaltered version; however, before the player can rescue the crew of the \"Kobayashi Maru\", the game bugs out and the player's ship blows up anyway even though there are no Klingons left.\n\nThe video game \"\" offers an alternate version of the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test, though conditions are entirely different - The player, who controls the character of Cadet Torlek, is assigned to prevent an incident between the Klingon Empire and the Tholian forces on approach, in the midst of a simulated Klingon-Federation war. Unlike the choice of saving lives or not, the player has the choice of either attempting to perform his duty but failing, in which the Klingons are forced to compromise their campaign to hold back the Tholians, or to sully his honor by collaborating with the Tholians and surrendering Colonel Poktarhl (Torlek's commanding officer), but ultimately ending the incident.\n\nRegardless of the result, the player is berated by General Chang for his deeds, and Chang's response can depend on Torlek's attitudes - If the player accepts the punishment, Chang will be severe but ultimately retain the player, given only his success record, so far. If, otherwise, Torlek berates Chang back, on the conditions of this test, Chang will calm Torlek down and expose this was intentional, meaning to have Torlek question the 'injustice' of the test, reassuring him no one is dismissed from the Klingon Academy for failing this one particular simulation, though all others are punished with summary discharge.\n\nIn the video game \"\", one of the campaign missions is titled \"Klingon Maru\". However, the player can rescue the ship and not fight a battle.\n\nThere was also a \"\" video game published by Simon & Schuster in 1985. The game was a text adventure written by Diane Duane depicting the \"Kobayashi Alternative Command Performance Evaluation\", a test being proposed to replace the \"Kobayashi Maru\" scenario, and was available for the Apple II, Commodore 64, MS-DOS PC-compatible, and Macintosh platforms. \n\nThe first mission of the first-person shooter, \"\", developed by Raven Software and published by Activision in 2000, is considered Ensign Munro's (the player character's) \"Kobayashi Maru\" by Commander Tuvok.\n\nIn \"Star Trek DAC\" for XBLA and PlayStation Network, there is a trophy called Kobayashi Maru that is only achievable by entering a cheat code. Paramount, the publisher of the game, leaked the cheat code in a press release.\n\nIn \"Star Trek Online\", the Fleet Action mission released on July 12, 2012, titled \"No Win Scenario\" pits a 5-player team against progressively harder waves of computer-controlled enemy ships who attempt to destroy the stationary freighter. The mission ends when the freighter is destroyed or the team defeats all 10 waves. Defeating higher waves rewards players with increased numbers of Fleet Marks and unlocks several Accolades and Captain Titles. Defeating the ninth wave yields the \"Original Thinking\" accolade and grants the \"Original Thinker\" title, and defeating the final wave rewards the \"I don't believe in the No-Win Scenario\" accolade which grants the title \"Kirk's Protégé\".\n\nIn \"\", which was developed to be played in virtual reality in 2017, the first level ends with the same Kobayashi Maru test as part of the mission to be solved. No moral choice of lateral thinking is involved here. In practice the mission serves to train the players how to coordinate their actions and alternate between beaming survivors aboard and combat.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" called the \"Kobayashi Maru\" test one of the top ten elements of \"Star Trek\" with which non-fans are likely to be familiar.\n"}

{"id": "73193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73193", "title": "Longchenpa", "text": "Longchenpa\n\nLongchen Rabjampa, Drimé Özer (Wylie: \"klong chen rab 'byams pa dri med 'od zer\"), commonly abbreviated to Longchenpa (1308–1364), was a major teacher in the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. Along with Sakya Pandita and Je Tsongkhapa, he is commonly recognized as one of the three main manifestations of Manjushri to have taught in Central Tibet. His major work is the \"Seven Treasuries\", which encapsulates the previous 600 years of Buddhist thought in Tibet. Longchenpa was a critical link in the exoteric and esoteric transmission of the Dzogchen teachings. He was abbot of Samye, one of Tibet's most important monasteries and the first Buddhist monastery established in the Himalaya, but spent most of his life travelling or in retreat.\n\nLongchen Rabjampa was born at Gra-phu stod-gron in g.Yo-ru in Eastern dBus in Central Tibet on the eighth day of the second lunar month of the Earth-Male-Ape year (i.e., Friday 1 March 1308, which was at the beginning of that Tibetan calendrical year). The date of Longchen Rabjampa's \"parinirvāṇa\" (his relinquishing of the appearance of his physical form manifest to others—or, in common parlance, his \"death\" or \"demise\") was the 18th day of the 12th lunar month of the Water-Female-Hare year (i.e., Wednesday 24 January 1364, which was at the end of that Tibetan calendrical year; he did not die in 1363, as has sometimes been maintained) at O-rgyan-rdzong in Gangs-ri thod-kar, Tibet.\n\nLongchenpa is regarded as an indirect incarnation of the princess Pema Sal. He was born to the master Tenpasung, an adept at both the sciences and the practice of mantra, and Dromza Sonamgyen, who was descended from the family of Dromton Gyelwie Jungne. Legend states that at age five, Longchenpa could read and write, and by age seven his father began instructing him in Nyingma tantras. Longchenpa was first ordained at the age of 12 and studied extensively with the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje. He not only received the Nyingma transmissions as passed down in his family, but also studied with many of the great teachers of his day without regard to sect. He thus received the combined Kadam and Sakya teachings of the Sutrayana through his main Sakya teacher, Palden Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen, in addition to the corpus of both old and new translation tantras. At the age of 19, Longchenpa entered the famous shedra (monastic college) Sangpu Neutok (Wylie: gSang-phu Ne'u-thog), where he acquired great scholarly wisdom. He later chose to practice in the solitude of the mountains, after becoming disgusted by the behavior of certain scholars.\n\nWhen he was in his late twenties two events occurred of decisive importance in his intellectual and spiritual development. One was a vision of Guru Padmasambhava and his consort Yeshe Tsogyal. The other happened in his 29th year, his meeting with the great mystic Rigdzin Kumaradza (alt. Kumaraja), from whom he received the Dzogchen empowerment and teachings in the uplands of Yartökyam at Samye, where he was traveling from valley to valley with his students in difficult conditions. Dudjom Rinpoche (1904–1987) \"et al.\" (1991: p. 579) held that just prior to the arrival of Longchenpa, Kumaraja related to his disciples:\n\nKumaraja accepted no outer tribute from Longchenpa for the teachings he received, discerning that Longchenpa was blameless and had offered his tribute internally.\n\nTogether with Rangjung Dorje, Longchenpa accompanied Kumaraja and his disciples for two years, during which time he received all of Rigdzin Kumaradza's transmissions. Through the efforts of these three, the diverse streams of the \"Innermost Essence\" (\"nying thig\") teachings of Dzogchen were brought together and codified into one of the common grounds between the Nyingma and Karma Kagyud traditions.\n\nAfter several years in retreat, Longchenpa attracted more and more students, even though he had spent nearly all of his life in mountain caves. During a stay in Bhutan (Tib., Mon), Longchenpa fathered a daughter and a son, Trugpa Odzer (b. 1356), who also became a holder of the Nyingtig lineage. A detailed account of Longchenpa's life and teachings is found in \"Buddha Mind\" by Tulku Thondup Rinpoche and in \"A Marvelous Garland of Rare Gems\" by Nyoshul Khenpo.\n\nPema Lingpa, the famous \"terton\" (finder of sacred texts) of Bhutan, is regarded as the immediate reincarnation of Longchenpa.\n\nIn the Nyingma lineage, Longchenpa, Rongzom, and Mipham are known as the Three Omniscient Ones.\n\nDavid Germano, in his doctoral thesis on the Tsigdön Dzö (tshigs don mdzod) (one of the Seven Treasuries), frames Longchenpa's brilliance within the wider discourse of the Dzogchen tradition (found in the Bonpo Zhangzhung and Indo-Tibetan traditions of Buddhism):\n\nLongchenpa is widely considered the single most important writer on Dzogchen teachings. He is credited with more than 250 works, both as author and compiler, among which are the famous \"Seven Treasuries\" (mdzod bdun), the \"Trilogy of Natural Freedom\" (rang grol skor gsum), the \"Trilogy of Natural Ease\" (ngal gso skor gsum), his \"Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness\", and his compilation, with commentaries, of the \"Nyingtig Yabshi.\" He is also a commentator on the \"Kunyed Gyalpo Tantra\" (Tib., kun byed rgyal po'i rgyud; \"The King Who Creates Everything\", Skt. kulayarāja, \"the King of the Dwelling Place [of Ultimate Bodhicitta]), a text belonging to the Mind Class (Tib., sems sde) of the Ati Yoga Inner Tantras. As scholar Jacob Dalton summarizes,\n\nLongchenpa combined the teachings of the Vima Nyingtig lineage with those of the Khandro Nyingtig, thus preparing the ground for the fully unified system of teachings that became known as the Longchen Nyingthig (by Jigme Lingpa).\n\nA (Seven Treasuries): \n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n6.\n7.\nB (Trilogy of Natural Ease)\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\nC (Trilogy of Natural Freedom)\nD (Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness)\nE (others)\n\nApart from Longchenpa's names given below, he is sometimes referred to by the honorary title \"Second Buddha\" (Tib. rgyal ba gnyis), a term usually reserved for Guru Padmasambhava and indicative of the high regard in which he and his teachings are held. Like the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje, Rongzompa and Jigme Lingpa, he carried the title \"Kunkhyen\" (Tibetan; \"All-Knowing\").\n\nVarious forms and spellings of Longchenpa's full name(s), in which 'Longchen' means \"great expanse\", \"vast space\", \"great vortex\", and 'Rab 'byams' \"cosmic\", \"vast\", \"extensive\", \"infinite\".\n\n"}

(16 October 1588 – 18 November 1657), was an Irish Franciscan friar and historian.\n\nWadding was born on 16 October 1588 in Waterford to Walter Wadding of Waterford, a wealthy merchant, and his wife, Anastasia Lombard (sister of Peter Lombard, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland). Educated at the school of Mrs. Jane Barden in Waterford and of Peter White in Kilkenny, in 1604 he went to study in Lisbon and at the University of Coimbra.\n\nAfter completing his university studies, Wadding became a Franciscan friar in 1607, and spent his novitiate at Matosinhos, Portugal. He was ordained priest in 1613 by João Manuel, Bishop of Viseu, and in 1617 he was made President of the Irish College at the University of Salamanca, and Master of Students and Professor of Divinity. The next year, he went to Rome as chaplain to the Spanish ambassador to the Papal States, Bishop Antonio Trejo de Sande, O.F.M. Wadding collected the funds for the establishment of the College of St. Isidore in Rome, for the education of Irish priests, opened 24 June 1625, with four lecturers — Anthony O'Hicidh of a famous literary family in Thomond, Martin Breathnach from Donegal, Patrick Fleming from Louth, and John Punch from Cork. He gave the college a library of 5,000 printed books and 800 manuscripts, and thirty resident students soon came. Wadding served as rector of the college for 15 years. From 1630 to 1634, he was Procurator of the Order of Friars Minor at their headquarters in Rome, and Vice Commissary from 1645 to 1648. During the papal conclaves of 1644 and 1655, Wadding received votes to become pope, making him \"as close as the church has come to having an Irish pope.\" \n\nWadding was an enthusiastic supporter of the Irish Catholics during the Irish Confederate Wars, and his college became the strongest advocate of the Irish cause in Rome. (This spirit of patriotism originated by Wadding had a lasting impact, so that the 19th-century Catholic Archbishop George Errington, who was sent by Gladstone to explain the relation of English and Irish politics in Rome, reported that those Irish politicians thought most extreme in England were conservatives compared with the collegians of St. Isidore.) Wadding sent officers and arms to Ireland, and induced Pope Innocent X to send there Giovanni Battista Rinuccini.\n\nThe confederate Catholics petitioned Pope Urban VIII to make Wadding a cardinal, but he found ways to intercept the petition, and it remained in the archives of the college.\n\nLuke Wadding was an important art patron. He commissioned artworks for St. Isidore's church in Rome. The painters Andrea Sacchi and Carlo Maratti were the most famous artists commissioned by Wadding.\n\nWadding died on 18 November 1657, and is buried in the church of the College of San Isidore, in Rome. His life was written by Francis Harold, his nephew. The learned Franciscan friar Bonaventura Baron was another nephew.\n\nWadding founded the Pontifical Irish College for Irish secular clergy. In 1900, Wadding's portrait and part of his library were in the Franciscan friary on Merchant's Quay, Dublin. Through Wadding's efforts, St Patrick's Day became a feast day. But it would take years for it to develop, taking until the 20th century for St. Patrick's Day parades to occur in his native Ireland, while the first organized celebration in America took place in the 18th century in cities like Boston and New York, and today occurs in faraway places like Russia and Japan. Amid all the celebrations, most Irish today do not know about the \"Waterford man who created St. Patrick's Day.\" \n\nIn the 1950s, a statue of Wadding was erected on the Mall in Waterford, adjacent to Reginald's Tower and one of the city's most prominent locations. The Waterford-born Franciscan's literary, academic and theological attributes were denoted by a quill pen held poised in the statue's right hand. More recently this statue was replaced by one of Thomas Francis Meagher. The figure of Luke Wadding was moved to a position at the entrance to the French Church, Waterford on Greyfriars.\n\nIn 2000, the Waterford Institute of Technology dedicated a new library building to his name.\n\nA voluminous writer, his chief work was the \"Annales Minorum\" in 8 folio volumes (1625–1654), re-edited in the 18th century and continued up to the year 1622; it is the classical work on Franciscan history. He published also a \"Bibliotheca\" of Franciscan writers, an edition of the works of Duns Scotus, and the first collection of the writings of St Francis of Assisi. \n\nWadding published a total of 36 volumes – fourteen at Rome, twenty-one at Lyon, and one at Antwerp.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22905486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22905486", "title": "Ministerial Code", "text": "Ministerial Code\n\nThe Ministerial Code is a document setting out \"rules\" and standards for government ministers in the United Kingdom. Separate codes exist for ministers of the Scottish Government, the Northern Ireland Executive (based on the St Andrews Agreement) and the Welsh Government.\n\nCodes of conduct for ministers are amongst a range of initiatives designed to respond to perceptions of the erosion of ministerial accountability, and to preserve public trust in the institutions of cabinet government. Written guidance for British cabinet ministers began as the document \"Questions of Procedure for Ministers\" (QPM), which was a confidential document prepared by the Cabinet Office to assist ministers, and dates to at least the 1980s.\n\nThe earliest published form of the Code is a result of the QPM's release by the Major Government in 1992. Further editions have been based on suggestions and recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The first edition to be entitled \"Ministerial Code\" was Tony Blair's 1997 set of rules. The most recent version was released in December 2016 (by convention, each new Prime Minister issues their own). \n\nWhen Gordon Brown came into office in June 2007 he appointed Sir Philip Mawer, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, as the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests – a form of enforcer to conduct investigations and give confidential advice. The Adviser under Tony Blair was Comptroller and Auditor General Sir John Bourn. The Cabinet Secretary, currently Jeremy Heywood, is responsible for clearing ministers' financial matters.\n\nThe Code is currently administered by the Propriety and Ethics group within the Cabinet Office.\n\nThe Code is periodically updated. The 2015 update included removing the explicit requirement that ministers comply with international law and treaty obligations.\n\nThe Code has 10 sections, and two annexes. It begins with a foreword from Theresa May. \n\nThis section is an introduction, setting out the role of ministers to the government, to Parliament, and to the people. It directs ministers to \"behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety,\" to uphold the principle of collective responsibility, not to mislead parliament, and to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nSection 2, \"Ministers and the Government\", sets out the precise rules of collective responsibility. It also states that ministers should relinquish all government material when ceasing to hold a role, and provides rules on access to government papers by former ministers (for example, those writing memoirs may wish to check the documents from their time in office). This set of rules is known as the \"Radcliffe rules\".\n\nSetting out the rules regarding special advisers (temporary civil servants who are political agents of the minister), how many each minister may appoint, and their powers and duties. Also covered is the appointment of Parliamentary Private Secretaries (backbenchers who act as an unpaid secretary to the minister, to gain experience and credit with the party), whose appointments require written authority from the Prime Minister. PPSs are not members of the Government, but are expected to form part of the payroll vote, and support all government initiatives in the House of Commons.\n\n\"Ministers and Their Departments\" regards the machinery of government (the structure of government departments and how responsibilities can be transferred), and how ministers should ensure that their work is covered during any absence from London, even for constituency business.\n\nThis section, \"Ministers and Civil Servants\", regards ministerial relationships with the Civil Service. It states that ministers \"must uphold the political impartiality of the Civil Service, and not ask civil servants to act in any way which would conflict with the \"Civil Service Code\".\"\n\n\"Ministers' Constituency and Party Interests\" directs ministers to refrain from using government property and resources in their role as an MP. For example, political leaflets must not be distributed at the expense of public funds. Ministers with a conflict of interest between their government role and their constituency (for example, a transport minister may have to balance the desire of his constituents not to have a new airport built near their town, with his government duties) are simply advised to act cautiously; \"ministers are advised to take particular care.\"\n\nThis section requires ministers to provide their Permanent Secretary with a complete list of any financial interests they have. In March 2009, this list was released to the public for the first time. It is collated and made available by the Cabinet Office. Officials sometimes need to restrict \"interested\" ministers' access to certain papers, to ensure impartiality.\n\nGuidelines are set out as to maintaining neutrality for ministers who are members of a trade union. No minister should accept gifts or hospitality from any person or organisation when a conflict of interest could arise. A list of gifts, and how they were dealt with on an individual basis, is published annually.\n\nSpeeches, interviews and news releases should all be cleared with the Number 10 Press Office, to ensure synchronicity of timing, and clarity of content. Ministers should not practice \"regular journalism\" without the permission of the Office. No minister may publish a book about their ministerial experiences while in office. Former ministers require manuscripts to be cleared by the Cabinet Secretary, under the \"Radcliffe rules\".\n\nMinisters should not make oral statements to Parliament without prior approval from the Prime Minister. Any other minister or MP to be mentioned in such a statement should be notified beforehand.\n\nOfficial government transport, paid for by public funds, should normally only be used on government business, except where security requires that it be used even for personal transport. All travel should be cost-effective, and any trips abroad should be kept as small as possible. All overseas delegations costing more than £500 have their details published, annually. Members of the Cabinet have the authority to order special (non-scheduled) flights, but this power should only be used when necessary. In the event of a minister being summoned home on urgent government business, the cost of the round trip will be paid for from public funds. There are also rules relating to the use of official cars, and air miles gained by official travel.\n\nThese principles were published by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in 1995.\n\nIt has been argued that, following a series of high-profile political scandals over the Code (David Blunkett resigned for a second time over a conflict of interest; and Tessa Jowell's husband was implicated – separately – in a furore over his financial dealings), that it should be administered by a more impartial figure than the Prime Minister. However, the Prime Minister remains the ultimate judge of whether or not a minister has breached the Code.\n\n\n"}

In Indian philosophy the notion of individuality, which is the third level of personality and the seed of all thoughts, speeches and actions is called \"Pashyanti\" , meaning 'that which witnesses'.\n\nThe Shiva-Shakti dance generated a rhythmic spiritual sound which the Vedic Rishis termed as Nāda Brahman, the initial primordial sound of extremely high frequencies that were beyond one’s imagination. They were aware of the subtle secrets of nature and knew that the gross-level sound related to corresponding spiritual, cosmic and semi-cosmic vibrations which were divine sounds. Solving the subtle riddle they found the four states of Vāni (speech or sound) – \"Parā\" (the spiritual sound of Brahman), Madhyama (the cosmic sound of \"Vāstu=Purusha\"), \"Pashyanti\" (the semi-cosmic sounds of \"Vibhootis\") and \"Vaikhari\" (the gross-level sounds of gross objects and living beings). The ripples of \"Samashti-Prānas\" produce semi-cosmic vibrations which are visible through cosmic sight alone; the Rishis applied the term \"Pashyanti\" to this observation because they could observe the semi-cosmic colours of the stimulated \"Samashti-Prānas\" corresponding to spoken alphabets, which observation is also known as Darśana, Indian philosophy is called Darśana. They concluded that all vowels are divine alphabets for they produce divine words or Mantras.\nThus, \"Pashyanti\" refers to the visible sound which is ordinarily experienced as a feeling or a mental picture. Each level or state of sound corresponds to a certain plane of existence, a certain state of consciousness; the ability to experience the different levels of sounds depends upon the refinement of consciousness. When sound out through the mouth as spoken syllables it is named \"Vaikhari-vac\"; the finer sounds that exist as a thought prior to expression are inaudible sounds, the sound existing in between the formation of a thought as an idea, feelings and image, and its expression on the material level as speech or action is named \"Madhyama-vac\" but the sound that leaves its audible nature and manifests as a feeling, a wordless idea or some visual imagery is named \"Pashyanti-vac\" which is intuitive in nature and beyond defined linguistic forms or frameworks.\n\nBhartrihari explains that \"Vaikhari\", the most external and differentiated level of language, on which speech is uttered by the speaker and heard by the hearer has its temporal sequence fully developed; \"Madhyama\" represents the thinking level of the mind; \"Pashyanti\" is the finest relative level where there is no distinction between the word and the meaning and there is no temporal sequence, and \"Parā\" is the fully unmanifest level of language beyond \"Pashyanti\". He associates the \"Pashyanti\" level of language with \"sphota\", representing a meaning as a whole, existing in the mind of the speaker as a unity. \"Sphota\" or the whole-meaning comprises \"dhvani\" (the word-sound) and \"artha\" (word-meaning).\nHaney points out that the unity of name and form, of sound and meaning, on the level of \"sphota\" in \"Pashyanti\" applies mainly to Sanskrit language, and Artaud is of the opinion that the language beyond speech is the language of nature whose grammar has not yet been discovered; \"Pashyanti\" representing the subtlest level of nature is the closest to nature itself.\n\nEven though Bhartrihari considers \"Pashyanti\" to be the highest level of language for it is the word without temporal sequence but \"Pashyanti\" contains the inherent impulse toward expression in time and space. \"Pashyanti\" borders on two dimensions – \"Jagrat chetna\" or refined ordinary waking consciousness which determines the force of expression, and \"Turiya chetna\" or the transcendental consciousness which determines the non-sequenced unity of sound and meaning intimated by the trace; these bring to the fore two kinds of infinity – that of dissemination, of unlimited extension within space, time and causality; and that of Turiya and \"Pashyanti\", of transcending duality through unity amidst diversity. According to Advaita school the access of the unity of language and consciousness on the level of \"Pashyanti\" and \"Parā\" results in the siddhis referred to as attainments or accomplishments in the Yoga Sutras.\nPippalada tells Satyakama Jabala that the status of the seeker depends on the depth of meditation, he uses two significant words, \"Abhidhyanam\" (dhyana) and \"Mātrā\" (degree), also used by Patanjali; meditation has three \"matras\" or levels, the one who has gone beyond \"Vaikhari\" and \"Madhyama\" and reached the \"Pashyanti\" stage of meditation can become one with the Absolute and need not be born.\n\nSankara explains that \"Pashyanti\" corresponds to the junction point between the ordinary waking state and pure consciousness. A word spoken or thought in the ordinary waking state is only a partial expression of an eternal meaning or transcendental signified.\n\nTantra, like the Vedas, recognizes four levels of speech. \"Vaikhari\" is the audible speech located in the throat and manifest during the waking state; \"Madhyama\" is thought located in the heart and manifest during the dream state; \"Pashyanti\" is illumined speech located in the navel and manifest during the deep-sleep state, and \"Parā\" is the transcendent located at the root center and manifest during Samadhi. The power of speech must be brought down to the base of the spine to allow the energy of consciousness to ascend upward as Kundalini to awaken higher potentials. \"Pashyanti\" is the state of seeing, the perceptive or the illumined word; it is the sound that perceives and reveals the truth. Tara represents the illumined word.\n\nYogakundalyupanishad III.18-19 tells us that sound sprouts in \"Parā\" (supreme) form, it becomes two-leafed (that is first manifested) in \"Pashyanti\" (radiant) form, buds in the \"Madhyama\" (subliminal) form and blooms in \"Vaikhari\" (acoustic) form; sound thus produced will become unmanifested, when the order is reversed. Shabda Brahman is the source of sound and is in the form of sound which is unmanifest, therefore it is called \"Parā\" and appears to express the kinetic part of the static quiescent eternal reality.\n"}
{"id": "24897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24897", "title": "Persuasion", "text": "Persuasion\n\nPersuasion is an umbrella term of influence. Persuasion can attempt to influence a person's beliefs, attitudes, intentions, motivations, or behaviors. In business,\npersuasion is a process aimed at changing a person's (or a group's) attitude or behavior toward some event, idea, object, or other person(s), by using written, spoken words or visual tools to convey information, feelings, or reasoning, or a combination thereof. Persuasion is also an often used tool in the pursuit of personal gain, such as election campaigning, giving a sales pitch, or in trial advocacy. Persuasion can also be interpreted as using one's personal or positional resources to change people's behaviors or attitudes.\nSystematic persuasion is the process through which attitudes or beliefs are leveraged by appeals to logic and reason. Heuristic persuasion on the other hand is the process through which attitudes or beliefs are leveraged by appeals to habit or emotion.\n\nPersuasion began with the Greeks, who emphasized rhetoric and elocution as the highest standard for a successful politician. All trials were held in front of the Assembly, and both the prosecution and the defense rested, as they often do today, on the persuasiveness of the speaker. Rhetoric was the ability to find the available means of persuasion in any instance.\nThe Greek philosopher Aristotle listed four reasons why one should learn the art of persuasion:\nAristotle's rhetorical proofs:\n\nHumans attempt to explain the actions of others through either dispositional attribution or situational attribution.\n\nDispositional attribution, also referred to as internal attribution, attempts to point to a person’s traits, abilities, motives, or dispositions as a cause or explanation for their actions. A citizen criticizing a president by saying the nation is lacking economic progress and health because the president is either lazy or lacking in economic intuition is utilizing a dispositional attribution.\n\nSituational attribution, also referred to as external attribution, attempts to point to the context around the person and factors of his surroundings, particularly things that are completely out of his control. A citizen claiming that a lack of economic progress is not a fault of the president but rather the fact that he inherited a poor economy from the previous president is situational attribution.\n\nFundamental attribution error occurs when people wrongly attribute either a shortcoming or accomplishment to internal factors, and disregarding any external factors. In general, people tend to make dispositional attributions more often than situational attributions when trying to explain or understand a person’s behavior. This happens when we are much more focused on the individual because we do not know much about their situation or context. When trying to persuade others to like us or another person, we tend to explain positive behaviors and accomplishments with dispositional attribution, but our own negative behaviors and shortcomings with situational attributions.\n\nThe theory of planned behaviour is the foremost theory of behaviour change. It has support from meta-analyses which reveals it can predict around 30% of behaviour. Theories, by nature however, prioritise internal validity, over external validity. They are coherent and therefore make for an easily and reappropriated story. On the other hand, they will correspond more poorly with the evidence, and mechanics of reality, than a straightforward itemisation of the behaviour change interventions (techniques) by their individual efficacy. \nThese behaviour change interventions have been categorised by behaviour scientists. A mutually exclusive, comprehensively exhaustive (MECE) translation of this taxonomy, in decreasing order of effectiveness are:\n\n\nA typical instantiations of these techniques in therapy isexposure / response prevention for OCD.\n\nConditioning plays a huge part in the concept of persuasion. It is more often about leading someone into taking certain actions of their own, rather than giving direct commands. In advertisements for example, this is done by attempting to connect a positive emotion to a brand/product logo. This is often done by creating commercials that make people laugh, using a sexual undertone, inserting uplifting images and/or music etc. and then ending the commercial with a brand/product logo. Great examples of this are professional athletes. They are paid to connect themselves to things that can be directly related to their roles; sport shoes, tennis rackets, golf balls, or completely irrelevant things like soft drinks, popcorn poppers and panty hose. The important thing for the advertiser is to establish a connection to the consumer.\n\nThis conditioning is thought to affect how people view certain products, knowing that most purchases are made on the basis of emotion. Just like you sometimes recall a memory from a certain smell or sound, the objective of some ads is solely to bring back certain emotions when you see their logo in your local store. The hope is that repeating the message several times makes consumers more likely to purchase the product because they already connect it with a good emotion and positive experience.\nStefano DellaVigna and Matthew Gentzkow did a comprehensive study on the effects of persuasion in different domains. They discovered that persuasion has little or no effect on advertisement; however, there was a substantial effect of persuasion on voting if there was face-to-face contact.\n\nLeon Festinger originally proposed the theory of cognitive dissonance in 1957. He theorized that human beings constantly strive for mental consistency. Our cognition (thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes) can be in agreement, unrelated, or in disagreement with each other. Our cognition can also be in agreement or disagreement with our behaviors. When we detect conflicting cognition, or dissonance, it gives us a sense of incompleteness and discomfort. For example, a person who is addicted to smoking cigarettes but also suspects it could be detrimental to his health suffers from cognitive dissonance.\n\nFestinger suggests that we are motivated to reduce this dissonance until our cognition is in harmony with itself. We strive for mental consistency. There are four main ways we go about reducing or eliminating our dissonance:\nRevisiting the example of the smoker, he can either quit smoking, reduce the importance of his health, convince himself he is not at risk, or that the reward of smoking is worth the cost of his health.\n\nCognitive dissonance is powerful when it relates to competition and self-concept. The most famous example of how cognitive dissonance can be used for persuasion comes from Festinger and Carlsmith’s 1959 experiment in which participants were asked to complete a very dull task for an hour. Some were paid $20, while others were paid $1, and afterwards they were instructed to tell the next waiting participants that the experiment was fun and exciting. Those who were paid $1 were much more likely to convince the next participants that the experiment really was enjoyable than those who received $20. This is because $20 is enough reason to participate in a dull task for an hour, so there is no dissonance. Those who received $1 experienced great dissonance, so they had to truly convince themselves that the task actually was enjoyable to avoid feeling taken advantage of, and therefore reduce their dissonance.\n\nPersuasion has traditionally been associated with two routes.\n\nThe Elaboration likelihood model (ELM) forms a new facet of the route theory. It holds that the probability of effective persuasion depends on how successful the communication is at bringing to mind a relevant mental representation, which is the elaboration likelihood. Thus if the target of the communication is personally relevant, this increases the elaboration likelihood of the intended outcome and would be more persuasive if it were through the central route. Communication which does not require careful thought would be better suited to the peripheral route.\n\nFunctional theorists attempt to understand the divergent attitudes individuals have towards people, objects or issues in different situations. There are four main functional attitudes:\n\nWhen communication targets an underlying function, its degree of persuasiveness influences whether individuals change their attitude after determining that another attitude would more effectively fulfill that function.\n\nA vaccine introduces a weak form of a virus that can easily be defeated to prepare the immune system should it need to fight off a stronger form of the same virus. In much the same way, the theory of inoculation suggests that a certain party can introduce a weak form of an argument that is easily thwarted in order to make the audience inclined to disregard a stronger, full-fledged form of that argument from an opposing party.\n\nThis often occurs in negative advertisements and comparative advertisements—both for products and political causes. An example would be a manufacturer of a product displaying an ad that refutes one particular claim made about a rival’s product, so that when the audience sees an ad for said rival product, they refute the product claims automatically.\n\nNarrative transportation theory proposes that when people lose themselves in a story, their attitudes and intentions change to reflect that story. The mental state of narrative transportation can explain the persuasive effect of stories on people, who may experience narrative transportation when certain contextual and personal preconditions are met, as Green and Brock postulate for the transportation-imagery model. Narrative transportation occurs whenever the story receiver experiences a feeling of entering a world evoked by the narrative because of empathy for the story characters and imagination of the story plot.\n\nSocial judgment theory suggests that when people are presented with an idea or any kind of persuasive proposal, their natural reaction is to immediately seek a way to sort the information subconsciously and react to it. We evaluate the information and compare it with the attitude we already have, which is called the initial attitude or anchor point.\n\nWhen trying to sort incoming persuasive information, an audience evaluates whether it lands in their latitude of acceptance, latitude of non-commitment or indifference, or the latitude of rejection. The size of these latitudes varies from topic to topic. Our \"ego-involvement\" generally plays one of the largest roles in determining the size of these latitudes. When a topic is closely connected to how we define and perceive ourselves, or deals with anything we care passionately about, our latitudes of acceptance and non-commitment are likely to be much smaller and our attitude of rejection much larger. A person’s anchor point is considered to be the center of his latitude of acceptance, the position that is most acceptable to him.\n\nAn audience is likely to distort incoming information to fit into their unique latitudes. If something falls within the latitude of acceptance, the subject tends to assimilate the information and consider it closer to his anchor point than it really is. Inversely, if something falls within the latitude of rejection, the subject tends to contrast the information and convince himself the information is farther away from his anchor point than it really is.\n\nWhen trying to persuade an individual target or an entire audience, it is vital to first learn the average latitudes of acceptance, non-commitment, and rejection of your audience. It is ideal to use persuasive information that lands near the boundary of the latitude of acceptance if the goal is to change the audience’s anchor point. Repeatedly suggesting ideas on the fringe of the acceptance latitude makes people gradually adjust their anchor points, while suggesting ideas in the rejection latitude or even the non-commitment latitude does not change the audience’s anchor point.\n\nPersuasion methods are also sometimes referred to as \"persuasion tactics\" or \"persuasion strategies\".\n\nThere is the usage of force in persuasion, which does not have any scientific theories, except for its use to make demands. The use of force is then a precedent to the failure of less direct means of persuasion. Application of this strategy can be interpreted as a threat since the persuader does not give options to his or her request.\n\nRobert Cialdini, in \"Influence\", his book on persuasion, defined six \"influence cues or weapons of influence\": Influence is the process of changing.\n\nThe principle of reciprocity states that when a person provides us with something, we attempt to repay him or her in kind. Reciprocation produces a sense of obligation, which can be a powerful tool in persuasion. The reciprocity rule is effective because it can be overpowering and instill in us a sense of obligation. Generally, we have a dislike for individuals who neglect to return a favor or provide payment when offered a free service or gift. As a result, reciprocation is a widely held principle. This societal standard makes reciprocity extremely powerful persuasive technique, as it can result in unequal exchanges and can even apply to an uninvited first favor.\n\nConsistency is an important aspect of persuasion because it:\nConsistency allows us to more effectively make decisions and process information. The concept of consistency states that someone who commits to something, orally or in writing, is more likely to honor that commitment. This is especially true for written commitments, as they appear psychologically more concrete and can create hard proof. Someone who commits to a stance tends to behave according to that commitment. Commitment is an effective persuasive technique, because once you get someone to commit, they are more likely to engage in self-persuasion, providing themselves and others with reasons and justifications to support their commitment in order to avoid dissonance. Cialdini notes Chinese brainwashing of American prisoners of war to rewrite their self-image and gain automatic unenforced compliance. Another example is children being made to repeat the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and why marketers make you close popups by saying \"I’ll sign up later\" or \"No thanks, I prefer not making money\".\n\nWe, as humans, are influenced by others around us; we want to do what everyone else is. People often base their actions and beliefs on what others around them are doing, how others act or what others believe.\n\n\"The power of the crowd\" is very effective. We all want to know what others are doing around us. We are so obsessed with what others do and how others act, that we then try to be just like other people. Cialdini gives an example that is somewhat like this: In a phone–a–thon, the host says something like, \"Operators are waiting, please call now.\" The only context you have from that statement is that the operators are waiting and not busy. Rather the host may say: \"If operators are busy, please call again.\" This is the technique of social proof. Just by changing three words, it sounds like the lines are busy and other people are calling, so it must be a worthwhile organization.\n\nSocial proof is most effective when people are uncertain or when there are similarities in a situation. In uncertain or ambiguous situations, when multiple possibilities create choices we must make, people are likely to conform to what others do. We become more influenced by people around us in situations that present a decision. The other effective situation for social proofing is when there are similarities. We are more prone to change or conform around people who are similar to us. If someone who is similar to you is being controlling and a leader, you are more likely to listen and follow what they say.\n\nThis principle is simple and concise. People say \"yes\" to people that they like. Two major factors contribute to overall likeness. The first is physical attractiveness. People who are physically attractive seem more persuasive. They get what they want and they can easily change others' attitudes. This attractiveness is proven to send favorable messages/impressions of other traits that a person may have, such as talent, kindness, and intelligence. The second factor is similarity. We are more easily persuaded by people we see as similar to ourselves.\n\nWe have the tendency to believe that if an expert says something, then it must be true. People like to listen to those who are knowledgeable and trustworthy, so if you can be those two things, then you are already on your way to getting people to believe and listen to you.\n\nIn the Milgram study, a series of experiments begun in 1961, a \"teacher\" and a \"learner\" were placed in two different rooms. The \"learner\" was attached to an electric harness that could administer shock. The \"teacher\" was told by a supervisor, dressed in a white scientist's coat, to ask the learner questions and punish him when he got a question wrong. The teacher was instructed by the study supervisor to deliver an electric shock from a panel under the teacher's control. After delivery, the teacher had to up the voltage to the next notch. The voltage went up to 450 volts. The catch to this experiment was that the teacher did not know that the learner was an actor faking the pain sounds he heard and was not actually being harmed. The experiment was being done to see how obedient we are to authority. \"When an authority tells ordinary people it is their job to deliver harm, how much suffering will each subject be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent other person if the instructions come 'from above'?.\" In this study the results show that most teachers were willing to give as much pain as was available to them. The conclusion was that people are willing to bring pain upon others when they are directed to do so by some authority figure.\n\nScarcity could play an important role in the process of persuasion. When something has limited availability, people assign it more value. According to Cialdini, \"people want more of what they cannot have.\" When scarcity is an issue, the context matters. This means that within certain contexts, scarcity \"works\" better. To get people to believe that something is scarcer, marketers explain what about that certain product provides what no other product does. Marketers also get people to believe something is scarce by telling them what they will lose, not what they will gain—using statements like, \"You will lose $5,\" rather than, \"Save $5.\"\nThere are two major reasons why the scarcity principle works:\nWhen this happens, we assign the scarce item or service more value simply because it is harder to acquire.\n\nThis principle is that we all want things that are out of our reach. If we see something is easily available, we do not want it as much as something that is very rare.\n\nMachiavellianism employs the tools of manipulation and deceit to gain wealth and power.\n\nIn their book \"The Art of Woo\", G. Richard Shell and Mario Moussa present a four-step approach to strategic persuasion. They explain that persuasion means to win others over, not to defeat them. Thus it is important to see the topic from different angles in order to anticipate the reaction others have to a proposal.\n\n\nBy appeal to reason:\n\nBy appeal to emotion:\n\nAids to persuasion:\n\nOther techniques:\n\nCoercive techniques, some of which are highly controversial or not scientifically proven effective:\nIt is through a basic cultural personal definition of persuasion that everyday people understand how others are attempting to influence them and then how they influence others. The dialogue surrounding persuasion is constantly evolving because of the necessity to use persuasion in everyday life. Persuasion tactics traded in society have influences from researchers, which may sometimes be misinterpreted.\nTo keep evolutionary advantage, in the sense of wealth and survival, you must persuade and not be persuaded. To understand cultural persuasion, researchers gather knowledge from domains such as \"buying, selling, advertising, and shopping, as well as parenting and courting.\"\n\nMethods of persuasion vary by culture, both in prevalence and effectiveness. For example, advertisements tend to appeal to different values according to whether they are used in collectivistic or individualistic cultures.\n\nThe Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM) was created by Friestad and Wright in 1994. This framework allows the researchers to analyze the process of gaining and using everyday persuasion knowledge. The researchers suggest the necessity of including \"the relationship and interplay between everyday folk knowledge and scientific knowledge on persuasion, advertising, selling, and marketing in general.\"\n\nTo educate the general population about research findings and new knowledge about persuasion, a teacher must draw on their pre-existing beliefs from folk persuasion to make the research relevant and informative to lay people, which creates \"mingling of their scientific insights and commonsense beliefs.\"\n\nAs a result of this constant mingling, the issue of persuasion expertise becomes messy. Expertise status can be interpreted from a variety of sources like job titles, celebrity, or published scholarship.\n\nIt is through this multimodal process that we create concepts like, \"Stay away from car salesmen, they will try to trick you.\" The kind of persuasion techniques blatantly employed by car salesmen creates an innate distrust of them in popular culture. According to Psychology Today, they employ tactics ranging from making personal life ties with the customer to altering reality by handing the customer the new car keys before the purchase.\n\nAttitudes and persuasion are among the central issues of social behavior. One of the classic questions is when are attitudes a predictor of behavior. Previous research suggested that selective activation of left prefrontal cortex might increase the likelihood that an attitude would predict a relevant behavior. Using lateral attentional manipulation, this was supported.\n\nAn earlier article showed that EEG measures of anterior prefrontal asymmetry might be a predictor of persuasion. Research participants were presented with arguments that favored and arguments that opposed the attitudes they already held. Those whose brain was more active in left prefrontal areas said that they paid the most attention to statements with which they agreed while those with a more active right prefrontal area said that they paid attention to statements that disagreed. This is an example of defensive repression, the avoidance or forgetting of unpleasant information. Research has shown that the trait of defensive repression is related to relative left prefrontal activation. In addition, when pleasant or unpleasant words, probably analogous to agreement or disagreement, were seen incidental to the main task, an fMRI scan showed preferential left prefrontal activation to the pleasant words.\n\nOne way therefore to increase persuasion would seem to be to selectively activate the right prefrontal cortex. This is easily done by monaural stimulation to the contralateral ear. The effect apparently depends on selective attention rather than merely the source of stimulation. This manipulation had the expected outcome: more persuasion for messages coming from the left.\n\n"}

{"id": "14536973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14536973", "title": "Prayer in the Catholic Church", "text": "Prayer in the Catholic Church\n\nIn the Catholic Church, prayer is \"the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God.\" It is an act of the moral virtue of religion, which Catholic theologians identify as a part of the cardinal virtue of justice.\n\nPrayer may be expressed vocally or mentally. Vocal prayer may be spoken or sung. Mental prayer can be either meditation or contemplation. The basic forms of prayer are praise, petition (supplication), intercession, and thanksgiving.\n\nRoman Catholic teachings on the subject of prayer are contained in the \"Catechism\", where quoting St. John of Damascus, prayer is defined as \"...the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God\". St. Thérèse of Lisieux describes prayer as \"... a surge of the heart; it is a simple look turned toward heaven, it is a cry of recognition and of love, embracing both trial and joy.\"\n\nBy prayer one acknowledges God's power and goodness, and one's own neediness and dependence. It is therefore an act of the virtue of religion implying the deepest reverence for God and habituating a person to look to him for everything. Prayer presupposes faith in God and hope in his goodness. By both, God, to whom one prays, moves the individual to prayer.\n\nPrayer can be divided into vocal and mental types. Vocal prayer is that which is made by using some approved form of words, read or recited; such as the sign of the cross, the Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office), the Angelus, grace before and after meals, etc. Mental prayer is that which is made without employing either words or formulas of any kind. Catholics are exhorted to beware of underrating the usefulness or necessity of vocal prayer. Common vocal prayers include the Lord's Prayer (Our Father, Pater Noster), the Hail Mary (Ave Maria, Angelic Salutation), the Glory Be (Gloria Patri, Minor Doxology), and the Apostles' Creed (Symbolum Apostolorum).\n\nCatholics consider vocal prayer an essential element of the Christian life. Vocal prayer can be as simple and uplifting as “Thank you, God, for this beautiful morning,” or as formal as a Mass celebrating a very special occasion.\n\nWhen two or more people gather together to pray, their prayer is called communal prayer. Examples of communal prayer are the Rosary, devotional prayers including novenas and litanies, classroom prayers, and, most importantly, the Mass.\n\nSt. Ambrose introduced in Milan antiphonal singing of the psalms \"after the manner of the East\".\n\nMental prayer was defined by Fr. John A. Hardon, S.J. in his Modern Catholic Dictionary as a form of prayer in which the sentiments expressed are one's own and not those of another person. Mental prayer is a form of prayer whereby one loves God through dialogue with him, meditating on his words, and contemplating him. It is a time of silence focused on God and one's relationship with him. It is distinguished from vocal prayers which use set prayers, although mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. Mental prayer can be divided into meditation, or active mental prayer; and contemplation, passive mental prayer.\n\nMeditation is a form of reflective prayer which engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. There are as many methods of meditation as there are spiritual masters. Ordinary or active mental prayer consists of two operations; one belongs to the thinking faculty which applies the imagination, memory, and understanding to consider some truth or mystery. The other operation is dependent on the will and compels one to love, desire, and ask for the good proposed by the mind, and make resolutions to arrive at it. According to St. Teresa, the soul in this stage is like gardener, who, with much labour, draws the water up from the depths of the well to water his plants and flowers.\n\nContemplative prayer is a silent attentiveness which looks at God by contemplating and adoring his attributes. St. Teresa describes Contemplative prayer [oración mental] as \"...nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us.” In this inner prayer we can still meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself. Contemplation, like all prayer, is pure gift, and not anything one can achieve.\n\nThe tradition of the Roman Catholic Church highlights four basic elements of prayer: Prayer of Blessing and Adoration, Prayer of Petition, Prayer of Intercession, and Prayer of Thanksgiving.\n\nIn its widest applications the word \"blessing\" has a variety of meanings in sacred writings. It can be taken in a sense that is synonymous with praise; thus the Psalmist, \"I will bless the Lord at all times; praise shall be always in my mouth.\" The prayer of blessing expresses praise and honor to God and is man's response to God's gifts. \nAdoration is the first attitude of man acknowledging that he is a creature before his Creator. Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately that God is God. It lauds God for his own sake and gives him glory, quite beyond what He does, but simply because He is.\n\nA prayer of petition is a request to God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression is not intended to instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The \"Catechism\" states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the \"Catechism\", Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.\n\nIntercession is a prayer of petition which leads us to pray as Jesus did. He is the one intercessor with the Father on behalf of all men, especially sinners. Intercession is also a prayer to Mary and the saints on behalf of another person asking God to assist other people with the things they need.\n\nThankfulness is thanking God for what he has given and done.\n\nThe Psalms have always been an important part of Catholic liturgy. From earliest times until today, Christians view the Old Testament as prefiguring Christ. The evangelists put the words of the psalms on the lips of Jesus during his passion. Along these lines, ancient monks and nuns in the Egyptian desert heard Jesus' voice in all the psalms. They believed the psalms were written by King David, but they also believed that the pre-existent Christ inspired David to do the writing (Ps 110:1). For this reason, they prayed the whole Psalter daily. This tradition has grown and changed, but it still continues, faithful to the ancient practice. In Christian monasteries and many religious houses throughout the world, vowed men and women gather three to seven times daily to pray the psalms.\nThe Liturgy of the Hours is centered on chanting or recitation of the Psalms. Early Catholics employed the Psalms widely in their individual prayers also. Until the end of the Middle Ages it was not unknown for the laity to join in the singing of the Little Office of Our Lady, which was a shortened version of the Liturgy of the Hours providing a fixed daily cycle of twenty-five psalms to be recited.\n\nDevotions are prayers or pious exercises used to demonstrate reverence for a particular aspect of God or the person of Jesus, or for a particular saint. Catholic devotions have various forms, ranging from formalized prayers such as novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such as Eucharistic adoration, the veneration of the saints, and even horticultural practices such as maintaining a Mary garden. Common examples of Catholic devotions include the Rosary, the Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and the veneration of various saints, etc. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a \"Directory of devotions and pious practices\". The Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of joy, of sorrow and the glory of Jesus and Mary.Sister Lucia dos Santos said:\"The Most Holy Virgin in these last times in which we live has given a new efficacy to the recitation of the Rosary to such an extent that there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or above all spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families...that cannot be solved by the Rosary. There is no problem, I tell you, no matter how difficult it is, that we cannot resolve by the prayer of the Holy Rosary.\" \n\nAlthough many promises are associated with prayer, in his book \"The Way to Christ\" Pope John Paul II warned against \"mechanical prayer\" and pointed out the need for self-reflection before prayer. And in his message for the 42nd \"World Day of Prayer\" he said:\n\nIn Catholic tradition, there are many legends about the power of persistent prayer. In the fourth century, Saint Monica of Hippo is said to have prayed for the conversion of her son Augustine for fourteen years and he eventually became an influential figure in Christian thought.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40758039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40758039", "title": "Region-beta paradox", "text": "Region-beta paradox\n\nThe region-beta paradox denotes the phenomenon that people can sometimes recover more quickly from more intense emotions or pain than from less distressing experiences. The hypothesized reason is that intense states trigger psychological defense processes that reduce the distress, while less intense states do not trigger the same psychological defense processes and, therefore, less effective attenuation of the stress occurs. However, people typically predict intense states to last longer.\n\nThe paradox has been observed in the psychological effects of exposure to terrorist attacks. This is likely related to activation of coping, cognitive dissonance and other forms of mental mobilization.\n\nIt has been computationally modelled in an affective computing model.\n\nThe name originates from the illustration in the paper by Gilbert et al. that introduced the paradox. They consider a commuter who has the habit of walking to destinations within a mile of her origin, and biking to more distant destinations. Since the bike is faster the commuter will reach some distant locations more quickly than a nearer destinations (region beta in their diagram), reversing the normal tendency to arrive later at more distant locations.\n\nThis non-monotonicity applies to states where interventions can be chosen, but are not chosen below certain thresholds (because of cost etc.). For example, injured people may be more likely to seek out effective means to speed their recovery (taking medicine, going to a doctor, undergoing surgery) when the injury is more severe than for mild injuries, making the lesser injuries last longer.\n\n"}
{"id": "146342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146342", "title": "Right of self-defense", "text": "Right of self-defense\n\nThe right of self-defense (also called, when it applies to the defense of another, alter ego defense, defense of others, defense of a third person) is the right for people to use reasonable force or defensive force, for the purpose of defending one's own life (self-defense) or the lives of others, including –in certain circumstances– the use of deadly force.\n\nIf a defendant uses defensive force because of a threat of deadly or grievous harm by the other person, or a reasonable perception of such harm, the defendant is said to have a \"perfect self-defense\" justification. If defendant uses defensive force because of such a perception, and the perception is not reasonable, the defendant may have an \"imperfect self-defense\" as an excuse.\n\nThe early theories make no distinction between defense of the person and defense of property. Whether consciously or not, this builds on the Roman Law principle of \"dominium\" where any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the \"pater familias\" the male head of the household, sole owner of all property belonging to the household, and endowed by law with dominion over all his descendants through the male line no matter their age. The right to self-defense is phrased as the principle of \"vim vi repellere licet\" (\"it is permitted to repel force by force\") in the \"Digest\" of Justitian (6th century).\n\nIn \"Leviathan\" (1651), Hobbes (using the English term \"self-defense\" for the first time) proposed the foundation political theory that distinguishes between a state of nature where there is no authority and a modern state. Hobbes argues that although some may be stronger or more intelligent than others in their natural state, none are so strong as to be beyond a fear of violent death, which justifies self-defense as the highest necessity. In the \"Two Treatises of Government\", John Locke asserts the reason why an owner would give up their autonomy:\n\n...the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.\n\nIn earlier times before the development of national policing, an attack on the family home was effectively either an assault on the people actually inside or an indirect assault on their welfare by depriving them of shelter and/or the means of production. This linkage between a personal attack and property weakened as societies developed but the threat of violence remains a key factor. As an aspect of sovereignty, in his 1918 speech \"Politik als Beruf\" (Politics as a Vocation), Max Weber defined a state as an authority claiming the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within defined territorial boundaries. Recognizing that the modern framework of nations has emerged from the use of force, Weber asserted that the exercise of power through the institutions of government remained indispensable for effective government at any level which necessarily implies that self-help is limited if not excluded.\n\nFor modern theorists, the question of self-defense is one of moral authority within the nation to set the limits to obedience to the state and its laws given the pervasive dangers in a world full of weapons. In modern societies, states are increasingly delegating or privatizing their coercive powers to corporate providers of security services either to supplement or replace components within the power hierarchy. The fact that states no longer claim a monopoly to police within their borders, enhances the argument that individuals may exercise a right or privilege to use violence in their own defense. Indeed, modern libertarianism characterizes the majority of laws as intrusive to personal autonomy and, in particular, argues that the right of self-defense from coercion (including violence) is a fundamental human right, and in all cases, with no exceptions, justifies all uses of violence stemming from this right, regardless whether in defense of the person or property. In this context, note that Article 12 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\n\nThe inclusion of defense of one's family and home recognizes the universal benefit claimed to stem from the family's peaceable possession of private property. This general approach implicitly attacks Hohfeld's focus on the correlative relationship between right and duty as an aspect of human interactiveness as opposed to rights deemed implicitly more important because they attach to a person by virtue of his or her ownership of property. Further, it follows that, in this moral balancing exercise, laws must simultaneously criminalize aggression resulting in loss or injury, but decriminalize qualitatively identical violence causing loss or injury because it is used in self-defense. As a resolution of this apparent paradox and in defiance of Hohfeld, Robert Nozick asserted that there are no positive civil rights, only rights to property and the right of autonomy. In this theory, the \"acquisition principle\" states that people are entitled to defend and retain all holdings acquired in a just way and the \"rectification principle\" requires that any violation of the first principle be repaired by returning holdings to their rightful owners as a \"one time\" redistribution. Hence, in default of self-defense in the first instance, any damage to property must be made good either in kind or by value. Similarly, theorists such as George Fletcher and Robert Schopp have adopted European concepts of autonomy in their liberal theories to justify the right-holder using all necessary force to defend his or her autonomy and rights. This right inverts the \"felicitation principle\" of utilitarianism with the responsive violence being the greatest good to the individual, but accurately mirrors Jeremy Bentham who saw property as the driving force to enable individuals to enhance their utilities through stable investment and trade. In liberal theory, therefore, to maximise the utility, there is no need to retreat nor use only proportionate force. The attacker is said to sacrifice legal protection when initiating the attack. In this respect, the criminal law is not the tool of a welfare state which offers a safety net for all when they are injured. Nevertheless, some limits must be recognized as where a minor initial attack simply becomes a pretext for an excessively violent response. The civil law systems have a theory of \"abuse of right\" to explain denial of justification in such extreme cases.\n\nThe rules are the same when force is used to protect \"another\" from danger. Generally, the defendant must have a reasonable belief that the third party is in a position where they have the right of self-defense. For example, a person who unknowingly chances upon two actors practicing a fight would be able to defend their restraint of the one that appeared to be the aggressor. However, in many jurisdictions a person who causes injury in defense of another may be liable to criminal and civil charges if such defence turned out to be unnecessary.\n\nDefense of others is called \"pikuach nefesh\" in Jewish law. One must violate most negative commandments of the Torah in order to save someone's life.\n\nWhen trying to claim a self-defense case it will all depend on the threat. Was it a verbal threat to where the person felt threatened. To where he or she felt like they needed to defend themselves. It will also depend on if the threat was imminent or not. Was the threat about to happen, was the person's life really in danger. Did he or she provoke the person for the attack to happen. When the person attacked the person, did his or hers self-defense match the threat. Was it an overkill to where the person ended up dead. To where you didn't need to put that much force towards a person. Was it a 'castle doctrine' defense. Did they intentionally break in your home and try to harm you or your family to where he or she had to defend themselves or others using deadly force. To claim self-defense one of these things must have happened. \n\nModel Penal Code §3.04 contains an elaborate formulation for use of force, including when it is justified, and limitations on the justification.\n\nIn \"People v. La Voie\", Supreme Court of Colorado, 395 P.2d 1001 (1964), The court wrote, \"When a person has reasonable grounds for believing, and does in fact actually believe, that danger of his being killed, or of receiving great bodily harm, is imminent, he may act on such appearances and defend himself, even to the extent of taking human life when necessary, although it may turn out that the appearances were false, or although he may have been mistaken as to the extent of the real actual danger.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4292532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4292532", "title": "Sangam landscape", "text": "Sangam landscape\n\nThe Sangam landscape (Tamil: அகத்திணை \"inner classification\") is the name given to a poetic device that was characteristic of love poetry in classical Tamil Sangam literature. The core of the device was the categorisation of poems into different \"tiṇai\"s or modes, depending on the nature, location, mood and type of relationship represented by the poem. Each \"tiṇai\" was closely associated with a particular landscape, and imagery associated with that landscape - its flowers, trees, wildlife, people, climate and geography - was woven into the poem in such a way as to convey a mood, associated with one aspect of a romantic relationship.\n\nClassical Tamil love poetry assigns the human experiences it describes, and in particular the subjective topics that those experiences relate to, to specific habitats. Every situation in the poems is described using themes in which the time, the place and the floral symbols of each episode are codified. These codifications are used as symbols to imply a socio-economic order, occupations and behaviour patterns, which, in turn, are symbolized, by specific flora and fauna. Details of secondary aspects are just as rigidly codified - the seasons, the hour a god, musical instruments and, above all, the sentimental connotations of each landscape: lovers' meetings, patient waiting, lovers' quarrels, separation, and the anxiously awaited return.\n\nUnder this codification, the inner universe associated with love is divided into seven modes, or \"thinai\", five of which are geographical and associated with specific landscapes, and two of which are non-geographical and not associated with any specific landscape. Four of the geographical landscapes are described as being landscapes that occur naturally in the Tamil lands. These are: kuṟiñci (குறிஞ்சி) - mountainous regions, associated with union, mullai (முல்லை) - forests, associated with waiting, marutam (மருதம்) - cropland, associated with quarreling, and neytal (நெய்தல்) - seashore, associated with pining. The fifth - pālai (பாலை), or desert, associated with separation - is described in the \"Tolkappiyam\" as not being a naturally existing landscape.\n\nFrom these basic associations of landscape and subject, a wide range of specific themes suitable for each landscape were derived. Thus, for example, the commentary on the Iraiyanar Akapporul states that as a result of the association of the \"kuṟiñci\" landscape with union, it was also associated with the fear of separation, reassurance, the hero's or heroine's discussions with their friends, their being teased or taunted by their friends, their replies to their friends, the friends' role as intermediary, the meeting of the lovers, grief and doubt, and other similar themes. According to the \"Tamilneri vilakkam\", a 9th-century text on poetry, the love themes described by the five thinais constitute \"the Tamil way of life\" or \"the Tamil way of love.\" (\"tamiḻneṟi\")\n\nThe two non-geographical modes - \"kaikkilai\" and \"peruntiṇai\" - were seen as dealing with emotions that were non-conforming, and therefore were not associated with any specific landscape. \"Kaikkilai\", dealt with unreciprocated or one-sided love, while \"peruntiṇai\", dealt with 'improper' love or love against the rules of custom.\n\nIn Tamil, each of the five geographical thinais are named for a flower that is characteristic of that landscape. In English translation, however, it is customary to use the name of the landscape rather than that of the flower, largely because the flowers lack the cultural association with a specific language in English that they have in Tamil.\n\nThe mountain is the scene of the lovers' union at midnight. It is the cold, dewy season. The forest is rich with lakes, waterfalls, teak, bamboo and sandalwood. In this region millet grows and wild bees are a source of honey.\nLove in this setting is exemplified by Murugan, and one of his wives, Valli, the daughter of a mountain dweller. He wears the sparkling red kantal flower and rides a peacock, the bird of the mountains.\n\nThe name of the region, Kurinchi, is also the name of the famous Kurinji flower (Strobilanthes kunthiana) from the lofty hills of Tamil country. The Strobilanthes, a shrub whose brilliant white flowers blossom for only a few days once every ten or twelve years, blanketing the slopes in radiant whiteness under the sun. This event of jubilation and purity symbolizes the frenzy of a sudden love shared, in concert with the unleashed forces of nature: the amorous dance of peacocks, their echoing cries, the splash of waterfalls, the roar of savage beasts. The lovers hold each other tighter still and forget the dangers of the mountain path.\n\nMullai is the land of the forest. The forest is rich with lakes, waterfalls, teak, bamboo and sandalwood. In this region millet grows and wild bees are a source of honey. Mullai or Jasmine (Jasminum auriculatum) is the flower of the forests.\n\nThe theme of the forest and of shepherds at play, the image of confident waiting for the loved one, produced an original offshoot; for this is the region of Maayon ( Ancient Tamil god ), and the love theme it represents symbolizes the devotee waiting in the hope that Maayon will eventually come and fill his soul, thus experiencing the joys of expectation.\n\nThe plains were the scene of triangular love plots in which the hero's visits to the courtesan oblige the heroine to counter with a mixed show of coquetry and moodiness, tactics whose limits are described in the Thirukkural (\"Sulking is like flavouring with salt; a little suffices, but it is easy to go too far.\"). Indra, the god of thunderstorm, is the god of Marutham land.\n\nThe Marutam (Lagerstroemia speciosa) tree was the characteristic tree of this region.\n\nThe seashore affords many examples of the compelling charm of Sangam poetry and the extraordinary freshness of its realism. From behind the conventional symbolization of waiting there emerges a picture of the life of the fisherfolk; the nets and boats drawn up on the beach, scuttling crabs and cart wheels bogged down in the sand, the odour of drying fish, cut into thick slices, which attracts the birds, beautiful village girls peering through the Pandanus hedges, and the wind blowing through the cracks in the roughly constructed straw huts at night. Varuna, the water god, is worshiped in Neithal. \n\nWater lily is the characteristic flower of the region.\n\nIn classical Tamil prosody, the \"pālai\" or wasteland is not seen as being a naturally occurring ecology. Ilampuranar, in his commentary on the Tolkappiyam, explains that instead, the landscape of the wasteland with which the paalai is associated emerges when other landscapes whither under the heat of the burning sun.\n. Paalai could thus be seen as a mixture of Mullai and Kuṟiñci tracts, rather than as a mere sandy area.\n\nThe theme of wasteland and separation occupies half of one of the most famous anthologies, the theme of the mountain being only secondary.\n\nPaalai tree is identified as Wrightia (Wrightia tinctoria).\n\n"}
{"id": "423727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=423727", "title": "Scientific consensus", "text": "Scientific consensus\n\nScientific consensus is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the community of scientists in a particular field of study. Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily unanimity.\n\nConsensus is normally achieved through communication at conferences, the publication process, replication (reproducible results by others), and peer review. These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the 'normal' debates through which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation. On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the \"inside\" to the \"outside\" of the scientific community. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the consensus is can be quite straightforward.\n\nScientific consensus may be invoked in popular or political debate on subjects that are controversial within the public sphere but which may not be controversial within the scientific community, such as evolution, climate change, or the lack of a link between MMR vaccinations and autism.\n\nThere are many philosophical and historical theories as to how scientific consensus changes over time. Because the history of scientific change is extremely complicated, and because there is a tendency to project \"winners\" and \"losers\" onto the past in relation to our \"current\" scientific consensus, it is very difficult to come up with accurate and rigorous models for scientific change. This is made exceedingly difficult also in part because each of the various branches of science functions in somewhat different ways with different forms of evidence and experimental approaches.\n\nMost models of scientific change rely on new data produced by scientific experiment. Karl Popper proposed that since no amount of experiments could ever \"prove\" a scientific theory, but a single experiment could \"disprove\" one, science should be based on falsification. Whilst this forms a logical theory for science, it is in a sense \"timeless\" and does not necessarily reflect a view on how science should progress over time.\n\nAmong the most influential challengers of this approach was Thomas Kuhn, who argued instead that experimental data always provide some data which cannot fit completely into a theory, and that falsification alone did not result in scientific change or an undermining of scientific consensus. He proposed that scientific consensus worked in the form of \"paradigms\", which were interconnected theories and underlying assumptions about the nature of the theory itself which connected various researchers in a given field. Kuhn argued that only after the accumulation of many \"significant\" anomalies would scientific consensus enter a period of \"crisis\". At this point, new theories would be sought out, and eventually one paradigm would triumph over the old one – a series of paradigm shifts rather than a linear progression towards truth. Kuhn's model also emphasized more clearly the social and personal aspects of theory change, demonstrating through historical examples that scientific consensus was never truly a matter of pure logic or pure facts. However, these periods of 'normal' and 'crisis' science are not mutually exclusive. Research shows that these are different modes of practice, more than different historical periods.\n\nPerception of whether a scientific consensus exists on a given issue, and how strong that conception is, has been described as a \"gateway belief\" upon which other beliefs and then action are based.\n\nIn public policy debates, the assertion that there exists a consensus of scientists in a particular field is often used as an argument for the validity of a theory and as support for a course of action by those who stand to gain from a policy based on that consensus. Similarly arguments for a \"lack\" of scientific consensus are often encouraged by sides who stand to gain from a more ambiguous policy.\n\nFor example, the scientific consensus on the causes of global warming is that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. The historian of science Naomi Oreskes published an article in \"Science\" reporting that a survey of the abstracts of 928 science articles published between 1993 and 2003 showed none which disagreed explicitly with the notion of anthropogenic global warming. In an editorial published in \"The Washington Post\", Oreskes stated that those who opposed these scientific findings are amplifying the normal range of scientific uncertainty about any facts into an appearance that there is a great scientific disagreement, or a lack of scientific consensus. Oreskes's findings were replicated by other methods that require no interpretation.\n\nThe theory of evolution through natural selection is also supported by an overwhelming scientific consensus; it is one of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science. Opponents of evolution claim that there is significant dissent on evolution within the scientific community. The wedge strategy, a plan to promote intelligent design, depended greatly on seeding and building on public perceptions of absence of consensus on evolution.\n\nThe inherent uncertainty in science, where theories are never \"proven\" but can only be \"disproven\" (see falsifiability), poses a problem for politicians, policymakers, lawyers, and business professionals. Where scientific or philosophical questions can often languish in uncertainty for decades within their disciplinary settings, policymakers are faced with the problems of making sound decisions based on the currently available data, even if it is likely not a final form of the \"truth\". The tricky part is discerning what is close enough to \"final truth\". For example, social action against smoking probably came too long after science was 'pretty consensual'.\n\nCertain domains, such as the approval of certain technologies for public consumption, can have vast and far-reaching political, economic, and human effects should things run awry with the predictions of scientists. However, insofar as there is an expectation that policy in a given field reflect knowable and pertinent data and well-accepted models of the relationships between observable phenomena, there is little good alternative for policy makers than to rely on so much of what may fairly be called 'the scientific consensus' in guiding policy design and implementation, at least in circumstances where the need for policy intervention is compelling. While science cannot supply 'absolute truth' (or even its complement 'absolute error') its utility is bound up with the capacity to guide policy in the direction of increased public good and away from public harm. Seen in this way, the demand that policy rely only on what is proven to be \"scientific truth\" would be a prescription for policy paralysis and amount in practice to advocacy of acceptance of all of the quantified and unquantified costs and risks associated with policy inaction.\n\nNo part of policy formation on the basis of the ostensible scientific consensus precludes persistent review either of the relevant scientific consensus or the tangible results of policy. Indeed, the same reasons that drove reliance upon the consensus drives the continued evaluation of this reliance over time – and adjusting policy as needed.\n\n"}

His mother was Maria Pietrzkiewicz Witkiewiczowa. Both of his parents were born in the Samogitian region of Lithuania. His godmother was the internationally famous actress Helena Modrzejewska.\n\nWitkiewicz was reared at the family home in Zakopane. In accordance with his father's antipathy to the \"servitude of the school,\" the boy was home-schooled and encouraged to develop his talents across a range of creative fields. Against his fathers wishes he studied at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts with Józef Mehoffer and Jan Stanisławski.\n\nWitkiewicz was close friends with composer Karol Szymanowski and, from childhood, with Bronisław Malinowski and Zofia Romer. He had a tumultuous affair with well known actress Irena Solska who according to Anna Micińska is represented as the heroine Akne Montecalfi in his first novel, \"The 622 Downfalls of Bungo or The Demonic Woman\", 1911. According to Micińska he also represented himself as the character Bungo and Malinowski as the Duke of Nevermore. The novel, which was not published until 1972, also describes erotic encounters between Bungo and the Duke of Nevermore. It was during this period that he also began producing the intimate portrait photography for which he is known.\n\nIn 1914 following a crisis in Witkiewicz's personal life due to the suicide of his fiancée , he was invited by Malinowski to act as draftsman and photographer on his anthropological expedition to the then Territory of Papua, by way of Ceylon and Australia. The venture that was interrupted by the onset of World War I. After quarrelling with Malinowski in Australia, Witkiewicz who was by birth a subject of the Russian Empire, travelled to St Petersburg from Sydney and was commissioned as an officer in the Pavlovsky Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. His ailing father, a Polish patriot, was deeply grieved by the youngster's decision and died in 1915 without seeing his son again.\n\nIn July 1916 he was seriously wounded in the battle on Stokhid River in what is now Ukraine and was evacuated to St Petersburg where he witnessed the Russian Revolution. He claimed that he worked out his philosophical principles during an artillery barrage, and that when the Revolution broke out he was elected political commissar of his regiment. His later works would show his fear of social revolution and foreign invasion, often couched in absurdist language.\nHe had begun to support himself through portrait painting and continued to do so on his return to Zakopane in Poland. He soon entered into a major creative phase, setting out his principles in \"New Forms in Painting\" and \"Introduction to the Theory of Pure Form in the Theatre\". He associated with a group of \"formist\" artists in the early 1920s and wrote most of his plays during this period. Of about forty plays written by Witkiewicz between 1918 and 1925, twenty-one survive, and only \"Jan Maciej Karol Hellcat\" met with any public success during the author's lifetime. The original Polish manuscript of \"The Crazy Locomotive\" was also lost; the play, back-translated from two French versions, was not published until 1962.\nAfter 1925, and taking the name 'Witkacy', the artist ironically re-branded his portrait painting which provided his economic sustenance as \"The S.I. Witkiewicz Portrait Painting Company\", with the tongue in cheek motto: \"The customer must always be satisfied\". Several the so-called grades of portraits were offered, from the merely representational to the more expressionistic and the narcotics-assisted. Many of his paintings were annotated with mnemonics listing the drugs taken while painting a particular painting, even if this happened to be only a cup of coffee. He also varied the spelling of his name, signing himself \"Witkac, Witkatze, Witkacjusz, Vitkacius\" and \"Vitecasse\" — the last being French for \"breaks quickly\".\n\nIn the late 1920s he turned to novel-writing, writing two works, \"Farewell to Autumn\" and \"Insatiability\". The latter, his major work, encompasses geopolitics, psychoactive drugs, and philosophy. In 1935 he was awarded the Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature for his novels.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Witkiewicz published a text on his experiences of narcotics, including peyote, and pursued his interests in philosophy writing, \"Concepts and Principles Implied by the Concept of Existence\" 1935. He also promoted emerging writers such as Bruno Schulz.\n\nShortly after Poland was invaded by Germany in September 1939, Witkiewicz escaped with his young lover Czesława to the rural frontier town of Jeziory, in what was then eastern Poland. After hearing the news of the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Witkacy committed suicide on 18 September by taking a drug overdose and trying to slit his wrists. He convinced Czesława to attempt suicide with him by consuming Luminal, but she survived. The film \"Mystification\" 2010, written and directed by Jacek Koprowicz proposed that Witkiewicz faked his own death and lived secretly in Poland until the 1960s.\n\nWitkiewicz had died in some obscurity but his reputation began to rise soon after the war, which had destroyed his life and devastated Poland. Outside of Poland his work was discussed in Martin Esslin's influential \"Theatre of the Absurd\" 1961, and Hans-Theis Lehmann's \"Postdramatic Theatre\" 2006. Konstanty Puzyna collected his dramatic writings in two volumes in \"Dramaty\" 1962 which made his plays available to a wider Polish readership.\n\nCzesław Miłosz framed his argument in \"The Captive Mind\" around a discussion of Witkiewicz's novel, \"Insatiability\". The artist and theater director Tadeusz Kantor was inspired by the \"Cricot\" group, through which Witkiewicz had presented his final plays in Kraków. Kantor brought many of the plays back into currency, first in Poland and then internationally. Artist Paulina Olowska produced Witkiewicz's \"The Mother\" at the Tate Modern in 2015. Films which have Witkiewicz as the subject include \"Tumor Witkacego\" 1985 and \"Mystification\" 2010. Films based on his works include \"Ludiot i kalugericata\" 1968,\"Farewell to Autumn\" 1990, \"Insatiability\" 2003,\"Madame Tutli-Putli\" 2007 and \"Nursery Rhyme of a Madman\" 2017.\n\nWitkiewicz's paintings are in the collections of the National Museum, Warsaw, the National Museum, Kraków, Museum of Literature, Warsaw and the Museum of Central Pomerania with 125 works in Słupsk Castle. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney hold important examples of his photography.\n\nIn the postwar period, Communist Poland's Ministry of Culture decided to exhume Witkiewicz's body, move it to Zakopane, and give it a solemn funeral. This was carried out according to plan, though no one was allowed to open the coffin that had been delivered by the Soviet authorities.\n\nOn 26 November 1994, the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art ordered the exhumation of the presumed grave of Witkiewicz in Zakopane. Genetic tests on the remaining bones proved that the body had belonged to an unknown woman — a final absurdist joke, fifty years after the publication of Witkacy's last novel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father was an astrologist. Inspired by his parents, he started to learn to meditate when he was 3 years old. He grew up with two brothers and three sisters and soon spent most of his time in prayer and meditation. His father died when he was twelve and his mother sent him to meet his uncle, Swami Madhavananda, at the age of 13 in Nipal. Mangilal showed little interest in schoolwork, but constantly asked his uncle to make him a sannyasi.\n\nAfter some years Madhavananda granted his wish. Mangilal was prescribed strict yogic exercises and after six months of fasting and meditation he attained the state of self-realization (1962). He was initiated in the order of swamis in 1967. In 1972 he went to Europe and founded the Austrian-Indian Yoga-Vedanta fellowship in Vienna and the first Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram.\n\nThe guru lineage begins with Sri Alakh Puriji. He was the Guru of Sri Devpuriji. Sri Devpuriji was believed to be an incarnation of Shiva, by his disciples. He lived sometime in the 19-20th century in ashram in a village Kailash in Rajasthan, India.\n\nHis spiritual successor was named Sri Mahaprabhuji. Sri Mahaprabhuji was born in 1828 and died in 1963 and was therefore believed to be 135 years old at that time. As Sri Devpuriji, he also announced his departure and died in meditation posture after singing OM in the presence of his disciples. Sri Mahaprabhuji was believed to be an incarnation of Vishnu by his disciples and was thought to possess all 24 siddhis. He spent a lot of his life in an ashram built close to Bari Kathu in Rajasthan.\n\nSri Mahaprabhuji received the title of Paramhansa from Sri Shankaracharya of Shringhari Matha in Pushkar in the presence of Sri Shankaracharya of Puri.\n\nParamhans Swami Madhavananda spent on the side of Mahaprabhuji more than 20 years and with his permission wrote a book titled \"Lila Amrit\" about the lives of Sri Mahaprabhuji and Sri Devpuriji describing the many miracles they performed. Swami Madhavananda named Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda as his spiritual successor and died in 2003.\n\nThe main points of Maheshwarananda's teachings are physical, mental, social and spiritual health; respect for life; tolerance for all religions, cultures and nationalities; world peace; protection of human rights and values; protection of the environment and preservation of nature; selfless service, and care and love for all living things. According to his teachings, the realisation of these fundamental principles of life will lead man to spiritual development, self-realization, and realisation of God. Yoga is not a part of any religion, but all religions are part of Yoga, because Yoga is universal. Yoga is a religion in terms of relation between individual and cosmic self, that is God. It is not a religion in terms of today's understanding of the word religion. Yoga is a Universal principle which balances entire Universe, the space and the consciousness. There is only one religion, humanity. One should not change religion, but become a better Christian, a better Muslim... a better human according to their religion. Helping hands are worth more than praying hands.We can help the world peace by limiting our needs, reduce the use of plastics, become vegetarians and avoid drugs, especially alcohol, which can be considered as a devil in the form of liquid. Peace begins within one's own heart and charity within one's own home.\n\n\"Yoga in Daily Life, the System\" is a holistic and comprehensive system concerning body, mind, consciousness and soul. The system can't be described only as a religion or only as exercise. Yogic exercises are so called psychosomatic movements which can be adapted to any individual. The exercises have very old origin coming from ancient yogic scriptures. The system was developed with doctors, therapists and psychologists and is designed as a complete system in the yoga tradition, including all the main yoga paths:\n\n\nThe system was developed and organised into 8 levels by Swami Maheshwarananda. The goal of \"Yoga in Daily Life, the System\" is to create a program in which people can learn human responsibility towards the world and environment in which we are living; foster our compassion for all living beings; develop dormant hidden forces, and learn how to use them for the benefit of the world. The system can be lived and practised independently of age, social status, nationality and denomination. The system is an acknowledged diplomatic course in overseas (European) universities, and is taught in schools and hospitals for physical rehabilitation.\n\nSwamiji's books are published in 11 languages and thousands of non-profit centres of Yoga in Daily life are present in all five continents.\n\nThe International Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram Fellowship is a non-profit and non-denominational organisation seated in Vienna/Austria, at Schikanedergasse 12/13 (A-1040 Vienna). It was founded in 1990 by Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda to unite, under one organisation, the various associations of \"Yoga in daily life\" that are scattered across the world. The fellowship has a member association in Roster Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC).\n\nIn 1990 Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda also laid the foundation stone of a project referred to as \"Om Ashram\" with the full name Om Vishwa Deep Gurukul, Swami Maheshwarananda Education & Research Center. The center is located on in the Jadan district of Rajasthan in the form of ancient symbol OM. Once completed, it would be the largest man-made symbol of OM in the world. Since 2003, the Om Ashram is also the Mahasamadhi Shrine (tomb) of his guru Dharmasamrat Paramhans Swami Madhavananda.\n\nAnother his initiative is the Sri Swami Madhavananda World Peace Council which has been established as a non-governmental, humanitarian and charitable society. The feature event of the Sri Madhavananda World Peace Council is the \"World Peace Summit\" (WPS) which met for several years in different countries with the aim to discuss a special topic (religious dialogue, humanitarian projects... ) to support world peace. The events brought together a large gathering of politicians, scientists and general public.\n\nLatest initiative by Swami Maheshwaranandaji \"Save the Birds\" would like to bring broader attention to the problem of birds live being endangered.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41755964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41755964", "title": "Tanmatras", "text": "Tanmatras\n\nTanmatra (Sanskrit: तन्मात्र) is a noun which means – rudimentary or subtle element, merely that, mere essence, potential or only a trifle. There are five sense perceptions – hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell, and there are the five tanmatras corresponding to the five sense perceptions and five sense-organs. The tanmatras combine and re-combine in different ways to produce the gross elements – earth, water, fire, air and ether, which make up the gross universe perceived by the senses. The senses play their part by coming into contact with the objects, and carry impressions of them to the manas which receives and arranges them into a precept.\n\nThe Samkhya school propounded by Rishi Kapila holds the five tanmatras or principle ideas as the essential elements that are the primordial causes of the five substantial elements of physical manifestation. The five substantial elements of the physical world are – ether (Akasha), air (Vayu), fire (Agni or Taijasa), water (Ap) and earth (Prithvi) in the order of their development, these are the five Bhutas from whose unlimited combination everything results including the living bodies which are material forms living in space and time. According to the Vedic theory of creation, the tanmatras are the basis of all corporeal existences because from them evolve the Bhutas, the building blocks of the perceptible universe.\n\nCharaka speaks of seven dhatus (components, elementary substances) - the five gross elements (bhutas) and Chetna or Purusha. Purusha (Creative force) and Prakṛti (Nature) are counted as one but there are twenty-four categories of elementary substances – the five cognitive and the five conative senses, the five objects of senses, and the eight-fold Prakrti viz. Prakrti (Nature), Mahat (great, eminent), Ahamkara (Ego) and the five elements. The Manas (conscience, mind) which remains in touch with these twenty-four categories, works through the senses and the two movements of manas are – indeterminate sensing (uha) and conceiving (vichara) before definite understanding (buddhi) arises. The five elements variously combine to produce the senses. All living beings are made up of the conglomeration of the sense-objects (gross matter), the ten senses, manas, the five subtle bhutas and Prakrti, Mahat and Ahamkara; cognition, pleasure, pain, ignorance, life, death, karmas and fruits of karmas belong to this conglomeration. By ignorance, will, antipathy, and work the conglomeration of Purusha with the elements takes place producing knowledge, feeling or action. The Atman is the illuminator of cognition. The avyakta (undifferentiated), a part of Prakrti, is identified with Purusha; this avyakta is the same as chetana from which is derived Buddhi (intellectual faculty) and from buddhi is derived Ahamkara, from Ahamkara are derived the five elements and the five senses and creation is said to have taken place. Ahamkara as Sattvika gives rise to the senses and as Tamasa to the Tanmatras and both these are held up in Mahat. Pancasikha calls the ultimate truth avyakta in the state of Purusha, and that consciousness is due to the conditions of the conglomeration of the mind-body complex and the element of cetas, the phenomena which though mutually independent are not the self, the renunciation of the perceived and imperceptible phenomena results in moksa (liberation). Vijnanabhiksu holds that both separation of Ahamkara and evolution of tanmatras take place in the Mahat. The pure cit (intellect) is neither illusory nor an abstraction, though concrete it is transcendent. The state in which the tamas succeeds in overcoming sattva aspect preponderant in Buddhi is called Bhutadi. Bhutadi and rajas generate the tanmatras, the immediately preceding causes of the gross elements.\n\nPurusha and Prakrti are non-evolutes, they are eternal and unchanging. From the union of these two non-evolutes evolves Buddhi (associated with knowing), from Buddhi evolves Ahamkara (associated with willing), from Ahamkara evolves Manas (associated with feeling), Jnanenriyas (five sense-capacities), karmendriyas (five action-capacities) and Tanmatras (five subtle elements) from which conglomeration evolve the Mahabhutas (five gross elements); the nearness of Purusha disturbs Prakrti, alters the equilibrium of the three Gunas – Sattva (illumination), Rajas (stimulating and dynamic) and Tamas (indifferent, heavy and inactive) whose combination of attributes determines the nature of all derivative principles enumerated by Samkhya, triggers the causal chains and facilitates evolution. Primordial materiality does not manifest itself; it is manifested through the evolutes.\n\nThe tanmatras, the subtle matter, vibratory, impingent, radiant, instinct with potential energy and collocations of original mass units with unequal distributions of original energy, evolve out of the Bhutadi which is only an intermediate state. They have some mass and the energy and physical characteristics like penetrability, powers of impact, radiant heat and viscous attraction etc., and have effect on the sense after assuming the form of paramanus or atoms of the Bhutas (the created ones) which process is Tattavantraparinama or primary evolution. In evolution the total energy always remains the same redistributed between causes and effects, the totality of effects exists in the totality of causes in the potential form. The collocations and regroupings of the three Gunas (attribute or property) induce more differentiated evolutes; they constitute the changes leading to evolutions i.e. from cause to effect, which process is based on Satkaryavada, the doctrine the effect is existent in the cause even before the causal process has started to produce the effect operating in accordance with the two laws of conservation of matter and energy.\n\nThe suksma bhutas combine in different proportions with the radical as its material cause and other bhutas as the efficient cause to form the Mahabhutas; atoms and suksma bhutas cannot exist in the phenomenal state in an uncombined form. Two panus or paramanus (atoms) combine as a result of parispanda (rotary or vibratory motion) to form a dvyanuka (molecule), three of these dvyanukas combine to form a tryanuka, and so on till heavier metals are formed. Except akasha, all other tanmatras have attributes of the previous ones in the succeeding ones. The tanmatras are quanta of energy. The total sattwik aspects of the five tanmatras combine to form the antah-karana or inner-instrument consisting of manas, buddhi, citta and ahamkara; the individual sattwik aspects of tanmatras combine to produce the jnana-indriyas consisting of the five sense organs of perception. The total rajasik aspects of tanmatras of the five tanmatras combine to form the five pranas – prana, apna, vyana, udana and samana; the individual rajasik aspects of tanmatras combine to produce the five organs of action. The individual tamasik aspects of the five tanmatras combine to form the elements that make up the world.\n\nFrom the subtle elements are formed the gross elements through the process of Panchikarana.\n\nVijnanabhiksu states that the tanmatras exist only in unspecialized forms as the indeterminate state of matter which the yogins alone can perceive. The five tanmatras - akasa associated with ether or space, sabda associated with air, sparsha associated with tejas, ap and rasa associated with kshiti, generate the paramanus in which they partly exist as tanmatravayava or trasarenu which Vaiseshika anus Vijnanbhiksu in his Yoga-vartikka states are the Gunas, and that in the tanmatras there exists the specific differentiation that constitutes the tanmatras. The formation of bhutas through tattvantra-parinama is followed by dharmaparinama or evolution by change of qualities. In the production of a thing, the different gunas do not choose to different independent course, but join together and effectuate themselves in the evolution of a single product. The appearance of a thing is only an explicit aspect of the selfsame thing – the atoms, quality is a nature of substance and any change in substance is owing to changed qualities. Lakshana-parinama aspect of the change in appearance refers to the three different moments of the same thing according to its different characters as unmanifested or manifested or manifested in the past but conserved; it is in the avastha-parinama aspect of that change that a substance is called new or old, grown or decayed.\n\nSankara and Ramanuja, the theological commentators on the Upanishads have understood the elements as meaning deities and not the elements proper. The Upanishads hold the impossibility of the generation of anything from out of Nothingness or Not-being and explain the genesis from Life-force or Cosmic-force but to finally aver that all creation is only an illusion or appearance. The first created Rayi and Prana mentioned by Pippalada refer to matter and spirit. That Brahman is the non-dual reality can only be known by the process of differentiation from the five elements, differentiation is necessary to separate Brahman from the elements which make up the perceived world. As creation means the appearance of names and forms, names and forms cannot exist before creation. Also, difference between objects of the same class can have no reference to Sat, for nothing else exists, and to speak of difference from a thing which does not exist conveys no meaning. Vidyaranya explains (Panchadasi III.27) that:\n\nan object which the senses can perceive can be compared, but an object which is beyond perception can only be imagined, and the object which is the subject of perception cannot be an object of the senses.\n"}

{"id": "342419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342419", "title": "Yi Hwang", "text": "Yi Hwang\n\nYi Hwang (1501–1570) is one of the two most prominent Korean Confucian scholars of the Joseon Dynasty, the other being his younger contemporary Yi I (Yulgok). A key figure of the Neo-Confucian literati, he established the Yeongnam School and set up the Dosan Seowon, a private Confucian academy. Yi Hwang is often referred to by his pen name Toegye (\"Retreating Creek\"). His courtesy name was Gyeongho.\n\nYi Hwang was born in Ongye-ri, Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, in 1501. He belonged to the Jinseong Yi clan, and was the youngest son among eight children. A child prodigy, he learned the Analects of Confucius from his uncle at age twelve and admiring the poetry of Tao Qian, started writing poetry. His poem \"Yadang\" (hangul:야당, hanja:野塘, \"Pond in the Wild\"), written at the age of eighteen, is considered one of his major works. Around the age of twenty, he immersed himself in the study of I Ching and Neo-Confucianism.\n\nHe came to Seoul when he was 23 years old and entered the national academy Sungkyunkwan in 1523. In 1527 he passed preliminary exams to become a government official, but re-entered Sungkyunkwan at the age of 33 and socialized with the scholar Kim In-hu. He passed the civil service exams with top honors in 1534 and continued his scholarly pursuits whilst working for the government. He returned to his childhood home at the death of his mother at the age of 37 and mourned her for 3 years. He was appointed various positions from the age of 39 and sometimes held multiple positions including secret royal inspector, or \"Amhaengeosa\" (hangul:암행어사, hanja:暗行御史), in 1542. His integrity made him relentless as he took part in purges of corrupt government officials. On numerous occasions he was even exiled from the capital for his firm commitment to principle.\n\nYi Hwang was disillusioned by the power struggles and discord in the royal court during the later years of King Jungjong's reign and left political office. However, he was continuously brought out of retirement and held several positions away from the royal court and in rural areas. He was the governor of Danyang at 48 and governor of Punggi afterwards. During his days at Pungi he redeveloped and improved the private Neo-Confucian academy Baekundong Seowon established by his predecessor Ju Se-bung.\n\nHe was named \"Daesaseong\" (대사성, head instructor) of Sungkyunkwan in 1552 but turned down other prominent offices later on. In 1560, he established the \"Dosan seodang\" and engrossed himself in meditation, study, and teaching his disciples. King Myeongjong tried to coax him back to political office, but he was steadfast in his devotion to study. He finally returned to the royal court at 67 upon the king's request when envoys from the Ming Dynasty came to Seoul. When King Myeongjong suddenly died, his successor King Seonjo appointed Yi Hwang as \"Yejo panseo\"(hangul:예조판서, hanja:禮曹判書, minister of rites) but he declined and returned to his home once again.\n\nHowever, the king continuously called Yi Hwang back and unable to refuse further, he resumed office at the age of 68 and wrote many advisory documents including \"Seonghak sipdo\" (hangul:성학십도, hanja:聖學十圖, \"Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning\"). He also gave lectures from the teachings of Song Dynasty Confucian scholars Cheng Yi and Cheng Hao, I Ching, Analects, and Zhang Zai in royal presence. He finally retired from politics at the age of 70 and died in 1570.\n\nDuring forty years of public life he served four kings (Jungjong, Injong, Myeongjong and Seonjo). On his death, Yi Hwang was posthumously promoted to the highest ministerial rank, and his mortuary tablet housed in a Confucian shrine as well as in the shrine of King Seonjo. His disciples and followers reorganized the \"Dosan seodang\" to Dosan Seowon in 1574.\n\nYi Hwang was the author of many books on Confucianism. He followed the dualistic Neo-Confucianism teachings of Chu Hsi, which views \"i\" (Chinese \"li\") and \"gi\" (Chinese \"qi\") as the forces of foundation of the universe. Yi Hwang placed emphasis on the \"i\", the formative element, as the existential force that determines \"gi\". This school of thought contrasted with the school that focused on the concrete element of \"gi\", established by Yi Hwang's counterpart Yi I. Understanding the determinative pattern of \"i\" would be more essential in understanding the universe than recognizing the principles that govern individual manifestations of \"gi\". This approach of placing importance on the role of \"i\" became the core of the Yeongnam School, where Yi Hwang's legacy was carried on by prominent figures such as Yu Seong-ryong and Kim Seong-il.\n\nYi Hwang was also talented in calligraphy and poetry, writing a collection of \"sijo\", a three line poetic form popular with the literati of the Joseon period.\n\nYi Hwang's published writings encompass 496 works in 764 publications in 4 languages and 5167 library holdings \n\n\nThe Neo-Confucian literature of \"Seonghaksipdo\" was composed by Yi Hwang in 1568 for King Seonjo. It is a series of lectures for rulers through examples of past sages. Traditional Confucians had affirmed that any man could learn to become a sage; the new Confucians made the ideal of sagehood real and attainable, just as enlightenment was for Buddhists. Yi Hwang intended to present that path by starting each chapter with a diagram and related text drawn from Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) or another leading authority, and concluding with a brief commentary. He intended for “Ten Diagrams” to be made into a ten paneled standing screen, as well as a short book, so that the mind of the viewer could be constantly engaged with its contents, until it totally assimilated the material.\n\nToegyero, a street in central Seoul, is named after him, and he is depicted on the South Korean 1,000 won note. The Taekwondo pattern Toi-Gye was named in honor of Yi Hwang.\n\nMany institutes and university research departments devoted to Yi Hwang have been established. The Toegye Studies Institute set up in Seoul in 1970, Kyungpook National University's Toegye Institute opened in 1979, and an institute and library in Dankook University in 1986. There are research institutes in Tokyo, Taiwan, Hamburg and the United States.\n\n\n"}
