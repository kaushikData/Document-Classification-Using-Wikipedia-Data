Gibson, coined the term in his 1966 book, \"The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems\", and it occurs in many of his earlier essays (e.g.). However, his best-known definition is taken from his seminal 1979 book, \"The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception\":\n\nThe original definition in psychology includes all transactions that are possible between an individual and their environment. When the concept was applied to design, it started also referring to only those physical action possibilities of which one is aware.\n\nThe word is used in a variety of fields: perceptual psychology, cognitive psychology, environmental psychology, industrial design, human–computer interaction (HCI), interaction design, user-centered design, communication studies, instructional design, science, technology and society (STS), sports science and artificial intelligence.\n\nPsychologist James J. Gibson developed the concept of affordance over many years, culminating in his final book \"The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception\" in 1979. He defined an affordance as what the environment provides or furnishes the animal. Notably, Gibson compares an affordance with an ecological niche emphasizing the way niches characterize how an animal lives in its environment. An affordance is independent of an individual's ability to recognize it or even take advantage of it, and so, should not be confused with a privately perceived world or a phenomenology of perception. The key to understanding affordance is that it is relational and characterizes the suitability of the environment to the observer, and so, depends on their current intentions and their capabilities. For instance, a set of steps which rises four feet high does not afford climbing to the crawling infant, yet might provide rest to a tired adult or the opportunity to move to another floor for an adult who wished to reach an alternative destination. This notion of intention/needs is critical to an understanding of affordance, as it explains how the same aspect of the environment can provide different affordances to different people, and even to the same individual at another point in time. As Gibson puts it, “Needs control the perception of affordances (selective attention) and also initiate acts.” Gibson's is the prevalent definition in cognitive psychology.\n\nAccording to Gibson, humans tend to alter and modify their environment so as to change its affordances to better suit them. On his view, humans change the environment to make it easier to live in (even if making it harder for other animals to live in it): to keep warm, to see at night, to rear children, and to move around. This tendency to change the environment is natural to humans, and Gibson argues that it is a mistake to treat the social world apart from the material world or the tools apart from the natural environment. He points out that manufacturing was originally done by hand as a kind of manipulation.\n\nGibson argues that learning to perceive an affordance is an essential part of socialization. The theory of affordances introduces a \"value-rich ecological object\". Affordances cannot be described within the value-neutral language of physics, but rather introduces notions of benefits and injuries to someone. An affordance captures this beneficial/injurious aspect of objects and relates them to the animal for whom they are well/ill-suited. During childhood development, a child learns to perceive not only the affordances for the self, but also how those same objects furnish similar affordances to another. A child can be introduced to the conventional meaning of an object by manipulating which objects command attention and demonstrating how to use the object through performing its central function. By learning how to use an artifact, a child “enters into the shared practices of society” as when they learn to use a toilet or brush their teeth. And so, by learning the affordances, or conventional meaning of an artifact, children learn the artifact's social world and further, become a member of that world.\n\nAffordances were further studied by Eleanor J. Gibson, wife of James J. Gibson, who created her theory of perceptual learning around this concept. Her book, \"An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development\", explores affordances further.\n\nJakob von Uexküll had already discussed the concept in the early twentieth century, calling it the \"functional tinting\" (') of organisms with respect to stimuli.\n\nAnderson, Yamagishi and Karavia (2002) found that merely looking at an object primes the human brain to perform the action the object affords.\n\nIn 1988, Donald Norman appropriated the term \"affordances\" in the context of human–machine interaction to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor. This new definition of \"action possibilities\" has now become synonymous with Gibson's work, although Gibson himself never made any reference to action possibilities in any of his writing. Through Norman's book \"The Design of Everyday Things\", this interpretation was popularized within the fields of HCI, interaction design, and user-centered design. It makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. If an actor steps into a room containing an armchair and a softball, Gibson's original definition of affordances allows that the actor may throw the chair and sit on the ball, because this is objectively possible. Norman's definition of (perceived) affordances captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the armchair and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman's affordances \"suggest\" how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size, shape and weight of a softball make it perfect for throwing by humans, and it matches their past experience with similar objects. The focus on perceived affordances is much more pertinent to practical design problems , which may explain its widespread adoption.\n\nNorman later explained that this restriction of the term's meaning had been unintended, and that he would replace it by \"perceived affordance\" in any future revision of the book. However, the definition from his book has been widely adopted in HCI and interaction design, and both meanings are now commonly used in these fields.\n\nFollowing Norman's adaptation of the concept, \"affordance\" has seen a further shift in meaning where it is used as an uncountable noun, referring to the easy discoverability of an object or system's action possibilities, as in \"this button has good affordance\". This in turn has given rise to a use of the verb \"afford\" – from which Gibson's original term was derived – that is not consistent with its dictionary definition (to provide or make available): designers and those in the field of HCI often use \"afford\" as meaning \"to suggest\" or \"to invite\".\n\nThe different interpretations of affordances, although closely related, can be a source of confusion in writing and conversation if the intended meaning is not made explicit and if the word is not used consistently. Even authoritative textbooks can be inconsistent in their use of the term.\n\nWhen affordances are used to describe information and communications technology (ICT) an analogy is created with everyday objects with their attendant features and functions. Yet, ICT's features and functions derive from the product classifications of its developers and designers. This approach emphasizes an artifact’s convention to be wholly located in how it was designed to be used. In contrast, affordance theory draws attention to the fit of the technology to the activity of the user and so lends itself to studying how ICTs may be appropriated by users or even misused. One meta-analysis reviewed the evidence from a number of surveys about the extent to which the Internet is transforming or enhancing community. The studies showed that the internet is used for connectivity locally as well as globally, although the nature of its use varies in different countries. It found that internet use is adding on to other forms of communication, rather than replacing them.\n\nWilliam Gaver divided affordances into three categories: perceptible, hidden, and false.\n\n\nThis means that, when affordances are perceptible, they offer a direct link between perception and action, and, when affordances are hidden or false, they can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings.\n\n\nAnd by \n\n"}

Later philosophers connected this plane to the idea of goodness, beauty, and then the Christian God.\n\nVarious observers have also argued that the experience of beauty is evidence of the existence of a universal God. Depending on the observer, this might include artificially beautiful things like music or art, natural beauty like landscapes or astronomical bodies, or the elegance of abstract ideas like the laws of mathematics or physics.\n\nThe best-known defender of the aesthetic argument is Richard Swinburne.\n\nThe argument from beauty has two aspects. The first is connected with the independent existence of what philosophers term a \"universal\" (see Universal (metaphysics) and also Problem of universals). Plato argued that particular examples of, say a circle, all fall short of the perfect exemplar of a circle that exists outside the realm of the senses as an eternal Idea. Beauty for Plato is a particularly important type of universal. Perfect beauty exists only in the eternal Form of beauty (see Platonic epistemology). For Plato the argument for a timeless idea of beauty does not involve so much whether the gods exist (Plato was not a monotheist) but rather whether there is an immaterial realm independent and superior to the imperfect world of sense. Later Greek thinkers such as Plotinus (c. 204/5–270 CE) expanded Plato's argument to support the existence of a totally transcendent \"One\", containing no parts. Plotinus identified this \"One\" with the concept of \"Good\" and the principle of \"Beauty\". Christianity adopted this Neo-Platonic conception and saw it as a strong argument for the existence of a supreme God. In the early fifth century, for example, Augustine of Hippo discusses the many beautiful things in nature and asks \"Who made these beautiful changeable things, if not one who is beautiful and unchangeable?\" This second aspect is what most people today understand as the argument from beauty.\n\nA contemporary British philosopher of religion, Richard Swinburne, known for philosophical arguments about the existence of God, advocates a variation of the argument from beauty:\n\nThe most frequent invocation of the argument from beauty today involves the aesthetic experience one obtains from great literature, music or art. In the concert hall or museum one can easily feel carried away from the mundane. For many people this feeling of transcendence approaches the religious in intensity. It is a commonplace to regard concert halls and museums as the cathedrals of the modern age because they seem to translate beauty into meaning and transcendence.\n\nDostoevsky was a proponent of the transcendent nature of beauty. His enigmatic statement: \"Beauty will save the world\" is frequently cited. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his Nobel Prize lecture reflected upon this phrase:\n\nIn his book, \"The God Delusion\", Richard Dawkins describes the argument thus:\n\nExactly what role to attribute to beauty in mathematics and science is hotly contested, see Philosophy of mathematics. The argument from beauty in science and mathematics is an argument for philosophical realism against nominalism. The debate revolves around the question, \"Do things like scientific laws, numbers and sets have an independent 'real' existence outside individual human minds?\". The argument is quite complex and still far from settled. Scientists and philosophers often marvel at the congruence between nature and mathematics. In 1960 the Nobel Prize–winning physicist and mathematician Eugene Wigner wrote an article entitled \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\". He pointed out that \"the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational explanation for it.\" In applying mathematics to understand the natural world, scientists often employ aesthetic criteria that seem far removed from science. Einstein once said that \"the only physical theories that we are willing to accept are the beautiful ones.\" Conversely, beauty can sometimes be misleading; Thomas Huxley wrote that \"Science is organized common sense, where many a beautiful theory was killed by an ugly fact.\"\n\nWhen developing hypotheses, scientists use beauty and elegance as valuable selective criteria. The more beautiful a theory, the more likely is it to be true. The mathematical physicist Hermann Weyl said with evident amusement, \"My work has always tried to unite the true with the beautiful and when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful.\" The quantum physicist Werner Heisenberg wrote to Einstein, \"You may object that by speaking of simplicity and beauty I am introducing aesthetic criteria of truth, and I frankly admit that I am strongly attracted by the simplicity and beauty of the mathematical schemes which nature presents us.\"\n\nThe argument implies beauty is something immaterial instead of being a subjective neurological response to stimuli. Philosophers since Immanuel Kant increasingly argue that beauty is an artifact of individual human minds. A 'beautiful' sunset is according to this perspective aesthetically neutral in itself. It is our cognitive response that interprets it as 'beautiful.' Others would argue that this cognitive response has been developed through the evolutionary development of the brain and its exposure to particular stimuli over long ages. Others point to the existence of evil and various types of ugliness as invalidating the argument. Joseph McCabe, a freethought writer of the early 20th century, questioned the argument in \"The Existence of God\", when he asked whether God also created parasitic microbes.\n\nBertrand Russell had no trouble seeing beauty in mathematics but he did not see it as a valid argument for the existence of God. In the Study of Mathematics, he wrote: \"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.\" However, he also wrote: \"My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true. Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny. The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity.\" H. L. Mencken stated that humans have created things of greater beauty when he wrote, \"I also pass over the relatively crude contrivances of this Creator in the aesthetic field, wherein He has been far surpassed by man, as, for example, for adroitness of design, for complexity or for beauty, the sounds of an orchestra.\"\n\nRichard Dawkins summarises the argument as: \"How dare another human being make such beautiful music/poetry/art when I can't? It must be God that did it\".\n\n"}

From 2006 to 2011, he served as the George F. Kennan Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\n\nAvishai Margalit grew up in Jerusalem. He was educated in Jerusalem and did his army service in the airborne Nahal. In 1960 he started his studies at the Hebrew University, majoring in philosophy and economics. He earned his B.A. in 1963 and his M.A. in philosophy in 1965, his M.A. thesis focusing on Karl Marx's theory of labor. During his years of study he worked as an instructor in a youth village, working with immigrant children who arrived with the mass wave of immigration in the 1950s. Thanks to a British Council scholarship he went to Queens College in Oxford University, where he stayed from 1968 to 1970. His doctoral dissertation, \"The Cognitive Status of Metaphors\", written under the supervision of Professor Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, earned him his Ph.D \"summa cum laude\" 1970 from the Hebrew University.\n\nAlso in 1970, he started teaching as an assistant professor at the philosophy department of the Hebrew University where he stayed throughout his academic career, climbing the ladder of academic promotions. In 1998-2006 he was appointed the Shulman Professor of Philosophy, and in 2006 he retired as a professor emeritus from the Hebrew University. Since 2006 Margalit has been the George Kennan Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He is also a member of the Center for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University.\n\nAvishai Margalit was a visiting Scholar at Harvard University (1974-5); a Visiting Fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford (1979–80); a Visiting Professor at the Free University of Berlin and a Fellow at the Max Planck Institute, Berlin (1984-5);\na Visiting Fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford (1990); a Rockefeller Fellow at the Center for Human Values, Princeton University (1995-6), a Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York (2001–2002) and Senior Fellow at the Global Law Program at NYU (2004-5). In addition, he held short-term visiting professorships at the Central European University in Prague and at the European University in Florence.\n\nIn 1999 Avishai Margalit delivered the Horkheimer Lectures at the University of Frankfurt, on The Ethics of Memory. In 2001-2002 he delivered the inaugural lectures at Oxford University as the first Bertelsman Professor there. In 2005 he delivered the Tanner Lectures at Stanford University.\nMargalit was among the founders of the \"Moked\" political party in 1973 and contributed to the writing of its platform. In 1975 he participated in the founding of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace, and in 1978 he belonged to the first group of leaders of Peace Now.\n\nIn addition, in the 1990s Margalit served on the board of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories.\n\nSince 1984, Avishai Margalit has been a frequent contributor to the New York Review of Books (NYRB),\n\nwhere he published articles on social, cultural and political issues; his political profiles included Yitzhak Rabin, Ariel Sharon, Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres, as well as cultural-philosophical profiles of thinkers like Baruch Spinoza, Martin Buber and Yeshayahu Leibowitz. A collection of his NYRB articles was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, under the title Views in Review: Politics and Culture in the State of the Jews (1998).\n\nAvishai Margalit was married to Edna Ullman-Margalit, a professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University. She died in October 2010. He has four children and lives in Jerusalem.\n\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018.\n\nAvishai Margalit's early research topics included the philosophy of language and of logic, general analytical philosophy and the concept of rationality. Gradually he shifted toward social and political philosophy, the philosophy of religion and culture, and the philosophical implications of social and cognitive psychology.\n\nIn the introduction to his book \"The Ethics of Memory\", Margalit offers a distinction between \"i.e. philosophy\" and \"e.g. philosophy\". The idea is to distinguish between explicating philosophy, based on conceptual analysis, and exemplifying philosophy, which focuses on real-life examples from history or literature. Without judging between the two, Margalit adopts the second approach. Most of his work since the 1990s reflects this approach to the analysis of philosophical questions.\n\nIn contrast to many in the philosophical tradition, who tend to accompany their abstract philosophical discussion with examples that are intentionally artificial or trivial, Margalit often starts from historical examples, whose richness and complexity precede their theoretical conceptualization. Through analyzing these examples he gradually builds up concepts and distinctions that serve him as the philosophical tools needed for the understanding of the phenomena he investigates.\n\nThus, for example, in his Ethics of Memory he uses the case of an officer who forgets the name of one of his subordinate soldiers who was killed in a heroic battle, as a test-case for discussing the issue of the moral responsibility that attaches to memory, on the one hand, and of the centrality of names in constituting memory, on the other. He also poses the following dilemma: were you a painter, would you prefer your paintings to survive you after your death, even if your name will be forgotten, or would you rather have your name remembered even if none of your paintings survive. Margalit's way of philosophizing reflects historical, literary and cultural insights and concerns that are not ordinarily encountered in philosophical discussions.\n\nWritten jointly with Margalit's doctoral student Moshe Halbertal,\ncurrently a professor of philosophy both at the Hebrew University and at NYU, the book presents the history of the notion of idolatry and discusses its religious and ideological significance and ramifications. Based largely on the philosophy of language and on the philosophy of Wittgenstein (whom Margalit had studied for many years), the book argues that the critique of ideology finds its first expression in the critique of idolatry. Idolatry, on this view, is not just an error but a sinful error; as such it makes the idolaters miss their life's purposes. Bacon's critique of the tribal gods, and the critique of political ideology in the sense Marx used it, are shown to be the continuation of this move concerning the attitude toward the sinful and sin-causing error.\n\nFrom Plato on, political philosophy has dealt with the question of the just society, but not with the question of the decent society. In this book,\n\nMargalit argues that the pursuit of decency, understood primarily in terms of the absence of humiliation, takes precedence over the pursuit of the ideal of justice.\n\nA decent society, in Margalit's view, is a society whose institutions do not humiliate its members. He presents the logical, moral and cognitive reasons for choosing \"philosophica negativa\": it is not justice that brings us to politics but injustice – the avoidance of evil rather than the pursuit of the good. In contrast to the elusiveness of the abstract notion of human dignity, the phenomenon of humiliation is tangible and instantly recognizable; so too is the notion of evil associated with it.\n\nIn essence, Margalit argues that the ideal of the decent, non-humiliating society is not only more urgent but also a more realistic and achievable ideal than that of the just society. He examines the essential manifestations of the decent society: respect for privacy, full citizenship, full employment, and resisting the trend to replace mechanisms of just distribution with organs of welfare and charity. In the second part of the book Margalit gives an account of institutions that are in particular danger of generating humiliation, like prisons, the security services, the army, and the media.\n\nTo a large extent because of its discussion of the idea of humiliation, Margalit's book has become a major source for the study of the notions of human dignity and human respect, which constitute the cornerstones of contemporary ethics, politics and legal theory. The book offers a deep analysis of the entire semantic field of the notions of dignity, respect, self-respect, honor, esteem, and their cognates. Margalit presents a \"skeptical\" solution to the question of human dignity. Rather than attempting to tie it to a particular characteristic shared by all humans and intrinsically worthy of respect (an attempt he believes has failed in the history of philosophy), Margalit proposes to turn this explanation on its head: the practice of according humans respect, he suggests, precedes the idea of human dignity as a character trait. This move does not evade the problem of human dignity, Margalit argues, but rather it points the way toward salvaging it from the futile and inconclusive metaphysical analysis.\n\nThe book\n\ntakes up the question of the duties of memory. While fundamental in the Jewish tradition, the obligation to remember (\"zachor\") is rarely brought up in philosophical discussions. In general, memory is not regarded as a moral concern: people remember or forget as a matter of fact, and since normally we do not control our memory, theories of ethics do not consider memory a duty. In this book, Margalit explores the evaluative and ethical dimensions of memory both in the private and in the collective spheres.\n\nThe question whether we are under a moral obligation to remember (or to forget) certain things is discussed in the book in light of a central distinction Margalit introduces, between ethics and morality. Duties of memory exist, he claims, with regard to our ethical relationships, namely the \"thick\" relationships we have with the members of our tribe, family, nation and circle of friends – namely, those with whom we have a shared history. Without memory there is no community; memory is a constitutive element in the making of a community.\n\nOur moral relationships, on the other hand, are \"thin\". Morality regulates the relationships we have with others who are strangers to us and to whom nothing more concrete ties us than our shared humanity. Regarding our moral relationships, Margalit contends, there are no obligations to remember.\n\nOne of Margalit's central theses in the book is that a \"community of memory\", as a political concept, is more significant and weighty than the notion of the nation. Memory forms a large part of our relationships, and a faulty memory damages the quality or strength of our thick relationships. In addition to the large question of the duty to remember, the book takes up a variety of other questions like what is a moral witness, what is a community of memory, how do we remember feelings (as distinct from moods), what is the proper relationship between remembering and forgetting, does remembering aid forgiving or does it rather hinder it, and more. Margalit believes that memory is the key to our ethical relationships, and that communities of memory are built upon a network of divisions of labor for the different representations of memory. These networks are constituted, in part, of particular people who remember the past and whose job it is to deal with it, like historians, archivists and journalists, and also of the idea that the large social network connects us all.\n\nThis book, written jointly with the writer and journalist Ian Buruma,\n\noriginated in a 2002 article in the New York Review of Books.\nOccidentalism is a worldview that influences many, often conflicting, ideologies. As a view about the West and about Western civilization, it is infused with strong elements of de-humanization: the western man, on this view, is a machine-like creature. He is efficient yet soul-less, emotionally obtuse and led by a perverse value system.\nThe novelty in the book is its claim that the occidental worldview is itself rooted in the West. It emerges, the authors argue, out of the Romantic Movement, especially in its German version, later to be taken up by the Slavophil movement. In the 20th century it can be traced to fascism – prominently in its German and Japanese varieties – on the one hand, and to communist Maoism on the other. Nowadays it is political Islam that is thoroughly imbued with a particularly pernicious version of Occidentalism. In it, the additional idea is found, that the West, via its representatives who are currently ruling many Moslem countries, is the carrier of a new Jahiliyya – namely, ignorance and barbarism of the sort that ruled the world before the evangelical mission of the prophet Mohamed.\n\nThe book\n\ndeals with political compromises: what compromises are morally acceptable and what are to be rejected as unacceptable, or \"rotten\". The argument of the book assigns great value to the spirit of compromise in politics, while warning against rotten ones. A rotten compromise is taken to be a compromise with a regime that exercises inhuman policies, namely systematic behavior that mixes cruelty with humiliation or and treats humans as inhuman.\n\nThe book examines central historical examples, like the Great Compromise that paved the way for the US constitution, which accepted the institution of slavery despite its inhuman, cruel and humiliating nature. Other test cases include the Munich agreement and the Yalta agreement – working from the assumption that WWII is a sort of laboratory for testing out our moral-political concepts and intuitions. The forced return by the Allies of the Russian POWs to Joseph Stalin's hands served in the book as a paradigm case of a rotten compromise.\n\nOn Compromise focuses on the tension between peace and justice, and warns against seeing these two as complementary products, like fish and chips. The author claims that compromise is justified for the sake of peace, sometimes even at the expense of justice. Yet rotten compromises, totally unjustifiable that they are, are to be avoided come what may.\n\nIn On Betrayal,\n\n, Margalit argues for and investigates the persistent\nsignificance of betrayal. He identifies four main types of betrayal,\nbelonging to four spheres of human experience: political betrayal (treason),\npersonal betrayal (adultery), religious betrayal (apostasy), and betrayal of\none's class. The book defends the significance of the concept of betrayal\neven in modern liberal societies, where treason no longer carries the weight\nit once did, where adultery is not a crime, and where apostasy, or changing\none's religious affiliation, is considered a basic right. Building on his\nearlier distinction between thick and thin relations, Margalit argues that\nbetrayal still matters because thick relations still matter and betrayal is\nthe undermining of thick relations. \"The basic claim in the book is that\nbetrayal is betrayal of a thick human relationship. A thick human\nrelationship comes very close to what fraternity means. So betrayal is the\nflip side of fraternity\" (2).\n\nBy Margalit analysis, betrayal is a ternary relation, that is a relation\nholding between three objects. Thus the standard form of betrayal is: A\nbetrays B with/to C. For betrayal to occur the relations between A and B\nmust be thick relations. In cases of double betrayal, the betrayed stands in\nthick relations to both the betrayer and the one with whom the betrayal took\nplace (eg: A betrayed B with her best friend C). Thick political relations\nshould be based neither on blood, nor on seed, nor on soil, but on shared\nhistorical memory. They consist in \"thick trust\". Its breach is political\nbetrayal, or treason. Idolatry is the betrayal of thick relations with god\nand apostasy of thick relations with one's religious community.\n\nThick relations provide individuals with a sense of meaning and belonging,\nan orientation in the world, a home. The feature of thick relations which is\neroded by betrayal is belonging, rather than trust. Belonging is not based\non achievement, it is not a possession, but a bond. Betrayal undermines this\nbond because it \"provides the betrayed party with a good reason to\nreevaluate the meaning of the thick relation with the betrayer\" (92). But\nits ethical significance consists in the kind of reason it provides for this\nreevaluation, namely the violation of a commitment. As Michael Walzer\nsummarizes in his review of the book, \"betrayal isn't leaving a relationship\nbut breaking it––and breaking it in a way that hurts, that leaves the other\nor others vulnerable, frightened, alone, at a loss.\"\n\nHowever, not every case of disloyalty toward a thick relation is an instance\nof betrayal, only disloyalty to relations deserving of loyalty constitute\nbetrayal. This gives rise to ambiguities and disagreements. Betrayal,\nMargalit says, is an essentially contested concept, \"that is to say, in all\nits uses the concept of traitor is always subject to dispute along\nideological lines\" (24). When an alleged traitor is caught between two\ncompeting deserving loyalties, he will be regarded by one side as a traitor\nand by the other as a hero. When one of the loyalties is morally undeserved,\nthe actor is either an uncontestable hero (Willy Brandt is an example) or an\nuncontestable traitor (eg Benedict Arnold). Assessments of deservedness can\nvary not only across societies, but also within societies. This is often the\ncase with whistleblowers, like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, seen by\nsome as heroes and by others as traitors. The difference between a traitor\nworthy of contempt and a whistleblower worthy of applause, Margalit says,\nconsists in the righteousness of their cause and the purity of their\nmotives. The fact that both can be mixed and ambiguous explains why public\nopinion is often split in such cases.\n\nBesides the four general kinds of betrayal, the book explores specific forms\nof potential betrayal, including collaboration with an enemy, class\nbetrayal, secrecy and hypocrisy. It investigates with nuance complicated\nhistorical cases like Josephus Flavius, Willy Brandt, and Marshal Petain\n(\"Petain betrayed by trying to form a France that would eradicate the memory\nand the legacy of the French Revolution\" (215)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8717999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8717999", "title": "De amore (Andreas Capellanus)", "text": "De amore (Andreas Capellanus)\n\nAndreas Capellanus was the twelfth century author of a treatise commonly titled De amore (\"About Love\"), also known as De arte honeste amandi, for which a possible English translation is The Art of Courtly Love. His real identity has never been determined, but has been a matter of extended academic debate. Andreas Capellanus is sometimes known by a French translation of his name, \"André le Chapelain\".\n\n\"De Amore\" was written sometime between 1186 and 1190. It was most likely intended for the French court of Philip Augustus. It has been supposed to have been written in 1185 at the request of Marie de Champagne, daughter of King Louis VII of France and of Eleanor of Aquitaine. A dismissive allusion in the text to the \"wealth of Hungary\" has suggested the hypothesis that it was written after 1184, at the time when Bela III of Hungary had sent to the French court a statement of his income and had proposed marriage to Marie's sister Marguerite of France, but before 1186, when his proposal was accepted. \n\nJohn Jay Parry, who edited \"De Amore\", has described it as \"one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization.\" It may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive; in any event it preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in Western literature.\n\nThe social system of \"courtly love\", as gradually elaborated by the Provençal troubadours from the mid twelfth-century, soon spread. It is often associated with Eleanor of Aquitaine (herself the granddaughter of an early troubadour poet, William IX of Aquitaine), but this link has never been verified. It has been proposed that \"De Amore\" codifies the social and sexual life of Eleanor's court at Poitiers between 1169 and 1174 because the author mentions both Eleanor and her daughter Marie by name; but there is no evidence that Marie ever saw her mother again after Eleanor's divorce from Louis VII in 1152.\n\nThe work deals with several specific themes that were the subject of poetical debate among late twelfth century troubadours and trobairitz.\nThe basic conception of Capellanus is that courtly love ennobles both the lover and the beloved, provided that certain codes of behaviour are respected. \"De amore\" describes the affection between spouses as an unrelated emotion, stating that \"love can have no place between husband and wife,\" although they may feel even \"immoderate affection\" for one another. Rather, the most ennobling love is generally secret and extremely difficult to obtain, serving as a means for inspiring men to great deeds.\n\nPreface: \"De Amore\" begins with a preface (\"præfatio\"), in which Andreas addresses an unidentified young man named Walter. Though Capellanus' relationship with the young man is unclear, he describes Walter as “a new soldier of love, wounded with a new arrow,” not knowing “how aptly to govern the reins of the horse that soldier himself rides nor to be able to find any remedy [him]self.” Capellanus promises to teach Walter, with this book, “the way in which a state of love between two lovers may be kept unharmed, and likewise how those who do not love may get rid of the darts of Venus that are in their hearts.” Whether literal or ironic, Capellanus implies here that he intends to teach the ways of love to his eager disciple.\n\nBook I: After an introductory analysis of \"What love is\" (Parry, pp. 28–36), Book One of \"De Amore\" sets out a series of nine imaginary dialogues (pp. 36–141) between men and women of different social classes, from bourgeoisie to royalty. In each dialogue the man is pleading inconclusively to be accepted as the woman's lover, and in each he finds some small reason for optimism. The dialogs are delightful compositions, with many well-crafted arguments (albeit based on medieval rather than modern concepts) by both the ardent suitor and the skeptical lady; typically, the older man asks to be rewarded for his accomplishments whereas the young men or men of lower birth ask to be given inspiration so that they might accomplish something. These dialogues are followed by short discussions of love with priests, with nuns, for money, with peasant women, and with prostitutes (pp. 141–150).\n\nBook II: This book takes love as established, and begins with a discussion of how love is maintained and how and why it comes to an end (pp. 151–167). Following this comes a series of twenty-one \"judgements of love\" (pp. 167–177), said to have been pronounced in contentious cases by great ladies. Among these, three judgements are attributed to \"Queen Eleanor\" and another four simply to \"the Queen\", seven to Eleanor's daughter Marie of Troyes (\"the Countess of Champagne\"), two to Eleanor's niece Isabelle of Vermandois (\"the Countess of Flanders\", daughter of Petronilla of Aquitaine), one to \"a court of ladies in Gascony\", and five to Viscountess Ermengarde of Narbonne, who is thus singled out as the only patron of a \"Court of Love\" not belonging to the immediate family of Eleanor of Aquitaine. However, it has been suggested that \"the Queen\" is not Eleanor but Adèle of Champagne, Eleanor's successor as wife of Louis VII and Queen of France. Book Two concludes (pp. 177–186) by setting out \"The Rules of Love\". A few examples of these guidelines are listed below (numbered according to the order found in the original work, which contains thirty-one total):\n\nBook III: This book is the briefest (pp. 187–212), and is titled \"The Rejection of Love\". This book seeks to remedy the natural affection of men for women, by painting all women as disgusting as possible in so few words. For example, women are described as being completely untrustworthy (\"everything a woman says is said with the intention of deceiving\"), insanely greedy and willing to do anything for food, weak-minded and easily swayed by false reasoning, \"slanderers filled with envy and hate,\" drunkards, loud-mouthed and gossipy, unfaithful in love, disobedient, vain and tortured by envy of all other women's beauty, \"even her daughter's.\" The historical example of Eve is cited at several points as evidence. This book is a disclaimer for the rest of the work—as is evidenced by its heading. It includes reasons why love affairs of the sort found in this book should not be conducted, and that personal abstinence from love was the preferred route. Capellanus states that this abstinence would allow one to “win an eternal recompense and thereby deserve a greater reward from God.” This last book constitutes one reason not to take the bulk of Capellanus' work at face value. Though some social practices acceptable during the Middle Ages may be reflected in Capellanus' work, it cannot be clearly demonstrated to be a reliable source on the common medieval attitude to \"courtly love.\"\n\n\"De Amore\" gives a listing of the stages of love, which resembles in some ways the modern baseball euphemism:\n\nCourtly love is reserved for the middle and upper classes in \"De Amore\". Attractive peasant girls are to be shunned or, failing this, \"embraced by force\":\n\nIn a similar vein, Andreas describes nuns as easy to seduce, although he condemns anyone who does so as a \"disgusting animal.\" (This caution does not apply to monks or priests.)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1007108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1007108", "title": "Eye contact", "text": "Eye contact\n\nEye contact occurs when two people look at each other's eyes at the same time. In human beings, eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication and is thought to have a large influence on social behavior. Coined in the early to mid-1960s, the term came from the West to often define the act as a meaningful and important sign of confidence, respect, and social communication. The customs and significance of eye contact vary between societies, with religious and social differences often altering its meaning greatly.\n\nThe study of eye contact is sometimes known as \"oculesics\".\n\nEye contact and facial expressions provide important social and emotional information. People, perhaps without consciously doing so, search other's eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs. In some contexts, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions.\nEye contact provides some of the strongest emotions during a social conversation. This primarily is because it provides details on emotions and intentions. While someone does not give eye contact it can make someone feel left out from a certain group. While on the other hand prolonged eye contact can tell someone you are interested in what they have to say. \n\nEye contact is also an important element in flirting, where it may serve to establish and gauge the other's interest in some situations.\n\nMutual eye contact that signals attraction initially begins as a brief glance and progresses into a repeated volleying of eye contact.\n\nIn the process of civil inattention, strangers in close proximity, such as a crowd, avoid eye contact in order to help maintain their privacy.\n\nWhen two or more individuals talk, the person that talks is used to being looked at. Therefore, making eye contact can make other people expect conversation. Discussing eye contact is actually quite difficult because any attempt to categorize the degree (of sustained contact or measure of directness) and the nature of the eye contact is nearly guaranteed to contain a lot of descriptors derived from one's own cultural predisposition.\n\nA 1985 study suggested that \"3-month-old infants are comparatively insensitive to being the object of another's visual regard\". A 1996 Canadian study with 3 to 6 month old infants found that smiling in infants decreased when adult eye contact was removed. A recent British study in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience found that face recognition by infants was facilitated by direct gaze. Other recent research has confirmed that the direct gaze of adults influences the direct gaze of infants. Within their first year, infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others conveys significant information. Infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze.\n\nInteresting conflict stories from children of Korean immigrants to the United States surround how they manage eye contact with adults. In school, when being reprimanded the teacher might say something to the effect of \"Look at me when I'm talking to you.\" At home, if Mom is doing the reprimanding, making eye contact would make the situation far worse. In such situations, Korean children are taught to look at the floor so the demands are precisely opposite of what is expected in school.\n\nA person's direction of gaze may indicate to others where their attention lies.\n\nIn the 2000s, studies suggest that eye contact has a positive impact on the retention and recall of information and may promote more efficient learning.\n\nIn a 2001 study conducted in Germany examining German infants during their first 12 weeks of life, researchers studied the relationship between eye contact, maternal sensitivity and infant crying to attempt to determine if eye contact and maternal sensitivity were stable over time. In this correlational study, they began by categorizing the mother’s sensitivity placing them into one of four behavioral categories: inhibited/intense behavior, distortion of infant signals, over and understimulational, and aggressive behavioral. Next, the observer video-taped the mother and infant’s free-play interactions on a weekly basis for 12 weeks. When watching the videos, they measured the mutual eye contact between the mother and the infant by looking at the overlap in time when the mothers looked at their infant’s face and when the infants looked at their mother’s face. The mothers were also asked to record their infant’s crying in a diary.\n\nThe study found that the amount of eye contact between the study's German mothers and infants increased continuously over the first 12 weeks. The mother who held eye contact with her child early on (week 1-4) was described as sensitive to her infant whereas if she did not hold eye contact, her behavior was described as insensitive. They also found a negative relationship between eye contact and the duration of crying of the infants; as eye contact increases, crying decreases. Maternal sensitivity was also shown to be stable over time. According to the study, these findings may potentially be based on the assumption that sensitive mothers are more likely to notice their child’s behavioral problems than non-sensitive mothers.\n\nSome people find eye contact difficult with others. For example, those with autistic disorders or social anxieties may find eye contact to be particularly unsettling.\n\nStrabismus, especially esophoria or exophoria, interferes with normal eye contact: a person whose eyes are not aligned usually makes full eye contact with one eye only, while the orientation of the other eye deviates slightly or more.\n\nIn one study conducted by British psychologists from the University of Stirling among 20 British children at the age five, researchers concluded that among the children in the study, the children who avoid eye contact while considering their responses to questions are more likely to answer correctly than children who maintain eye contact. While humans obtain useful information from looking at the face when listening to someone, the process of looking at faces is mentally demanding and takes processing. Therefore, it may be unhelpful to look at faces when trying to concentrate and process something else that's mentally demanding. Contrary to this, Doherty-Sneddon suggests that a blank stare indicates a lack of understanding.\n\nIn many cultures, such as in East Asia and Nigeria, it is respectful not to look the dominant person in the eye, but in Western culture this can be interpreted as being \"shifty-eyed\", and the person judged badly because \"he wouldn't look me in the eye\"; references such as \"shifty-eyed\" can refer to suspicions regarding an individual's unrevealed intentions or thoughts. Nevertheless, the seeking of constant unbroken eye contact by the other participant in a conversation can often be considered overbearing or distracting by many even in western cultures, possibly on an instinctive or subconscious level.\n\nPious Muslims aspire to lower their gaze and look at each other without sexual objectification. Japanese children are taught in school to direct their gaze at the region of their teacher's Adam's apple or tie knot. As adults, Japanese lower their eyes when speaking to a superior as a gesture of respect.\n\nSome bodies of parliamentary procedure ban eye contact between members when speaking.\n\nFor clinical evaluation purposes in the practice of psychiatry and clinical psychology, as part of a mental status exam, the clinician may describe the initiation, frequency, and quality of eye contact. For example, the doctor may note whether the patient initiates, responds to, sustains, or evades eye contact. The clinician may also note whether eye contact is unusually intense or blank, or whether the patient glares, looks down, or looks aside frequently.\n\nEye contact can also be a significant factor in interactions between non-human animals, and between humans and non-human animals.\n\nAnimals of many species, including dogs, often perceive eye contact as a threat. Many programs to prevent dog bites recommend avoiding direct eye contact with an unknown dog. According to a report in \"The New Zealand Medical Journal\", maintaining eye contact is one reason young children may be more likely to fall victim to dog attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, extended eye contact between a dog and its owner modulates the secretion of oxytocin, a neuromodulator that is known for its role in maternal-infant bonding.\n\nHikers are commonly advised to avoid direct eye contact if they have surprised a bear, since the bear may interpret the eye contact as a threat, although some sources suggest maintaining eye contact. \n\nAmong primates, eye contact is seen as especially aggressive, and staring at them in a zoo can induce agitated behavior. Chimpanzees use eye contact to signal aggression in hostile encounters. Eye tracking research shows that chimps are more likely to look at the mouth, while bonobos are more likely to look at the eyes; eye contact is lower among socially deprived primates. A 2007 incident at Rotterdam Zoo is believed to be connected to eye contact: Bokito the gorilla escaped from his exhibit and injured a woman who had visited him several times and apparently often held prolonged eye contact. Visitors were later given special glasses that averted their apparent gaze when looking at the gorilla.\n\n\nhttps://www.lds.org/church/news/first-presidency-letter-testimonies-in-fast-and-testimony-meeting?lang=eng"}
{"id": "52881503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52881503", "title": "Fake news", "text": "Fake news\n\nFake news is a type of yellow journalism or propaganda that consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media. The term is also at times used to cast doubt upon legitimate news from an opposing political standpoint, a tactic known as the lying press. The false information is then often reverberated as misinformation in social media, but occasionally finds its way to the mainstream media as well. Fake news is written and published usually with the intent to mislead in order to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership, online sharing, and Internet click revenue. In the latter case, it is similar to sensational online \"clickbait\" headlines and relies on advertising revenue generated from this activity, regardless of the veracity of the published stories. Intentionally misleading and deceptive fake news differs from obvious satire or parody, which is intended to amuse rather than mislead its audience.\n\nThe relevance of fake news has increased in post-truth politics. For media outlets, the ability to attract viewers to their websites is necessary to generate online advertising revenue. If publishing a story with false content attracts users, this benefits advertisers and improves ratings. Easy access to online advertisement revenue, increased political polarization, and the popularity of social media, primarily the Facebook News Feed, have all been implicated in the spread of fake news, which competes with legitimate news stories. Hostile government actors have also been implicated in generating and propagating fake news, particularly during elections.\n\nFake news undermines serious media coverage and makes it more difficult for journalists to cover significant news stories. An analysis by BuzzFeed found that the top 20 fake news stories about the 2016 U.S. presidential election received more engagement on Facebook than the top 20 election stories from 19 major media outlets. Anonymously-hosted fake news websites lacking known publishers have also been criticized, because they make it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel.\n\nDuring and after his presidential campaign and election, Donald Trump popularized the term \"fake news\" when he used it to describe the negative press coverage of himself. In part as a result of Trump's use of the term, the term has come under increasing criticism, and in October 2018 the British government decided that it will no longer use the term because it is \"a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes.\"\n\n\"Fake news\" is a neologism often used to refer to fabricated news. This type of news, found in traditional news, social media or fake news websites, has no basis in fact, but is presented as being factually accurate.\n\nMichael Radutzky, a producer of CBS \"60 Minutes\", said his show considers fake news to be \"stories that are provably false, have enormous traction [popular appeal] in the culture, and are consumed by millions of people\". These stories are not only found in politics, but also in areas like vaccination, stock values and nutrition. He did not include news that is \"invoked by politicians against the media for stories that they don't like or for comments that they don't like\" as fake news. Guy Campanile, also a \"60 Minutes\" producer said, \"What we are talking about are stories that are fabricated out of thin air. By most measures, deliberately, and by any definition, that's a lie.\"\n\nThe intent and purpose of fake news is important. In some cases, what appears to be fake news may be news satire, which uses exaggeration and introduces non-factual elements that are intended to amuse or make a point, rather than to deceive. Propaganda can also be fake news. Some researchers have highlighted that \"fake news\" may be distinguished not just by the falsity of its content, but also the \"character of [its] online circulation and reception\".\n\nClaire Wardle of \"First Draft News\" identifies seven types of fake news:\n\n\nIn the context of the United States of America and its election processes in the 2010s, fake news generated considerable controversy and argument, with some commentators defining concern over it as moral panic or mass hysteria and others worried about damage done to public trust.\n\nIn January 2017, the United Kingdom House of Commons conducted a parliamentary inquiry into the \"growing phenomenon of fake news\".\n\nSome, most notably United States President Donald Trump, have broadened the meaning of \"fake news\" to include news that was negative of his presidency.\n\nIn November 2017, Claire Wardle (mentioned above) announced she has rejected the phrase \"fake news\" and \"censors it in conversation\", finding it \"woefully inadequate\" to describe the issues. She now speaks of \"information pollution\" and distinguishes between three types of problems: 'mis-information', 'dis-information', and 'mal-information':\n\nThe International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) published a summary in diagram form \"(pictured at right)\" to assist people in recognizing fake news. Its main points are:\nThe International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), launched in 2015, supports international collaborative efforts in fact-checking, provides training and has published a code of principles. In 2017 it introduced an application and vetting process for journalistic organisations. One of IFCN's verified signatories, the independent, not-for-profit media journal \"The Conversation\", created a short animation explaining its fact checking process, which involves \"extra checks and balances, including blind peer review by a second academic expert, additional scrutiny and editorial oversight\".\n\nBeginning in the 2017 school year, children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources. Called \"media literacy\", the course provides training in journalism in the new information society.\n\nIn the 13th century BC, Rameses the Great spread lies and propaganda portraying the Battle of Kadesh as a stunning victory for the Egyptians; he depicted scenes of himself smiting his foes during the battle on the walls of nearly all his temples. The treaty between the Egyptians and the Hittites, however, reveals that the battle was actually a stalemate.\n\nDuring the first century BC, Octavian ran a campaign of misinformation against his rival Mark Antony, portraying him as a drunkard, a womanizer, and a mere puppet of the Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII. He published a document purporting to be Marc Antony's will, which claimed that Marc Antony, upon his death, wished to be entombed in the mausoleum of the Ptolemaic pharaohs. Although the document may have been forged, it invoked outrage from the Roman populace. Marc Antony ultimately killed himself after his defeat in the Battle of Actium upon hearing false rumors propagated by Cleopatra herself claiming that she had committed suicide.\n\nDuring the second and third centuries AD, false rumors were spread about Christians claiming that they engaged in ritual cannibalism and incest. In the late third century AD, the Christian apologist Lactantius invented and exaggerated stories about pagans engaging in acts of immorality and cruelty, while the anti-Christian writer Porphyry invented similar stories about Christians.\n\nIn 1475, a fake news story in Trent claimed that the Jewish community had murdered a two-and-a-half-year-old Christian infant named Simonino. The story resulted in all the Jews in the city being arrested and tortured; fifteen of them were burned at the stake. Pope Sixtus IV himself attempted to stamp out the story, but, by that point, it had already spread beyond anyone's control. Stories of this kind were known as \"blood libel\"; they claimed that Jews purposely killed Christians, especially Christian children, and used their blood for religious or ritual purposes.\n\nAfter the invention of the printing press in 1439, publications became widespread but there was no standard of journalistic ethics to follow. By the 17th century, historians began the practice of citing their sources in footnotes. In 1610 when Galileo went on trial, the demand for verifiable news increased.\n\nDuring the 18th century publishers of fake news were fined and banned in the Netherlands; one man, Gerard Lodewijk van der Macht, was banned four times by Dutch authorities—and four times he moved and restarted his press. In the American colonies, Benjamin Franklin wrote fake news about murderous \"scalping\" Indians working with King George III in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of the American Revolution.\n\nCanards, the successors of the 16th century pasquinade, were sold in Paris on the street for two centuries, starting in the 17th century. In 1793, Marie Antoinette was executed in part because of popular hatred engendered by a canard on which her face had been printed.\n\nDuring the era of slave-owning in the United States, supporters of slavery propagated fake news stories about African Americans, whom white people considered to have lower status. Violence occurred in reaction to the spread of some fake news events. In one instance, stories of African Americans spontaneously turning white spread through the south and struck fear into the hearts of many people.\n\nRumors and anxieties about slave rebellions were common in Virginia from the beginning of the colonial period, despite the only major uprising occurring in the 19th century. One particular instance of fake news regarding revolts occurred in 1730. The serving governor of Virginia at the time, Governor William Gooch, reported that a slave rebellion had occurred but was effectively put down – although this never happened. After Gooch discovered the falsehood, he ordered slaves found off plantations to be punished, tortured, and made prisoners.\n\nOne instance of fake news was the Great Moon Hoax of 1835. \"The New York Sun\" published articles about a real-life astronomer and a made-up colleague who, according to the hoax, had observed bizarre life on the moon. The fictionalized articles successfully attracted new subscribers, and the penny paper suffered very little backlash after it admitted the next month that the series had been a hoax. Such stories were intended to entertain readers, and not to mislead them.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Joseph Pulitzer and other yellow journalism publishers goaded the United States into the Spanish–American War, which was precipitated when the U.S.S. Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana, Cuba.\n\nDuring the First World War, an example of anti-German atrocity propaganda was that of an alleged \"German Corpse Factory\" in which the German battlefield dead were rendered down for fats used to make nitroglycerine, candles, lubricants, human soap, and boot dubbing. Unfounded rumors regarding such a factory circulated in the Allied press starting in 1915, and by 1917 the English-language publication \"North China Daily News\" presented these allegations as true at a time when Britain was trying to convince China to join the Allied war effort; this was based on new, allegedly true stories from \"The Times\" and \"The Daily Mail\" that turned out to be forgeries. These false allegations became known as such after the war, and in the Second World War Joseph Goebbels used the story in order to deny the ongoing massacre of Jews as British propaganda. According to Joachim Neander and Randal Marlin, the story also \"encouraged later disbelief\" when reports about the Holocaust surfaced after the liberation of Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps.\nAfter Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in 1933, they established the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda under the control of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The Nazis used both print and broadcast journalism to promote their agendas, either by obtaining ownership of those media or exerting political influence. Throughout World War II, both the Axis and the Allies employed fake news in the form of propaganda to persuade publics at home and in enemy countries. The British Political Warfare Executive used radio broadcasts and distributed leaflets to discourage German troops.\n\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has published that \"The New York Times\" printed fake news \"depicting Russia as a socialist paradise.\" During 1932–1933, \"The New York Times\" published numerous articles by its Moscow bureau chief, Walter Duranty, who won a Pulitzer prize for a series of reports about the Soviet Union.\n\n\"The War of the Worlds\" is a 1938 episode of the American radio drama anthology series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". Directed and narrated by actor and filmmaker Orson Welles, the episode was an adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898), presented as a series of simulated news bulletins. Although preceded by a clear introduction that the show was a drama, it became famous for allegedly causing mass panic, although the reality of the panic is disputed as the program had relatively few listeners. An investigation was run by The Federal Communications Commission to examine the mass hysteria produced by this radio programming; no law was found broken. This event was an example the early stages of society's dependency on information from print to radio and other mediums. Fake news can even be found within this example, the true extent of the \"hysteria\" from the radio broadcast has also been falsely recorded. The most extreme case and reaction after the radio broadcast was a group of Grover Mill locals attacking a water tower because they falsely identified it as an alien.\n\nIn the 21st century, the impact of fake news became widespread, as well as the usage of the term. The opening of the Internet to the people in the 90s was a movement meant to allow them access to information. Over time, the Internet has grown to unimaginable heights with tons of information coming in all the time which allows the Internet to be a host for plenty of unwanted, untruthful and misleading information that can be made by anyone. Besides referring to made-up stories designed to deceive readers into clicking on links, maximizing traffic and profit, the term has also referred to satirical news, whose purpose is not to mislead but rather to inform viewers and share humorous commentary about real news and the mainstream media. United States examples of satire (as opposed to fake news) include the television show \"Saturday Night Live\"'s \"Weekend Update\", \"The Daily Show\", \"The Colbert Report\", \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The Onion\" newspaper.\n\n21st century fake news is often intended to increase the financial profits of the news outlet. In an interview with NPR, Jestin Coler, former CEO of the fake media conglomerate Disinfomedia, said who writes fake news articles, who funds these articles, and why fake news creators create and distribute false information. Coler, who has since left his role as a fake news creator, said that his company employed 20 to 25 writers at a time and made $10,000 to $30,000 monthly from advertisements. Coler began his career in journalism as a magazine salesman before working as a freelance writer. He said he entered the fake news industry to prove to himself and others just how rapidly fake news can spread. Disinfomedia is not the only outlet responsible for the distribution of fake news; Facebook users play a major role in feeding into fake news stories by making sensationalized stories \"trend\", according to BuzzFeed media editor Craig Silverman, and the individuals behind Google AdSense basically fund fake news websites and their content. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, said, \"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea\", and then a few days later he blogged that Facebook was looking for ways to flag fake news stories.\n\nMany online pro-Trump fake news stories are being sourced out of a city of Veles in Macedonia, where approximately seven different fake news organizations are employing hundreds of teenagers to rapidly produce and plagiarize sensationalist stories for different U.S. based companies and parties.\n\nOne fake news writer, Paul Horner, was behind the widespread hoax that he was the graffiti artist Banksy and had been arrested; that a man stopped a robbery in a diner by quoting \"Pulp Fiction\"; and that he had an \"enormous impact\" on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to CBS News. These stories consistently appeared in Google's top news search results, were shared widely on Facebook, were taken seriously, and shared by third parties such as Trump presidential campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Eric Trump, ABC News, and the Fox News Channel. Horner later claimed that his work during this period was intended \"to make Trump's supporters look like idiots for sharing my stories\".\n\nIn a November 2016 interview with \"The Washington Post\", Horner expressed regret for the role his fake news stories played in the election and surprise at how gullible people were in treating his stories as news. In February 2017 Horner said, \"I truly regret my comment about saying that I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me. I know all I did was attack him and his supporters and got people not to vote for him. When I said that comment it was because I was confused how this evil got elected President and I thought maybe instead of hurting his campaign, maybe I had helped it. My intention was to get his supporters NOT to vote for him and I know for a fact that I accomplished that goal. The far right, a lot of the Bible thumpers and alt-right were going to vote him regardless, but I know I swayed so many that were on the fence.\"\n\nIn December 2016, while speaking on \"Anderson Cooper 360\", Horner said that all news is fake news and said CNN \"spread misinformation\", which was one month before Trump leveled the same criticism at that network.\n\nHorner spoke at the European Parliament in March, speaking about fake news and the importance of fact checking. According to a 2017 BuzzFeed article, Horner stated that a story of his about a rape festival in India helped generate over $250,000 in donations to GiveIndia, a site that helps rape victims in India. Horner said he dislikes being grouped with people who write fake news solely to be misleading. \"They just write it just to write fake news, like there's no purpose, there's no satire, there's nothing clever. All the stories I wrote were to make Trump's supporters look like idiots for sharing my stories.\" \"The Huffington Post\" called Horner a \"Performance Artist\". Horner has been referred to as a \"hoax artist\" by outlets such as the Associated Press and the \"Chicago Tribune\".\n\nKim LaCapria of the fact checking website Snopes.com has stated that, in America, fake news is a bipartisan phenomenon, saying that \"[t]here has always been a sincerely held yet erroneous belief misinformation is more red than blue in America, and that has never been true.\" Jeff Green of Trade Desk agrees the phenomenon affects both sides. Green's company found that affluent and well-educated persons in their 40s and 50s are the primary consumers of fake news. He told Scott Pelley of \"60 Minutes\" that this audience tends to live in an \"echo chamber\" and that these are the people who vote.\n\nIn 2014, the Russian Government used disinformation via networks such as RT to create a counter-narrative after Russian-backed Ukrainian rebels shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. In 2016, NATO claimed it had seen a significant rise in Russian propaganda and fake news stories since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. Fake news stories originating from Russian government officials were also circulated internationally by Reuters news agency and published in the most popular news websites in the United States.\n\nA 2018 study at Oxford University<ref name=\"Narayanan_Barash_2/8/2018\"></ref> found that Trump's supporters consumed the \"largest volume of 'junk news' on Facebook and Twitter\":\nIn 2018,<ref name=\"Guess_Nyhan_Reifler_1/9/2018\"></ref> researchers from Princeton University, Dartmouth College, and the University of Exeter examined the consumption of fake news during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Their findings showed that Trump supporters and older Americans (over 60) were far more likely to consume fake news than Clinton supporters. Those most likely to visit fake news websites were the 10% of Americans who consumed the most conservative information. There was a very large difference (800%) in the consumption of fake news stories as related to total news consumption between Trump supporters (6.2%) and Clinton supporters (0.8%).<ref name=\"Sarlin_1/14/2018\"></ref>\n\nThe study also showed that fake pro-Trump and fake pro-Clinton news stories were read by their supporters, but with a significant difference: Trump supporters consumed far more (40%) than Clinton supporters (15%). Facebook was by far the key \"gateway\" website where these fake stories were spread, and which led people to then go to the fake news websites. Fact checks of fake news were rarely seen by consumers, with none of those who saw a fake news story being reached by a related fact check.<ref name=\"Poynter_1/3/2018\"></ref>\n\nBrendan Nyhan, one of the researchers, emphatically stated in an interview on NBC News: \"People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites – full stop.\"\nAnother issue in mainstream media is the usage of the filter bubble, a \"bubble\" that has been created that gives the viewer, on social media platforms, a specific piece of the information knowing they will like it. Thus creating fake news and biased news because only half the story is being shared, the portion the viewer liked. \"In 1996, Nicolas Negroponte predicted a world where information technologies become increasingly customizable.\" Decades ago people predicted that customized news would become a reality. This becomes a problem in today's society because people are seeing only bits and pieces and not the whole issues making it much harder to solve the issues or talk about it worldwide.\n\nThe term \"fake news\" gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America. It is determined by fraudulent content in news format and its velocity. According to Bounegru, Gray, Venturini and Mauri, fake news is when a deliberate lie \"is picked up by dozens of other blogs, retransmitted by hundreds of websites, cross-posted over thousands of social media accounts and read by hundreds of thousands\" that it then effectively becomes \"fake news\".\n\nThe evolving nature of online business models encourages the production of information that is \"click-worthy\" independently of its accuracy.\n\nThe nature of trust depends on the assumptions that non-institutional forms of communication are freer from power and more able to report information that mainstream media are perceived as unable or unwilling to reveal. Declines in confidence in much traditional media and expert knowledge have created fertile grounds for alternative, and often obscure sources of information to appear as authoritative and credible. This ultimately leaves users confused about basic facts.\n\nInternet companies with threatened credibility tend to develop new responses to limit fake news and reduce financial incentives for its proliferation.\n\nWhen the Internet was first made accessible for public use in the 1990s, its main purpose was for the seeking and accessing of information. As fake news was introduced to the Internet, this made it difficult for some people to find truthful information. The impact of fake news has become a worldwide phenomenon. Fake news is often spread through the use of fake news websites, which, in order to gain credibility, specialize in creating attention-grabbing news, which often impersonate well-known news sources. Jestin Coler, who said he does it for \"fun\", also said he earned US$10,000 per month from advertising on his fake news websites. In 2017, the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee claimed that fake news was one of the three most significant new disturbing Internet trends that must first be resolved, if the Internet is to be capable of truly \"serving humanity.\" The other two new disturbing trends that Berners-Lee described as threatening the Internet were the recent surge in the use of the Internet by governments for both citizen-surveillance purposes, and for cyber-warfare purposes. Research has shown that fake news hurts social media and online based outlets far worse than traditional print and TV outlets. After a survey was conducted, it was found that 58% of people had less trust in social media news stories as opposed to 24% of people in mainstream media after learning about fake news.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Nicolas Negroponte anticipated a world where news through technology become progressively personalized. In his 1996 book \"Being Digital\" he predicted a digital life where news consumption becomes an extremely personalized experience and newspapers adapted content to reader preferences. This prediction has since been reflected in news and social media feeds of modern day.\n\nBots have the potential to increase the spread of fake news, as they use algorithms to decide what articles and information specific users like, without taking into account the authenticity of an article. Bots mass-produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of the sources, allowing them to play an essential role in the mass spread of fake news, as bots are capable of creating fake accounts and personalities on the web that are then gaining followers, recognition, and authority. Additionally, almost 30% of the spam and content spread on the Internet originates from these software bots.\n\nIn the 21st century, the capacity to mislead was enhanced by the widespread use of social media. For example, one 21st century website that enabled fake news' proliferation was the Facebook newsfeed. In late 2016 fake news gained notoriety following the uptick in news content by this means, and its prevalence on the micro-blogging site Twitter. In the United States, 62% of Americans use social media to receive news. Many people use their Facebook news feed to get news, despite Facebook not being considered a news site. According to Craig McClain, over 66% of Facebook users obtain news from the site. This, in combination with increased political polarization and filter bubbles, led to a tendency for readers to mainly read headlines.\n\nNumerous individuals and news outlets have stated that fake news may have influenced the outcome of the 2016 American Presidential Election. Fake news saw higher sharing on Facebook than legitimate news stories, which analysts explained was because fake news often panders to expectations or is otherwise more exciting than legitimate news. Facebook itself initially denied this characterization. A Pew Research poll conducted in December 2016 found that 64% of U.S. adults believed completely made-up news had caused \"a great deal of confusion\" about the basic facts of current events, while 24% claimed it had caused \"some confusion\" and 11% said it had caused \"not much or no confusion\". Additionally, 23% of those polled admitted they had personally shared fake news, whether knowingly or not. Researchers from Stanford assessed that only 8% of readers of fake news recalled and believed in the content they were reading, though the same share of readers also recalled and believed in \"placebos\" – stories they did not actually read, but that were produced by the authors of the study. In comparison, over 50% of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories.\n\nBy August 2017 Facebook stopped using the term \"fake news\" and used \"false news\" in its place instead. Will Oremus of \"Slate\" wrote that because supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump had redefined the word \"fake news\" to refer to mainstream media opposed to them, \"it makes sense for Facebook—and others—to cede the term to the right-wing trolls who have claimed it as their own.\"\n\nResearch from Northwestern University concluded that 30% of all fake news traffic, as opposed to only 8% of real news traffic, could be linked back to Facebook. Fake news consumers, they concluded, do not exist in a filter bubble; many of them also consume real news from established news sources. The fake news audience is only 10 percent of the real news audience, and most fake news consumers spent a relatively similar amount of time on fake news compared with real news consumers—with the exception of Drudge Report readers, who spent more than 11 times longer reading the website than other users.\n\nIn the wake of western events, China's Ren Xianling of the Cyberspace Administration of China suggested a \"reward and punish\" system be implemented to avoid fake news.\n\nIn Internet slang, a troll is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or off-topic discussion, often for the troll's amusement. The term troll alludes back to a monster that hides in the shadows and threatens people. Internet trolls also feed on attention.\n\nThe idea of internet trolls gained popularity in the 1990s, though its meaning shifted in 2011. Whereas it once denoted provocation, it is a term now widely used to signify the abuse and misuse of the Internet. Trolling comes in various forms, and can be dissected into abuse trolling, entertainment trolling, classical trolling, flame trolling, anonymous trolling, and kudos trolling. It is closely linked to fake news, as internet trolls are now largely interpreted as perpetrators of false information, information that can often be passed along unwittingly by reporters and the public alike.\n\nWhen interacting with each other, trolls often share misleading information that contributes to the fake news circulated on sites like Twitter and Facebook. In the 2016 American election, Russia paid over 1,000 internet trolls to circulate fake news and disinformation about Hillary Clinton, and they also had the power to create social media accounts that resembled voters in important swing states that spread influential political standpoints.\n\nDuring the 2016 United States presidential election, the creation and coverage of fake news increased substantially. This resulted in a widespread response to combat the spread of fake news. The volume and reluctance of fake news websites to respond to fact-checking organizations has posed a problem to inhibiting the spread of fake news through fact checking alone. In an effort to reduce the effects of fake news, fact-checking websites, including Snopes.com and FactCheck.org, have posted guides to spotting and avoiding fake news websites. New critical readings of media events and news with an emphasis on literalism and logic have also emerged. Social media sites and search engines, such as Facebook and Google, received criticism for facilitating the spread of fake news. Both of these corporations have taken measures to explicitly prevent the spread of fake news; critics, however, believe more action is needed.\n\nAfter the 2016 American election and the run-up to the German election, Facebook began labeling and warning of inaccurate news and partnered with independent fact-checkers to label inaccurate news, warning readers before sharing it. After a story is flagged as disputed, it will be reviewed by the third-party fact-checkers. Then, if it has been proven to be a fake news story, the post cannot be turned into an ad or promoted. Artificial intelligence is one of the more recent technologies being developed in the United States and Europe to recognize and eliminate fake news through algorithms. In 2017, Facebook targeted 30,000 accounts related to the spread of misinformation regarding the French presidential election.\n\nIn March 2018, Google launched Google News Initiative (GNI) to fight the spread of fake news. It launched GNI under the belief that quality journalism and identifying truth online is crucial. GNI has three goals: “to elevate and strengthen quality journalism, evolve business models to drive sustainable growth and empower news organizations through technological innovation.” To achieve the first goal, Google created the Disinfo Lab, which combats the spread of fake news during crucial times such as elections or breaking news. The company is also working to adjust its systems to display more trustworthy content during times of breaking news. To make it easier for users to subscribe to media publishers, Google created Subscribe with Google. Additionally, they have created a dashboard, News Consumer Insights that allows news organizations to better understand their audiences using data and analytics. Google will spend $300 million through 2021 on these efforts, among others, to combat fake news.\n\nPresident-elect Jair Bolsonaro has claimed that he will not allow his government to use any of its 1.8 billion reais ($487 million) media budget on purchases from fake news media. The \"BBC\" reported that Bolsonaro's campaign declared media associating his campaign to the \"extreme right\" were themselves fake news.\n\nPresident Trump has claimed that the mainstream American media regularly reports fake news. His doing so is seen as having increased distrust of the American media globally, particularly in Russia. His claims have given credibility to the stories in the Russian media that label American news, especially news about atrocities committed by the Syrian regime against its own people, where it was quoted that \"munitions at the air base had as much to do with chemical weapons as the test tube in the hands of Colin Powell had to do with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq\", as just more fake American news.\n\nTrump has carried on a war against the mainstream media, often attacking it as \"fake news\" and \"the \"enemy of the people\".<ref name=\"Pak_Seyler_7/19/2018\"></ref><ref name=\"Atkins_2/27/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Felsenthal_3/2/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Massie_2/7/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Page_2/7/2017\"></ref>\n\nAccording to Jeff Hemsley, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media, Trump uses this term for any news that is not favorable to him or which he simply dislikes.<ref name=\"Gendreau_2/25/2017\"></ref> Trump provided a widely cited example of this interpretation in a tweet on May 9, 2018:\n\nChris Cillizza described the tweet on CNN as an \"accidental\" revelation about Trump's \"'fake news' attacks\", and wrote: \"The point can be summed up in these two words from Trump: 'negative (Fake).' To Trump, those words mean the same thing. Negative news coverage is fake news. Fake news is negative news coverage.\"<ref name=\"Cillizza_5/9/2018\"></ref> Other writers made similar comments about the tweet. Dara Lind wrote in Vox: \"It's nice of Trump to admit, explicitly, what many skeptics have suspected all along: When he complains about 'fake news,' he doesn't actually mean 'news that is untrue'; he means news that is personally inconvenient to Donald Trump.\"<ref name=\"Lind_5/9/2018\"></ref> Jonathan Chait wrote in \"New York\" magazine: \"Trump admits he calls all negative news 'fake'.\": \"In a tweet this morning, Trump casually opened a window into the source code for his method of identifying liberal media bias. Anything that's negative is, by definition, fake.\"<ref name=\"Chait_5/9/2018\"></ref> Philip Bump wrote in \"The Washington Post\": \"The important thing in that tweet...is that he makes explicit his view of what constitutes fake news. It's negative news. Negative. (Fake.)\"<ref name=\"Bump_5/9/2018\"></ref> In an interview with Lesley Stahl, before the cameras were turned on, Trump explained why he attacks the press: \"You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.\"<ref name=\"Mangan_5/22/2018\"></ref>\n\nAuthor and literary critic Michiko Kakutani has described developments in the right-wing media and websites:\nIn September 2018, National Public Radio noted that Trump has expanded his use of the terms \"fake\" and \"phony\" to \"an increasingly wide variety of things he doesn't like\": \"The range of things Trump is declaring fake is growing too. Last month he tweeted about \"fake books,\" \"the fake dossier,\" \"fake CNN,\" and he added a new claim – that Google search results are \"RIGGED\" to mostly show only negative stories about him.\" They graphed his expanding use in columns labeled: \"Fake news\", \"Fake (other), and \"Phony\".<ref name=\"Keith_9/4/2018\"></ref>\n\nBecause of the manner in which Trump has co-opted the term, \"Washington Post\" media columnist Margaret Sullivan has warned fellow journalists that \"It's time to retire the tainted term 'fake news'. Though the term hasn't been around long, its meaning already is lost.\"\n\nIn October 2018, the British government decided that the term \"fake news\" will no longer be used in official documents because it is \"a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes.\" This followed a recommendation by the House of Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee to avoid the term.\n\nA well-known case of fabricated news in Australia happened in 2009 when a report \"Deception Detection Across Australian Populations\" of a \"Levitt Institute\" was widely cited on the news websites all over the country, claiming that Sydney was the most naive city, despite the fact that the report itself contained a cue: amidst the mathematical gibberish, there was a statement: \"These results were completely made up to be fictitious material through a process of modified truth and credibility nodes.\"\nThe Australian Parliament initiated investigation into \"fake news\" regarding issues surrounding fake news that occurred during the 2016 United States election. The inquiry looks at a few major areas in Australia to find audiences most vulnerable to fake news, by considering the impact on traditional journalism, and by evaluating the liability of online advertisers and by regulating the spreading the hoaxes. This act of parliament is meant to combat the threat of social media power on spreading fakes news as concluded negative results to the public.\n\nPoliticians in Austria dealt with the impact of fake news and its spread on social media after the 2016 presidential campaign in the country. In December 2016, a court in Austria issued an injunction on Facebook Europe, mandating it block negative postings related to Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, Austrian Green Party Chairwoman. According to \"The Washington Post\" the postings to Facebook about her \"appeared to have been spread via a fake profile\" and directed derogatory epithets towards the Austrian politician. The derogatory postings were likely created by the identical fake profile that had previously been utilized to attack Alexander van der Bellen, who won the election for President of Austria.\n\nBrazil faced increasing influence from fake news after the 2014 re-election of President Dilma Rousseff and Rousseff's subsequent impeachment in August 2016. BBC Brazil reported in April 2016 that in the week surrounding one of the impeachment votes, three out of the five most-shared articles on Facebook in Brazil were fake. In 2015, reporter Tai Nalon resigned from her position at Brazilian newspaper \"Folha de S Paulo\" in order to start the first fact-checking website in Brazil, called Aos Fatos (To The Facts). Nalon told \"The Guardian\" there was a great deal of fake news, and hesitated to compare the problem to that experienced in the U.S. In fact, Brazil also have problems with fake news and according to a survey have a greater number of people that believe fake news influenced the outcome of their elections (69%) than the United States (47%).\n\nFake news online was brought to the attention of Canadian politicians in November 2016, as they debated helping assist local newspapers. Member of Parliament for Vancouver Centre Hedy Fry specifically discussed fake news as an example of ways in which publishers on the Internet are less accountable than print media. Discussion in parliament contrasted increase of fake news online with downsizing of Canadian newspapers and the impact for democracy in Canada. Representatives from Facebook Canada attended the meeting and told members of Parliament they felt it was their duty to assist individuals gather data online.\n\nIn January 2017, the Conservative leadership campaign of Kellie Leitch admitted to spreading fake news, including false claims that Justin Trudeau was financing Hamas. The campaign manager claimed he spread the news in order to provoke negative reactions so that he could determine those who \"aren't real Conservatives\".\n\nCzech Republic has become home to numerous fake news outlets, many redistributing news in Czech and English originally produced by Russian sources. Czech president Miloš Zeman has been supporting media outlets accused of spreading fake news.\n\nThe \"Centre Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats\" (CTHH) is unit of the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic primarily aimed at countering disinformation, fake news, hoaxes and foreign propaganda. The CTHH started operations on January 1, 2017. The CTHH has been criticized by Czech President Miloš Zeman, who said: \"We don't need censorship. We don't need thought police. We don't need a new agency for press and information as long as we want to live in a free and democratic society.\"\n\nIn 2017 media activists started a website Konspiratori.cz maintaining a list of conspiracy and fake news outlets in Czech.\n\nFake news during the 2016 U.S. election spread to China. Articles popularized within the United States were translated into Chinese and spread within China. The government of China used the growing problem of fake news as a rationale for increasing Internet censorship in China in November 2016. China took the opportunity to publish an editorial in its Communist Party newspaper \"The Global Times\" called: \"Western Media's Crusade Against Facebook\", and criticized \"unpredictable\" political problems posed by freedoms enjoyed by users of Twitter, Google, and Facebook. China government leaders meeting in Wuzhen at the third World Internet Conference in November 2016 said fake news in the U.S. election justified adding more curbs to free and open use of the Internet. China Deputy Minister Ren Xianliang, official at the Cyberspace Administration of China, said increasing online participation led to \"harmful information\" and fraud. Kam Chow Wong, a former Hong Kong law enforcement official and criminal justice professor at Xavier University, praised attempts in the U.S. to patrol social media.\"The Wall Street Journal\" noted China's themes of Internet censorship became more relevant at the World Internet Conference due to the outgrowth of fake news.\n\nThe issue of fake news in the 2016 United States election has given the Chinese Government a reason to further criticize Western democracy and press freedom. The Chinese government has also accused Western media organisations of bias, in a move apparently inspired by President Trump.\n\nIn March 2017, the \"People's Daily\", a newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party of China denounced news coverage of the torture of Chinese lawyer and human rights advocate Xie Yang, claiming it to be fake news. The newspaper published a Twitter post declaring that \"Foreign media reports that police tortured a detained lawyer is FAKE NEWS, fabricated to tarnish China's image\". The state-owned Xinhua News Agency claimed that \"the stories were essentially fake news\". The Chinese government has often accused Western news organizations of being biased and dishonest.\n\nThe Chinese government also claimed that there are people who pose as journalists that spread negative information on social media in order to extort payment from their victims to stop doing so. David Bandurski of University of Hong Kong's China Media Project has said that this issue has continued to worsen.\n\nOfficials from 11 countries met in Helsinki in November 2016 to plan the formation of a center to combat disinformation cyber-warfare, which includes the spread of fake news on social media. The center is planned to be located in Helsinki and combine efforts from 10 countries, including Sweden, Germany, Finland, and the U.S. Prime Minister of Finland Juha Sipilä planned to address the topic of the center in Spring 2017 with a motion before Parliament.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State for EU Affairs Jori Arvonen said cyber-warfare, such as hybrid cyber-warfare intrusions into Finland from Russia and the Islamic State, became an increased problem in 2016. Arvonen cited examples including online fake news, disinformation, and the little green men troops of the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nDuring the 10-year period preceding 2016, France was witness to an increase in popularity of far-right alternative news sources called the \"fachosphere\" (\"facho\" referring to fascist); known as the . According to sociologist Antoine Bevort, citing data from Alexa Internet rankings, the most consulted political websites in France in 2016 included \"Égalité et Réconciliation\", \"\", and \"Les Moutons Enragés\". These sites increased skepticism towards mainstream media from both left and right perspectives.\n\nIn September 2016, the country faced controversy regarding fake websites providing false information about abortion. The National Assembly moved forward with intentions to ban such fake sites. Laurence Rossignol, women's minister for France, informed parliament though the fake sites look neutral, in actuality their intentions were specifically targeted to give women fake information.\n\nFrance saw an uptick in amounts of disinformation and propaganda, primarily in the midst of election cycles. A study looking at the diffusion of political news during the 2017 presidential election cycle suggests that one in four links shared in social media comes from sources that actively contest traditional media narratives. Facebook corporate deleted 30,000 Facebook accounts in France associated with fake political information.\n\nIn April 2017, Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign was attacked by the fake news articles more than the campaigns of conservative candidate Marine Le Pen and socialist candidate . One of the fake articles even announced that Marine Le Pen won the presidency before the people of France had even voted. Macron's professional and private emails, as well as memos, contracts and accounting documents were posted on a file sharing website. The leaked documents were mixed with fake ones in social media in an attempt to sway the upcoming presidential election. Macron said he would combat fake news of the sort that had been spread during his election campaign.\n\nInitially, the leak was attributed to APT28, a group tied to Russias GRU military intelligence directorate. However, the head of the French cyber-security agency, ANSSI, later said that there was no evidence that the hack leading to the leaks had anything to do with Russia, saying that the attack was so simple, that \"we can imagine that it was a person who did this alone. They could be in any country.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel lamented the problem of fraudulent news reports in a November 2016 speech, days after announcing her campaign for a fourth term as leader of her country. In a speech to the German parliament, Merkel was critical of such fake sites, saying they harmed political discussion. Merkel called attention to the need of government to deal with Internet trolls, bots, and fake news websites. She warned that such fraudulent news websites were a force increasing the power of populist extremism. Merkel called fraudulent news a growing phenomenon that might need to be regulated in the future. Germany's foreign intelligence agency Federal Intelligence Service Chief, Bruno Kahl, warned of the potential for cyberattacks by Russia in the 2017 German election. He said the cyberattacks would take the form of the intentional spread of disinformation. Kahl said the goal is to increase chaos in political debates. Germany's domestic intelligence agency Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution Chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, said sabotage by Russian intelligence was a present threat to German information security. The German term \"Lügenpresse\", or lying press, has been used since the 19th century as a strategy to attack news spread by political opponents from the 19th century.\n\nFake news in India has led to episodes of violence between castes and religions and interfered with public policies. It often spreads through the smartphone instant messenger Whatsapp, which had 200 million monthly active users in the country .\n\nOn November 8, 2016, India established a 2,000-rupee currency bill on the same day as the Indian 500 and 1,000 rupee note demonetisation. Fake news went viral over Whatsapp that the note came equipped with spying technology that tracked bills 120 meters below the earth. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley refuted the falsities, but not before they had spread to the country's mainstream news outlets. Later, in May 2017, seven people were lynched as rumor of child abductions spread through WhatsApp in a village.\n\nPrabhakar Kumar of the Indian media research agency CMS, told \"The Guardian\" India was harder hit by fake news because the country lacked media policy for verification. Law enforcement officers in India arrested individuals with charges of creating fictitious articles, predominantly if there was likelihood the articles inflamed societal conflict.\n\nIn April 2018, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry said the government would cancel the accreditation of journalists found to be sharing fake news, but this was quickly retracted after criticism that this was an attack on freedom of the press.\n\nIn June 2018 mobs murdered a governmental employee, Sukanta Chakraborty, who was fighting against false news and rumours, and two other unrelated people. More people were severely injured. The local government temporarily shut down mobile Internet and texting services.\n\nIn Kashmir, to tackle the menace of fake news, Amir Ali Shah, a youth from south Kashmir' Anantnag district has developed a website \"Stop Fake in Kashmir\", on which news can be verified and facts can be checked. The website is the first of its kind developed in the Kashmir valley.\n\nRecently, Indonesia has seen an increase in the amount of fake news circulating social media. The problem first arose during their 2014 presidential election, where candidate Jokowi became a target of a smear campaign which falsely claimed he was the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian. Unlike the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where the sharing of fake news resulted in increased social-media engagement than real news, inflaming ethnic and political tensions could be potentially deadly in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anticommunist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms. The government, watchdog groups, and even religious organizations have taken steps to prevent its spreading, such as blocking certain websites and creating fact-check apps. The largest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, Nahdlatul Ulama, has created an anti-fake news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while other Islamic groups have defined such propagation as tantamount to a sin. While the government currently views criminal punishment as its last resort, officials are working hard to guarantee law enforcement will respect the freedom of expression.\n\nFake news about Israel has been published by the Palestinian Authority and news agencies.. In 1996, people had been killed in the Western Wall Tunnel riots in reaction to fake news accounts. An Egyptian newspaper reported on Israeli spy sharks trained to eat Arab bathers in the Red Sea, an example of a Israel-related animal conspiracy theories. The Israeli state has been accused of spreading propaganda in the USA. In April 2018, Palestinian-Israeli football team Bnei Sakhnin threatened to sue Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for libel, after he claimed fans booed during a minute of silence for Israeli flash-flood victims.\n\nIn a social media post, Netanyahu blasted various Israeli news critical of him, as fake news including Channel 2, Channel 10, Haaretz and Ynet the same day US President Trump decried \"fake news\".\n\nThe Palestinian Islamist political organization, Hamas published a political program in 2017 intended to ease its position on Israel. Among other things, this charter accepted the borders of the Palestinian state circa the Six-Day War of 1967. Although this document is an advancement from their previous 1988 charter, which called for the destruction of the State of ‘’’Israel’’’, it still does not recognize Israel as legitimate independent nation. In a video, Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the coverage of this event by news outlets such as \"Al Jazeera\", \"CNN\", \"New York Times\" and \"The Guardian,\" calling their reporting fake news. He specifically disagreed with the notion that Hamas had accepted the state of Israel within their new charter, and called this \"a complete distortion of the truth.” Instead he said, “The new Hamas document says Israel has no right to exist.” In a later speech, addressed to his supporters, Netanyahu responded to allegations against him: “The fake news industry is at its peak... Look, for example, how they cover with unlimited enthusiasm, every week, the left-wing demonstration. The same demonstrations whose goal is to apply improper pressure on law enforcement authorities so they will file an indictment at any price.” Observers likened his blanketed use of the term, ‘fake news’, for describing left-wing media to Donald Trump, and his similar statements during the 2016 election cycle.\n\nIn April 2018, Malaysia implemented the Anti-Fake News Bill 2018, a controversial law that deemed publishing and circulating misleading information as a crime punishable by up to six years in prison and/or fines of up to 500,000 ringit. At implemention, the country's prime minister was Najib Razak, whose associates were connected to the mishandling of at least $3.5 billion by a United States Department of Justice report. Of that sum of money, $731 million was deposited into bank accounts controlled by Razak. The convergence between the fake news law and Razak's connection to scandal was made clear by the Malaysian minister of communications and multimedia, Salleh Said Keruak, who said that tying Razak to a specific dollar amount could be a prosecutable offense. In the 2018 Malaysian general election, Najib Razak lost his seat as prime minister to Mahatir Mohammad, who vowed to abolish the fake news law in his campaign, as the law was used to target him. After winning the election, the newly elected prime minister Mohammad has said, “Even though we support freedom of press and freedom of speech, there are limits.\" , Mohammad has supported amending the law, rather than a full abolition.\n\nPaul Bernal, a lecturer in information and technology, fears that the fake news epidemic is a “Trojan horse” for countries like Malaysia to “control uncomfortable stories.” The vagueness of this law means that satirists, opinion writers, and journalists who make errors could face persecution. The law also makes it illegal to share fake news stories; a Danish man and Malaysian citizen were arrested for posting false news stories online and were sentenced to serve a month in jail.\n\nIn 2015, BBC News reported on fake stories, using unrelated photographs and fraudulent captions, shared online in support of the Rohingya. Fake news negatively affected individuals in Myanmar, leading to a rise in violence against Muslims in the country. Online participation surged from one percent to 20 percent of Myanmar's total populace from 2014 to 2016. Fake stories from Facebook were reprinted in paper periodicals called \"Facebook\" and \"The Internet\". False reporting related to practitioners of Islam in the country was directly correlated with increased attacks on Muslims in Myanmar. BuzzFeed journalist Sheera Frenkel reported fake news fictitiously stated believers in Islam acted out in violence at Buddhist locations. She documented a direct relationship between the fake news and violence against Muslim people. Frenkel noted countries that were relatively newer to Internet exposure were more vulnerable to the problems of fake news and fraud.\n\nIn March 2018, the European Union’s East StratCom Team compiled a list dubbed a “hall of shame” of articles with suspected Kremlin attempts to influence political decisions. However, controversy arose when three Dutch media outlets claimed they had been wrongfully singled out because of quotes attributed to people with non-mainstream views. The news outlets included ]Post Online, GeenStijl, and De Gelderlander. All three were flagged for publishing articles critical of Ukrainian policies, and none received any forewarning or opportunity to appeal beforehand. This incident has contributed to the growing issue of what defines news as fake, and how freedoms of press and speech can be protected during attempts to curb to spread of false news.\n\nKhawaja Muhammad Asif, the Minister of Defence of Pakistan, threatened to nuke Israel on Twitter after a false story claiming that Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli Ministry of Defense, said \"If Pakistan send ground troops into Syria on any pretext, we will destroy this country with a nuclear attack.\"\n\nFake news has been problematic in the Philippines where social media has outsized political influence. Following the 2016 Philippine election, Senator Francis Pangilinan filed that there be an inquiry of conduct of social media platforms that allowed for the spreading of fake news. Pangilinan called for penalties for social media platforms that provided the public with false information about his ideas. The news that came out was meant to discredit the opposing party and used social media as an outlet to bring propaganda into the mainstream media. According to media analysts, developing countries such as the Philippines, with the generally new access to social media and democracy, feel the problem of fake news to a larger extent. Facebook is one of the largest platforms being an open website, that works as a booster to sway the opinion of the public due to manufactured stories. While Facebook provides free media sources, it does not provide its users with the access to fact checking websites. Because of this, government authorities call for a tool that will filter out \"fake news\" to secure the integrity of cyberspace in the Philippines. Rappler, a social news network in the Philippines, investigated online networks of Rodrigo Duterte supporters and discovered that they include fake news, fake accounts, bots and trolls, which Rappler thinks are being used to silence dissent. The creation of fake news, and fake news accounts on social media has been a danger to the political health of the country. According to Kate Lamble and Megha Mohan of BBC news, \"What we're seeing on social media again is manufactured reality... They also create a very real chilling effect against normal people, against journalists (who) are the first targets, and they attack in very personal ways with death threats and rape threats.\" Journalists are often risking their lives in publishing articles that contest fake news in the Philippines.\n\nThe 2016 Filipino election was influenced, in large part, by false information propagated by fake news outlets. By New York Times contributor Miguel Syjuco's account, President Rodrigo Duterte benefited from a disproportionate amount of complimentary fake news compared to his opponents. The pro-Duterte propaganda spread across Filipino social media include fake endorsements from prominent public figures like Pope Francis and Angela Merkel. Duterte's own campaign was responsible for a portion of the misinformation spread during the election; according to a study from Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Research Program, Duterte's campaign paid an estimated $200,000 for dedicated trolls to undermine dissenters and disseminate misinformation in 2016.\n\nAn incident was the accusation made by Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II regarding 2017 Marawi Crisis in which he tagged various opposition senators and other people as masterminds of the attack based on a photo shared through social media and other blog sites which produces fake news. Another government official, Communications Assistant Secretary Margaux \"Mocha\" Uson has been accused of spreading fake news.\n\nThe prevalence of fake news in the Philippines have pushed lawmakers to file laws to combat it, like criminalizing its dissemination. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines strongly opposes the spread of fake news as a sin, and published a list of fake news websites.\n\nPolish historian noted fake news websites had infiltrated Poland through anti-establishment and right-wing sources that copied content from \"Russia Today\". Targalski observed there existed about 20 specific fake news websites in Poland that spread Russian disinformation in the form of fake news. One example cited was fake news that Ukraine announced the Polish city of Przemyśl as occupied Polish land.\n\nPoland's anti-EU Law and Justice (PiS) government has been accused of spreading \"illiberal disinformation\" to undermine public confidence in the European Union. Maria Snegovaya of Columbia University said: \"The true origins of this phenomenon are local. The policies of Fidesz and Law and Justice have a lot in common with Putin's own policies.\"\n\nSome mainstream outlets were long accused of fabricating half-true or outright false information. One of popular TV stations, TVN, in 2010 attributed to Jarosław Kaczyński (then an opposition leader) words that \"there will be times, when true Poles will come to the power\". However, Kaczyński has never uttered those words in the commented speech.\n\nSingapore criminalises the propagation of fake news. Under existing law, \"Any person who transmits or causes to be transmitted a message which he knows to be false or fabricated shall be guilty of an offence\".\n\nOn 18 March 2015, a doctored screenshot of Prime Minister's Office website claiming the demise of the Lee Kuan Yew went viral, and several international news agencies such as CNN and China Central Television initially reported it as news, until corrected by the Prime Minister's Office. The image was created by a student to demonstrate to his classmates how fake news could be easily created and propagated. In 2017, Singaporean news website \"Mothership.sg\" was criticised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) for propagating remarks falsely attributed to a MOE official. In addition, Minister of Law K Shanmugam also singled out online news website \"The States Times Review\" as an example of a source of fake news, as it once claimed a near-zero turnout at the state funeral of President S. R. Nathan.\n\nFollowing these incidents, Shanmugam stated that the existing legalisation is limited and ineffective and indicated that the government intends to introduce legislation to combat fake news in 2018. In 2017, the Ministry of Communications and Information set up \"Factually\", a website intended to debunk false rumours regarding issues of public interest such as the environment, housing and transport, while in 2018, the Parliament of Singapore formed a Select Committee to consider new legislation to tackle fake news.\n\nActivist platform \"The Online Citizen\" regarded legislation against fake news as an attempt by the government to curb the free flow of information so that only information approved by the government is disseminated to the public. In an online essay, activist and historian Thum Ping Tjin denied that fake news was a problem in Singapore, and accused the People's Action Party government as the only major source of fake news, claiming that detentions made without trial during Operation Coldstore and Operation Spectrum were based on fake news for party political gain.\n\nFacebook and Google have opposed the introduction of new laws to combat fake news, claiming that existing legislation is adequate to address the problem and that an effective way of combating misinformation is through educating citizens on how to distinguish reliable from unreliable information.\n\nA wide range of South African media sources have reported fake news as a growing problem and tool to both increase distrust in the media, discredit political opponents, and divert attention from corruption. Media outlets owned by the Gupta family have been noted by other South African media organisations such as The Huffington Post (South Africa), \"Sunday Times,\" Radio 702, and \"City Press\" for targeting them. Individuals targeted include Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who was seen as blocking Gupta attempts at state capture with accusations levelled against Gordhan of promoting state capture for \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC) was taken to court by Sihle Bolani for unpaid work she did during the election on the ANC's behalf. In court papers Bolani stated that the ANC used her to launch and run a covert R50 million fake news and disinformation campaign during the 2016 municipal elections with the intention of discrediting opposition parties.\n\nSouth Korean journalists and media experts lament political hostility between Korea's which distorts Media coverage of North Korea and North Korea has attributed erroneous reporting to South Korea and United States with being critical to media organization Chosun Ilbo while also American journalist Barbara Demick had made similar criticisms on media coverage of North.\n\nOn November 27, 2018, prosecutors raided the house of Gyeonggi Province governor Lee Jae-myung amid suspicions that his wife used a pseudonymous Twitter handle to spread fake news about President Moon Jae-in and other political rivals of her husband. \n\nFake news in Spain has become much more prevalent in the 2010s, but has been a major factor in Spain's history. The United States government published a fake article in regards to the purchase of the Philippines from Spain, which they had already purchased. Despite this, the topic of fake news has traditionally not been given much attention to in Spain, until the newspaper \"El País\" launched the new blog dedicated strictly to truthful news entitled \"Hechos\"; which literally translates to \"fact\" in Spanish. David Alandete, the managing editor of \"El País\", stated how many people misinterpret fake news as real because the sites \"have similar names, typography, layouts and are deliberately confusing\" (Southern). Alandete made it the new mission of \"El País\" \"to respond to fake news\" (Scott). María Ramírez of Univision Communications has stated that much of the political fake news circulating in Spain is due to the lack of investigative journalism on the topics. Most recently \"El País\" has created a fact-checking position for five employees, to try and debunk the fake news released.\n\nThe Swedish Security Service issued a report in 2015 identifying propaganda from Russia infiltrating Sweden with the objective to amplify pro-Russian propaganda and inflame societal conflicts. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), part of the Ministry of Defence of Sweden, identified fake news reports targeting Sweden in 2016 that originated from Russia. Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency official Mikael Tofvesson stated a pattern emerged where views critical of Sweden were constantly repeated. \"The Local\" identified these tactics as a form of psychological warfare. The newspaper reported the MSB identified \"Russia Today\" and \"Sputnik News\" as significant fake news purveyors. As a result of growth in this propaganda in Sweden, the MSB planned to hire six additional security officials to fight back against the campaign of fraudulent information.\n\nIn February 2017, Amnesty International reported that up to 13,000 people had been hanged in a Syrian prison as part of an “extermination” campaign. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad questioned the credibility of Amnesty International and called the report \"fake news\" fabricated to undermine the government. \"You can forge anything these days – we are living in a fake news era.”\nRussia ran a disinformation campaign during the Syrian Civil War to discredit the humanitarian rescue organisation White Helmets, and to discredit reports and images of children and other civilian bombing victims. This was done to weaken criticism of Russia's involvement in the war. The United Nations and international chemical inspectors found Bashar al-Assad responsible for use of chemical weapons, which was called \"fake news\" by Russia. Russia promoted various contradictory claims that no chemicals were present, or attributing the chemical attacks to other countries or groups.\n\nIn a report in December 2015 by \"The China Post\", a fake video shared online showed people a light show purportedly made at the Shihmen Reservoir. The Northern Region Water Resources Office confirmed there was no light show at the reservoir and the event had been fabricated. The fraud led to an increase in tourist visits to the actual attraction.\n\nAccording to the news updated paper from the Time World in regards the global threat to free speech, the Taiwanese government has reformed its policy on education and it will include \"media literacy\" as one part of school curriculum for the students. It will be included to develop the critical thinking skills needed while using social media. Further, the work of media literacy will also include the skills needed to analyze propaganda and sources, so the student can clarify what is fake news.\n\nSince the Euromaidan and the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, the Ukrainian media circulated several fake news stories and misleading images, including a dead rebel photograph with a Photoshop-painted tattoo which allegedly indicated that he belonged to Russian Special Forces, a video game screenshot disguised as a satellite image ostensibly showing the shelling of the Ukrainian border from Russia, and the threat of a Russian nuclear attack against the Ukrainian troops. The recurring theme of these fake news was that Russia was solely to blame for the crisis and the war in Donbass.\n\nIn 2015 the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe published a report criticizing Russian disinformation campaigns to disrupt relations between Europe and Ukraine after ouster of Viktor Yanukovych. According to \"Deutsche Welle\", similar tactics were used by fake news websites during the US elections. A website, StopFake was created by Ukrainian activists in 2014 to debunk fake news in Ukraine, including media portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nOn May 29, 2018, the Ukrainian media and state officials announced that the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko was assassinated in his apartment in Kiev. Later, Babchenko appeared to be alive, and the Security Service of Ukraine claimed that the staged assassination was needed to arrest a person who allegedly was planning a real assassination. Alexander Baunov, writing for Carnegie.ru, mentioned that the staged assassination of Babchenko was the first instance of fake news delivered directly by the highest officials of a state.\n\nOn December 8, 2016, Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) Alex Younger delivered a speech to journalists at the MI6 headquarters where he called fake news and propaganda damaging to democracy. Younger said the mission of MI6 was to combat propaganda and fake news in order to deliver to his government a strategic advantage in the information warfare arena, and assist other nations including Europe. He called such methods of fake news propaganda online a \"fundamental threat to our sovereignty\". Younger said all nations that hold democratic values should feel the same worry over fake news.\n\nHowever, definitions of \"fake news\" have been controversial in the UK, with political satire being seen as a key element of British humour. Members of Parliament in the UK have been advised against using the term \"when describing the complexity of information disorder\", as the term \"fake news\" is \"woefully inadequate\":\n\nNeither the words 'fake' nor 'news' effectively capture this polluted information ecosystem. Much of the content used as examples in debates on this topic are not fake, they are genuine but used out of context or manipulated. Similarly, to understand the entire ecosystem of polluted information, we need to consider far more than content that mimics 'news'.\n\nFake news became a global subject and was widely introduced to billions as a subject mainly due to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Numerous political commentators and journalists wrote and stated in media that 2016 was the year of fake news and as a result nothing will ever be the same in politics and cyber security. Due to the fair amount of fake news in 2016, it became hard to tell what was real in 2017. Donald Trump tweeted or retweeted posts about \"fake news\" or \"fake media\" 176 times as of Dec. 20, 2017, according to an online archive of all of Trump's tweets. Governmental bodies in the U.S. and Europe started looking at contingencies and regulations to combat fake news specially when as part of a coordinated intelligence campaign by hostile foreign governments. Online tech giants Facebook and Google started putting in place means to combat fake news in 2016 as a result of the phenomenon becoming globally known. Google Trends shows that the term \"fake news\" gained traction in online searches in October 2016.\n\nProfessor Philip N. Howard of the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford studied web traffic in the United States prior to the election. He found that about one half of all news on Twitter directed at Michigan was junk or fake, and the other half came from actual professional news sources.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, during the last three months of the presidential campaign, of the top twenty fake election-related articles on Facebook, seventeen were anti-Clinton or pro-Trump. Facebook users interacted with them more often than with stories from genuine news outlets.\n\nDebate over the impact of fake news in the election, and whether or not it significantly impacted the election of the Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom the most shared fake stories favored, led researchers from Stanford to study the impact of fake news shared on social media, where 62% of U.S. adults get their news from. They assessed that 8% of readers of fake news recalled and believed in the content they were reading, though the same share of readers also recalled and believed in \"placebos\" — stories they did not actually read, but that were produced by the authors of the study. In comparison, over 50% of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories. The authors do not assess the final impact of these numbers on the election, but seek to \"offer theoretical and empirical background\" for the debate.\n\nIn the United States in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, fake news was particularly prevalent and spread rapidly over social media \"bots\", according to researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute. In a speech shortly after the election, former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton warned of the \"real-world consequences\" of fake news. Shortly thereafter, in the early weeks of his presidency, U.S. President Donald Trump frequently used the term \"fake news\" to refer to traditional news media, singling out CNN. Linguist George Lakoff says this creates confusion about the phrase's meaning. According to CBS \"60 Minutes\", President Trump may use the term fake news to describe any news, however legitimate or responsible, with which he may disagree.\n\nAfter Republican Colorado State Senator Ray Scott used the term as a reference to a column in the \"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel\", the newspaper's publisher threatened a defamation lawsuit.\n\nIn December 2016, an armed North Carolina man, Edgar Maddison Welch, traveled to Washington, D.C., and opened fire at the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, driven by a fake online news story known as the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which accused the pizzeria of hosting a pedophile ring run by Democratic Party leaders. These stories tend to go viral quickly. Social media systems, such as Facebook, play a large role in the broadcasting of fake news. These systems show users content that reflects their interests and history, leading to fake and misleading news. Following a plea agreement with prosecutors, Welch pleaded guilty to the federal charge of interstate transport of firearms and a District of Columbia charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. Welch was sentenced to four years in prison on June 22, 2017 and agreed to pay $5,744.33 for damages to the restaurant.\n\nA situation study by \"The New York Times\" shows how a tweet by a person with no more than 40 followers went viral and was shared 16,000 times on Twitter. The tweet concluded that protesters were paid to be bussed to Trump demonstrations and protest. A Twitter user then posted a photograph of two buses outside a building, claiming that those were the Anti-Trump protesters. The tweet immediately went viral on both Twitter and Facebook. Fake news can easily spread due to the speed and accessibility of modern communications technology.\n\nA CNN investigation examined exactly how fake news can start to trend. There are \"bots\" used by fake news publishers that make their articles appear more popular than they are. This makes it more likely for people to discover them. \"Bots are fake social media accounts that are programmed to automatically 'like' or retweet a particular message.\"\n\nFraudulent stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election included a viral post popularized on Facebook that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump, and another that actor Denzel Washington \"backs Trump in the most epic way possible\". Trump's son and campaign surrogate Eric Trump, top national security adviser Michael Flynn, and then-campaign managers Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski shared fake news stories during the campaign.\n\nStarting in July 2017, President Trump's 2020 presidential campaign launched \"Real News Update\", an online news program posted on Facebook. The series reports on Trump's accomplishments as president of the United States and claims to highlight \"real news\" as opposed to alleged \"fake news\". Lara Trump introduced one video by saying \"If you are tired of all the fake news out there...we are going to bring you nothing but the facts\" and \"I bet you haven't heard about all the accomplishments the president had this week, because there's so much fake news out there\". The show has been labelled as \"propaganda\".\n\nIn January 2018, it was reported that a Gallup-Knight Foundation survey found that 17% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans \"consider accurate news stories that cast a politician or political group in a negative light to always be 'fake news.'\" A June 2018 poll by Axios and Survey Monkey found that 72% of Americans believe \"traditional news outlets knowingly report false or misleading stories at least sometimes,\" with 92% of Republican and Republican-leaning independents and 53% of Democrats believing this.\n\nOn 4 August 2018, a documentary by German broadcaster Deutsche Welle stated that a documentary titled \"Venezuela — Escape from a Failed State\" was censored from Venezuelan television programming. On social media, Venezuelans voiced their anger of not being able to watch the program. Venezuela's journalist union SNTP stated that the state-run National Commission of Telecommunications (CONATEL) was responsible for the incident, with CONATEL denying the reports of censorship, stating \"Media of the right circulate fake news to destabilize the peace of the country\".\n\nLater on 3 September 2018, Vice President of Venezuela Delcy Rodríguez stated that the Venezuelan refugee crisis was \"fake news\" and that reports surrounding large scale migration were acts of propaganda designed to promote foreign intervention in Venezuela.\n\n\n"}

Goldman) is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. Her publications focus on questions in normative ethics, moral responsibility and structural questions common to normative theories.\n\nA recipient of the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Fellowship at the National Humanities Center (2013–14), she held an American Association of University Women Postgraduate Fellowship (1975–76) and a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for Independent Study (1982-83.)\n\nBetween 1985 and 2006 she held a series of increasingly responsible academic administrative positions, first at the University of Arizona, including Head, Department of Philosophy (1985–90), Vice Provost for Academic Affairs (1991-June 1993), and Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences (1993-July 2001); and then at Rutgers University-New Brunswick from 2001 to 2006: Executive Dean Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Dean of the Graduate School-New Brunswick. Active in national academic administrative organizations, she served as President of the Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences, a national organization of arts and sciences deans, during 2000-01.\n\nSmith received her early education in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Attending Wellesley College on a National Merit Scholarship, she received her B.A. as First Trustee Fellow in 1966, followed by an M.A. (1970) and a Ph.D. (1972) in Philosophy from the University of Michigan. Smith taught at Tufts University (1970–71), The University of Michigan at Flint (1971–72), The University of Pittsburgh (1972–73), The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (1973-80), The University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (1980–83), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Visiting Associate Professor, 1981–82), and The University of Arizona (1983-2001). From 2001 she has served as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.\n\nHer husband Alvin I. Goldman is Board of Governors Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers. Her sister Sherri Smith, a prominent fiber artist, is Catherine B. Heller Collegiate Professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nSmith’s philosophical work falls into four main areas: biomedical ethics (with an emphasis on reproductive ethics); consequentialism (the theory that the moral status of our acts depends on their consequences alone); moral responsibility; and normative ethics concerns that transcend particular normative theories.\n\nSmith defended a liberal perspective, arguing that the fetus has no natural right to the use of its mother’s body during pregnancy, and that it has no right to “rescue” by the mother.\n\nSmith focused on forms of rule utilitarianism, arguing, contra David Lyons, that act utilitarianism and full compliance forms of rule utilitarianism do not always prescribe the same actions, and maintaining that the project of finding an appropriate definition for “consequences” within rule utilitarianism had been misconceived and was doomed to failure.\n\nSmith explored how to assess an agent’s degree of credit or blameworthiness for an action when the agent acts from a mixture of good and bad motives. She worked on the question of whether an agent is blameworthy for a wrongful act done in culpable ignorance. Her most noted paper is “Culpable Ignorance,” which was named by \"The Philosopher’s Annual\" as one of the ten best articles in 1983. It analysed in detail the terms of the debate between those who argue that a person is blameworthy for an action performed in culpable ignorance, versus those who hold that while a person is blameworthy for the initial dereliction of failing to acquire information, that does not taint a subsequent action, done in culpable ignorance, that is itself done from acceptable motives.\n\nSmith concluded that the only defense for the position—a controversial one in law and philosophy—is one that holds people blameworthy for the unlucky consequences of their actions.\n\nLater she explored the implications of cognitive and social psychology for questions about moral responsibility, arguing that agents should not be held responsible for emotional reactions and behavior that issue from cognitive processes involving automatic (Kahneman/Tversky's System 1) responses to environmental stimuli.\n\nMuch of Smith’s work focused on questions about right and wrong that are common to many distinct ethical theories, including both consequentialist theories and deontological ones (the moral status of an act depends on features of an act other than its consequences, such as whether or not it involves telling a lie or breaking a promise). Her paper “Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection” helped launch a debate now known as the debate between Actualism and Possibilism by arguing for the first time in favor of Actualism. Possibilists believe that whether or not the agent ought to perform an immediate action depends on whether performing it would enable the ideal course of action in the future. Actualists believe that whether or not an agent ought to perform the action depends on what performing that action would actually lead her to do in the future.\n\nThe issue is illustrated by an example from Smith/Goldman’s later paper “Doing the Best One Can”. A graduate student asks faculty member S for comments on a paper he plans to present at a job interview. If S agrees and comments on the paper, the student will improve the paper substantially, have a highly successful interview, and receive an offer for a three-year job. If S accepts the task but fails to comment on the paper in time, the student will make no revisions, have a dismal interview, and receive no job offer. If S declines to provide comments, the student will elicit comments from a less expert faculty member, make less helpful revisions on the paper, have a moderately successful interview, and receive a one-year job offer. Clearly S’s accepting the task would enable her to follow the ideal course of action, namely reading and commenting on the paper in a timely way, resulting in the student’s receiving a three-year job. However, in reality if S accepted the task, she would actually fail to comment on the paper in time, either because she would misunderstand the deadline, or because she of her time-consuming administrative chores. In this case the student would receive no job offer. Possibilism recommends that S agree to comment, that would support her intent to follow the best course of action. Actualism takes a more realistic stance: it recommends that S decline since that would lead to a better outcome. Smith argues this case requires the same reasoning as a prudential decision, such as deciding to drive carefully to avoid a crash.\n\nSmith also considered the question of how to use moral theories in actual decision-making, especially given agent's lack of enough information about the world to ascertain accurately which action their favored moral theory implies. Thus the intent to avoid adultery may be thwarted by not knowing that a partner is actually married. And someone trying to follow W. D. Ross’s prima facie duty to keep promises may fail should she forget the promise. Smith repeatedly explored these “epistemic” problems and argued that the solution depends on recognizing that moral theories must be supplemented by a hierarchy of decision rules that prescribe acts as “subjectively right” to agents who are uncertain what the moral theory itself recommends. Smith was awarded a National Humanities Center Fellowship during 2013-14 to complete a book manuscript on this cluster of epistemic challenges to using morality to make decisions.\n\nSmith’s article \"Culpable Ignorance\" was selected by \"The Philosopher's Annual\" as one of the ten best articles to appear in print in 1983. Fellowships supporting her research included:\nWhile dean she was elected to the Presidency of the Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences (2000–01). She served as chair of the American Philosophical Association Pacific Division Program Committee, 1989–90, and is a member of the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" Editorial Board as subject co-editor for Normative Ethics (from August 2013).\n\n\n"}

This regulation is done via the programming of various transcription factors by the homeotic genes, and these factors affect genes through regulatory genetic pathways.\n\nMutations in homeotic genes cause displaced body parts, such as antennae growing at the posterior of the fly instead of at the head. Mutations that lead to such ectopic placements are usually lethal.\n\nThere are several subsets of homeotic genes. They include many of the Hox and ParaHox genes that are important for segmentation. Hox genes are found in bilateral animals, including \"Drosophila\" (in which they were first discovered) and humans. Hox genes are a subset of the homeobox genes. The Hox genes are often conserved across species, so some of the Hox genes of \"Drosophila\" are homologous to those in humans. In general, Hox genes play a role of regulating expression of genes as well as aiding in development and assignment of specific structures during embryonic growth. This can range from segmentation in \"Drosophila\" to central nervous system (CNS) development in vertebrates. Both Hox and ParaHox are grouped as HOX-Like (HOXL) genes, a subset of the ANTP class (named after the \"Drosophila\" gene, Antennapedia).\n\nThey also include the MADS-box-containing genes involved in the ABC model of flower development. Besides flower-producing plants, the MADS-box motif is also present in other organisms such as insects, yeasts, and mammals. They have various functions depending on the organism including flower development, proto-oncogene transcription, and gene regulation in specific cells (such as muscle cells).\n\nDespite the terms being commonly interchanged, not all homeotic genes are Hox genes; the MADS-box genes are homeotic but not Hox genes. Thus, the Hox genes are a subset of homeotic genes.\n\nOne of the most commonly studied model organisms in regards to homeotic genes is the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\". Its homeotic genes occur in either the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) or the Bithorax complex (BX-C) discovered by Edward B. Lewis. Each of the complexes focuses on a different area of development. The antennapedia complex consists of five genes, including proboscipedia, and is involved in the development of the front of the embryo, forming the segments of the head and thorax. The bithorax complex consists of three main genes and is involved in the development of the back of the embryo, namely the abdomen and the posterior segments of the thorax.\n\nDuring development (starting at the blastoderm stage of the embryo), these genes are constantly expressed to assign structures and roles to the different segments of the fly's body. For \"Drosophila\", these genes can be analyzed using the Flybase database.\n\nMuch research has been done on homeotic genes in different organisms, ranging from basic understanding of how the molecules work to mutations to how homeotic genes affect the human body. Changing the expression levels of homeotic genes can negatively impact the organism. For example, in one study, a pathogenic phytoplasma caused homeotic genes in a flowering plant to either be significantly upregulated or downregulated. This led to severe phenotypic changes including dwarfing, defects in the pistils, hypopigmentation, and the development of leaf-like structures on most floral organs. In another study, it was found that the homeotic gene \"Cdx2\" acts as a tumor suppressor. In normal expression levels, the gene prevents tumorgenesis and colorectal cancer when exposed to carcinogens; however, when \"Cdx2\" was not well expressed, carcinogens caused tumor development. These studies, along with many others, show the importance of homeotic genes even after development.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35713040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35713040", "title": "Mimesis criticism", "text": "Mimesis criticism\n\nMimesis criticism is a method of interpreting texts in relation to their literary or cultural models. Mimesis, or imitation (\"imitatio\"), was a widely used rhetorical tool in antiquity up until the 18th century's romantic emphasis on originality. Mimesis criticism looks to identify intertextual relationships between two texts that go beyond simple echoes, allusions, citations, or redactions. The effects of imitation are usually manifested in the later text by means of distinct characterization, motifs, and/or plot structure.\n\nAs a critical method, mimesis criticism has been pioneered by Dennis MacDonald, especially in relation to New Testament and other early Christian narratives imitating the \"canonical\" works of Classical Greek literature.\n\nGreek rhetorician Aristotle (4th century ) discusses the rhetorical technique of mimesis or imitation; what Aristotle describes, however, is the author's imitation of nature, not earlier literary or cultural models.\n\nPhilodemus of Gadara (1st century ), an Epicurean philosopher and poet and one of Virgil's teachers, affirms that writers of prose histories and fictions used literary models. He writes (rhetorically) in book five of \"On Poetry\", \"Who would claim that the writing of prose is not reliant on the Homeric poems?\" (5.30.36-31.)\n\nA Greek historian and rhetorician from the late first century /early first century , Dionysius of Halicarnassus represents a change from the Aristotelian rhetorical notion of mimesis, from imitation of nature to imitation of literature. His most important work in this respect, \"On Mimesis\" (, \"Perì mimēseōs\"), survives only in fragments. Apparently, most of this work concerned the proper selection of literary models.\n\nRoman rhetorician M. Fabius Quintilianus published his twelve-volume \"Institutio oratoria\" around 95 . In book 10, Quintilian - who was well-read with respect to both Greek and Latin rhetoricians, including Dionysius - gives advice to teachers who are instructing students in oration. He tells them that, by the time students begin composition, they should be so well-versed in exemplary models that are able to imitate them without physically consulting them (10.1.5). Quintilian writes,\nFor in everything which we teach examples are more effective even than the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the assistance of a teacher, and can rely on his own powers to imitate them. (10.1.15; Butler, LCL)\nHe also advises that students constantly reread the exemplary models (10.1.19), not only in sections but all the way through (10.1.20), so that they might be empowered to imitate these models with more craft and subtlety.\n\nOf course, the selection of one's literary model is of the utmost importance. In Quintilian's opinion, one could find no better model than Homer, \"for he has given us a model and an inspiration for very department of eloquence\" (10.1.46; Butler, LCL). When it comes to the act of imitation itself, he writes,\nThere can be no doubt that in art no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since, although invention came first and is all-important, it is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented with success. And it is a universal rule of life that we should wish to copy what we approve in others. It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of letters that they may learn to write, and that musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters the works of their predecessors, and peasants the principles of agriculture which have been proved in practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we may note that the elementary study of every branch of learning is directed by reference to some definite standard that is placed before the learner. (10.2.1-2; Butler, LCL)\nFurthermore, students are encouraged to \"improve\" upon their chosen models (10.2.12). One way for students to accomplish this task, Quintilian says, is to imitate several models in eclectic fashion: \"We shall do well to keep a number of different excellences before our eyes, so that different qualities from different authors may impose themselves on our minds, to be adopted for use in the place that becomes them best\" (10.2.26; Butler, LCL). On this point, Quintilian was at odds with Cicero, who felt it best for authors to imitate a single author.\n\nIn order to circumvent the capriciousness of subjectivity, MacDonald suggests six criteria for determining whether a claim for a mimetic connection between texts is reasonable: accessibility, analogy, density, order, distinctive traits, and interpretability. The first two criteria concern the status of the text used as a model (\"ante-text\"); the final four concern the later text that may have used the antetext.\n\n\nTwo examples of imitation within the New Testament will be outlined. The first pertains to Luke's use of 1 Kings 17 as a literary model. The second outlines Luke's imitation of Homer's \"Odyssey\" 10-12 in Acts 20.\nOne can justifiably argue that Luke used 1 Kings 17:9-24 as a model for Luke 7:11-16 because it meets the criteria of mimesis criticism. Criterion 1 (Accessibility): Luke cites this very story in Luke 4:25-26. Criterion 2 (Analogy): Mark provides an analogous imitation of 1 Kings 17 with his story about the raising of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:35-43). Criteria 3 (Density), 4 (Order), and 5 (Distinctive Traits) can be identified in the above table. The most important aspect for criterion 5 is the identical Greek wording for \"And he gave him to his mother.\" Criterion 6 (Interpretability): Luke improves upon his model in the following ways. In 1 Kings, the widow initiates the miracle by castigating Elijah for causing her son's death; in Luke, Jesus is the one to initiate the miracle. In 1 Kings, Elijah then reproaches God, asking if God has \"brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son\" (17:20); in Luke, Jesus does not blame God for the boy's death but instead has compassion for her. In 1 Kings, it is the who raises the boy, not Elijah; in Luke, it is Jesus himself. In 1 Kings, only the widow responds to the miracle; in Luke, a \"large crowd\" responds positively.\n\nIn the same way, one can justifiably argue that Luke has used the story of Elpenor from \"Odyssey\" 10-12 as a model for his account of Eutychus in Acts 20:5-12 using the criteria. Criterion 1 (Accessibility): Books 10-12 of \"Odyssey\" were among the most popular in antiquity. Criterion 2 (Analogy): Among the many imitations of these books in antiquity, Virgil's \"Aeneid\" contains two, the stories about Palinurus and Misenus. Criteria 3 (Density), 4 (Order), and 5 (Distinctive Traits) can be seen to be met by referring to the above table. Of particular significance is Luke's name choice: Homer often called Elpenor \"unlucky\" (\"Odyssey\" 11.61, 76, 80); Luke's Eutychus literally means \"good fortune.\" Furthermore, the raising of Luke's Eutychus occurs in the Troad, the cite of the Trojan War. Criterion 6 (Interpretability): Luke emulates Homer in the following ways. Elpenor fell to his death because he was in a drunken stupor; Eutychus appeared to die after falling asleep (out a window) while listening to Paul preach deep into the night. Odysseus was unaware of Elpenor's misfortune; Paul knew immediately about Eutychus' fall and also that \"his soul [was] still in him.\" Later in Homer's story, Elpenor's body was buried at dawn; at dawn, the other believers lifted up Eutychus alive.\n\nIn addition to imitating the Septuagint and Homer's \"Odyssey\", MacDonald proposes that Mark's Gospel and Luke-Acts used the following literary models: Homer's \"Iliad\", several \"Homeric Hymns\", Euripides' \"Bacchae\" and \"Madness of Heracles\", and dialogues by Plato and Xenophon about Socrates.\n\nIn his seminal work \"Christianizing Homer:\" The Odyssey\", Plato, and\" The Acts of Andrew, MacDonald argues that the second-century apocryphal work, the Acts of Andrew, was a Christian version of Homer's Iliad. Elsewhere, MacDonald has also argued for the presence of Homeric imitations in the Acts of Peter, another second-century apocryphal work.\n\nKarl Olav Sandnes, the most vocal of MacDonald's critics, objects that MacDonald's \"reading of both Mark's Gospel and Acts assumes a readership with an in-depth as well as extensive familiarity with the Homeric epics. This implies that the curriculum of encyclical studies had penetrated into the Christian movement to an extent which the present study has not confirmed. Ancient education was designed for the upper strata of the population.\" Thus, Sandnes argues deductively: Since such familiarity with Homer was limited to the upper stratum of society, and since the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts (nor their audiences) are not believed to belong to this stratum, then the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts simply \"could not\" have imitated Homer in the way MacDonald suggests.\n\nMacDonald's response has been threefold. First, a more sure decision about the education of the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts would result from an \"inductive\" approach to the question, rather than Sandnes' \"deductive\" approach. Second, access to Homer was \"not\" restricted to the cultural elite. According to a first-century writer, \"From the earliest age, children beginning their studies are nursed on Homer's teaching. One might say that while we were still in swathing bands we sucked from his epics as from fresh milk. He assists the beginner and later the adult in his prime. In no stage of life, from boyhood to old age, do we ever cease to drink from him.\" Finally, MacDonald notes that Sandnes does not offer any other explanation for the parallels between the New Testament writings and Homer.\n\nMargaret M. Mitchell has also published a critical response to MacDonald's work on Homeric imitation within the New Testament. MacDonald addresses Mitchell's critiques, as well as earlier criticism from Sandnes, in an article titled, \"My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism.'\"\n\nMacDonald's arguments for the mimetic nature of the Gospel narratives have influenced how some view the question of the historicity of Jesus. Some have taken the extremist position that all of the Gospel narratives are exclusively the byproduct of the Evangelists' literary imagination, influenced by Homer and the Septuagintal narratives, and not historical memory. Perhaps this is due to a misunderstanding of MacDonald's claim that the Gospel of Mark was an \"intentional fiction.\" MacDonald believes that such a stance is taking matters too far, although he himself holds to a minimalist view of the Historical Jesus. This debate is usually generated in non-academic circles, such as YouTube video blogs.\n\n\n"}

He is co-initiator of the Jerusalem-Project.\n\nNiklaus Brantschen grew up with six brothers and sisters in a traditionally Catholic family; he is a skilled mountaineer.\n\nWhen he was 22 years old he joined the Society of Jesus. After the novitiate in Villars-sur-Glâne he received the licentiate of the Munich University of Philosophy in 1964. As practical studies he worked in 1964-67 as an educator at Stella Matutina in Feldkirch, Austria followed by three years of theology studies at the university of Fourvière, Lyon, France and a fourth year at the University of Tübingen, among others from the professors Eberhard Jüngel, Jürgen Moltmann, Walter Kasper, Hans Küng; Licentiate work about Dietrich Bonhoeffer. In 1970 he celebrated his first Mass (liturgy) in Randa. From 1973 he made a certificate study in adult's education in Munich as assistant of meditation teacher Klemens Tilmann, followed by meditation courses with Karlfried Graf Dürckheim.\n\nFrom 1976 he made regular education stays for Zen studies in Kamakura, Kanagawa/Japan with Hugo Makibi Enomiya-Lassalle and Yamada Kôun Roshi. There, meetings with Heinrich Dumoulin, Jerry Brown, Willigis Jäger, Johannes Kopp. In 1988 he was given the teaching competence for Zen by Yamada Roshi, in 1999 he received the confirmation of a Zen master (\"inka shōmei\") from Tetsugen Bernard Glassman.\n\n1986 Brantschen met Jerry Brown in Japan and held inspiring conversations, 1987 he practised Zen together also with him.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1977, Brantschen was assistant manager of the educational institution Bad Schönbrunn near Menzingen, until 1987 he was its manager. For the next five years he worked as a student minister at different colleges in Zürich. In 1993 he positioned the educational institution Bad Schönbrunn new as a centre for spirituality and social consciousness and renamed it . In 1995, together with Pia Gyger, he founded the , an institution in the fields of Zen, ethics and leadership, which they both led until 2002. Within the institute both are involved especially in the project \"Jerusalem – Open town for learning of the peace in the world\" which takes them regularly to Jerusalem and to the UN in New York.\n\nAccording to Brantschen there is no alternative to the interfaith dialogue. Interfaith dialogue is not only conversation, but also the positive, constructive relations between persons and communities of other religions for their mutual enrichment. \"To be religious today calls to be interreligious, not only bilaterally but multilaterally.“\n\nBrantschen considers the dialog with Buddhism as an enriching, but not straight or concluded way between the East and West, which springs up in the suspense between real Zen-experience and imitation of Christ. He sees strong parallels between Christian spiritual exercises and Zen-practice, which for him have formed a synthesis during the years.\n\nThe practice of Zen is a way to remove the barriers between religions, nations and races – to create a united humanity.\n\nFor Brantschen collaboration in partnership is an important contribution for a necessary global change of consciousness. Something truly new originates only if man and woman live a culture of partnership with equal rights. For him „humanity is like a bird with both wings like man and woman. If a wing is not equally developed, we do have a banking bird which cannot make his way.“\n\nIn his characteristic style Brantschen summarizes his judgments in concise sentences:\n\nBrantschen has written 14 books, most in German, some edited in Italian or Spanish.\n\n"}

{"id": "69677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69677", "title": "Ramon Llull", "text": "Ramon Llull\n\nRamon Llull, T.O.S.F. (; c. 1232 – c. 1315; Anglicised \"Raymond Lully\", \"Raymond Lull\"; in Latin \"Raimundus\" or \"Raymundus Lullus\" or \"Lullius\") was a philosopher, logician, Franciscan tertiary and writer from the Kingdom of Majorca. He is credited with writing the first major work of Catalan literature. Recently surfaced manuscripts show his work to have predated by several centuries prominent work on elections theory. He is also considered a pioneer of computation theory, especially given his influence on Leibniz.\n\nSince his first writings, there has been confusion in the church regarding whether he was a saint or a heretic. Ramon Lull has had a sanctification process open in the Vatican since the times of Philip II. King Philip was one of the impulsors of this process. The Spanish king was extremely fond of his work and used parts of it in the creation of the monasterio del Escorial. Prior to that, Lull was considered a heretic by most, and the debate regarding both King Philip II and him continued in Rome long afterwards. Lull's works were prohibited by the Spanish Inquisition under the same king Philip, for he considered that \"non-initiates could not understand them\". Copies of the works were safely stored in the Library of El Escorial and were consulted by Spanish Scholars, mostly sympathetic to Lull's views.\n\nWithin the Franciscan Order he is honoured as a martyr. He was beatified in 1847 by Pope Pius IX. His feast day was assigned to 30 June and is celebrated by the Third Order of St. Francis.\n\nLlull was born into a wealthy family in Palma, the capital of the newly formed Kingdom of Majorca. James I of Aragon founded Majorca to integrate the recently conquered territories of the Balearic Islands (now part of Spain) into the Crown of Aragon. Llull's parents had come from Catalonia as part of the effort to colonize the formerly Almohad ruled island. As the island had been conquered militarily, the Muslim population who had not been able to flee the conquering Christians had been enslaved, even though they still constituted a significant portion of the island's population.\n\nIn 1257 he married Blanca Picany, with whom he had two children, Domènec and Magdalena. Although he formed a family, he lived what he would later call the licentious and wasteful life of a troubadour.\n\nLlull served as tutor to James II of Aragon, and later became Seneschal (the administrative head of the royal household) to the future King James II of Majorca, a relative of his wife.\n\nIn 1263 Llull experienced a religious epiphany in the form of a series of visions. He narrates the event in his autobiography \"Vita coaetanea\" (\"Daily Life\"):\n\nThe vision came to him five times in all, leading him to leave his family, position, and belongings in order to pursue a life in the service of God. Specifically, he realized three intentions: to die in the service of God while converting Muslims to Christianity, to see to the founding of religious institutions that would teach foreign languages, and to write a book on how to overcome someone's objections to being converted.\n\nFollowing his epiphany Llull became a Franciscan tertiary (a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis), taking inspiration from Saint Francis of Assisi. After a short pilgrimage he returned to Majorca, where he purchased a Muslim slave from whom he wanted to learn Arabic. For the next nine years, until 1274, he engaged in study and contemplation in relative solitude. He read extensively in both Latin and Arabic, learning both Christian and Muslim theological and philosophical thought.\n\nBetween 1271 and 1274 he wrote his first works, a compendium of the Muslim thinker Al-Ghazali's logic and the \"Llibre de contemplació en Déu\" (\"Book on the Contemplation of God\"), a lengthy guide to finding truth through contemplation.\n\nIn 1274, while staying at a hermitage on Puig de Randa, the form of the great book he was to write was finally given to him through divine revelation: a complex system that he named his \"Art\", which would become the motivation behind most of his life's efforts.\n\nLlull urged the study of Arabic and other then-insufficiently studied languages in Europe, along with most of his works, to convert Muslims and schismatic Christians. He travelled through Europe to meet with popes, kings, and princes, trying to establish special colleges to prepare future missionaries.\n\nIn 1285, he embarked on his first mission to North Africa but was expelled from Tunis. Llull travelled to Tunis a second time in about 1304, and wrote numerous letters to the king of Tunis, but little else is known about this part of his life.\n\nIn the early 14th century, Llull again visited North Africa. He returned in 1308, reporting that the conversion of Muslims should be achieved through prayer, not through military force. He finally achieved his goal of linguistic education at major universities in 1311 when the Council of Vienne ordered the creation of chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Chaldean (Aramaic) at the universities of Bologna, Oxford, Paris, and Salamanca as well as at the Papal Court.\n\nFollowing the favourable attitude of some Franciscan theologians to this truth, Llull's position on this subject was of great importance because it paved the way for the doctrine of Duns Scotus, whom he met in 1297, after which he was given the nickname \"Doctor Illuminatus\", even if it seems that he had not direct influence on him. Llull is the first author to use the expression \"Immaculate Conception\" to designate the Virgin's exemption from original sin. He appears to have been the first to teach this doctrine publicly at the University of Paris.\n\nTo explain this Marian privilege, he resorts to three arguments:\n\n1. The Son of God could not become incarnate in a mother who was stained by sin in any way:\n\n2. There had to be a certain likeness between the Son's generation without sin and the generation of his Mother:\n3. The second creation, that is the Redemption, which began with Christ and Mary, had to happen under the sign of the most total purity, as was the case with the first creation:\n\nIn a sermon entitled \"The Fruit of Mary's Womb\", Llull states that,\n\nIn 1314, at the age of 82, Llull traveled again to North Africa where he was stoned by an angry crowd of Muslims in the city of Bougie. Genoese merchants took him back to Mallorca, where he died at home in Palma the following year. Though the traditional date of his death has been 29 June 1315, his last documents, which date from December 1315, and recent research point to the first quarter of 1316 as the most probable death date.\n\nIt can be documented that Llull was buried at the Church of Saint Francis in Mallorca by March 1316. Riber states that the circumstances of his death remain a mystery. Zwemer, a Protestant missionary and academic, accepted the story of martyrdom, as did an article in the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" published in 1911 (see links in the References section). Bonner gives as a reason for Llull's journey to Tunis the information that its ruler was interested in Christianity—false information given to the Kings of Sicily and Aragon and relayed to Llull.\n\nLlull was extremely prolific, writing a total of more than 250 works in Catalan, Latin, and Arabic, and often translating from one language to the others. While almost all of his writings after the revelation on Mt. Randa connect to his \"Art\" in some way, he wrote on diverse subjects in a variety of styles and genres.\n\nThe romantic novel \"Blanquerna\" is widely considered the first major work of literature written in Catalan, and possibly the first European novel.\n\nHis first elucidation of the \"Art\" was in \"Art Abreujada d'Atrobar Veritat\" (\"The Abbreviated Art of Finding Truth\"), in 1290.\n\nAfter spending some time teaching in France and being disappointed by the poor reception of his \"Art\" among students, he decided to revise it. It is this revised version that he became known for. It is most clearly presented in his \"Ars generalis ultima\" or \"Ars magna\" (\"The Ultimate General Art\" or \"The Great Art\", published in 1305).\n\nThe \"Art\" operated by combining religious and philosophical attributes selected from a number of lists. It is believed that Llull's inspiration for the \"Ars magna\" came from observing Arab astrologers use a device called a zairja.\n\nThe \"Art\" was intended as a debating tool for winning Muslims to the Christian faith through logic and reason. Through his detailed analytical efforts, Llull built an in-depth theosophic reference by which a reader could enter any argument or question (necessarily reduced to Christian beliefs, which Llull identified as being held in common with other monotheistic religions). The reader then used visual aids and a book of charts to combine various ideas, generating statements which came together to form an answer.\n\nOne of the most significant changes between the original and the second version of the \"Art\" was in the visuals used. The early version used 16 figures presented as complex, complementary trees, while the system of the \"Ars Magna\" featured only four, including one which combined the other three. This figure, a \"Lullian Circle,\" took the form of a paper machine operated by rotating concentrically arranged circles to combine his symbolic alphabet, which was repeated on each level. These combinations were said to show all possible truth about the subject of inquiry. Llull based this notion on the idea that there were a limited number of basic, undeniable truths in all fields of knowledge, and that everything about these fields of knowledge could be understood by studying combinations of these elemental truths.\n\nThe method was an early attempt to use logical means to produce knowledge. Llull hoped to show that Christian doctrines could be obtained artificially from a fixed set of preliminary ideas. For example, the most essential table listed the attributes of God: goodness, greatness, eternity, power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth and glory. Llull knew that all believers in the monotheistic religions—whether Jews, Muslims or Christians—would agree with these attributes, giving him a firm platform from which to argue.\n\nThe idea was developed further for more esoteric purposes by Giordano Bruno in the 16th century, and in the 17th century by the \"Great Rationalist\" Gottfried Leibniz, who wrote his dissertation about Llull's \"Art\" and integrated it into his metaphysics and philosophy of science. Leibniz gave Llull's idea the name \"ars combinatoria\", by which it is now often known.\n\nSome computer scientists have adopted Llull as a sort of founding father, claiming that his system of logic was the beginning of information science.\n\nLlull is known to have written at least 265 works, including:\n\nA considerable body of work on esoteric subjects was misattributed to Llull in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The oeuvre of the pseudo-Llull (and, by extension, that of the actual Llull) was influential among Hermeticists, Gnostics, and other Esoterics. Llull himself explicitly condemned many of the subjects, such as alchemy, that he is purported to have written about.\n\nThe Roman Catholic inquisitor Nicholas Eymerich condemned 100 theories or ideas of Llull as errors in 1376. Pope Gregory XI also formally condemned 20 of his books in 1376 and the condemnation was renewed by Pope Paul IV, although Pope Martin V reversed the condemnation of Pope Gregory XI in 1416. Despite these condemnations, Llull himself remained in good standing with the Church.\n\nChairs for the propagation of the theories of Llull were established at the University of Barcelona and the University of Valencia. He is regarded as one of the most influential authors in Catalan; the language is sometimes referred to as \"la llengua de Llull\", as other languages might be referred to as \"Shakespeare's language\" (English), \"la langue de Molière\" (French), \"la lengua de Cervantes\" (Spanish) or \"die Sprache Goethes\" (German).\n\nThe logo of the Spanish \"Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas\" (\"Higher Council of Scientific Research\") is Llull's Tree of Science. Ramon Llull University, a private university established in Barcelona in 1990, is named after the philosopher.\n\nWith the discovery in 2001 of his lost manuscripts, \"Ars notandi\", \"Ars eleccionis\", and \"Alia ars eleccionis\", Llull is given credit for discovering the Borda count and Condorcet criterion, which Jean-Charles de Borda and Nicolas de Condorcet independently proposed centuries later. The terms Llull winner and Llull loser are ideas in contemporary voting systems studies that are named in honor of Llull. Also, Llull is recognized as a pioneer of computation theory, especially due to his great influence on Gottfried Leibniz. Llull's systems of organizing concepts using devices such as trees, ladders, and wheels, have been analyzed as classification systems.\n\nThe inspiration of Llull's mnemonic graphic cartwheels, reaching into contemporary art and culture, is demonstrated by Daniel Libeskind's architectural construction of the 2003 completed Studio Weil in Port d'Andratx, Majorca. \"Studio Weil, a development of the virtuality of these mnemonic wheels which ever center and de-center the universal and the personal, is built to open these circular islands which float like all artwork in the oceans of memory.\"\n\nPaul Auster refers to Llull (as Raymond Lull) in his memoir \"The Invention of Solitude\" in the second part, \"The Book of Memory\". Llull, now going under the name 'Cole Hawlings' and revealed to be immortal, is a major character in \"The Box of Delights\", the celebrated children's novel by poet John Masefield. He is also a major influence on the fictional character Zermano in Thomas Salazar's \"The Day of the Bees\", and his name, philosophies, and quotes from his writings appear throughout the novel. In Roberto Bolaño's novel \"2666\", Amalfitano, a Chilean professor, thinks about \"Ramon Llull and his fantastic machine. Fantastic in its uselessness.\" Adán, Leopoldo Marechal's protagonist of the novel \"Adán Buenosayres\" (1948), mentions Ramon Lulio when he walks past a \"curtiembre\" (a leather-tanning shop): He says: \"Ramon Lulio, que aconsejaba no rehuir del olor de las letrinas a fin de recordar a menudo lo que da el cuerpo de si mismo en su tan frecuentemente olvidada miseria\" (Edición Crítica, Colección Archivos, 1997. Page 312) (\"Ramon Llull advised not to shy away from the smell of outhouses, in order not to forget that which the body gives out in its often forgotten misery.\") In William Gaddis' first novel, \"The Recognitions\", the final paragraph of Chapter II alludes to \"Raymond Lully\", as a \"scholar, a poet, a missionary, a mystic, and one of the foremost figures in the history of alchemy.\" Llull is also mentioned in passing in Neil Gaiman's comic-book \"Calliope,\" an issue of the DC/Vertigo series \"The Sandman.\" In \"The Commodore\", the 17th book in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series, Stephen Maturin remarks that his daughter \"...will learn Spanish, too, Castellano. I am sorry it will not be Catalan, a much finer, older, purer, more mellifluous language, with far greater writers — think of En Ramon Llull — but as Captain Aubrey often says, 'You cannot both have a stitch in time and eat it.'\"\n\nHarry Harrison, in \"Deathworld 2\", has his protagonist, Jason dinAlt, use the Book of the Order of Chivalry, along with others, to disable the engines of the spaceship on which he is being held. As the ship starts to blow up, he remarks \"I should not have thrown in the Lull book, it is more than even the ship could stomach.\" This comes at the end of an argument with his kidnapper, in which dinAlt attacks the idea that there are universal laws which apply to all human beings for all time.\n\nW. B. Yeats refers to Llull twice in \"Rosa Alchemica\", first published in 1897 (\"I turned to my last purchase, a set of alchemical apparatus which, the dealer in the Rue le Peletier had assured me, once belonged to Raymond Lully\"; and \"There were the works [...] of Lully, who transformed himself into the likeness of a red cock\"). His \"first eight poems in \"The Green Helmet and Other Poems\" were published under the general title 'Raymond Lully and his wife Pernella'; an erratum-slip corrected this: 'AN ERROR By a slip of the pen when I was writing out the heading for the first group of poems, I put Raymond Lully's name in the room of the later Alchemist, Nicolas Flamel'\".\n\nGordon R. Dickson has the protagonist, Hal Mayne, in the book \"The Final Encyclopedia\", (1984) refer to Lull and his combination-of-wheels device, which Hal states is ″nothing less than a sort of primitive computer.″\n\nLlull's mission to convert the Jews of Europe was zealous; his goal was to utterly relieve Christendom of any Jews or Jewish religious influence. Some scholars regard Llull's as the first comprehensive articulation, in the Christian West, of an expulsionist policy regarding Jews who refused conversion. To acquire converts, he worked for amicable public debate to foster an intellectual appreciation of a rational Christianity among the Jews of his time. His rabbinic opponents included Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet of Barcelona and Moshe ben Shlomo of Salerno.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Publications such as \"Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincaré\" (1978), \"Relativity and geometry\" (1983) and \"El paraíso de Cantor\" (1998) have made Torretti a leading authority on the philosophy of science. Much of Torretti’s work has dealt with physics and mathematics, with a major focus on relativity theory and 19th century geometry. He has devoted the book \"El Paraíso de Cantor\" to the set-theoretical tradition in logic and philosophy of mathematics. Together with Jesús Mosterín, he has written an original and comprehensive dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.\n\n\n\n"}

The effect is named after Robin Hood, said to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor.\n\nA Robin Hood effect can be caused by a large number of different policies or economic decisions, not all of which are specifically aimed at reducing inequality. This article lists only some of these.\n\nSimon Kuznets argued that one major factor behind levels of economic inequality is the stage of economic development of a country. Kuznets described a curve-like relationship between level of income and inequality, as shown. That theory prescribes that countries with very low levels of development will have relatively equal distributions of wealth.\n\nAs a country develops, it necessarily acquires more capital, and the owners of this capital will then have more wealth and income, which introduces inequality. However, eventually various possible redistribution mechanisms such as trickle down effects and social welfare programs will lead to a Robin Hood effect, with wealth redistributed to the poor. Therefore, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.\n\nMany countries have an income tax system where the first part of a worker's salary is taxed very little or not at all, while those on higher salaries must pay a higher tax rate on earnings over a certain threshold, known as progressive taxation. This has the effect of the better-off population paying a higher proportion of their salary in tax, effectively subsidising the less-well off, leading to a Robin Hood effect.\n\nSpecifically, a progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. \"Progressive\" describes a distribution effect on income or expenditure, referring to the way the rate progresses from low to high, where the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate. It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower ability-to-pay, as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay.\n\nIn many developing countries, mobile communications networks tend to experience a large network externality, which regulators and operators seek to correct by subsidising subscriptions through increased prices for call termination. That then allows the less-well off in that country to gain access to communications services, often for free (on a prepay tariff). The additional cost is then levied on subscribers who make calls to these new subscribers; the call originators tend to be better-off. Therefore, despite there being no direct transfer of money, there is a strong Robin Hood effect, with the better-off subsidising the less well-off.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7201028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7201028", "title": "Round square copula", "text": "Round square copula\n\nThe \"round square copula\" is a common example of the dual copula strategy used in reference to the problem of nonexistent objects as well as their relation to problems in modern philosophy of language. The issue arose, most notably, between the theories of Alexius Meinong, Bertrand Russell—Gilbert Ryle playing a minor part as well in the eventual dismissal of Meinong's object theory (see Meinong's 1904 book, \"Theory of Objects\").\n\nThe strategy employed is the dual copula strategy, which is used to make a distinction between relations of properties and individuals. It entails creating a sentence that isn't supposed to make sense by forcing the term \"is\" into ambiguous meaning.\n\nBy borrowing Edward Zalta's notational method (\"Fb\" stands for \"b exemplifies\" the property of being \"F\"; \"bF\" stands for \"b encodes\" the property of being \"F\"), and using a revised version of Meinongian object theory which makes use of a dual copula distinction (\"MOT\"), we can say that the object called \"the round square\" encodes the property of being round, the property of being square, all properties implied by these, and no others. But it is true that there are also infinitely many properties being exemplified by an object called the round square (and, really, any object)—e.g. the property of not being a computer, and the property of not being a pyramid. Note that this strategy has forced \"is\" to abandon its predicative use, and now functions abstractly.\n\nWhen one now analyzes the round square copula using the \"MOT\", one will find that it now avoids the three common paradoxes: (1) The violation of the law of contradiction, (2) The paradox of claiming the property of existence without actually existing, and (3) producing counterintuitive consequences. Firstly, the \"MOT\" shows that the round square does not exemplify the property of being round, but the property of being round and square. Thus, there is no subsequent contradiction. Secondly, it avoids the conflict of existence/non-existence by claiming non-physical existence: by the \"MOT\", it can only be said that the round square simply does not exemplify the property of occupying a region in space. Finally, the \"MOT\" avoids counterintuitive consequences (like a 'thing' having the property of nonexistence) by stressing that the round square copula can be said merely to encode the property of being round and square, not actually exemplifying it. Thus, logically, it does \"not\" belong to any set or class.\n\nIn the end, what the \"MOT\" really does is created a kind of object: a nonexistent object that is very different from the objects we might normally think of. Occasionally, references to this notion, while obscure, may be called \"Meinongian objects.\"\n\nMaking use of the notion of \"non-physically existent\" objects is \"highly\" controversial in philosophy, and created the buzz for many articles and books on the subject during the first half of the 20th century. There are other strategies for avoiding the problems of Meinong's theories, but they suffer from serious problems as well.\n\nFirst is the \"other worlds\" strategy. Similar to the ideas explained with Possible worlds theory, this strategy employs considering that logical principles and the law of contradiction have limits, but without assuming that everything is true. Enumerated and championed by Graham Priest, who was heavily influenced by Richard Routley, this strategy forms the notion of \"noneism\". In short, assuming there exist infinite possible and impossible worlds, objects are freed from necessarily existing in all worlds, but instead may exist in impossible worlds (where the law of contradiction does not apply, for example) and not in the actual world. Unfortunately, accepting this strategy entails accepting the host of problems that come with it, such as the ontological status of impossible worlds.\n\nSecondly, there is the strategy of nuclear-extranuclear properties. According to Meinong, it is possible to distinguish the natural (nuclear) properties of an object, from its external (extranuclear) properties. Terence Parsons identifies four types of extranuclear properties: ontological, modal, intentional, technical—however, philosophers dispute Parson's claims in number and kind. Additionally, Meinong states that nuclear properties are either constitutive or consecutive, meaning properties that are either explicitly contained or implied/included in a description of the object. Essentially the strategy denies the possibility for objects to have only \"one\" property, and instead they may have only one \"nuclear\" property. Meinong himself, however, found this solution to be inadequate in several ways and its inclusion only served to muddle the definition of an object.\n"}

{"id": "69317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69317", "title": "Samaritan Pentateuch", "text": "Samaritan Pentateuch\n\nThe Samaritan Pentateuch, also known as the Samaritan Torah ( \"torah shomronit\"), is a text of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, written in the Samaritan alphabet and used as scripture by the Samaritans. It constitutes their entire biblical canon. \n\nSome six thousand differences exist between the Samaritan and the Masoretic Text. Most are minor variations in the spelling of words or grammatical constructions, but others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Nearly two thousand of these textual variations agree with the Koine Greek Septuagint and some are shared with the Latin Vulgate. Throughout their history, Samaritans have made use of translations of the Samaritan Pentateuch into Aramaic, Greek and Arabic as well as liturgical and exegetical works based upon it.\n\nIt first became known to the Western world in 1631, proving the first example of the Samaritan alphabet and sparking an intense theological debate regarding its relative age versus the Masoretic text. Some Pentateuchal manuscripts discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls have been identified as bearing a \"pre-Samaritan\" text type. Wide agreement now exists among textual critics that the Samaritan Pentateuch represents an authentic ancient textual tradition despite the presence of some unique variants introduced by the Samaritans.\n\nSamaritans believe that God authored their Pentateuch and gave Moses the first copy along with the two tablets containing the Ten Commandments. They believe that they preserve this divinely composed text uncorrupted to the present day. Samaritans commonly refer to their Pentateuch as (\"The Truth\").\n\nSamaritans include only the Pentateuch in their biblical canon. They do not recognize divine authorship or inspiration in any other book in the Jewish Tanakh. A Samaritan Book of Joshua partly based upon the Tanakh's Book of Joshua exists, but Samaritans regard it as a non-canonical secular historical chronicle.\n\nAccording to a view based on the biblical Book of Ezra (), the Samaritans are the people of Samaria who parted ways with the people of Judah (the Judahites) in the Persian period. The Samaritans believe that it was not they, but the Jews, who separated from the authentic stream of Judaism, around the time of Eli, in the 11th century BCE. Jews have traditionally connected the origin of the Samaritans with the later events described in claiming that the Samaritans are not related to the Israelites, but to those brought to Samaria by the Assyrians.\n\nModern scholarship connects the formation of the Samaritan community with events which followed the Babylonian Captivity. One view is that the Samaritans are the people of the Kingdom of Israel who separated from the Judaites (people of Judah). Another view is that the event happened somewhere around 432 BCE, when Manasseh, the son-in-law of Sanballat, went off to found a community in Samaria, as related in Nehemiah 13:28 and Josephus. Josephus himself, however, dates this event and the building of the temple at Shechem to the time of Alexander the Great. Others believe that the real schism between the peoples did not take place until Hasmonean times when the Gerizim temple was destroyed in 128 BCE by John Hyrcanus. The script of the Samaritan Pentateuch, its close connections at many points with the Septuagint, and its even closer agreements with the present Hebrew text, all suggest a date about 122 BCE.\n\nExcavation work undertaken since 1982 by Yitzhak Magen has firmly dated the temple structures on Gerizim to the middle of the 5th century, built by Sanballat the Horonite, a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah, who lived more than one hundred years before the Sanballat that is mentioned by Josephus. \n\nThe adoption of the Pentateuch as the sacred text of the Samaritans before their final schism with the Palestinian Jewish community provides evidence that it was already widely accepted as a canonical authority in that region.\n\nManuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch are written in a different Hebrew script than is used in other Hebrew Pentateuchs. Samaritans employ the Samaritan alphabet which is derived from the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet used by the Israelite community prior to the Babylonian captivity. Afterwards, Jews adopted a script based on the Aramaic alphabet that developed into the Hebrew alphabet. Originally all manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consisted of unvocalized text written using only the letters of the Samaritan alphabet. Beginning in the 12th century, some manuscripts show a partial vocalization resembling the Jewish Tiberian vocalization used in Masoretic manuscripts. More recently a few manuscripts have been produced with full vocalization. However, many extant manuscripts show no tendency towards vocalization. The Pentateuchal text is divided into 904 paragraphs. Divisions between sections of text are marked with various combinations of lines, dots or an asterisk; a dot is used to indicate the separation between words.\n\nThe critical apparatus accompanying the London Polyglot's publication of the Samaritan Pentateuch lists six thousand instances where the Samaritan differs from the Masoretic Text. However, as different printed editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch are based upon different sets of manuscripts, the precise number varies significantly from one edition to another.\n\nOnly a minority are significant; most can be categorized as one of the following types:\n\nAmong the most notable semantic differences are those related to the Samaritan place of worship on Mount Gerizim. The Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments commands that an altar be built on Mount Gerizim on which all sacrifices should be offered. The Samaritan Pentateuch contains this text at Exodus 20:17:\nThis commandment is absent from the corresponding text of the Ten Commandments in the Masoretic. The Samaritan Pentateuch's inclusion of the Gerizim variation within the Ten Commandments places additional emphasis on the divine sanction given to that community's place of worship. This variation has similarities to and is supported by changes to the verbal tense within the Samaritan text of Deuteronomy indicating that God has already chosen this place. The future tense (\"will choose\") is used in the Masoretic. And whereas in the Masoretic commands an altar to be constructed on Mount Ebal, the Samaritan texts has Mount Gerizim.\n\nIn () Samaritan Pentateuch contains the following passage after the prohibition: [כי עשה זאת כזבח שכח ועברה היא לאלהי יעקב] which roughly translates \"that one doing this as sacrifice forgets and enrages God of Jacob\".\n\nIn () Samaritan Pentateuch contains the following passage: [ולקחו בגד ארגמן וכסו את הכיור ואת כנו ונתנו אתם אל מכסה עור תחש ונתנו על המוט] which roughly translates \"And they will take a purple covering and cover the laver and his foot, and they cover it in Tachash skins, and they put it upon a bar.\"\n\nSeveral other types of differences are found. The Samaritan Pentateuch uses less anthropomorphic language in descriptions of God with intermediaries performing actions the Masoretic version attributes directly to God. Where the Masoretic describes Yahweh as a \"man of war\" (), the Samaritan has \"hero of war\", a phrase applied to spiritual beings, and in , the Samaritan reading \"The Angel of God found Balaam\" contrasts with the Masoretic \"And God met Balaam.\" A few differences reflect Samaritan notions of propriety, such as the alteration in of the Masoretic \"upon the knees of Joseph\" to \"in the days of Joseph.\" Samaritan scribes, who interpreted this verse literally, found it improper that the mother of Joseph's grandchildren would give birth on his knees. Distinctive variants in the Samaritan are also found in certain legal texts where Samaritan practice varies from that prescribed within rabbinical halachic texts.\n\nIn about thirty-four instances, the Samaritan Pentateuch imports text from parallel or synoptic passages in other parts of the Pentateuch. These textual expansions record conversations and events that are implied or presupposed by other parts of the narrative, but not explicitly recorded in the Masoretic text. For example, the Samaritan text in the Book of Exodus on multiple occasions records Moses repeating to Pharaoh exactly what both the Samaritan and Masoretic record God instructing Moses to tell him. The result is repetitious, but the Samaritan makes it clear that Moses spoke exactly as God commanded him. In addition to these substantial textual expansions, the Samaritan Pentateuch on numerous occasions adds subjects, prepositions, particles, appositives, and the repetition of words and phrases within a single passage to clarify the meaning of the text.\n\nThe Septuagint (LXX) agrees with the Samaritan in approximately 1900 of the six thousand variations from the Masoretic. Many of these agreements reflect inconsequential grammatical details, but some are significant. For example, in the Samaritan and the Septuagint reads:\n\nIn the Masoretic text, the passage reads:\n\nSome passages in the Latin Vulgate show agreements with the Samaritan against the Masoretic. For example, in the Samaritan has \"land of Moreh\" (Hebrew: מוראה) while the Masoretic has \"land of Moriah\" (Hebrew: מריה). \"Land of Moreh\" is considered to be a Samaritan variant because \"Moreh\" describes the region around Shechem, where Mount Gerizim is situated. The Vulgate translates this phrase as \"in terram visionis\" (\"in the land of vision\") which implies that Jerome was familiar with the reading \"Moreh\", a Hebrew word whose trilateral root suggests \"vision.\"\n\nThe earliest recorded assessments of the Samaritan Pentateuch are found in rabbinical literature and Christian patristic writings of the first millennium CE. The Talmud records Rabbi Eleazar b. Simeon condemning the Samaritan scribes: \"You have falsified your Pentateuch...and you have not profited aught by it.\" Some early Christian writers found the Samaritan Pentateuch useful for textual criticism. Cyril of Alexandria, Procopius of Gaza and others spoke of certain words missing from the Jewish Bible, but present in the Samaritan Pentateuch. Eusebius of Caesarea wrote that the \"Greek translation [of the Bible] also differs from the Hebrew, though not so much from the Samaritan\" and noted that the Septuagint agrees with the Samaritan Pentateuch in the number of years elapsed from Noah's Flood to Abraham. Christian interest in the Samaritan Pentateuch fell into neglect during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 17th-century Europe reawakened interest in the text and fueled a controversy between Protestants and Roman Catholics over which Old Testament textual traditions are authoritative. Roman Catholics showed a particular interest in the study of the Samaritan Pentateuch on account of the antiquity of the text and its frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, two Bible translations to which Catholics have traditionally ascribed considerable authority. Some Catholics including Jean Morin, a convert from Calvinism to Catholicism, argued that the Samaritan Pentateuch's correspondences with the Latin Vulgate and Septuagint indicated that it represents a more authentic Hebrew text than the Masoretic. Several Protestants replied with a defense of the Masoretic text's authority and argued that the Samaritan text is a late and unreliable derivation from the Masoretic.\n\nThe 18th-century Protestant Hebrew scholar Benjamin Kennicott's analysis of the Samaritan Pentateuch stands as a notable exception to the general trend of early Protestant research on the text. He questioned the underlying assumption that the Masoretic text must be more authentic simply because it has been more widely accepted as the authoritative Hebrew version of the Pentateuch:\n\nKennicott also states that the reading Gerizim may actually be the original reading, since that is the mountain for proclaiming blessings, and that it is very green and rich of vegetation (as opposed to Mt. Ebal, which is barren and the mountain for proclaiming curses) amongst other arguments.\n\nGerman scholar Wilhelm Gesenius published a study of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1815 which biblical scholars widely embraced for the next century. He argued that the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch share a common source in a family of Hebrew manuscripts which he named the \"Alexandrino-Samaritanus\". In contrast to the proto-Masoretic \"Judean\" manuscripts carefully preserved and copied in Jerusalem, he regarded the Alexandrino-Samaritanus as having been carelessly handled by scribal copyists who popularized, simplified, and expanded the text. Gesenius concluded that the Masoretic text is almost invariably superior to the Samaritan.\n\nIn 1915 Paul Kahle published a paper which compared passages from the Samaritan text to Pentateuchal quotations in the New Testament and pseudepigraphal texts including the Book of Jubilees, the First Book of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses. He concluded that the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves \"many genuine old readings and an ancient form of the Pentateuch.\" Support for Kahle's thesis was bolstered by the discovery of biblical manuscripts among the Dead Sea Scrolls, approximately five percent of which contain a text similar to the Samaritan Pentateuch. Apart from the sectarian variants unique to the Samaritan Pentateuch such as the reference to the worship of God on Mount Gerizim, the Dead Sea Scroll texts have demonstrated that a Pentateuchal text type resembling the Samaritan Pentateuch goes back to the second century BCE and perhaps even earlier. Other Dead Sea Scroll Pentateuchal manuscripts show a close affinity to the later Masoretic text. These discoveries have demonstrated that manuscripts bearing a \"pre-Samaritan\" text of at least some portions of the Pentateuch such as Exodus and Numbers circulated alongside other manuscripts with a \"pre-Masoretic\" text. One Dead Sea Scroll copy of the Book of Exodus, conventionally named 4QpaleoExod, shows a particularly close relation to the Samaritan Pentateuch:\n\nFrank Moore Cross has described the origin of the Samaritan Pentateuch within the context of his local texts hypothesis. He views the Samaritan Pentateuch as having emerged from a manuscript tradition local to Palestine. The Hebrew texts that form the underlying basis for the Septuagint branched from the Palestinian tradition as Jews emigrated to Egypt and took copies of the Pentateuch with them. Cross states that the Samaritan and the Septuagint share a nearer common ancestor than either does with the Masoretic, which he suggested developed from local texts used by the Babylonian Jewish community. His explanation accounts for the Samaritan and the Septuagint sharing variants not found in the Masoretic and their differences reflecting the period of their independent development as distinct Egyptian and Palestinian local text traditions. On the basis of archaizing and pseudo-archaic forms, Cross dates the emergence of the Samaritan Pentateuch as a uniquely Samaritan textual tradition to the post-Maccabaean age.\n\nScholars have tended to presuppose that the Samaritan Pentateuch consists of two \"layers\", one composed of the sectarian variants introduced by Samaritan scribes and a second layer reflecting the text's earlier transmission history as a \"pre-Samaritan\" Palestinian local text. In light of recent research \"it is now clear that the Samaritan layer is very thin.\" Although the majority of scholars continue to favor the Masoretic as a superior text, many other scholars have now adopted Kahle's thesis. Scholars now widely agree though that many textual variants previously classified as \"Samaritan\" actually derive from even earlier phases of the Pentateuch's textual history.\n\nKennicott's claim that Gerizim is the original reading continues to be a subject of discussion. Dead Sea Scroll fragment 4Q41(981) contains a text of which makes no reference to Mount Gerizim, but matches the Masoretic Text. The New Testament also agrees with the Masoretic version designating Jerusalem as the \"chosen place\". However, some scholars hold that constitutes one occasion where the Samaritan's \"Gerizim\" may be the original reading.\"\n\nThe Samaritan Targum, composed in the Samaritan dialect of Aramaic, is the earliest translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch. Its creation was motivated by the same need to translate the Pentateuch into the Aramaic language spoken by the community which led to the creation of Jewish Targums such as Targum Onkelos. Samaritans have traditionally ascribed the Targum to Nathanael, a Samaritan priest who died circa 20 BCE. The Samaritan Targum has a complex textual tradition represented by manuscripts belonging to one of three fundamental text types exhibiting substantial divergences from one another. Affinities that the oldest of these textual traditions share with the Dead Sea Scrolls and Onkelos suggest that the Targum may originate from the same school which finalized the Samaritan Pentateuch itself. Others have placed the origin of the Targum around the beginning of the third century or even later. Extant manuscripts of the Targum are \"extremely difficult to use\" on account of scribal errors caused by a faulty understanding of Hebrew on the part of the Targum's translators and a faulty understanding of Aramaic on the part of later copyists.\n\nScholia of Origen's Hexapla and the writings of some church fathers contain references to \"the Samaritikon\" (Greek: το Σαμαρείτικον)., a work that is no longer extant. Despite earlier suggestions that it was merely a series of Greek scholia translated from the Samaritan Pentateuch, scholars now concur that it was a complete Greek translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch either directly translated from it or via the Samaritan Targum. It may have been composed for the use of a Greek-speaking Samaritan community residing in Egypt.\n\nWith the displacement of Samaritan Aramaic by Arabic as the language of the Samaritan community in the centuries following the Muslim conquest of Syria, they employed several Arabic translations of the Pentateuch. The oldest was an adaptation of Saadia Gaon's Arabic translation of the Jewish Torah. Although the text was modified to suit the Samaritan community, it still retained many unaltered Jewish readings. By the 11th or 12th centuries, a new Arabic translation directly based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch had appeared in Nablus. Manuscripts containing this translation are notable for their bilingual or trilingual character; the Arabic text is accompanied by the original Samaritan Hebrew in a parallel column and sometimes the Aramaic text of the Samaritan Targum in a third. Later Arabic translations also appeared; one featured a further Samaritan revision of Saadia Gaon's translation to bring it into greater conformity with the Samaritan Pentateuch and others were based upon Arabic Pentateuchal translations used by Christians.\n\nIn April 2013, a complete English translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch comparing it to the Masoretic version was published.\n\nSeveral biblical commentaries and other theological texts based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch have been composed by members of the Samaritan community from the fourth century CE onwards. Samaritans also employ liturgical texts containing catenae extracted from their Pentateuch.\n\nSamaritans attach special importance to the \"Abisha Scroll\" used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus. It consists of a continuous length of parchment sewn together from the skins of rams that, according to a Samaritan tradition, were ritually sacrificed. The text is written in gold letters. Rollers tipped with ornamental knobs are attached to both ends of the parchment and the whole is kept in a cylindrical silver case when not in use. Samaritans claim it was penned by Abishua, great-grandson of Aaron (), thirteen years after the entry into the land of Israel under the leadership of Joshua, son of Nun, although contemporary scholars describe it as a composite of several fragmentary scrolls each penned between the 12th and 14th centuries CE. Other manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consist of vellum or cotton paper written upon with black ink. Numerous manuscripts of the text exist, but none written in the original Hebrew or in translation predates the Middle Ages. The scroll contains a cryptogram, dubbed the \"tashqil\" by scholars, which Samaritans consider to be Abishua's ancient colophon:\nI, Abishua,—the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, unto them be accorded the grace of YHWH and His glory—wrote the holy book at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation, at Mount Gerizim, in the year thirteen of the possession by the children of Israel, of the Land of Canaan according to its boundaries [all] around; I praise YHWH.\n\nInterest in the Samaritan Pentateuch was awakened in 1616 when the traveler Pietro della Valle purchased a copy of the text in Damascus. This manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library. In 1631, an edited copy of Codex B was published in Le Jay's (Paris) Polyglot by Jean Morin. It was republished in Walton's Polyglot in 1657. Subsequently, Archbishop Ussher and others procured additional copies which were brought to Europe and later, America.\n\nUntil the latter half of the 20th century, critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch were largely based upon Codex B. The most notable of these is \"Der Hebräische Pentateuch der Samaritaner\" (\"The Hebrew Pentateuch of the Samaritans\") compiled by August von Gall and published in 1918. An extensive critical apparatus is included listing variant readings found in previously published manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch. His work is still regarded as being generally accurate despite the presence of some errors, but it neglects important manuscripts including the Abisha Scroll which had not yet been published at the time. Textual variants found in the Abisha scroll were published in 1959 by Federico Pérez Castro and between 1961 and 1965 by A. and R. Sadaqa in \"Jewish and Samaritan Versions of the Pentateuch – With Particular Stress on the Differences Between Both Texts\". In 1976 L.F. Giron-Blanc published Codex Add. 1846, a Samaritan Pentateuch codex dating to 1100 CE in the critical edition \"Pentateuco Hebreo-Samaritano: Génesis\" supplemented with variants found in fifteen previously unpublished manuscripts. Certain recently published critical editions of Pentateuchal books take Samaritan variants into account, including D.L. Phillips' edition of Exodus.\n\nSeveral publications containing the text of the Samaritan Targum have appeared. In 1875, the German scholar Adolf Brüll published his \"Das samaritanische Targum zum Pentateuch\" (\"The Samaritan Targum to the Pentateuch\"). More recently a two volume set edited by Abraham Tal appeared featuring the first critical edition based upon all extant manuscripts containing the Targumic text.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He describes the postulated interactions as constituting a \"society of mind\", hence the title.\n\nThe work, which first appeared in 1986, was the first comprehensive description of Minsky's \"society of mind\" theory, which he began developing in the early 1970s. It is composed of 270 self-contained essays which are divided into 30 general chapters. The book was also made into a CD-ROM version.\n\nIn the process of explaining the society of mind, Minsky introduces a wide range of ideas and concepts. He develops theories about how processes such as language, memory, and learning work, and also covers concepts such as consciousness, the sense of self, and free will; because of this, many view \"The Society of Mind\" as a work of philosophy.\n\nThe book was not written to prove anything specific about AI or cognitive science, and does not reference physical brain structures. Instead, it is a collection of ideas about how the mind and thinking work on the conceptual level.\n\nMinsky first started developing the theory with Seymour Papert in the early 1970s. Minsky said that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.\n\nA core tenet of Minsky's philosophy is that \"minds are what brains do\". The society of mind theory views the human mind and any other naturally evolved cognitive systems as a vast society of individually simple processes known as \"agents\". These processes are the fundamental thinking entities from which minds are built, and together produce the many abilities we attribute to minds. The great power in viewing a mind as a society of agents, as opposed to the consequence of some basic principle or some simple formal system, is that different agents can be based on different types of processes with different purposes, ways of representing knowledge, and methods for producing results.\nThis idea is perhaps best summarized by the following quote:\n\n\n"}

In November of that year he signed \"The Chartered Guidance from Meher Baba for the Reorientation of Sufism\". He appointed Ivy O. Duce as the first Murshida, or spiritual guide, of Sufism Reoriented.\n\nMeher Baba designed Sufism Reoriented as a universal spiritual school which recognizes a central core of divine love at the heart of all spiritual systems. Meher Baba reorganized patterns of life and inner training associated with ancient Sufism and adapted them to the needs of spiritual students in contemporary America. He identified the central principles of Sufism Reoriented as love and service: active love for God and active service to others in God’s world.\n\nSufism was originally brought to the West by Hazrat Inayat Khan (1882–1927) in 1910. He appointed Rabia Martin as his successor and Murshida of his Sufi Order. In the 1940s, Rabia Martin recognized Avatar Meher Baba as the reigning spiritual authority of the age and surrendered herself and her spiritual order to him. She appointed Ivy Oneita Duce as her successor as Murshida of the Sufi Order. In 1948 Murshida Duce was called to India by Meher Baba who confirmed her role as Murshida and announced that he intended to reorient Sufism under his guidance and her leadership in the near future. This was realized in 1952 with the creation of Sufism Reoriented.\n\nThe members of Sufism Reoriented celebrate Meher Baba as the Avatar, the human incarnation of God and the spiritual authority of this age. This represents a substantial departure from Sufism in either its traditional Islamic form, or in the form taught by Hazrat Inayat Khan. Meher Baba asserted that Sufism pre-dates the Islamic prophet Muhammad, having begun with the prophet Zoroaster of Persia.\n\nThose drawn to Sufism Reoriented also recognize a natural affinity with the school’s spiritual teacher, who occupies the office of Murshid. The term \"Murshid\" or \"Murshida\" means Guide. It is used in traditional Sufism to refer to the spiritual figure who directs a Sufi school. Meher Baba, who described himself as the \"Murshid of Murshids\", first received Murshida Rabia Martin as His follower, and agreed to guide her and her Sufi group. However, Murshida Martin died before meeting Meher Baba physically. Before passing, Murshida Martin made Ivy Oneita Duce (1895–1981) her successor (the next Murshida) of the Sufi Order. In 1952 Meher Baba appointed her the first Murshida of Sufism Reoriented. Meher Baba confirmed this in India upon meeting Murshida Duce there. Before her death, Murshida Duce named Dr. James S. B. MacKie (1932–2001) as her successor. He, in turn, designated Carol Weyland Conner, the current Murshida, as his successor.\n\nSufism Reoriented is the copyright holder and publisher of several books by and about Meher Baba including Meher Baba's most important published book, \"God Speaks: the Theme of Creation and Its Purpose\". It also owns and publishes \"Beams from Meher Baba on the Spiritual Panorama\", \"Life At Its Best\", \"Glimpses of the God-Man Meher Baba. Volume I\", and \"How a Master Works\" by Ivy Oneita Duce. In addition Sufism Reoriented owns and preserves numerous films and photographs of Baba. These include color 16mm films taken of Baba during his trip to the United States in 1956 by Charmian Duce Knowles, daughter of Murshida Ivy Oneita Duce.\n\nAfter decades of operating out of temporary facilities, Sufism Reoriented began construction of a new, permanent sanctuary on May 24, 2012. The new sanctuary, designed by the architectural firm of Philip Johnson Alan Ritchie, was formally inaugurated on February 26, 2017. The sanctuary is located on three acres of land in the Saranap neighborhood of Walnut Creek, about twenty-five miles east of San Francisco. Carol Weyland Conner, the current Murshida of Sufism Reoriented, has characterized the sanctuary as follows:“In all spiritual traditions, the design of a sanctuary strives to be an outward expression, in material form, of the still, sacred space at the center of the human heart where man is joined with and can know God. It therefore aspires, first, to be the most beautiful form its creators can envision...My primary aim was to create a beautiful building that is an expression of our worship. The sanctuary’s curvilinear design is based on the form of the circle. Like God, the circle has no beginning and no end. This expresses eternity, the eternal life in God the Infinite. The circle is also recognized as a symbol of unity since all points on the circle are equidistant from the center, as all beings are in relation to God. This symbol embodies the essential unity of Creation and the Universal Love at the heart of all life.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31054", "title": "Theological virtues", "text": "Theological virtues\n\nTheological virtues are virtues associated in Christian theology and philosophy with salvation resulting from the grace of God. Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally they have been named Faith, Hope, and Charity, and can trace their importance in Christian theology to Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 13, who also pointed out that charity is the most important.\n\nThe medieval Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas explained that these virtues are called theological virtues \"because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures\".\n\nA person receives the theological virtues by their being \"infused\"—through Divine grace—into the person. The theological virtues are so named because their object is the divine being (theos).\n\nThe first mention in Christian literature of the three theological virtues is in St. Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians 1:3, \"...calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope...\" He later refers to this triad of virtues again, \"But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation.\" \nIn 1 Corinthians 13, Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). \"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\" First, because it informs the other two: \"It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\" Secondly, from a temporal perspective, love lasts, while \"Hope isn't hope if its object is seen\", and faith gives way to possession.\n\nAquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (\"prudentia\") and moral virtue (e.g. courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness). This is frequently termed \"the Unity of the Virtues.\"\n\nAquinas stated that theological virtues are so called \"because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures\".\n\nIn his treatment of the virtues, Aquinas viewed the theological virtues as being the product of habitual grace. According to Aquinas, this grace, through the theological virtues, allows humanity to become agents in meritorious action that is beyond their own natural ability. In this way it is supernatural.\n\nAquinas says \"Faith has the character of a virtue, not because of the things it believes, for faith is of things that appear not, but because it adheres to the testimony of one in whom truth is infallibly found\". (De Veritate, xiv, 8)\n\nAquinas further connected the theological virtues with the cardinal virtues. He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological virtues, caused by habitual grace, to find their fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal virtues.\n\nThe moral virtues are acquired by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology holds that the theological virtues differ from the cardinal virtues in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. Like the cardinal virtues, an individual who exercises these virtues strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.\n\nFollowing St. Augustine, Aquinas also recognized a separate but related type of moral virtue which is also infused by God. The distinction lies both in their source and end. The moral virtue of temperance recognizes food as a good that sustains life, but guards against the sin of gluttony. The \"infused\" virtue of temperance disposes the individual to practice fasting and abstinence. The infused moral virtues are connected to the theological virtue of Charity.\n\nPope Benedict XVI wrote three encyclicals about the theological virtues: \"Deus caritas est\" (about love), \"Spe salvi\" (about hope), and \"Lumen fidei\" (about faith: this encyclical was written both by Pope Benedict XVI and by Pope Francis).\n\n\n\n"}

His work (written primarily in French) attempted to unite phenomenology with Marxist philosophy. His work had some currency in France in the 1950s and 1960s, and was cited favorably by Jacques Derrida, Jean-François Lyotard and Louis Althusser.\nTrần Đức Thảo was born in Hanoi, French Indochina, he was educated there, completing his baccalaureate at 17. In 1936, he continued his studies in France, becoming a student of Maurice Merleau-Ponty at the École Normale Supérieure where he wrote a dissertation for a diplôme d’études supérieures on Hegel. In 1943, he completed his agrégation with a thesis on the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, being received premier ex aequo alongside Jules Vuillemin. Through the 1940s, he worked on his first book, \"Phenomenology and Dialectical Materialism\". The book argued that the defects of the phenomenological account of consciousness could only be remedied by the Marxist account of labor and society. In the 1940s and 50s, Trần Đức Thảo’s ideas achieved some currency among the elite philosophical circles of France. At the same time, he became an active anti-colonialist, publishing articles in Jean-Paul Sartre and Merleau-Ponty’s journal \"Les Temps modernes\" about colonialism in Indochina; these articles were read by Frantz Fanon and other anticolonialists. From October to December 1945, Trần Đức Thảo was jailed by the French government as a threat to its security.\n\n\"Phenomenology and Dialectical Materialism\" was published in 1951, and in the same year he returned to Vietnam, working in support of the Communist Party. In 1956, he was named the Dean of History in the country’s first national university. \n\nBut he became critical of the Party over land reforms which had led to many deaths in 1956, and Trần Đức Thảo was caught up in the Nhan Van-Giai Pham affair in which the dissident intellectuals of the late 1950s were publicly criticized or punished. Though Tran Duc Thao was never jailed, he fell out of favor with the ruling Party, publishing two self-criticisms in \"Nhân Dân\" and leaving his position of authority in 1958. None of his work was published in his home country from 1965 until 1987.\nFor the next thirty years, his profile was lower, as he worked in the rural provinces translating philosophy into Vietnamese and preparing his book \"Investigations into the Origin of Language and Consciousness\". This book, published in France in 1973, combined materialist biological and cognitive accounts of subjectivity and consciousness with the Marxist account he had elaborated earlier. In the liberalized political climate of the 1980s, he was able to return to France for medical treatment, and there he met many of his old philosophical colleagues again, although he lived in poverty in an apartment at the Vietnamese embassy. He died in Paris in 1993 and was cremated at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1519001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1519001", "title": "Verstehen", "text": "Verstehen\n\nVerstehen (, literally: \"to understand\"), in the context of German philosophy and social sciences in general, has been used since the late 19th century – in English as in German – with the particular sense of the \"interpretive or participatory\" examination of social phenomena. The term is closely associated with the work of the German sociologist, Max Weber, whose antipositivism established an alternative to prior sociological positivism and economic determinism, rooted in the analysis of social action. In anthropology, \"Verstehen\" has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture attempts to relate to it and understand others. \n\n\"Verstehen\" is now seen as a concept and a method central to a rejection of positivistic social science (although Weber appeared to think that the two could be united). \"Verstehen\" refers to understanding the meaning of action from the actor's point of view. It is entering into the shoes of the other, and adopting this research stance requires treating the actor as a subject, rather than an object of your observations. It also implies that unlike objects in the natural world human actors are not simply the product of the pulls and pushes of external forces. Individuals are seen to create the world by organizing their own understanding of it and giving it meaning. To do research on actors without taking into account the meanings they attribute to their actions or environment is to treat them like objects.\n\nInterpretative sociology (\"verstehende Soziologie\") is the study of society that concentrates on the meanings people associate to their social world. Interpretative sociology strives to show that reality is constructed by people themselves in their daily lives.\n\n\"Verstehen\" roughly translates to \"meaningful understanding\" or \"putting yourself in the shoes of others to see things from their perspective\". Interpretive sociology differs from positivist sociology in three ways:\n\n\"Verstehen\" was introduced into philosophy and the human sciences (\"Geisteswissenschaften\") by the German historist philosopher Johann Gustav Droysen. He first made a distinction between nature and history in terms of the categories of space and time. The method of the natural sciences (\"Naturwissenschaften\") is explanation (\"erklären\"), while that of history is understanding (\"verstehen\").\n\nThe concept of \"Verstehen\" was later used by the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey to describe the first-person participatory perspective that agents have on their individual experience as well as their culture, history, and society. In this sense, it is developed in the context of the theory and practice of \"interpretation\" (as understood in the context of hermeneutics) and contrasted with the external objectivating third-person perspective of \"explanation\" (\"das Erklären\") in which human agency, subjectivity, and its products are analyzed as effects of impersonal natural forces in the natural sciences and social structures in sociology.\n\nTwentieth-century philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer have been critical of what they considered to be the romantic and subjective character of \"Verstehen\" in Dilthey, although both Dilthey and the early Heidegger were interested in the \"facticity\" and \"life-context\" of understanding, and sought to universalize it as the way humans exist through language on the basis of ontology. \"Verstehen\" also played a role in Edmund Husserl and Alfred Schutz's analysis of the \"lifeworld.\" Jürgen Habermas and Karl-Otto Apel further transformed the concept of \"Verstehen\", reformulating it on the basis of a transcendental-pragmatic philosophy of language and the theory of communicative action.\n\nMax Weber and Georg Simmel introduced interpretive understanding (\"Verstehen\") into sociology, where it has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture (such as an anthropologist or sociologist) relates to an indigenous people or sub-cultural group on their own terms and from their own point of view, rather than interpreting them in terms of his or her own culture. \"Verstehen\" can mean either a kind of empathic or participatory understanding of social phenomena. In anthropological terms this is sometimes described as cultural relativism, especially by those that have a tendency to argue toward universal ideals. In sociology it is an aspect of the comparative-historical approach, where the context of a society like twelfth century \"France\" can be potentially better understood (\"Besserverstehen\") by the sociologist than it could have been by people living in a village in Burgundy. It relates to how people in life give meaning to the social world around them and how the social scientist accesses and evaluates this \"first-person perspective\". This concept has been both expanded and criticized by later social scientists. Proponents laud this concept as the only means by which researchers from one culture can examine and explain behaviors in another. While the exercise of \"Verstehen\" has been more popular among social scientists in Europe, such as Habermas, \"Verstehen\" was introduced into the practice of sociology in the United States by Talcott Parsons, an American follower of Max Weber. Parsons used his structural functionalism to incorporate this concept into his 1937 work, \"The Structure of Social Action\".\n\nWeber had more specific beliefs than Marx where he put value to understanding and meaning of key elements—not just with intuition or sympathy with the individual but also the product of \"systematic and rigorous research\". The goal is to identify human actions and interpreting them as observable events leading us to believe that it not only provides for a good explanation for individual actions but also for group interactions. The meaning attached needs to include constraints and limitations and analyze the motivation for action. Weber believed that this gives the sociologist an advantage over a natural scientist because \"We can accomplish something which is never attainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective understanding of the action of the component individuals\" (Weber, Economy and Society, p. 15).\n\nCritics of the social scientific concept of \"Verstehen\" such as Mikhail Bakhtin and Dean MacCannell counter that it is simply impossible for a person born of one culture to ever completely understand another culture, and that it is arrogant and conceited to attempt to interpret the significance of one culture's symbols through the terms of another (supposedly superior) culture. Such criticisms do not necessarily allow for the possibility that \"Verstehen\" does not involve \"complete\" understanding. Just as in physical science all knowledge is asymptotic to the full explanation, a high degree of cross-cultural understanding is very valuable. The opposite of \"Verstehen\" would seem to be ignorance of all but that which is immediately observable, meaning that we would not be able to understand any time and place but our own. A certain level of interpretive understanding is necessary for our own cultural setting, however, and it can easily be argued that even the full participant in a culture does not fully understand it in every regard.\n\nCritics also believe that it is the sociologist's job to not just observe people and what people do but also share in their world of meaning and come to appreciate why they act as they do. Subjective thoughts and feelings regarded as bias in the sciences is an important aspect to be controlled for while doing sociological research.\n\n"}
