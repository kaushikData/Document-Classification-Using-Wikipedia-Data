Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada\n\nAbhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (; ; 1 September 1896 – 14 November 1977) was an Indian Hindu spiritual teacher and the founder preceptor of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the \"Hare Krishna Movement\". Members of the ISKCON movement view Prabhupada as a representant and messenger of Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nBorn Abhay Charan De in Calcutta, he was educated at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta. Before adopting the life of a pious renunciant (vanaprastha) in 1950, he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business. In 1959 he took a vow of renunciation (sannyasa) and started writing commentaries on Vaishnava scriptures. In his later years, as a travelling Vaishnava monk, he became an influential communicator of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology to India and specifically to the West through his leadership of ISKCON, founded in 1966. As the founder of ISKCON, he \"emerged as a major figure of the Western counterculture, initiating thousands of young Americans.\" He received criticism from anti-cult groups, as well as a favourable welcome from religious scholars such as J. Stillson Judah, Harvey Cox, Larry Shinn and Thomas Hopkins, who praised Bhaktivedanta Swami's translations and defended the group against distorted media images and misinterpretations. In respect to his achievements, religious leaders from other Gaudiya Vaishnava movements have also given him credit.\n\nHe has been described as a charismatic leader, in the sense used by sociologist Max Weber, as he was successful in acquiring followers in the United States, Europe, India and elsewhere. His mission was to propagate, throughout the world, Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a school of Vaishnavite Hinduism that had been taught to him by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. After his death in 1977, ISKCON, the society he founded based on a type of Hindu Krishnaism using the \"Bhagavata Purana\" as a central scripture, continued to grow. In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported reaching a milestone of distributing over half a billion of his books since 1965. His translation and commentaries of the \"Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is\" is considered by adherents to the ISKCON movement and many Vedic scholars as one of the finest literary works of Vaishnavism translated into the English Language.\n\nBorn on 4 September 1896, the day after Janmastami, one of the most important Vaishnava holidays, in a humble house in the Tollygunge suburb of Calcutta in a Bengali Suvarna Banik family, he was named Abhay Charan, \"\"one who is fearless\", \"having taken shelter at Lord Krishna's feet\".\" Since he was born on the day of Nandotsava (\"the celebration of Nanda,\" Krishna's father, a traditional festival in honour of Krishna's birth) he was also called Nandulal. His parents, Sriman Gour Mohan De and Srimati Rajani De, were devout Vaishnavas (devotees of Vishnu). In accordance with Bengali tradition, his mother had gone to the home of her parents for the delivery, and only a few days later Abhay returned with parents to his home at 6 Sitakanta Banerjee Lane Kolkata 700005.\n\nHe received a European-led education in the Scottish Church College, which was well reputed among Bengalis; many Vaishnava families sent their sons there. The professors, most of whom were Europeans, were known as sober, moral men, and it is believed that the students received a good education. The college was located in north Calcutta, near the De's family home on Harrison Road. During his years in the college, Abhay Charan De (অভয়চরণ দে) was a member of the English Society as well as that of the Sanskrit Society, and it has been suggested that his education provided him a foundation for his future leadership. He graduated in 1920 with majors in English, philosophy and economics. He rejected his diploma in response to Gandhi's independence movement.\n\nAt 22 years of age he married Radharani Devi, who was then 11 years old, in a marriage arranged by their parents. At 14, she gave birth to Abhay's first son.\n\nIn 1922, when he first met his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, he was requested to spread the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the English language. In 1933 he became a formally initiated disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta. In 1944, (from his front room at Sita Kanta Banerjee, Calcutta), he started the publication called \"Back to Godhead\", for which he acted as writer, designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and distributor. He personally designed the logo, an effulgent figure of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the upper left corner, with the motto: \"Godhead is Light, Nescience is darkness\" greeting the readers. In his first magazine he wrote:\n\nIn 1947, the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society recognised his scholarship with the title \"Bhaktivedanta,\" (\"\") meaning \"one who has realised that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge\" (with the words Bhakti, indicating devotion and Vedanta indicating conclusive knowledge).\n\nHis later well known name, ', is a Sanskrit title, literally meaning \"he who has taken the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord\" where\" \" denotes \"Lord\", and ' means \"taking shelter.\" Also, \"at whose feet masters sit\". This name was used as a respectful form of address by his disciples from late 1967 early 1968 onwards. Previous to this, as with his early disciples, followers used to call him \"Swamiji\".\n\nFrom 1950 onwards, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar mandir in the holy town of Vrindavan, where he began his commentary and translation work of the Sanskrit work Bhagavata Purana. Of all notable Vrindavana's temples, the Radha-Damodara mandir had at the time the largest collection of various copies of the original writings of the Six Gosvamis and their followers – more than two thousand separate manuscripts, many of them three hundred, some even four hundred years old. His guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, had always encouraged him to print books, and beholding his spiritual master, Abhay felt the words deeply enter his own life – \"If you ever get money, print books.\" referring to the need of literary presentation of the Vaishnava culture.\n\nThe Gaudiya Matha at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh was where he lived, wrote and studied, edited the \"\" magazine and where he donated the idol (murti) of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu which stands on the altar beside those of Radha Krishna (named \"Śrī Śrī Rādhā Vinodavihārījī\"). During his visit in September 1959 he entered the doors of this \"matha\" dressed in white, as Abhoy Babu, but would be leaving dressed in saffron, a Vaishnava renunciate (\"sannyasi\"). He took his renunciate vows from his friend and godbrother Bhakti Prajnana Keshava. On becoming a sannyasa he also took the prenominal \"Swami\" (स्वामी Svāmī). He single-handedly published the first three volumes covering seventeen chapters of the first book of \"Bhagavata Purana\", filling three volumes of four hundred pages, each with a detailed commentary. The introduction to the first volume was a biographical sketch of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He then left India, obtaining free passage on a freighter called the \"Jaladuta\", with the aim and a hope of fulfilling his spiritual master's instruction to spread the message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu around the world. In his possession were a suitcase, an umbrella, a supply of dry cereal, about eight dollars worth of Indian currency, and several boxes of books.\n\nWhen he sailed to the United States in 1965, his trip was not sponsored by any religious organization, nor was he met upon arrival by a group of loyal followers. As the Indian freighter \"Jaladuta\" neared his destination, the magnitude of his intended task weighed on him. On 13 September he wrote in his diary, \"Today I have disclosed my mind to my companion, Lord Sri Krishna.\" On this occasion and on a number of others, he called on Krishna for help in his native Bengali. Examining these compositions, academics regard them as \"intimate records of his prayerful preparation for what lay ahead\" and a view on \"how Bhaktivedanta Swami understood his own identity and mission.\"\n\nBy journeying to the United States, he was attempting to fulfil the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of \"his dear Lord Krishna\". It was in July 1966 that he brought \"global missionary Vaishnavism\" to the Western world, founding the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in New York City. He spent much of the last decade of his life setting up the institution. Since he was the Society's leader, his personality and management were responsible for much of ISKCON's growth and the reach of his mission.\n\nWhen it was suggested to him at the time of founding the ISKCON in 1966 that a broader term \"God Consciousness\" would be preferable to \"Krishna Consciousness\" in the title, he rejected this recommendation, suggesting that the name \"Krishna\" includes all other forms and concepts of God.\n\nAfter a group of devotees and a temple had been established in New York another centre was started in San Francisco in 1967. From there he travelled throughout America with his disciples, popularizing the movement through street chanting (\"sankirtana\"), book distribution and public speeches.\n\nOnce ISKCON was more established in there, a small number of devotees from the San Francisco temple were sent to London, England where they came into contact with The Beatles. George Harrison took the greatest interest, spending a significant time speaking with him and producing a record with members of the later London Radha Krsna Temple. \n\nOver the following years his continuing leadership role took him around the world some several times setting up temples and communities on other continents. By the time of his death in Vrindavan in 1977, ISKCON had become an internationally known expression of Vaishnavism.\n\nIn the twelve years from his arrival in New York until his final days, he:\n\nThrough his mission, he followed and communicated the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and introduced bhakti yoga to an international audience. Within Gaudiya Vaishnavism this was viewed as the fulfilment of a long time mission to introduce Caitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings to the world.\n\nIn his discussion with historian Arnold J. Toynbee in London, he is quoted as saying: \"I have started this Krishna Conscious Movement among the Indians and Americans and for the next ten thousand years it will increase.\"\n\n\nBhaktivedanta Swami died on 14 November 1977 in Vrindavan, India; his burial remains in Krishna Balaram Mandir in Vrindavan India.\n\nIt is believed that Bhaktivedanta Swami's most significant contribution are his books. Within the final twelve years of his life Bhaktivedanta Swami translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures (such as the \"Bhagavad Gita, Chaitanya Charitamrita\"and the \"Srimad Bhagavatam\") into the English language. For their authority, depth, and clarity, his books have won praise from professors at colleges and universities like Harvard, Oxford, Cornell, Columbia, Syracuse, Oberlin, and Edinburgh, and his \"Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is\" was published by Macmillan Publishers, in 1968 and unabridged edition in 1972, and is now available in over sixty languages around the world and some other books by Bhaktivedanta Swami are available in over eighty different languages. In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported to have reached a milestone of distributing over half a billion books authored by Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, since 1965.\n\nThe Bhaktivedanta Book Trust was established in 1972 to publish his works, and it has also published his multi-volume biography, \"Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta\", that according to Larry Shinn will \"certainly be one of the most complete records of the life and work of any modern religious figure\". Prabhupada reminded his devotees before his death that he would live forever in his books, and through them would remain present as a spiritual master or guru. Bhaktivedanta Swami had instilled in his followers an understanding of the importance of writing and publishing not only with regard to his works, but also their own initiatives. His early disciples felt Prabhupada had given them \"Back To Godhead\" for their own writings from the very start.\n\nA prominent Gaudiya Vaishnava figure, Shrivatsa Goswami, who as a young man had met Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1972, affirmed the significance of book publishing and distribution in spreading the message of Caitanya in an interview with Steven Gelberg:\n\nIn 1997, a legal dispute opposing ISKCON Inc. / BBTI (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International) to the sole trustee of Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (at this time, Hansadutta Swami), ISKCON Inc. supported the position that Bhaktivedanta Book Trust was non-existent; in 1995 it was claimed by ISKCON that Bhaktivedanta's work was done as a \"Work for hire\". The litigation led to amiable arrangement after which books of Bhaktivedanta are being edited in mainly two forms: original work (\"Pre 1978\") and work which has, since Bhaktivedanta's passing, been further edited, the later being the sole endorsed by ISKCON.\n\nBhaktivedanta Swami said:\n\nOther typical expressions present a different perspective, where he would point out that \"today I may be a Hindu, but tomorrow I may become a Christian or Muslim. In this way faiths can be changed, but dharma is a natural sequence, a natural occupation or a connection and it can not be changed, because it is permanent, according to him.\" While the ISKCON theology of personal god is close to Christian theology, both personal and monotheistic, being a preacher of bhakti and a missionary he sometimes would add, that \"already many Christians have tasted the nectar of divine love of the holy name and are dancing with \"karatalas\" (hand-cymbals) and \"mridangas\" (drums).\"\nHis approach to modern knowledge is also seen in sectarian Orthodox Judaism, where the skills and technical knowledge of modernity are encouraged, but the values rejected. Bhaktivedanta Swami stated \"devotees should not be lazy, idle...we are not afraid to work. Whatever our engagement is, by offering the result to Krishna we become Krishna conscious\". Some of his representations are believed to affect women adversely and are male-centred, others are tender and celebratory. Bhaktivedanta Swami himself taught a dualism of body and soul and that of the genders. Similar to many traditional religions he considered sexuality and spirituality as conflicting opposites. Among some liberal male followers there is a positive recognition of his example in applying the spirit of the law according to time, place, person and circumstance, rather than literal tracing of the tradition.\n\nBeginning his public preaching mission in India, he founded the League of Devotees in Jhansi in 1953.\n\nFollowing the establishment of temples and centres in the United States and Europe, he returned to India in 1971, holding many public programs which were well attended. From 1971 onwards, the movement became increasingly popular and spread throughout India. He was particularly eager to see the progress at \"the impressive temple project in\" Mumbai which he and his disciples had fought very hard to establish, with large temples in Mayapur and Vrindavan to follow in the mid-1970s. To promote the vedic education system within the modern Indian education structure, he introduced a chain of Gurukul in various part of India. The Bhaktivedanta Gurukula and International School is one of the most successful schools in the list.\n\nIn 1996, the Government of India recognized his accomplishments by issuing a commemorative stamp in his honour as a part of Prabhupada Centennial celebrations.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of ISKCON's cultural centre in New Delhi on 5 April on the occasion of Ramnavmi in 1998, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then India's prime minister, said:\n\nA number of memorial samadhis or shrines to Bhaktivedanta Swami were constructed by the members of ISKCON in his remembrance, the largest of which are in Mayapur, Vrindavan and at the larger sized temples in America. Prabhupada's Palace of Gold was designed and constructed by devotees of the New Vrindavan community and dedicated on 2 September 1979. Back in 1972 it was intended to be simply a residence for Bhaktivedanta Swami, but over time the plans evolved into an ornate marble and gold palace which is now visited by thousands of Hindu pilgrims each year, visiting this centrepiece of the community strongly relying upon tourist trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\n \n \n"}
{"id": "1572071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1572071", "title": "Barbelo", "text": "Barbelo\n\nBarbēlō (Greek: Βαρβηλώ) refers to the first emanation of God in several forms of Gnostic cosmogony. Barbēlō is often depicted as a supreme female principle, the single passive antecedent of creation in its manifoldness. This figure is also variously referred to as 'Mother-Father' (hinting at her apparent androgyny), 'First Human Being', 'The Triple Androgynous Name', or 'Eternal Aeon'. So prominent was her place amongst some Gnostics that some schools were designated as \"Barbeliotae\", Barbēlō worshippers or Barbēlōgnostics.\n\nIn the \"Apocryphon of John\", a tractate in the Nag Hammadi Library containing the most extensive recounting of the Sethian creation myth, the Barbēlō is described as \"the first power, the glory, Barbēlō, the perfect glory in the aeons, the glory of the revelation\". All subsequent acts of creation within the divine sphere (save, crucially, that of the lowest aeon Sophia) occurs through her coaction with God. The text describes her thus:\n\nBarbēlō is found in other Nag Hammadi writings:\n\nIn the \"Pistis Sophia\" Barbēlō is named often, but her place is not clearly defined. She is one of the gods, \"a great power of the Invisible God\" (373), joined with Him and the three \"Thrice-powerful deities\" (379), the mother of Pistis Sophia (361) and of other beings (49); from her Jesus received His \"garment of light\" or heavenly body (13, 128; cf. 116, 121); the earth apparently is the \"matter of Barbēlō\" (128) or the \"place of Barbēlō\" (373).\n\nShe is obscurely described by Irenaeus as \"a never-aging aeon in a virginal spirit\", to whom, according to certain \"Gnostici\", the Innominable Father wished to manifest Himself, and who, when four successive beings, whose names express thought and life, had come forth from Him, was quickened with joy at the sight, and herself gave birth to three (or four) other like beings.\n\nShe is noticed in several neighbouring passages of Epiphanius, who in part must be following the Compendium of Hippolytus, as is shown by comparison with Philaster (c. 33), but also speaks from personal knowledge of the Ophitic sects specially called \"Gnostici\" (i. 100 f.). The first passage is in the article on the Nicolaitans (i. 77 f.), but is apparently an anticipatory reference to their alleged descendants the \"Gnostici\" (77 A; Philast.). According to their view Barbēlō lives \"above in the eighth heaven\"; she had been 'put forth' (προβεβλῆσθαι) \"of the Father\"; she was mother of Yaldabaoth (some said, of Sabaoth), who insolently took possession of the seventh heaven, and proclaimed himself to be the only God; and when she heard this word she lamented. She was always appearing to the Archons in a beautiful form, that by beguiling them she might gather up her own scattered power.\n\nOthers, Epiphanius further seems to say (78 f.), told a similar tale of Prunikos, substituting Caulacau for Yaldabaoth. In his next article, on the \"Gnostici\", or Borborites (83 C D), the idea of the recovery of the scattered powers of Barbēlō recurs as set forth in an apocryphal Book of Noria, Noah's legendary wife.\n\nIn both places Epiphanius represents the doctrine as giving rise to sexual libertinism. Mircea Eliade has compared these Borborite beliefs and practices involving Barbēlō to Tantric rituals and beliefs, noting that both systems have a common goal of attaining primordial spiritual unity through erotic bliss and the consumption of menses and semen.\n\nIn a third passage (91 f.), enumerating the Archons said to have their seat in each heaven, Epiphanius mentions as the inhabitants of the eighth or highest heaven \"her who is called Barbēlō\", and the self-gendered Father and Lord of all things, and the virgin-born (αὐτολόχευτον) Christ (evidently as her son, for according to Irenaeus her first progeny, \"the Light\", was called Christ); and similarly he tells how the ascent of souls through the different heavens terminated in the upper region, \"where Barbēro or Barbēlō is, the Mother of the Living\" ().\n\nTheodoret (\"H. F.\" f. 13) merely paraphrases Irenaeus, with a few words from Epiphanius. Jerome several times includes \"Barbēlō\" in lists of portentous names current in Spanish heresy, that is, among Priscillianists; \"Balsamus\" and \"Leusibora\" being three times associated with it (\"Ep.\" 75 c. 3, p. 453 c. Vall.; c. \"Vigil.\" p. 393 A; \"in Esai\". lxvi. 4 p. 361 c; in \"Amos\" iii. 9 p. 257 E).\n\n\"Babel\", in the book of \"Baruch\" of the Gnostic Justinus, the name of the first of the twelve \"maternal angels\" born to Elohim and Edem (Hipp. \"Haer\". v. 26, p. 151). She is identical with Aphrodite, and is enjoined by her mother to cause adulteries and desertions among men, in revenge for Edem's desertion by Elohim (p. 154). When Heracles is sent by Elohim as \"a prophet of the uncircumcision\" to overcome \"the twelve evil angels of the creation,\" i. e. the maternal angels, Babel, now identical with Omphale, beguiles and enfeebles him (p. 156; x. 15, p. 323). She may possibly be the Baalti or female Baal of various Semitic nations, though the intrusive β is not easily explained. But it is on the whole possible to take \"Babel\", \"confusion\" (Joseph. \"Ant\". i. 4, § 3), as a form of Barbēlō, which may have the same meaning. The eclecticism of Justinus would account for his deposition of Barbēlō from the first to the second place, where she is still above Hachamoth.\n\nIn Gnostic accounts of God, the notions of impenetrability, stasis and ineffability are of central importance. The emanation of Barbēlō may be said to function as an intermediary generative aspect of the Divine, or as an abstraction of the generative aspect of the Divine through its Fullness. The most transcendent hidden invisible Spirit is not depicted as actively participating in creation. This significance is reflected both in her apparent androgyny (reinforced by several of her given epithets), and in the name \"Barbēlō\" itself. Several plausible etymologies of the name (Βαρβηλώ, Βαρβηρώ, Βαρβηλ, Βαρβηλώθ) have been proposed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The group is named after its chairman, Kenneth Boyd, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nThe groups states its primary objective is to act as a \"forum for open exchange of views\" on \"issues of concern\" to its membership and, whenever possible, form consensus and make recommendations. However, due to the diverse membership, the group will often fail to find consensus. In these situations, they aim to publish \"an agreed account of where members (as people familiar with the issues) differ from one another, regarding what they consider to be the relevant facts, the best interpretation of these facts and relevant moral arguments\". Issues for debate are raised by members, then discussed by the group (or a sub-group). Occasionally, the group may communicate with other bodies, such as Pro-Test.\n\nPatrick Bateson has said of the group: \n\nThe Boyd Group has been criticized by some anti-vivisection organisations. Representatives of the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) told a House of Lords select committee the Boyd Group is a \"talking shop\" with a \"pre-set agenda.\" However, Les Ward defended Advocates for Animals' membership of the group and the effectiveness of a collaborative approach: \n\nThe group had, according to Blakemore in 2002, \"about 25 member organisations\" including animal welfare groups, anti-vivisectionist groups, charitable bodies, government, industry, veterinarians, academic scientists and philosophers. The membership includes both expert individuals and those nominated by, and representative of, groups or societies. The group invites applications for membership, but excluding only individuals and groups that \"support violent activity or break the criminal law\". Identified members, past and present, include:\n\n\nThe Boyd Group lacks representation from a number of large anti-vivisectionist organisations, with Blakemore admitting their \"credibility is reduced because of that\". Both Ward and Blakemore have expressed a wish to include more of these organisations, including BUAV, NAVS, PETA and Animal Aid.\n\nWard has since withdrawn from the Boyd Group, believing it had become \"stalemated\", but in 2006 continued to defend his participation in \"one of the few places where moderate activists and moderate scientists sat down and talked things over.\" \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4243217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4243217", "title": "Constructivism (international relations)", "text": "Constructivism (international relations)\n\nIn international relations, constructivism is the claim that significant aspects of international relations are historically and socially constructed, rather than inevitable consequences of human nature or other essential characteristics of world politics.\n\nNicholas Onuf is usually credited with coining the term \"constructivism\" to describe theories that stress the socially constructed character of international relations. Contemporary constructivist theory traces its roots to pioneering work not only by Onuf, but also by Richard K. Ashley, Friedrich Kratochwil, John Ruggie, and Christian Reus-Smit. Nevertheless, Alexander Wendt is the best-known advocate of social constructivism in the field of international relations. Wendt’s 1992 article \"Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics\" published in \"International Organization\" laid the theoretical groundwork for challenging what he considered to be a flaw shared by both neorealists and neoliberal institutionalists, namely, a commitment to a (crude) form of materialism. By attempting to show that even such a core realist concept as \"power politics\" is socially constructed—that is, not given by nature and hence, capable of being transformed by human practice—Wendt opened the way for a generation of international relations scholars to pursue work in a wide range of issues from a constructivist perspective. Wendt further developed these ideas in his central work, \"Social Theory of International Politics\" (1999).\n\nSince the late 1980s and early 1990s, constructivism has become one of the major schools of thought within international relations. John Ruggie and Christian Reus-Smit have identified several strands of constructivism. On the one hand, there are constructivist scholars such as Martha Finnemore, Kathryn Sikkink, Peter Katzenstein, Elizabeth Kier, and Alexander Wendt, whose work has been widely accepted within the mainstream IR community and has generated vibrant scholarly discussions among realists, liberals, institutionalists, and constructivists. On the other hand, there are radical constructivists who take discourse and linguistics more seriously.\n\nConstructivism primarily seeks to demonstrate how core aspects of international relations are, contrary to the assumptions of neorealism and neoliberalism, \"socially constructed\", that is, they are given their form by ongoing processes of social practice and interaction. Alexander Wendt calls two increasingly accepted basic tenets of Constructivism \"that the structures of human association are determined primarily by shared ideas rather than material forces, and that the identities and interests of purposive actors are constructed by these shared ideas rather than given by nature\".\n\nThe notion that international relations are not only affected by power politics, but also by ideas, is shared by writers who describe themselves as \"constructivist theorists.\" According to this view, the fundamental structures of international politics are social rather than strictly material. This leads to \"social constructivists\" to argue that changes in the nature of social interaction between states can bring a fundamental shift towards greater international security. \n\nDuring constructivism's formative period neorealism was the dominant discourse of international relations, thus much of constructivism's initial theoretical work challenged basic Neorealist assumptions. Neorealists are fundamentally causal structuralists, in that they hold that the majority of important content to international politics is explained by the structure of the international system, a position first advanced in Kenneth Waltz's \"Man, the State, and War\" and fully elucidated in his core text of Neorealism, \"Theory of International Politics\". Specifically, international politics is primarily determined by the fact that the international system is anarchic – it lacks any overarching authority, instead it is composed of units (states) which are formally equal – they are all sovereign over their own territory. Such anarchy, Neorealists argue, forces States to act in certain ways, specifically, they can rely on no-one but themselves for security (they have to self-help). The way in which anarchy forces them to act in such ways, to defend their own self-interest in terms of power, neorealists argue, explains most of international politics. Because of this, Neorealists tend to disregard explanations of international politics at the \"unit\" or \"state\" level. Kenneth Waltz attacked such a focus as being reductionist.\n\nConstructivism, particularly in the formative work of Wendt, challenges this assumption by showing that the causal powers attributed to \"structure\" by neorealists are in fact not \"given\", but rest on the way in which structure is constructed by social practice. Removed from presumptions about the nature of the identities and interests of the actors in the system, and the meaning that social institutions (including anarchy) have for such actors, Wendt argues neorealism's \"structure\" reveals very little: \"it does not predict whether two states will be friends or foes, will recognize each other's sovereignty, will have dynastic ties, will be revisionist or status quo powers, and so on\". Because such features of behavior are not explained by anarchy, and require instead the incorporation of evidence about the interests and identities held by key actors, Neorealism's focus on the material structure of the system (anarchy) is misplaced. Wendt goes further than this – arguing that because the way in which anarchy constrains states depends on the way in which states conceive of anarchy, and conceive of their own identities and interests, anarchy is not necessarily even a self-help system. It only forces states to self-help if they conform to neorealist assumptions about states as seeing security as a competitive, relative concept, where the gain of security for any one state means the loss of security for another. If states instead hold alternative conceptions of security, either \"co-operative\", where states can maximise their security without negatively affecting the security of another, or \"collective\" where states identify the security of other states as being valuable to themselves, anarchy will not lead to self-help at all. Neorealist conclusions, as such, depend entirely on unspoken and unquestioned assumptions about the way in which the meaning of social institutions are constructed by actors. Crucially, because Neorealists fail to recognize this dependence, they falsely assume that such meanings are unchangeable, and exclude the study of the processes of social construction which actually do the key explanatory work behind neorealist observations.\n\nAs constructivists reject neorealism's conclusions about the determining effect of anarchy on the behavior of international actors, and move away from neorealism's underlying materialism, they create the necessary room for the identities and interests of international actors to take a central place in theorising international relations. Now that actors are not simply governed by the imperatives of a self-help system, their identities and interests become important in analysing how they behave. Like the nature of the international system, constructivists see such identities and interests as not objectively grounded in material forces (such as dictates of the human nature that underpins classical realism) but the result of ideas and the social construction of such ideas. In other words, the meanings of ideas, objects, and actors are all given by social interaction. People give objects their meanings and can attach different meanings to different things.\n\nMartha Finnemore has been influential in examining the way in which international organizations are involved in these processes of the social construction of actor's perceptions of their interests. In \"National Interests In International Society\", Finnemore attempts to \"develop a systemic approach to understanding state interests and state behavior by investigating an international structure, not of power, but of meaning and social value\". \"Interests\", she explains, \"are not just 'out there' waiting to be discovered; they are constructed through social interaction\". Finnemore provides three case studies of such construction – the creation of Science Bureaucracies in states due to the influence of the UNESCO, the role of the Red Cross in the Geneva Conventions and the World Bank's influence of attitudes to poverty.\n\nStudies of such processes are examples of the constructivist attitude towards state interests and identities. Such interests and identities are central determinants of state behaviour, as such studying their nature and their formation is integral in constructivist methodology to explaining the international system. But it is important to note that despite this refocus onto identities and interests—properties of states—constructivists are not necessarily wedded to focusing their analysis at the unit-level of international politics: the state. Constructivists such as Finnemore and Wendt both emphasise that while ideas and processes tend to explain the social construction of identities and interests, such ideas and processes form a structure of their own which impact upon international actors. Their central difference from neorealists is to see the structure of international politics in primarily ideational, rather than material, terms.\n\nMany constructivists analyse international relations by looking at goals, threats, fears, cultures, identities, and other elements of \"social reality\" as social facts. In an important edited volume, \"The Culture of National Security\", constructivist scholars—including Elizabeth Kier, Jeffrey Legro, and Peter Katzenstein - challenged many realist assumptions about the dynamics of international politics, particularly in the context of military affairs. Thomas J. Biersteker and Cynthia Weber applied constructivist approaches to understand the evolution of state sovereignty as a central theme in international relations, and works by Rodney Bruce Hall and Daniel Philpott (among others) developed constructivist theories of major transformations in the dynamics of international politics. In international political economy, the application of constructivism has been less frequent. Notable examples of constructivist work in this area include Kathleen R. McNamara's study of European Monetary Union and Mark Blyth's analysis of the rise of Reaganomics in the United States.\n\nBy focusing on how language and rhetoric are used to construct the social reality of the international system, constructivists are often seen as more optimistic about progress in international relations than versions of realism loyal to a purely materialist ontology, but a growing number of constructivists question the \"liberal\" character of constructivist thought and express greater sympathy for realist pessimism concerning the possibility of emancipation from power politics.\n\nConstructivism is often presented as an alternative to the two leading theories of international relations, realism and liberalism, but some maintain that it is not necessarily inconsistent with one or both. Wendt shares some key assumptions with leading realist and neorealist scholars, such as the existence of anarchy and the centrality of states in the international system. However, Wendt renders anarchy in cultural rather than materialist terms; he also offers a sophisticated theoretical defense of the state-as-actor assumption in international relations theory. This is a contentious issue within segments of the IR community as some constructivists challenge Wendt on some of these assumptions (see, for example, exchanges in \"Review of International Studies\", vol. 30, 2004). It has been argued that progress in IR theory will be achieved when Realism and Constructivism can be aligned or even synthesized. An early example of such synthesis was Jennifer Sterling-Folker’s analysis of the United States’ international monetary policy following the Bretton Woods system. Sterling-Folker argued that the U.S. shift towards unilateralism is partially accounted for by realism’s emphasis of an anarchic system, but constructivism helps to account for important factors from the domestic or second level of analysis.\n\nA significant group of scholars who study processes of social construction self-consciously eschew the label \"Constructivist\". They argue that \"mainstream\" constructivism has abandoned many of the most important insights from linguistic turn and social-constructionist theory in the pursuit of respectability as a \"scientific\" approach to international relations. Even some putatively \"mainstream\" constructivists, such as Jeffrey Checkel, have expressed concern that constructivists have gone too far in their efforts to build bridges with non-constructivist schools of thought.\n\nA growing number of constructivists contend that current theories pay inadequate attention to the role of habitual and unreflective behavior in world politics. These advocates of the \"practice turn\" take inspiration from work in neuroscience, as well as that of social theorists such as Pierre Bourdieu, that stresses the significance of habit and practices in psychological and social life - essentially calling for greater attention and sensitivity towards the 'every day' and 'taken for granted' activities of international politics Increasingly, these scholars are also moving towards employing the related sociological approach known as Actor-Network Theory (ANT), which extends the early focus of the Practice Turn on the work of Pierre Bourdieu towards that of Bruno Latour and others. Scholars have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.), consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR, explore the infrastructures of world politics, and consider the effects of technological agency.\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of ten one-hour films, inspired by the decalogue of the Ten Commandments. Each short film explores characters facing one or several moral or ethical dilemmas as they live in an austere housing project in 1980s Poland.\n\nThe series, which is Kieślowski's most acclaimed work, was said in 2002 to be \"the best dramatic work ever done specifically for television\" and has won numerous international awards, though it was not widely released outside Europe until the late 1990s. In 1991, filmmaker Stanley Kubrick wrote an admiring foreword to the published screenplay.\n\nThe series was conceived when screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, who had seen a 15th-century artwork illustrating the Commandments in scenes from that time period, suggested the idea of a modern equivalent. Filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski was interested in the philosophical challenge, and also wanted to use the series as a portrait of the hardships of Polish society, while deliberately avoiding the political issues he had depicted in earlier films. He originally meant to hire ten different directors, but decided to direct the films himself. He used a different cinematographer for each episode except III and IX, in both of which Piotr Sobociński was director of photography.\n\nThe large cast includes both famous and unknown actors, many of whom Kieślowski also used in his other films. Typically for Kieślowski, the tone of most of the films is melancholic, except for the final one, which is a black comedy, featuring two of the same actors, Jerzy Stuhr and Zbigniew Zamachowski, as in .\n\nThe ten films are titled simply by number, e.g. \"Dekalog: One\". According to film critic Roger Ebert's introduction to the DVD set, Kieślowski said that the films did not correspond exactly to the commandments, and never used their names himself. \nThough each film is independent, most of them share the same setting in Warsaw, and some of the characters are acquainted with each other. Each short film explores characters facing one or several moral or ethical dilemmas as they live in a large housing project in 1980s Poland.\nThe themes can be interpreted in many different ways; however, each film has its own literality:\nA nameless character played by Polish actor Artur Barciś appears in all but episodes 7 and 10. He observes the main characters at key moments, and never intervenes. He is possibly meant to be a supernatural figure.\n\nMilk is a recurring element in the following 7 episodes: \n\n\"Dekalog\" was admired by critics and important figures from the film industry, such as Stanley Kubrick.\n\nThe DVD box issue held 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. The series was praised by renowned film critics, including Roger Ebert and Robert Fulford.\n\nIn the 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" poll to determine the greatest films of all time, \"Dekalog\" and \"A Short Film About Killing\" received votes from 4 critics and 3 directors, including Ebert, New Yorker critic David Denby, and director Mira Nair. Additionally, in the \"Sight & Sound\" poll held the same year to determine the top 10 films of the previous 25 years, Kieslowski was named #2 on the list of Top Directors, with votes for his films being split between \"Dekalog,\" \"Three Colors Red/Blue\", and \"The Double Life of Veronique\".\n\nIn 2002, the film was listed among the Top 100 \"Essential Films\" of all time by the National Society of Film Critics and ranked #36 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n\nAccording to online film resource \"They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?\", \"Dekalog\" is the most acclaimed film of 1988.\n\nKieślowski expanded \"Five\" and \"Six\" into longer feature films (\"A Short Film About Killing\" and \"A Short Film About Love\"), using the same cast and changing the stories slightly. \nThis was part of a contractual obligation with the producers, since feature films were easier to distribute outside Poland. In 2000, the series was released on five DVDs, each containing two parts of about 2 hours.\n"}
{"id": "23920246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23920246", "title": "Derge Parkhang", "text": "Derge Parkhang\n\nThe Derge Parkhang, (pronunciation \"Dehr-geh\", alternative names Dege Parkhang, Derge Sutra Printing Temple, Dege Yinjing Yuan, Derge Barkhang, Dege Barkhang, Barkhang, Parkhang, Bakong Scripture Printing Press and Monastery) is one of the foremost cultural treasures of Tibet. Derge is a county seat in a high valley in Kham, an eastern district of traditional Tibet which is now part of China's Sichuan Province. The Derge Parkhang is a living institution devoted to the printing and preservation of Tibetan literature, a printing temple that holds the greatest number of Tibetan woodblocks in the world. \nThe Derge Sutra Printing Temple (Parkhang in Tibetan) is one of the most important cultural, social, religious and historical institutions in Tibet. Founded in 1729 by Demba Tsering, the fortieth King of Derge (1678–1739) with the spiritual and literature assistance of the 8th Tai Situ Panchen Chokyi Jungne, the Derge Parkhang is an active center for publication of Tibetan Buddhist sutra, commentaries, and thangka as well as works of history, technology, biography, medicine and literature. Books are still being made in the same way as they have been for almost three hundred years: handprinted from hand-carved wooden blocks. Cinnabar is used to colour the text red, in which workers can print eight to fifteen pages manually a minute, 2500 in a day, from wooden blocks that have already been engraved with text. Thirty printers are in working condition where printers work in pairs, one puts ink on wooden press, later cleaned in a trough, while the other rolls a piece of paper using a roller which is imprinted red with sayings of Buddha.\n\nThe history of the Derge Parkhang is closely bound to the history of the Kingdom of Derge. From a mythical ancestor in the eighth century, the Derge royal dynasty rose to found and rule an influential independent Tibetan kingdom in the Kham area of Eastern Tibet, controlling a large area straddling the Drichu River (called the Jinsha River in Chinese and forming the upper reaches of the Yangtse River) on what is now the border between the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Sichuan. Astute politicians, the Kings of Derge maintained political power through generous patronage of religious institutions: their unusual pattern of patronage for all five schools of Buddhism meant strong support for monasteries, learning and art in the area under their political control. They were also able stay on good terms with both of their powerful neighbors, the governments of Lhasa and Beijing. A gradual weakening of the family through the nineteenth century followed by a succession struggle in the early twentieth century brought about the effective end of their political control, but they remained in nominal power until the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese Communists in 1950.\n\nThe survival of the Derge Parkhang during the \"Three Crises\", its close escape from destruction during the campaigns of Gonpo Namgyal in the mid-nineteenth century, survival through the succession struggles in the early twentieth century, and finally its preservation through the period of religious and cultural suppression under the Communist Party of China are credited to sources both natural and supernatural. The Parkhang returned to production in the early 1980s after a hiatus of almost twenty-five years, and today produces and distributes sutra and other books throughout Tibet, China and internationally (including the collection of the New York Public Library) as well as printed thangkas and mandala to local people, pilgrims and, increasingly, to tourists. As the present Director, Tsewang Jirme Rinpoche says, \"This is not a museum of antiques, it is a living institution.\" The temple has been recognized by the People's Republic of China since the fifties as a national site for historical preservation and is working for recognition as a World Heritage Site. Derge has attracted western notice (e.g. New York Times, March 19, 2000: \"Storehouse of Tibetan Culture,\") and welcomes tourists, but because of its remote location, four days by bus from Chengdu only the most committed travelers visit it.\n\nThe Derge Parkhang today faces a set of challenges that arise from the social, economic and political developments that arise from Kham's opening to development and tourism in the late nineties. Current leadership at the Parkhang has worked to clarify the institution's bureaucratic status, open new sources of funding and support, and to gain control of its media representation. All of these programs demand money, and both governmental support and donations steered by the government have been developed. Nevertheless, the institution remains in competition with hundreds of other cultural preservation projects in China and with numerous other religious institutions in Kham and Tibet. The leadership at the Parkhang needs to find a way to transform immense cultural capital into the means to support the institution.\n\n\n"}

A. W. F. Edwards has remarked that it is \"probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology\".\n\nFisher's principle was famously outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1930 book \"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\" (but has been incorrectly attributed to Fisher as original). Specifically, Fisher couched his argument in terms of parental expenditure, and predicted that parental expenditure on both sexes should be equal. Sex ratios that are 1:1 are hence known as \"Fisherian\", and those that are not 1:1 are \"non-Fisherian\" or \"extraordinary\" and occur because they break the assumptions made in Fisher's model.\n\nW.D. Hamilton gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on \"Extraordinary sex ratios\", given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:\n\nIn modern language, the 1:1 ratio is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS).\n\nIn Chapter 6 \"Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection\", Fisher wrote under the heading \"Natural Selection and the sex-ratio\" (page 141) the explanation described by Eric Charnov and James J. Bull as being \"characteristically terse\" and \"cryptic\":\n\nFisher's principle is an early example of a model in which genes for greater production of either sex become equalized in the population, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations.\n\nFisher's principle is rooted in the concept of frequency-dependent selection, though Fisher's principle is not frequency-dependent selection \"per se\". Frequency-dependent selection, in this scenario, is the logic that the probability of an individual being able to breed is dependent on the frequency of the opposite sex in relation to its own sex. It was first described by Darwin in 1871.\n\nFisher's principle extends frequency dependence to explain how natural selection can act on genes that affect the frequency of an individual's grandchildren without affecting the frequency of their children. Fisher predicted that parents will invest their resources equally between each sex of offspring, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations. As a result, those genes that cause parents to invest unequally in the sexes will tend to be selected against. Fisher was aware that in humans, more boys are born, whilst boys are also more likely to die in infancy. As a consequence, he reasoned that because parents tend to invest less in boys because more boys die before the end of the period of parental care there is a higher rate of male births to equalise parental investment in each sex.\n\nFisher's principle is also the precursor to evolutionary game theory. R.H. MacArthur (1965) first suggested applying to sex ratios the language of game theory, and this was subsequently picked up by W.D. Hamilton (1967) who termed the equilibrium point the \"unbeatable strategy\". Hamilton's unbeatable strategy was refined by John Maynard Smith and George R. Price (1973) into their concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy, i.e. one which cannot be invaded by a mutant strategy.\n\nFisher's concept of parental expenditure (now termed parental investment), developed particularly by Robert Trivers is now an important concept in ecology.\n\nHistorical research by A.W.F. Edwards has shown that the argument is incorrectly attributed to Fisher (the name is in common use and is unlikely to change). Charles Darwin had originally formulated a similar but somewhat confused argument in the first edition of \"The Descent of Man\" but withdrew it for the second edition Fisher only had a copy of the latter, and quotes Darwin in \"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\".\n\nSpecifically, Carl Düsing of the University of Jena published this in three works between 1883–84, and this is essentially identical to Shaw and Mohler's later model.\n\nAs \"probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology\", Fisher's principle is a staple of popular science books on evolution. For example, see:\n\n\nFor those wishing more advanced treatment, see the 2002 book \"Sex Ratios: Concepts and Research Methods\" edited by Ian C.W. Hardy, (chapters 1 and 2 by Ido Pen and Franz J.

{"id": "22645860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22645860", "title": "Gapping", "text": "Gapping\n\nIn linguistics, gapping is a type of ellipsis that occurs in the non-initial conjuncts of coordinate structures. Gapping usually elides minimally a finite verb and further any non-finite verbs that are present. This material is \"gapped\" from the non-initial conjuncts of a coordinate structure. Gapping exists in many languages, but by no means in all of them, and gapping has been studied extensively and is therefore one of the more understood ellipsis mechanisms. Stripping is viewed as a particular manifestation of the gapping mechanism where just one remnant (instead of two or more) appears in the gapped/stripped conjunct.\n\nCanonical examples of gapping have a true \"gap\", which means the elided material appears medially in the non-initial conjuncts, with a remnant to its left and a remnant to its right. The elided material of gapping in all the examples below is indicated with subscripts and a smaller font:\n\nIn the first sentence, the second conjunct has the subject \"others\", the object \"rice\", but the verb has been 'gapped', that is, omitted. Gapping can span several verbs and nonfinite clause boundaries, as the second and third sentence illustrate, but it cannot apply across a finite clause boundary, as seen in the next sentence:\n\nThe star * indicates that the sentence is bad. Gapping is also incapable of operating backwards, which means that the antecedent to the gap must precede the gap. Attempts at gapping where the gap precedes its antecedent are quite bad, e.g.\n\nWhile the canonical cases of gapping have medial gaps, the gap can also be discontinuous, e.g.\n\nMany syntacticians take stripping (= bare argument ellipsis) to be a particular manifestation of gapping where only one remnant appears instead of two or more. If this assumption is correct, then the same ellipsis mechanism is at work in the following cases:\n\nIn its manifestation as stripping, the gapping mechanism occurs frequently. Gapping is widely assumed to obligatorily elide a finite verb. However, gapping can also occur when no finite verb is involved, e.g.\n\nThe gap of gapping cannot, however, cut into a \"major constituent\", e.g.\n\nGapping challenges phrase structure theories of syntax because it is not evident how one might produce a satisfactory analysis of the material that can be gapped. The problem concerns the fact that the elided material often does not qualify as a constituent, as many of the examples above illustrate. Faced with this challenge, one prominent approach is to assume some sort of movement. The remnants are moved out of an encompassing parent constituent so that the parent constituent can then be deleted. In other words, there is an ordering of transformations. First the remnants are moved out of their parent constituent and then that parent constituent is elided. The difficulty with such movement analyses concerns the nature of the movement mechanisms, since the movement mechanism needed to vacate the parent constituent would be unlike the recognized movement mechanisms (fronting, scrambling, extraposition).\n\nAn alternative analysis of gapping assumes that the catena is the basic unit of syntactic analysis. The catena is associated with dependency grammars and is defined as \"any word or any combination of words that is continuous with respect to dominance\". The elided material of gapping always qualifies as a catena. This situation is illustrated with the following tree, which shows the dependency structure of a well-known example from Ross 1970:\n\nThe a-clause is from Ross, whereas the clauses b-i have been added to illustrate the role that the catena plays. The (at least somewhat) acceptable clauses a-d have the elided material corresponding to a catena each time, whereas the clauses e-i are unacceptable each time because the elided material does not correspond to a catena. The star * indicates that the clauses are bad. For instance, the elided material \"wants...to begin\", to the exclusion of \"to try\", is not a catena in (g). The other main forms of ellipsis (e.g. answer fragments, sluicing, VP-ellipsis, etc.) can also all be investigated in terms of the catena. The elided material of most if not all ellipsis mechanisms corresponds to catenae.\n\n"}

It was founded in 2004 by Zen Master Ji Bong (Robert Moore). Moore began training with the Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn in 1974, and was one of the founders of the New Haven Zen Center and core teachers of the early years of the international Kwan Um School of Zen. He was a teacher at several centers around the United States, and after more than twenty years of training, he received Dharma transmission from Seung Sahn in 1997.\n\nMoore established his own practice center in the 1990s, and eventually broke off from the Kwan Um School in 2004 to establish an independent organization, the Golden Wind Zen Order. Though not affiliated with the Kwan Um School, the GWZO follows many of its practice forms, with an emphasis on seated meditation practice, kong-an training, and chanting.\n\nThe Order's practice centers are the Golden Wind Zen Center (currently in the Signal Hill area of Long Beach, CA) and the Blue Heron Zen Community in Seattle, WA.\n\nThe Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn, Robert Moore, and Paul Lynch founded the Huntington Beach Zen Center in 1993. The first center was a four bedroom house, with the Dharma Room located in the back of the house. In early 1994 the Zen Center accepted its first resident, who lived as a novice monk full-time at the Zen Center. A few residents moved in and out of the Huntington Beach Zen Center, including a Korean monk. In 1995 the Zen Center was moved to a larger six bedroom house in Stanton. At that time Zen Master Seung Sahn suggested changing the name of the center to Ocean Eyes Zen Center.\n\nIn 1997 the Ocean Eyes Zen Center moved from Stanton to a residence in Long Beach, California where it was established as a residential center with 5 to 6 full-time resident students. However, the residential model came into conflict with local zoning ordinances, and in 1999 the Center became temporarily homeless. However, students continued to practice in transitional locations in Whittier and in San Pedro until 2000, when the Center reopened at a new location in Long Beach. In 2011, the Center re-located to a commercial building in the Signal Hill area of Long Beach.\n\nThese centers were all affiliated with the international Kwan Um School of Zen until 2004. That year Moore and the membership decided to change the name of the Center to the Golden Wind Zen Center, and to affiliate with a new, independent teaching organization called the Golden Wind Zen Order.\n\nThe Dharma Sound Zen Community in Seattle, WA was originally established under the auspices of the Kwan Um School of Zen, with Moore as their guiding teacher. After Moore established the GWZO, Dharma Sound members elected to retain Moore as their guiding teacher, and to affiliate with the GWZO. In 2006, Dharma Sound changed its name to the Blue Heron Zen Community, and also separated from the Kwan Um School.\n\nOver some two decades, Moore trained several students to become teachers or \"Ji Do Poep Sunims\" (JDPSN, or \"Dharma Masters\"). These have included Jeff Tipp, Eric Nord, and Anita Feng in Seattle, along with Tim Colohan and Sensei Frank McGouirk in Long Beach. McGouirk has been the head teacher and director of the Aikido-Ai dojo in Whittier, CA for several years, and some GWZO members also practice and teach there. After nearly twenty years of training, Colohan left the GWZO in 2015 to pursue other teaching and practice opportunities.\n\nIn 2015, Zen Master Ji Bong (Robert Moore) gave transmission to his first Dharma heir, Zen Master Jeong Ji (Anita Feng) at the Blue Heron Zen Community in Seattle, WA.\n\nGuiding Teachers\n\n\n"}

During a repressive phase of government in the 1940s he led a literary movement known as Nadaísmo (Nothing-\"ism\"). He and other young Colombian thinkers of his generation in the movement were inspired by the Colombian philosopher Fernando González Ochoa.\n\nArango's life was characterized by large contrasts from an open atheism to an intense spirituality, and a strong criticism of the society of his time. Those contrasts can be read in the \"First Manifesto of Nadaísmo\" as \"\"The artist is considered sometimes a symbol fluctuation between holiness and madness\". Arango died in a tragic car accident in the city of Tocancipá in 1976 when he was planning to move to London so that \"by losing me, Colombians win me\".\n\nGonzalo Arango was born in Andes, a town of the Antioquian South-Eastern region in 1931, in a time known in Colombia as the Regime of the Liberals that had to face the Great Depression. It was also the time of Constitutional and social reforms such as that of president Alfonso López Pumarejo. When he was an adolescent he saw the falling of the country into a bloody fight between the two traditional political parties after El Bogotazo of April 9, 1948, a period of violent civil strife that was triggered by the murder of presidential candidate Jorge Eliecer Gaitán. He lived also in a time when the Catholic Church in Colombia possessed the control of education, thanks to the Colombian Constitution of 1886, and thus exerted a great authority over political, cultural and social matters, such as in the censorship over intellectual material produced in the nation. As an example, one of the works by philosopher Fernando González Ochoa, \"Viaje a pie\" (Trip by foot) was forbidden by the Archbishop of Medellín under death penalty in 1929. This social context promoted his growing as an eccentric writer and thinker, and would influence Arango's work.\n\nArango was the last son of the 13 children of Francisco Arango (known as Don Paco) and Magdalena Arias. Don Paco was the telegraphist of the town and Madgalena was a housewife.\n\nIn 1947 he began to study Law in the University of Antioquia, but three years later he left the studies to devote himself to writing, starting with his first work \"Después del Hombre\"\" (After the Man). The eccentric writer stole a skull from the Saint Peter Cemetery of Medellín to be his companion in a country farm of his relatives where he went to live alone. About this time Eduardo Escobar wrote:\n\nOn June 13, 1953 General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla led a bloodless Coup d'etat to the authoritarian conservative president Laureano Gómez to bring peace to the country after many years of civil war between liberals and conservatives. The Assembly that replaced the Congress, composed mostly of conservatives, re-elected him for the next presidential period until 1958. The Rojas coup was seen by many as a solution to the political crisis, the violence in the country, and as an alternative to the two traditional national parties. Young Arango was a Rojas supporter, joining the \"Movimiento Amplio Nacional - MAN\" (National Wide Movement) composed of artists and young intellectuals that supported the dictator. In this period, Arango devoted himself to journalism.\n\nSoon, however, the reaction of the leaders of conservatives and liberals against Rojas was manifested in an agreement that caused his fall on May 10, 1957. While the dictator was exiled in Spain, Gonzalo Arango fled to Chocó.\n\nHe took refuge in the city of Cali in 1957. It was in the bohemian lifestyle of the salsa music's city where he started to give form to the Nadaism that he was to express in the First Manifesto, to be published a year later in Medellín. The dishonour of having supported a lost cause and the feeling of no future, with nothing, brought him to look for other companions who thought likewise about society:\n\nThe first people to join the new movement were Alberto Escobar and Amilkar Osorio and, as an inauguration, they burned in 1958 in Plazuela de San Ignacio of Medellín the Colombian literature as a symbol against what was considered the traditional and masterpiece of literature. One of the books was his own first work, \"After the Man\".\n\nThe following year the Nadaists sabotaged the First Congress of Catholic Intellectuals in Medellín, a reason enough to be sent to prison in the same city. In prison he received the visit of Fernando González, the philosopher of \"Otraparte\" and one of his first inspirations. Among other Nadaist scandals is the sacrilege of the Holy Host in the Basilica of Medellín in 1961, a fact that had international consequences, and that he himself later repented for.\n\nIn 1963 he began a new change in his life and he was symbolically burned by the Nadaists in a bridge in Cali. He published a poetic anthology of ten Nadaists and wrote for \"La Nueva Prensa\".\n\nThe \"Nadaísmo\" movement continues to be a matter of study, because it was an authentic literary revolution in the Colombia of the second part of the 20th century. It has as its first inspiration the books of the philosopher Fernando González Ochoa and is framed by the flamboyant methods of surrealism.\n\nMore than anything, \"Nadaísmo\" was Gonzalo Arango's creation and inspiration, and his goal for it was that of \"not leaving intact any faith or any idol in place,\" according to the First Manifesto. The Movement was deeply entrenched in the 1960s and attracted young talented writers of the time who created a strong literary school in Colombia, especially in poetry. The first \"Nadaists\" with Arango were Amílcar Osorio (known as Amílkar U) and Eduardo Escobar. Others would come such as Elmo Valencia and Jotamario Arbeláez. The cities of Medellín and Cali became the first setting for the development of the Movement, but it became soon of a national level.\n\nNadaism manifested its nonconformity against the social order of the time under the rule of the two Colombian traditional political parties (Liberal and Conservative), against a very conservative social structure, against bourgeoisie, and against mass revolutions with totalitarian aims. It was also a bohemian movement dedicated to poetry that was given as closed by its own founder at the beginning of the 1970s, but was continued by some of its followers even until modern times, like Jotamario Arbeláez and Eduardo Escobar.\n\nAs a surprise for his followers, Gonzalo Arango abandoned Nadaísmo in 1970, an event that was considered by the Nadaists as treason to its original principles. Already in 1968 he wrote an article of admiration for president Carlos Lleras Restrepo that caused the disapproval of the Nadaists. It was the beginning of the separation of the founder and his foundation until the day of his death.\n\nThe man who wrote manifestos against Catholic writers, began a new time of profound spirituality and the writing of love poems for his lover, the British Angela Mary Hickie:\n\nHowever, for Colombian writers of Nadaism like Jotamario Arbeláez and Eduardo Escobar, the movement is still alive in dissenter youngsters:\n\nGonzalo Arango was also a journalist and he participated in different newspapers and magazines both in his country like \"Nueva Prensa\", \"Cromos Magazine\", and outside, as \"Corno Emplumado\" (Mexico) and \"Zona Franca\" (Venezuela). He published also his \"Nadaism Magazine\".\n\n\"The Prophet,\" as he liked to call himself and was so called by his followers, ended his life in a tragic accident on the road Bogotá - Tunja on September 25, 1976.\n\n"}

Baxter Foundation Professor and Director of the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. She is known for establishing the reversibility of the mammalian differentiated state. Her landmark papers showed that nuclear reprogramming and the activation of novel programs of gene expression were possible, overturning the prevailing view that the differentiated state was fixed and irreversible. Her discoveries opened the door for cellular reprogramming and its application to stem cell biology.\n\nHelen Blau was born 1948 in London and is a dual citizen of the United States and Great Britain. She earned a B.A. from the University of York in England and an M.A. and Ph.D. in biology from Harvard University with Fotis C. Kafatos. After a postdoctoral fellowship with Charles J. Epstein in the Departments of Biochemistry and Biophysics and the Division of Medical Genetics at UCSF, she joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1978. She was awarded an endowed chair in 1999 and named Director of the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology in 2002.\n\nBlau is known for her support of women in science and success in mentoring numerous young scientists who comprise the next generation of academic leaders in muscle biology and regenerative medicine.\n\nIn the 1980s Dr. Blau's findings challenged the prevalent view that the mammalian differentiated state is fixed and irreversible. In her famous heterokaryon experiments she fused differentiated cells of two different species to form stable non-dividing heterokaryons, and found that previously silent genes could be activated. As a result, human keratinocytes, hepatocytes and fibroblasts expressed muscle genes that they normally never would. This body of work showed that the differentiated state requires continuous regulation and that a shift in the stoichiometry of trans-acting regulators induces nuclear reprogramming to another differentiated state. Her discoveries fostered the development of the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.\n\nBlau characterized muscle stem cells and showed they are dysfunctional in aging and in muscular dystrophy. She showed that stem cells lose their regenerative potential when grown in traditional plastic dishes and overcame this limitation by fabricating bioengineered microenvironments that mimic crucial stem cell niche and tissue properties. She\nhas applied this approach to identify molecules that rejuvenate the function of\nthe aged stem cell population and enhance muscle regeneration.\n\nBlau showed that telomere dysfunction in conjunction with dystrophin deficiency plays a central role in the skeletal muscle wasting and fatal cardiomyopathy characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Her lab's novel technologies enable rapid, transient and robust elongation of telomeres to overcome cellular dysfunction due to short telomeres, which have translational applications.\n\nDr. Blau's lab applied evolutionary lessons from newts and salamanders that regenerate limbs to identify genes that constitute barriers to regeneration. By transiently alleviating these brakes on the cell cycle, post-mitotic cells are induced to divide, reconstituting a regenerative cell source.\n\nA hallmark of Blau's research is the development and application of novel technologies. Her discovery of β-galactosidase complementation is widely used in drug discovery. Non-invasive bioluminescence imaging enables highly sensitive temporal and spatial resolution of muscle stem cell regenerative function in vivo. Using single cell lineage tracking and the Baxter algorithms her lab developed, cell morphology, movement, cell-cell interactions, division behavior and gene expression can be dynamically monitored, resolving the cellular basis for population changes, in response to pharmacologic interventions. She has eight issued US patents.\n\nDr. Blau's ongoing research focuses on cellular reprogramming, therapeutic interventions to enhance stem cell function in muscle regeneration, and cell rejuvenation strategies.\n\nAlong her professional career, among other honors, Professor Blau has won the following distinctions:\n\nHelen Blau has contributed to multiple national and international committees and boards. She served on the Congressional Liaison Committee for Public Policy for the American Society for Cell Biology. At NIH she served on the (RAC) Oversight Committee of Gene Therapy (created by Harold Varmus) and as a member of the Council of the National Institute on Aging. She has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers and the Board of Directors of the American Society of Gene Therapy and the Council of the National Academy of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. She has advised the Conseil Stratégique de l’Association Française contre les Myopathies (AFM) and served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the Helmsley Trust and the Ellison Medical Foundation. She currently serves on the Pew Charitable Trust Scholars Advisory Committee and the Council of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. \n\nProfessor Blau was born in England, spent her early childhood in the U.S. and then lived in Europe until she moved to the United States for graduate school. She speaks French and German. Her father, George E. Blau, was Chief historian for the U.S. Government in Europe and her mother Gertrud M.

He enjoyed great esteem from his contemporaries, both as an administrator and a philosopher.\n\nIt is still unclear where Ercole was born in Malta or when. He was a Dominican friar, for sure, but it not known where he completed his initial studies, whether in Malta, Sicily or elsewhere. The first time we come across documentary evidence about him is when, in 1711, he was Master of Studies at the \"Studium Generale\" of the Dominicans at Rabat, Malta. Four years later, in 1715, he held the same office at Trapani, Sicily.\n\nFor some unknown reason, some time between 1716 and 1718 Ercole was expelled from Sicily by royal decree, and returned to Malta. He acquired his Baccalaureate in theology between 1718 and 1722. In this latter year, Ercole was appointed Master of Studies at the Dominican \"Collegium Generale\" of Valletta, Malta. A year later, in 1723, he became Master of Theology.\n\nIn 1724, Ercole’s life took a turn when he was chosen as Prior Provincial of the Dominican province of Sicily (which included also Malta). This was at Caltanisetta, and Ercole was the first Maltese Dominican friar to achieve such a position. He remained in this office for two years, up till 1726, then returned to Malta. He lived at the convent of Valletta, where, in 1734, he was chosen as Prior of the community. Ercole was twice the Vicar-General of the Maltese Dominicans on behalf of the Sicilian Prior Provincial. The second time was between 1738 and 1741.\n\nThroughout this whole period, at least from 1711 onwards, Ercole never stopped teaching philosophy and theology. He was particularly close to the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, who consistently showered upon him innumerable favours. This stands as witness to Ercole’s position of high regard.\n\nUnfortunately, no portrait of him has been discovered as yet.\n\nVery few works of Ercole seem to have survived. Three works by Rosarius Mary Hagius declare that Ercole gave his assistance in their composition, though they fall short of asserting that he was their co-author.\n\nOnly one light work is certainly his: Lettere Famigliari (\"Convivial Letters\"), dedicated to Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. The manuscript, which is held at National Library of Malta in Valletta, Malta, and marked as MS. 759, is made up of 231 folios (though in the extant document the last six pages are missing). The work is a collection of twenty-six letters, all signed, in which Ercole imagines writing to scholars who had put in doubt the shipwreck of St. Paul on Malta back in the 1st century as recounted in the Bible (\"Acts of the Apostles\", Chapters 27-28). To illustrate his point, he also pens down a crude map of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nErcole’s writing is not a piece of rhetorical work, as one might expect with such themes. It is an interesting Scholastic disputation concentrating on the logic of statements put forward by the proponents. Ercole skilfully draws out certain main points, and examines their logical content and their syntax.\n\nApart from this work, it is possible that other compositions exist from Ercole’s hand. However, they might not bear his name, and much research is still needed to ascribe authorship to him.\n\n\nPhilosophy in Malta\n"}

{"id": "193965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193965", "title": "Hermetica", "text": "Hermetica\n\nThe Hermetica are Egyptian-Greek wisdom texts from the 2nd century AD and later, which are mostly presented as dialogues in which a teacher, generally identified as Hermes Trismegistus (\"thrice-greatest Hermes\"), enlightens a disciple. The texts form the basis of Hermeticism. They discuss the divine, the cosmos, mind, and nature. Some touch upon alchemy, astrology, and related concepts.\n\nThe term particularly applies to the Corpus Hermeticum, Marsilio Ficino's Latin translation in fourteen tracts, of which eight early printed editions appeared before 1500 and a further twenty-two by 1641. This collection, which includes \"Poimandres\" and some addresses of Hermes to disciples Tat, Ammon and Asclepius, was said to have originated in the school of Ammonius Saccas and to have passed through the keeping of Michael Psellus: it is preserved in fourteenth century manuscripts. The last three tracts in modern editions were translated independently from another manuscript by Ficino's contemporary Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500) and first printed in 1507. Extensive quotes of similar material are found in classical authors such as Joannes Stobaeus.\n\nParts of the \"Hermetica\" appeared in the 4th-century Gnostic library found in Nag Hammadi. Other works in Syriac, Arabic, Coptic and other languages may also be termed \"Hermetica\" — another famous tract is the \"Emerald Tablet\", which teaches the doctrine \"as above, so below\".\n\nAll these are themselves remnants of a more extensive literature, part of the syncretic, intellectualized paganism of their era, a cultural movement that also included the Neoplatonic philosophy of the Greco-Roman mysteries and late Orphic and Pythagorean literature and influenced Gnostic forms of the Abrahamic religions. There are significant differences: the Hermetica are little concerned with Greek mythology or the technical minutiae of metaphysical Neoplatonism. The Hermetica are heavily influenced by Judaism and explicitly refer to Genesis 1:28. However most of these schools do agree in attributing the creation of the world to a Demiurge rather than the supreme being and in accepting reincarnation. Although Neoplatonic philosophers, who quote apocryphal works of Orpheus, Zoroaster, Pythagoras and other figures, almost never cite Hermes Trismegistus, the tracts were still popular enough in the 5th century to be argued against by Augustine of Hippo in the \"City of God\".\n\nThe extant Egyptian-Greek texts dwell upon the oneness and goodness of God, urge purification of the soul, and defend pagan religious practices, such as the veneration of images. Their concerns are practical in nature, their end is a spiritual rebirth through the enlightenment of the mind:\nSeeing within myself an immaterial vision that came from the mercy of God, I went out of myself into an immortal body, and now I am not what I was before. I have been born in mind!\n\nWhile they are difficult to date with precision, the texts of the \"Corpus\" were likely redacted between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. During the Renaissance these texts were believed to be of ancient Egyptian origin and even today some readers believe them to date from Pharaonic Egypt. Since Plato's Timaeus dwelt upon the great antiquity of the Egyptian teachings upon which the philosopher purported to draw, scholars were willing to accept that these texts were the sources of Greek ideas. However the classical scholar Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614) successfully argued that some, mainly those dealing with philosophy, betrayed too recent a vocabulary. Hellenisms in the language itself point to a Greek-era origin. However, flaws in this dating were discerned by the 17th century scholar Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a terminus ad quem and not a quo. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of alchemy clothed in philosophical metaphor. And one text, the \"Asclepius\", lost in Greek but partially preserved in Latin, contained a bloody prophecy of the end of Roman rule in Egypt and the resurgence of pagan Egyptian power. Thus, it would be fair to assess the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" as intellectually eclectic.\n\nMore recent research, while affirming the late dating in a period of syncretic cultural ferment in Roman Egypt, suggests more continuity with the culture of Pharaonic Egypt than had previously been believed. There are many parallels with Egyptian prophecies and hymns to the gods but the closest comparisons can be found in Egyptian wisdom literature, which is characteristically couched in words of advice from a \"father\" to a \"son\". Demotic (late Egyptian) papyri contain substantial sections of a dialogue of Hermetic type between Thoth and a disciple. Egyptologist Sir William Flinders Petrie states that some texts in the Hermetic corpus date back to the 6th century BC during the Persian period. Some similarities between the Demotic texts and Platonic philosophy could be the result of Plato and his followers' having drawn on Egyptian sources.\n\nMany hermetic texts were lost to Western culture during the Middle Ages but rediscovered in Byzantine copies and popularized in Italy during the Renaissance. The impetus for this revival came from the Latin translation by Marsilio Ficino, a member of the de' Medici court, who published a collection of thirteen tractates in 1471, as \"De potestate et sapientia Dei\". The \"Hermetica\" provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on alchemy and modern magic as well as influencing philosophers such as Giordano Bruno and Pico della Mirandola, Ficino's student. This influence continued as late as the 17th century with authors such as Sir Thomas Browne.\n\nAlthough the most famous examples of Hermetic literature were products of Greek-speakers under Roman rule, the genre did not suddenly stop with the fall of the Empire but continued to be produced in Coptic, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian and Byzantine Greek. The most famous example of this later Hermetica is the \"Emerald Tablet\", known from medieval Latin and Arabic manuscripts with a possible Syriac source. Little else of this rich literature is easily accessible to non-specialists. The mostly gnostic Nag Hammadi Library, discovered in 1945, also contained one previously unknown hermetic text called \"The Ogdoad and the Ennead\", a description of a hermetic initiation into gnosis that has led to new perspectives on the nature of Hermetism as a whole, particularly due to the research of Jean-Pierre Mahé.\n\nJohn Everard's historically important 1650 translation into English of the \"Corpus Hermeticum\", entitled \"The Divine Pymander in XVII books\" (London, 1650) was from Ficino's Latin translation; it is no longer considered reliable by scholars. The modern standard editions are the Budé edition by A. D. Nock and A.-J. Festugière (Greek and French, 1946, repr. 1991) and Brian P. Copenhaver (English, 1992).\n\nThe following are the titles given to the eighteen tracts, as translated by G.R.S. Mead:\n\nThe following are the titles given by John Everard:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "243454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243454", "title": "Hug", "text": "Hug\n\nA hug is a form of endearment, universal in human communities, in which two or more people put their arms around the neck, back, or waist of one another and hold each other closely. If more than two persons are involved, it is referred to as a group hug.\n\nThe origins of the word are unknown but two theories exist. The first is that the verb \"hug\" (first used in the 1560s) could be related to the Old Norse word \"hugga\", which meant to comfort. The second theory is that the word is related to the German word \"hegen\" which means to foster or cherish, and originally meant to enclose with a hedge.\n\nA hug, sometimes in association with a kiss, is a form of nonverbal communication. Depending on culture, context and relationship, a hug can indicate familiarity, love, affection, friendship, brotherhood or sympathy. A hug can indicate support, comfort, and consolation, particularly where words are insufficient. A hug usually demonstrates affection and emotional warmth, sometimes arising from joy or happiness when reunited with someone or seeing someone absent after a long time. A non-reciprocal hug may demonstrate a relational problem. A hug can range from a brief one second squeeze, with the arms not fully around the friend to an extended holding. The length of a hug in any situation is socially and culturally determined. In the case of lovers, and occasionally others, the hips may also be pressed together. The emotionality of the hug furthermore influences the direction of the hug. In deeply emotional contexts, hugs tend to be more left-sided compared to hugs in neutral situations such as greetings. While the overall direction of hugs corresponds with physical motor phenotypes such as handedness, the emotional state induces an overall shift to the left attributed to right-hemispheric emotional processing. \n\nUnlike some other types of physical contact, a hug can be practiced publicly and privately without stigma in many countries, religions and cultures, within families, and also across age and gender lines, but is generally an indication that people are familiar with each other. Moving from a handshake (or touch-free) relationship to a hug relationship is a sign of a closer friendship such as best friends.\n\nAn unexpected hug can be regarded as an invasion of a person's personal space, but if it is reciprocated it is an indication that it is welcome. Some Western culture commentators advise avoiding hugs at work to prevent uncomfortable moments, especially with people who dislike hugging. Also, a person, especially a child, may caress and hug a doll or stuffed animal. Young children will also hug their parents when they feel threatened by an unfamiliar person, although this may be regarded as clinging onto rather than hugging because it demonstrates a need for protection rather than affection.\n\nWhile less common, hugging may be undertaken as part of a ritual or social act in certain social groups. It is a custom in some cultures such as France, Spain and Latin America for male friends to hug (as well as slap each other on the back) in a joyous greeting. A similar hug, usually accompanied by a kiss on the cheek, is also becoming a custom among Western women at meeting or parting. In Portugal and Brazil, it is common, mostly among males, to finish letters and emails with \"Um abraço\" or \"Abraço\" followed by the sender's signature. Similar formulas may be used in oral communication. In the Roman Catholic rite of the Holy Mass a hug may be substituted for a kiss or handshake during the kiss of peace ritual.\n\nIn May 2009, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"the hug has become the favorite social greeting when teenagers meet or part these days\" in the United States. A number of schools in the United States have issued bans on hugs, which in some cases have resulted in student-led protests against these bans.\n\nA Canadian journalistic investigation in 2015 noted the popularity of the hug in bromance, among young francophone adults in Quebec.\n\nSome cultures do not use hugging as a sign of affection or love, such as the Himba in Namibia. During the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, it is halal (permissible) for someone to hug one's significant other during daylight hours if one has self-control. However, if accompanied by libidinous urges, it is haram (sinful).\n\nIn the south Indian state of Kerala a sixteen-year-old boy was expelled from school for hugging a girl after she won a prize at an arts competition. When the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights ordered the school to re-enroll the boy, it was challenged in the High Court. The Court nullified the Commission's order and upheld the school principal's order to expel the student saying \"The school principal is the institution’s guardian, vested with powers to take action necessary to maintain discipline and morality in the school. The child rights commission cannot interfere there.\"\n\nHugging has been proven to have health benefits. One study has shown that hugs increase levels of oxytocin and reduce blood pressure.\n\nBased on significant research indicating that a 20-second-or-longer hug releases oxytocin. Leo Buscaglia encourages people to hug for 21 days consecutively and to have each day a hug that lasts for a minimum of 21 seconds. He recommends \"getting lost in the hug\", encouraging people to slow down and \"use the power of the hug to be fully present in the moment\".\n\nIn the United States, 30,000 people have Williams syndrome and are prone to hugging others.\n\nA group hug has been found to be a useful tool in group therapy to cement a sense of cohesion among the participants after a session, although it may cause discomfort for group members who shy away from physical contact.\n\nCuddling is a related form of physical intimacy in which two people hold one another with each person's arms wrapped around the other's body. Cuddling can be with family members, friends or lovers. In 2014, British sociologists Eric Anderson and Mark McCormack published a study which showed that 93% of British heterosexual student-athletes had spooned or cuddled with a male friend, as a sign of friendship. Similar to hugging, cuddling is a more affectionate and intimate embrace, normally done for a longer period of time (usually lasting from a few minutes to several hours). In contrast to hugging, which can often be a nonverbal greeting or parting tradition, cuddling is usually shared between two people who are lying down together or sitting somewhere in an intimate manner. Like hugging, cuddling makes the body release oxytocin, which has a variety of effects.\n\n"}

In the 1940s and 1950s, she exchanged a series of letters with Albert Einstein about philosophical aspects of physics, such as theory of relativity, fundamental constants and physical reality. She remained in contact with Einstein through correspondence until the death of Einstein in 1955.\n\n"}

Later, he left the monastery to study in Prague, gaining his baccalaureate in 1415. He joined the movement against Jan Želivský, after which he had to flee from Prague. He also opposed the Taborites, most notably at Konopiště in 1423. Later in Prague he opposed Jan Žižka, when he was blamed for the defeat of the Prague militia at Malešov.\n\nIn 1427 he became the vicar of Týn church. He even opposed Sigismund Korybut. In 1429 he became the \"správcem duchovenstva podobojí\", or the Vicar General of the Prague Archbishopric. In 1430 he earned his Master of Arts, and in 1435 became rector of Charles University.\n\nOn 4 October 1441 he convened an assembly of all estates at Kutná Hora, where the fundamentals of Hussite belief were laid down as the law of the land. In the year 1442 he made his peace with Jan Příbram. In 1444, the courts found in favour of him against the Taborites, who still refused to comply with the unanimous policy and the Tabor doctrine was decried.\n\nIn 1449, he started to correspond regularly with Pope Nicholas V, because he needed to carry out ordinations to the priesthood. In the end, he tried to come to see the Pope in person, but was unable to pass through Germany. For this reason, in 1451 he started talks with Constantinople about the potential cooperation of the Hussite and Greek Churches, but had to give up in 1452, when Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks.\n\nKing Ladislaus Posthumus (1440 - 1457) was unsure of Rokycan's agenda, so he avoided his sermons. In 1457, Jan Rokycana started corresponding again directly with the Pope (now Pope Callixtus III), though this was interrupted by Ladislaus's death.\n\nThe situation was somewhat improved by the rise of Jiří z Poděbrad, and although Jiří z Poděbrad tried to reduce the power of the church, Jan Rokycana supported his election through his lectures. From the beginning, Jan endorsed Jiří z Poděbrad's politics and had all churches ring their bells to mark the reconciliation of the Vratislavskys. In return, Jiří z Poděbrad considered him to represent the church and alternated between attending Jan Rokycana’s masses and those in Saint Vitus Cathedral.\n\nIn 1461, Jiří z Poděbrad began aspiring to the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor, which would surely have meant renouncing the chalice of Hussitism. This led Jan Rokycana to speak against Jiří z Poděbrad in his sermons. On 7 February 1465 he took part in a dispute over the king's ministry, after which the king requested greater cooperation from the church. A year later, in 1466, Jan Rokycana suffered a stroke, after which he started to have trouble speaking. He was buried in Týn church.\n\nFor his seal, he used a horseshoe with a star, probably in memory of his father, who was a blacksmith.\n\n\nHe has also been credited by some sources with the composing of several songs.\n\n\nThis article was translated from the Czech-language version (see \"Česky\" in the navigation bar on the left side of the screen), although some facts and dates do not exactly correspond to other articles in Wikipedia (see Links above).\n"}

He has also taught at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, and was president of the Philosophy of Science Association. He received his PhD from Princeton in 1968.\n\nJohn Earman was born in Washington, D.C. in 1942 and earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1968 with a dissertation on temporal asymmetry directed by Carl Gustav Hempel and Paul Benacerraf. After holding professorships at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, he joined the faculty of the History and Philosophy of Science department of the University of Pittsburgh in 1985. He remained at Pittsburgh for the rest of his career, recently retiring to become Professor Emeritus. Earman is a former president of the Philosophy of Science Association and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences. He is a member of the Archive Board of the Phil-Sci Archive.\n\nEarman has notably contributed to debate about the \"hole argument\". The hole argument was invented for slightly different purposes by Albert Einstein late in 1913 as part of his quest for the general theory of relativity (GTR). It was revived and reformulated in the modern context by John3 (a short form for the \"three Johns\": John Earman, John Stachel, and John Norton).\n\nWith the GTR, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether or not spacetime is a substance, since the GTR largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. The \"hole argument\" offered by John Earman is a powerful argument against manifold substantialism.\n\nThis is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nDefine a function formula_1 as the identity function over all elements over the manifold formula_2, excepting a small neighbourhood (topology) formula_3 belonging to formula_2. Over formula_3, formula_1 comes to differ from identity by a smooth function.\n\nWith use of this function formula_1 we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying formula_1 to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time formula_9, where formula_10 is a time function created by a foliation of spacetime, but differ after formula_9.\n\nThese considerations show that, since substantialism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantialism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantialism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10058145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10058145", "title": "Jorge J. E. Gracia", "text": "Jorge J. E. Gracia\n\nJorge J.E. Gracia (born 1942, Cuba) is the Samuel P. Capen Chair, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Department of Comparative Literature in the State University of New York at Buffalo. Gracia was educated in Cuba, the United States, Canada, and Spain, and received his Ph.D. in Medieval Philosophy from the University of Toronto.\n\nGracia has authored or edited over forty books. His areas of specialization include Metaphysics/Ontology, Philosophical Historiography, Philosophy of Language/Hermeneutics, Ethnicity/Race/Nationality Issues, Hispanic/Latino Issues, Medieval/Scholastic Philosophy and Hispanic/Latino/Latin-American Philosophy. While Gracia's earlier work was primarily in the areas of Medieval Philosophy and Metaphysics, much of his recent work has focused on issues of race, ethnicity and identity. His contributions to the philosophical study of race and ethnicity have been groundbreaking. It is within this area that Gracia proposed his familial-historical view of ethnicity and his genetic common-bundle view of race. These views of race and ethnicity have helped to shape the field and addressed many issues that previous theories had left unanswered.\n\nGracia was the founding chair of the APA Committee for Hispanics in Philosophy, past president of the Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy, past president of the Society for Iberian and Latin American Thought, past president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association, and past president of the Metaphysical Society of America.\n\nGracia studied architecture at Universidad de La Habana and also took classes at Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes San Alejandro, both in Havana, Cuba, for a year before coming to United States and earning a B.A. in philosophy at Wheaton College (Ill.) in 1965. In his book \"Painting Borges\", he narrates how he changed his field of study from architecture to mathematics to English literature to philosophy because he became \"enthralled by language\" and \"craved ... to know [its] secret.\" He received his M.A. in philosophy from University of Chicago in 1966, M.S.L. (Licentiate in Mediaeval Studies) in philosophy from Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in 1970, and Ph.D. in Medieval philosophy from University of Toronto in 1971. During his graduate studies he spent a year (1969-1970) at Institut d'Estudis Catalans for study and research.\n\nGracia has written extensively on the problem of individuation in the early Middle Ages. Within this context, he has explored Boethius and his metaphysical and logical approaches to the problem of individuation. He has also dealt with the metaphysical views of Thierry of Chartres, Gilbert of Potiers, Peter Abailard and others. He wrote the first book on the development of the problem of individuation in the early Middle Ages, the period that goes from the 6th century to the 14th. In this book, he applied a new, analytic problems approach method to the history of medieval philosophy.\n\nGracia has studied and written on the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, focusing on Aquinas' Christian philosophy, his approach to universals, and his metaphysics of thought and existence.\n\nGracia has explored the work of Francisco Suárez, focusing on his metaphysics as well as the issues of individuation and good and evil. He has also translated Suárez's Disputations V, X, and XI and published commentaries and editions of these. He has also studied Ramon Llull's work on metaphysics and individuation and written on José Ortega y Gasset.\n\nGracia has published many articles on the work of Latin American philosophers and explored their work in terms of the impact it has had upon Latin America. The research has also extended to the exploration of Latin American art and literature. He was a pioneer in this field. The anthology on Latin American philosophy he edited in the mid-1980s was the first work of its nature published in English by a philosopher.\n\nGracia's work in this area has examined the concept of Hispanic philosophy and presented a historico-relational understanding of it. In addition, Gracia has described the origin of Hispanic philosophy in the 16th century. He presented a historical account of discussions concerning the controversy about the nature of Latin-American philosophy and developed a historiographical model for the understanding of Hispanic thought.\n\nGracia has also focused on a systematic treatment of the main issues involved in philosophical historiography. He has dealt with such topics as the relation of philosophy to its history, the role of value judgments in historical accounts, the value of the history of philosophy for philosophy, the nature and role of texts and their interpretation in the history of philosophy, historiographical method, and the stages of development and progress of philosophical ideas. His book on the historiography of philosophy is the most comprehensive study of this topic in English.\n\nGracia has published many works in the area of metaphysics. He has devoted extensive time dealing with the metaphysical/ontological issues posed by categories. In this work, Gracia has also offered a systematic analysis of the nature of metaphysics which provides an answer as to why metaphysics always recovers from the many attacks to which it has been subjected throughout its history. Apart from a new conception of metaphysics and an explanation of the resilience of the discipline, Gracia presents an understanding of the nature and ontological status of categories, an analysis of the nature of reductionism and its role in philosophy, and a discussion and criticism of the main views concerning the nature of metaphysics developed in the history of philosophy. Gracia also distinguishes six fundamental issues in the metaphysics of individuality: intension, extension, ontological status, the principle of individuation, discernibility, and reference. He has taken new and controversial positions in all these topics.\n\nGracia has written on the logical and epistemological dimensions of a theory of textuality which takes into account the relevant views of both analytic and Continental thinkers and also of some major historical figures. He has given a logical analysis of the notion of text resulting from a definition that serves as the basis for the distinctions subsequently drawn between texts on the one hand and language, artifacts, art objects, and works on the other; and for the classification of texts according to modality and function. He has used his conclusions in this area to solve the various epistemological issues which have been raised about texts by philosophers of language, semioticians, hermeneuticists, literary critics, semanticists, aestheticians, and historiographers. Gracia has provided an ontological characterization of texts; it explores the issues raised by the identity of various texts; and it presents a view of the identity and function of authors and audiences and of their relations to texts.\n\nGracia has written a philosophical understanding of the conditions that must be satisfied by the interpretation of texts which are regarded as revealed by religious communities. He has focused on the issues of revelation, interpretation, various kinds of hermeneutical views (authorial, audiencial, literary, sociological, and theological), definitive interpretations, and the relativity of interpretations. He has argued for the preeminence of theological interpretations, for the logical possibility but the factual difficulty of definitive interpretations of revelation, and for the relativity of, but not relativism in, these interpretations. Gracia has also written on religious skepticism in Latin America.\n\nGracia has examined the nature of tradition and how a proper metaphysical understanding of this notion as a kind of action clarifies its various uses and helps us understand in turn how communication, the preservation of knowledge, and group identity take place. He has also published a systematic discussion of the notions of race, ethnicity, and nationality. He has written on the metaphysical questions of \"What is race?\" and \"What is ethnicity.\" It is within this area that Gracia has proposed his familial-historical view of ethnicity and his genetic common-bundle view of race. These views of race and ethnicity have helped to shape the field and addressed many issues that previous theories had left unanswered.\n\nGracia published systematic discussions of social issues that affect Latinxs/Hispanics in American society. As well, Gracia presents a familial/relational theory of Hispanic/Latinx identity. In addition he discusses such topics as the nature of ethnicity, the proper name for Hispanics/Latinxs, the origin of Hispanic/Latinx identity, the role of mestizaje in Hispanic/Latinx identity, the history of discussions of Latin American identity in Latin America, and the situation of Hispanics/Latinxs in American philosophy today. Within this work Gracia takes into account recent research in various disciplines: anthropology, sociology, history, philosophy, literature, and Latinx studies. Gracia's book on Hispanic/Latinx identity as the first published book on this topic.\n\nGracia has also published a systematic discussion of the nature and possibility of the philosophical interpretation of art with respect to Carlos Estévez work. Gracia's work also includes writing on a number of Cuban American artists, writers, and philosophers.\n\n\n1. Images of Thought: Philosophical Interpretations and Carlos Estévez's Art.

Bocheński earned a doctorate in philosophy (he studied in Fribourg in Switzerland, 1928–31). He was also an alumnus of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\" in Rome where he studied Sacred Theology from 1931 to 1934 earning a doctorate in Sacred Theology. Bocheński was a professor of logic at the \"Angelicum\" until 1940.\n\nDuring World War II he served as chaplain to Polish forces during the 1939 invasion of Poland, was taken prisoner of war, escaped the Germans and reached Rome. He joined the Polish Army and served as chaplain first in France, then in England. He fought as a soldier in 1944 in the Italian campaign of the Polish II Corps at Monte Cassino.\n\nIn 1945 he received the chair in the history of twentieth-century philosophy at the University of Fribourg (of which he was rector in 1964-66); he founded and ran the Institute of Eastern Europe there, and published the journal \"Studies in Soviet Thought\" and a book series concerned with the foundations of Marxist philosophy (\"Sovietica\").\n\nBocheński served as consultant to several governments: West Germany (under Konrad Adenauer), South Africa, the United States, Argentina, and Switzerland.\n\nBefore 1989 none of his works were published officially in Poland.\n\nBocheński is perhaps the most famous exponent of the Cracow Circle Thomism, which has been called \"the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars.\" The Circle was founded by a group of philosophers and theologians that, in distinction from traditional neo-Thomism, embraced modern formal logic and applied it to traditional Thomist philosophy and theology. Inspired by the logical clarity of Aquinas, members of the Circle held both philosophy and theology to contain \"propositions with truth-values…a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment etc.\" \"The Cracow Circle set about investigating and where possible improving this logical structure with the most advanced logical tools available at the time, namely those of modern mathematical logic, then called ‘logistic’.\" Other members of the Circle included and Jan F. Drewnowski.\n\nIn Bocheński's \"Précis de logique mathématique\", he uses this notation, in the style of Łukasiewicz:\n\nRobert Blanché quoted a passage of Bochenski’s \"Formale Logik\" in \"Structure intellectuelles\" (1966, 39): \"Hindu logic knows of three logical propositions and not the four of western logic. For it \"Some S are P\" does not signify \"Some S at least are P\" but \"Some S are P but not all\".\" This passage shows that Indian tradition explicitly speaks of the existence of partial quantity, the third quantity to be considered along with totality apprehended by A the universal affirmative of the square, and zero quantity apprehended by E the universal negative of the square. To the two universals A and E entertaining a relationship of contrariety, one should add the third contrary constituted by the double negation of the first two. As the subcontrary I contradicts E and the subcontrary O contradicts A, the logical proposition apprehending partial quantity can be represented by the conjunction of I and O : I & O. In Blanché’s logical hexagon this conjunction is symbolized by the letter Y. Many scholars think that the logical square of opposition, representing four values, should be replaced by the logical hexagon, which has the power to express more relations of opposition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "92222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92222", "title": "Kundalini yoga", "text": "Kundalini yoga\n\nKundalini yoga () is a school of yoga that is influenced by Shaktism and Tantra schools of Hinduism. It derives its name through a focus on awakening kundalini energy through regular practice of mantra, tantra, yantra, yoga\nor meditation. Kundalini yoga is often identified as the most dangerous form of yoga because of the involvement of subtle energies.\n\nWhat has become known as \"Kundalini yoga\" in the 20th century, after a technical term particular to this tradition, is actually a synthesis of many traditions which may include haṭha yoga techniques (such as bandha, pranayama, and asana), Patañjali's kriya yoga (consisting of self-discipline, self-study, and devotion to God), tantric visualization and meditation techniques of \"laya yoga\" (known as \"samsketas\"), and other techniques oriented towards the 'awakening of kundalini'. Laya may refer both to techniques of yoga, and (like Raja Yoga) its effect of \"absorption\" of the individual into the cosmic. Laya Yoga, from the Sanskrit term \"laya\" meaning \"dissolution\", \"extinction\", or \"absorption\", is almost always described in the context of other Yogas such as in the \"Yoga-Tattva-Upanishad\", the \"Varaha Upanishad\", the \"Goraksha Paddhati\", the \"Amaraugha-Prabodha\", and the \"Yoga-Shastra of Dattatreya\". The exact distinctions between traditional yoga schools is often hazy due to a long history of syncretism, hence many of our oldest sources on Kundalini come through manuals of the tantric and haṭha traditions such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Shiva Samhita. The Shiva Samhita describes the qualified yogi as practicing 'the four yogas' to achieve kundalini awakening while lesser students may resort solely to one technique or another: \"Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga. Laya Yoga is the third. The fourth is Raja Yoga. It is free from duality.\"\n\nThe Sanskrit adjective ' means \"circular, annular\". It does occur as a noun for \"a snake\" (in the sense \"coiled\", as in \"forming ringlets\") in the 12th-century \"Rajatarangini\" chronicle (I.2). ', a noun with the meaning \"bowl, water-pot\" is found as the name of a Naga in Mahabharata 1.4828.\nThe feminine \"kuṇḍalī\" has the meaning of \"ring, bracelet, coil (of a rope)\" in Classical Sanskrit, and is used as the name of a \"serpent-like\" Shakti in Tantrism as early as the 11th century, in the \"Śaradatilaka\". This concept is adopted as \"kuṇḍalniī\" as a technical term into Hatha yoga in the 15th century and becomes widely used in the Yoga Upanishads by the 16th century.\n\nThe \"Yoga-Kundalini\" Upanishad is listed in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads. Since this canon was fixed in the year 1656, it is known that the \"Yoga-Kundalini\" Upanishad was compiled in the first half of the 17th century at the latest.\nThe Upanishad more likely dates to the 16th century, as do other Sanskrit texts which treat \"kundalini\" as a technical term in tantric yoga, such as the \"Ṣaṭ-cakra-nirūpana\" and the \"Pādukā-pañcaka\". These latter texts were translated in 1919 by John Woodroffe as \"The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga\". He identifies the process of involution and its techniques in these texts as a particular form of Tantrik \"Laya Yoga\".\n\nThe \"Yogakundali\" and the \"Yogatattva\" are yoga texts related to the school of Hatha yoga and Mantra yoga. They are part of a tendency of syncretism combining the tradition of yoga with other schools of Hindu philosophy during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nThe \"Yoga-Kundalini\" Upanishad itself consists of three short chapters; it begins by stating that Chitta (consciousness) is controlled by Prana, and it's controlled by moderate food, postures and \"Shakti-Chala\" (I.1-2). Verses I.3-6 explain the concepts of moderate food and concept, and verse I.7 introduces \"Kundalini\" as the name of the \"Shakti\" under discussion:\n\nAlthough kundalini developed as a part of tantra side-by-side with hatha yoga through a process of syncretism, Swami Nigamananda (d. 1935) taught a form of \"laya yoga\" which he insisted was not part of Hatha yoga.\n\nSwami Sivananda (1935) introduced many readers to \"Kundalini Yoga\" with his book on the subject in 1935. This book has in-depth details about Kundalini Yoga Swami Sivananda's book combines laya teachings from older sources including the Hathapradipika and Satcakranirupdepth details about Kundalini Yogaana. Together with other currents of Hindu revivalism and Neo-Hinduism, Kundalini Yoga became popular in 1960s to 1980s western counterculture.\n\nIn 1968, Harbhajan Singh Khalsa, also known as Yogi Bhajan, introduced his own brand of kundalini yoga into the United States, \"Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan\". Yogi Bhajan founded the \"Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization\" (3HO) as a teaching organization. Yogi Bhajan took yogic postures and techniques, attached them to Tantric theories and Sikh mantras, synthesizing a new form of 'Kundalini' yoga. \"When placed alongside the teachings of Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari and Maharaj Virsa Singh, it becomes strikingly apparent that at least in its earliest years, Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini yoga was not a distinct practice, but essentially a combination of yogic mechanics learned from the former and the Sikh-derived mantras (Ik Ongkaar, Sat Naam, Sri Waheguru) and chanting from the latter,\" Deslippe writes. But Virsa Singh rejected Bhajan’s Kundalini yoga. Yoga was not a part of the Gobind Sadan spiritual path. And a power struggle ensued over who would win control of the new American followers.\n\nTraditional Sikhs use quotations by Bhai Gurdas, whose \"Vaaraa,\" or \"Ballads,\" were considered by Guru Arjan as a key to understanding the concepts of the Guru Granth as saying, wherever Guru Nanak went and debated the futility of yoga, the yogis gave up their yogic paths. The yogis of \"Gorakhmata,\" meaning \"Wisdom of Gorakhnatha,\" the founder of Hatha yoga, converted to the path of Guru Nanak, and also changed the name of their ancient center to \"Nanakmata,\" meaning \"Wisdom of Guru Nanak,\" known today as Gurdwara Sri Nanakmata Sahib.\nGuru Nanak never practiced yoga, and neither did any of the following Gurus, their Sikhs or the Khalsa. Yoga is unmistakably refuted in the Guru Granth.\n\nDisciples of Harbhajan Singh (Yogi Bhajan) claim that while Yoga practice and philosophy are generally considered a part of Hindu culture, Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is founded on the principles of Sikh Dharma. While adhering to the three pillars of Patanjali's kriya yoga system: discipline (\"tapaḥ\"), spiritual study (\"svādhyāya\") and devotion to God (\"iśvarapraṇidāna\") (PYS, II:1), Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan does not condone extremes of asceticism or renunciation. He encouraged his students to marry, establish businesses, and be fully engaged in society. Rather than worshiping God, Yogi Bhajan's teachings encourage students to train their mind to experience God. Yogi Bhajan sometimes referred to the Sikh lifestyle as \"Raja Yoga\", the yoga of living detached, yet fully engaged in the world.\n\nIn respect of the rigor of his teachings, Yogi Bhajan claims kinship with other 20th century Sikh sadhu saints, such as Sant Baba Attar Singh, Sant Baba Nand Singh, and Bhai Randhir Singh.\n\nYogi Bhajan version of Kundalini Yoga has continued to grow in influence and popularity largely in the Americas, Europe, South Africa, Togo, Australia, and East Asia, with the training of many thousands of teachers. It is popularized through books and videos, teachers such as Gurmukh, research by David Shannahoff-Khalsa, Dharma Singh Khalsa, Sat Bir Singh Khalsa and others, and through the publicity accorded it by various celebs such as Madonna (entertainer), Demi Moore, Cindy Crawford, Russell Brand, Al Pacino, David Duchovny, and Miranda Kerr who are known, or have been known, to practice it. One 2013 article in a New York wellness magazine described Kundalini Yoga as \"The Ultra-Spiritual Yoga Celebs Love.\"\n\n\"Kundalini\" is the term for \"a spiritual energy or life force located at the base of the spine\", conceptualized as a coiled-up serpent. The practice of Kundalini yoga is supposed to arouse the sleeping Kundalini Shakti from its coiled base through the 6 chakras, and penetrate the 7th chakra, or crown. \nThis energy is said to travel along the ida (left), pingala (right) and central, or sushumna nadi - the main channels of pranic energy in the body. A recent article has suggested that the process may be mediated by vagus nerve.\n\nKundalini energy is technically explained as being sparked during yogic breathing when prana and apana blends at the 3rd chakra (navel center) at which point it initially drops down to the 1st and 2nd chakras before traveling up to the spine to the higher centers of the brain to activate the \"golden cord\" - the connection between the pituitary and pineal glands - and penetrate the 7 chakras.\nBorrowing and integrating the highest forms from many different approaches, Kundalini Yoga can be understood as a tri-fold approach of Bhakti yoga for devotion, Shakti yoga for power, and Raja yoga for mental power and control. Its purpose through the daily practice of kriyas and meditation in sadhana are described a practical technology of human consciousness for humans to achieve their total creative potential. With the practice of Kundalini Yoga one is thought able to liberate oneself from one's Karma and to realize one's Dharma (Life Purpose).\n\nThe practice of kriyas and meditations in Kundalini Yoga are designed to raise complete body awareness to prepare the body, nervous system, and mind to handle the energy of Kundalini rising. The majority of the physical postures focus on navel activity, activity of the spine, and selective pressurization of body points and meridians. Breath work and the application of bandhas (3 yogic locks) aid to release, direct and control the flow of Kundalini energy from the lower centers to the higher energetic centers.\n\nAlong with the many kriyas, meditations and practices of Kundalini Yoga, a simple breathing technique of alternate nostril breathing (left nostril, right nostril) is taught as a method to cleanse the \"nadis\", or subtle channels and pathways, to help awaken Kundalini energy.\n\nSovatsky (1998) adapts a developmental and evolutionary perspective in his interpretation of Kundalini Yoga. That is, he interprets Kundalini Yoga as a catalyst for psycho-spiritual growth and bodily maturation. According to this interpretation of yoga, \"the body bows itself into greater maturation [...], none of which should be considered mere stretching exercises\".\n\n\n\"Kundalini Yoga consists of active and passive asana-based kriyas, pranayama, and meditations which target the whole body system (nervous system, glands, mental faculties, chakras) to develop awareness, consciousness and spiritual strength.\" —Yogi Bhajan\n\n\n \n"}

She has written on the themes of prejudice, social exclusion and minority rights, and has contributed to public debates on hate speech.\n\nHer book \"Respect, Plurality, and Prejudice\" combined critical theory with psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies, examining the underlying unconscious forces and structures that make up the phenomena of xenophobia, Antisemitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and sexism. It provides an overview of how social prejudices, and the discrimination and violence that often tend to accompany the latter, come into being. Moreover, It argues that in order to fully understand how a complex phenomenon such as prejudice works, we need to alter our traditional Western philosophical understanding of the subject as a supposedly fully rational, autonomous and individual agent. Auestad argues that we need a more situated and relational understanding of subjectivity and the subject, as prejudice and acts of discrimination always take place in a contextualized setting between subjects whose thoughts and actions influence each other.\n\nAuestad has also written about the rise of nationalism in European countries, both in terms of its expression in extreme far-right groups and in the context of everyday political language and policy.\n\nAuestad suggested that psychoanalysis can be used to think about the invisible and subtle processes of power over symbolic representation, for example, in the context of stereotyping and dehumanization, and posed the question of what forces govern the states of affairs that determine who is an 'I' and who is an 'it' in the public sphere.\n\nShe founded and runs the international and interdisciplinary conference series Psychoanalysis and Politics http://www.psa-pol.org , which aims to address how contemporary political issues may be analyzed through psychoanalytic theory and vice versa – how political phenomena may reflect back on psychoanalytic thinking.\n\n\n\nIn English:\nAbout the book, Respect, Plurality, and Prejudice, podcast on New Books in Psychoanalysis 11 September 2015 \n\nAbout hate speech: \"Fierce online debate brings more prejudice\" Alpha Galileo 13 September 2013 \nAbout the conference series \"Psychoanalysis and Politics\" \"Introducing Psychoanalysis and Politics\" in \"Journal of Psycho-Social Studies\" Volume 7 (1) 2013\nin Swedish:\n•Lene Auestad, Iréne Matthis and Diana Mulinari: Vad ska vi med psykoanalysen till?

He was a Professor in the Department of Mathematics, a Member of University Grant Commission and the Dean of the faculty of Science at the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka.\n\nDe Silva has openly stated that the so-called 'objective scientific method' is a lie.\n\nIn June 2011 he stated that information regarding presence of Arsenic in water claiming that the cause of Rajarata Chronic Kidney Disease had been given to him by the god \"Natha\". The Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science, an organisation in which De Silva claims lifelong membership, has said that they consider it \"extremely unfortunate that the Dean of a Science Faculty should make it his publicly stated aim to run down science and bring it into disrepute.\". However the presence of Arsenic was verified in water and vegetation, and the source was found to be agrochemical fertilizers.\n\nNalin de Silva was born on 20 October 1944 in Kovilagodella, Panadura, Sri Lanka. His father was Daniel De Silva, a principal and his mother was Jayline Perera, a school teacher. De Silva was the eldest of eight siblings. He had primary education at Bauddhaloka Maha Vidyalaya, Thurstan College Colombo and secondary education at Royal College Colombo. He captained the Sinhala Debating team at Royal College and won the Weerasooriya medal for oratory. \nHe entered the University of Ceylon in 1963 and graduated in Mathematics in 1967. De Silva entered University of Sussex in January 1969, where he obtained his Doctorate in Theoretical Physics -Cosmology - in 1970.\nHe is married and has two sons and one daughter.\n\nNalin de Silva was formally a member of the Marxist Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Nava Sama Samaja Party, and as a marxist studying both disciplines he intensively began to question the foundations of both Marxism and science. As a result, in 1986, he wrote \"Mage Lokaya\" (My World), criticizing the basis of the established western system of knowledge, and its propagation, which he refers as \"domination throughout the world\".He explained in this book that mind independent reality is impossible and knowledge is not found but constructed.\n\nThis has further evolved into a study of Epistemology & Ontology, and in the process he has introduced and developed the concept of \"Constructive Relativism\" as the basis on which knowledge is constructed relative to the sense organs, culture and the mind completely based on Avidya. Though he was identified as a representative of \"Jathika Chinthanaya\" an idea proposed by Gunadasa Amarasekara based on national thought concept of Erich Fromm, Nalin de Silva's concept Chinthanaya is a different epistemological concept.\n\nThe Rajarata Chronic Kidney Disease (RCKD) has been an ailment prevalent in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka for several decades. In 2010 a team of scientists headed by Prof. Priyani Paranagama, Head of the Chemistry Department at Kelaniya University, conducted a study to find the cause of the disease. The team was advised by Prof. Nalin de Silva, Dean of the Faculty of Science, Kelaniya University. The team presented their findings in June 2011. They stated that they had found high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water, vegetation, rice and other samples in the region. The team however refused to release their data to the public raising questions about their methodology. Their finding were followed by allegations that the arsenic was being introduced to the system through foreign pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nAs this statement caused a huge uproar in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka, the Industrial Technology Institute stated that they had used Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometry on rice samples which showed no high levels of arsenic. The ITI study also found that in samples of 28 different pesticides only 3 showed any signs of arsenic, and even then not in the concentrations that De Silva's team alleged. The Kelaniya University team stated that they had used new methods to locate the Arsenic in the samples they collected but did not feel a need to submit their findings for peer-review. De Silva stated that they did not publish their results in a \"so-called peer reviewed journal due to our concern regarding the authorship of the paper as the original idea was given by 'samyak drshtika devivaru' also known as Devas\n\nWhen the authenticity of the findings made by the University of Kelaniya team were questioned by other scientists De Silva stated that the god \"Natha\" had first told them about the arsenic through a mystic.\nThe merit (pina) in this regard should go to the \"samyak drshtika devivaru\" who first told that Arsenic is present in Rajarata drinking water and later revealed to us that Arsenic which is not found naturally in Sri Lanka has found its way to the wells and the wewas in Rajarata through Agrochemicals. \n\nIt's simply like this. We can see professors. Professors cannot see Arsenic. We cannot see gods. Gods can see Arsenic. I like this because there is certain symmetry in it... I know very well that the so-called objective scientific method is a lie.\n\nDr Paranagama too has stood by De Silva and defended their methods. She said that they had first been told of the Arsenic by the wife of \"a university lecturer who had developed her mental faculties to communicate with a higher being\", but then used scientific methods to deduce it.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science released a statement in July 2011 questioning the validity of the findings and the process and individuals involved in the study. Their statement laid the blame for the scandal firmly on Prof Nalin De Silva and they called for other scientists and researchers in the group to distance themselves from De Silva to have their work taken seriously .\n\nThere is another serious issue which casts grave doubts on the credibility of the claims made by the Kelaniya group. The press has publicly identified as the leader of this group an individual, who despite holding a responsible position, professes a disdain for 'Western' science. He has publicly claimed supernatural revelations ('samyak drushtika devivaru') as the source of his group's information and even methods. While recognising that many scientists are deeply religious, the SLAAS wishes to state categorically that superstition and the supernatural have no place in science, and that scientific results inspired by such sources are highly suspect because of a probable bias on the part of the investigator.\n\nWe also note that other researchers in the group have yet to distance themselves from the eccentric statements of their leader, and they need to do this if they wish to be taken seriously as scientists.\n\nProf. De Silva has also been a vocal opponent of what he calls western cultural dominance which he claims is in its final phase.\nThe western Christian modernity (WCM) is in the last phase of its hegemony and is acting like an insane person. It has no respect for the sovereignty of the other countries as has been exemplified from invasions, killings and supporting so called rebel groups in the countries in Asia and Africa. The USA that became the leader of WCM after the so called second world war is trying desperately to hold to the hegemony of WCM. After more than five hundred years of world domination WCM will have to leave the planet without making the people suffer more and more. \n\nProf. De Silva has also referred to linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky as a puppet of the Western Christian Modernity.\nThe west also maintains people such as Chomsky who is not known to the average American in order to show to the world that there is freedom for the intellectuals to champion their views heard more by the rest of the world than by the Americans themselves.\n\nNalin de Silva who is influenced by Paul Feyerabend rejected the existence of scientific method and propose proliferation of sciences on various chinthanayas. \n\nHe proposes theories are stories constructed by abductive reasoning to explain phenomenas . \n\nHe refuses ideas that science is truth or science is advancing towards the truth.\n\nDe Silva was sacked from the University of Colombo for engaging in unlawful political activity within the campus. In subsequent letters he has described the event.\nWhen I was in the University of Colombo, not the best place to fight the cultural pentagon, I was asked by the then Vice Chancellor G. L. Peiris why I was teaching Jathika Chinthanaya to a captive audience. The audience was not that captive and had the backing of the Vice Chancellor and some members of the senior staff, and of course the cultural pentagon. Nothing happened to the captive audience but soon I found that I was out of the University system. \n\nIn 2008 the Veemansaka Parshadaya, a student organisation where De Silva is the treasurer and mentor started a campaign to ban western clothing in Kelaniya University.\n\nNalin de Silva is a member of the International Astronomical Union.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the editor-in-chief of MacMillan's eight-volume \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" from 1967, and lectured at New York University, Brooklyn College and the New School for Social Research from the 1960s to the 1990s.\n\nEdwards was born Paul Eisenstein in Vienna in 1923 to assimilated Jewish parents, the youngest of three brothers. According to Peter Singer, his upbringing was non-religious. He distinguished himself early on as a gifted student and was admitted to the Akademisches Gymnasium, a prestigious Viennese high school. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Edwards was sent by his family to Scotland, later joining them in Melbourne, Australia, where the family name was changed to Edwards. He attended Melbourne High School, graduating as dux of the school, then studied philosophy at the University of Melbourne, completing a B.A. and M.A.\n\nHe was awarded a scholarship to study in England in 1947, but on his way there, he stopped in New York and ended up staying there for the rest of his life, apart from a brief period teaching at the University of California in Berkeley. He was awarded his doctorate by Columbia University in 1951. While writing his doctoral thesis he contacted Bertrand Russell because he shared Russell's scepticism about religious belief. This led to a lasting friendship and a number of joint projects. Edwards collected Russell's writings on religion and published them in 1957, with an appendix on \"the Bertrand Russell case,\" under the title \"Why I am not a Christian\". He taught at New York University until 1966, at Brooklyn College from then until 1986, and at the New School from the 1960s until 1999.\n\nEdwards was characterized by Michael Wreen as \"mixed one part analytic philosopher to one part \"philosophe\"\" with \"a deep respect for science and common sense.\" His considerable influence on moral philosophy came from two works he edited, a very widely used introductory book he co-edited with Arthur Pap (\"A modern introduction to philosophy\", 1965), and the famous \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", an eight-volume \"massive Enlightenment work with notable analytic sensibility.\"\n\nHe was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nPhilosopher Timothy Madigan wrote in an obituary: \"Those who knew Edwards will always remember his erudition and his wicked sense of humour. [ ... ] Given Paul's own biting wit, it's not surprising that he so admired Voltaire and Russell. [ ... ] Never one to hide his own unbelief, he often commented that his two main goals were to demolish the influence of Heidegger and keep alive the memory of Wilhelm Reich, the much-reviled psychoanalyst whose critiques of religion Edwards felt remained valid.\" Edwards was also sympathetic to the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, although he detested Kierkegaardian existentialist admirers such as Heidegger and William Barrett for confusing and conflating Kierkegaardian terminology.\n\nEdwards was editor-in-chief of Macmillan's \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", published in 1967. With eight volumes and nearly 1,500 entries by over 500 contributors, it is one of the monumental works of twentieth century philosophy. Using his editorial prerogative, Edwards made sure that there were plentiful entries on atheism, materialism and related subjects (which is not surprising considering that such subjects would have been of interest to modern philosophers). He always remained \"a fervent advocate of clarity and rigour in philosophical argument.\" When, after four decades, the \"Encyclopedia\" was revised by other editors for a new edition, Edwards told Peter Singer that he was \"distressed that the revisions had diluted the philosophical message and had been too gentle on a lot of postmodern thought.\"\n\nEdwards was highly skeptical of claims regarding reincarnation. He was the author of the book \"Reincarnation: A Critical Examination\" (1996), which is notable for criticizing the cases collected by Ian Stevenson. The book has received positive reviews from academics. Barry Beyerstein wrote that \"Skeptics who follow my recommendation and read \"Reincarnation: A Critical Examination\" will derive much ammunition for arguing not only with reincarnationists but with 'near-death experience' aficionados and afterlife enthusiasts of other stripes as well.\" Philosopher and parapsychologist Stephen E. Braude criticized the arguments presented in Edwards book, saying, \"Apparently Edwards did not realize that his condescending and allegedly hard-nosed attack on reincarnationists was as deeply (and inevitably) metaphysical as the view he opposed.\"\n\nEdwards said that when he arrived in New York in 1947 Wilhelm Reich was \"the talk of the town\" and that for years he and his friends regarded Reich as \"something akin to a messiah\": \"There was ... a widespread feeling that Reich had an original and penetrating insight into the troubles of the human race.\" Twenty years later, as editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy,\" Edwards wrote an article about Reich, comprising 11 pages as compared to the four devoted to Freud. He pointed out what is of interest to philosophers in Reich: his views concerning the origin of religious and metaphysical needs, the relation between the individual and society and the possibility of social progress, and, above all, the implications of his psychiatry for certain aspects of the mind-body problem. An abridged version of the article appeared in the \"Encyclopedia of Unbelief\" (ed. Gordon Stein, 1985).\n\nEdwards omitted Reich's orgone therapy from the \"Encyclopedia\" article because, he said, \"it is of no philosophical interest.\" But in a BBC interview he said somewhat more: \"I concede that Reich had no real competence as a physicist... At the same time I am quite convinced that the orgone theory cannot be complete nonsense. For a number of years, largely out of curiosity, I sat in an orgone accumulator once a day.\"\n\n\n\n"}

That’s why this initiative has proposed that, for one day a year on 21 September, every country raises an all-white version of their national flag to represent that we are all one. In 2013, embassies of Colombia, Equatorial Guinea and Ecuador in London officially agreed to support The Peace Flag initiative by raising a colorless version of their respective flags on September 21. The initiative was nominated for a White Pencil in 2012 at D&AD for its contribution towards peace, in support of Peace One Day.\n\nThe white flag is recognized in most of the world as a flag of surrender, truce or ceasefire. The first mention of a white flag used in this context is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220). A white flag was also used by the anti-war movement during the US Civil War in 1861.\n\nIn 1891, the third Universal Peace Congress in Rome devised a generalized Peace Flag design, which was simply the home nation's flag bordered in white to signify non-violent conflict resolution. This was used (although not officially adopted) by the American Peace Society and the Universal Peace Union. It was designed by Henry Pettit.\n\nIn the 1890s, expatriate American Cora Slocomb di Brazza Savorgnan, the Countess Di Brazza, invented a universal peace flag with three upright bands: yellow, purple, and white, which became the peace flag of the International Peace Bureau. Originally, there was a complicated symbol on the middle band: \"a shield ... surmounted by a man's and a woman's clasped hands, sustained by a pair of dove wings with a white star aloft; on the shield can appear any device chosen by the association adopting the flag, or simply the number of enrollment among the users of the flag, or the motto \"Pro Concordia Labor\" (For Peace I Work), or this motto may be placed upon a ribbon on the flag beneath the shield, or on a streamer (white) from the flag staff (blue, the color of promise) surmounted by a star with the motto of the association or individual using the flag upon the other white streamer\".\n\nThis flag was adopted by the International Council of Women in 1896. In 1904, it lost the complicated design and became a simple tricolor.\n\nJames William van Kirk, a Methodist minister from Youngstown (Ohio, USA), designed the first world peace flag of the Earth, using rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. In 1913 and 1929, he made a peace tour through Europe with his flag. He traveled around the world arguing for \"the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God\".\n\nThe Universal Peace Congress eventually came to adopt Kirk's flag as its official World Peace Flag, and it was subsequently adopted by the American Peace Society as well as other groups. It consisted of \"the earth on a blue field covered with white stars; a white band crossed the globe and to the left was broken up into a spectrum representing the variations of the human race — different, but united in peace\".\n\nIn 1938, Kirk authored an autobiography, \"Stranger than fiction : four times around the world, designer of world flag, a world builder, at 80 years makes a new start in life\".\n\nThe \"banner of peace\" is a symbol of the Roerich Pact. This pact was the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments. It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by Nicholas Roerich for an international pact for the protection of culture values.\n\nThe most common recent design is a rainbow flag representing peace, first used in Italy at a peace march in 1961. The flag was inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against nuclear weapons. A previous version had featured a dove drawn by Pablo Picasso.\n\nThe most common variety has seven colours — purple, blue, azure, green, yellow, orange, and red — and is emblazoned in bold with the Italian word \"PACE\", meaning \"peace\".\n\nIt became popular with the \"Pace da tutti i balconi\" (\"peace from every balcony\") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in the world. The flag was flown from balconies in all Italian cities by citizens against the war. Its use spread to other countries too, and the Italian \"Pace\" was sometimes, but not everywhere, replaced with the corresponding translation in the local languages.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, producer Franco Belsito had produced about 1,000 flags per year for 18 years, and suddenly had to cope with a demand in the range of the millions.\n\nCommon variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top.\n\nThe seven-color peace flag is not to be confused with the similar six-color gay pride flag, which does not have azure (it has turquoise) and the colors are in opposite order: with red at the top.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein, in his 1947 short story \"The Green Hills of Earth\", referred to \"Terra's [Earth's] rainbow banner\".\n\nThe first large peace flag was made in Lecce, Salento, Italy by the association \"GPace - Youth for peace\" on Saturday, 14 November 2009. It was 21 m wide and 40 m long. Three years later this record was broken. On September the 21st 2012 the Belgian Peace Organisation Vrede vzw, Vredeshuis Ghent and five city schools unfolded the worlds largest peace flag (30 m wide and 50 m long) in the historic center of Ghent. The action aimed to reinforce the demand to disarm in order to make room for sustainable development.\n\n\n"}

Munz is one of two students who studied under both Popper and Wittgenstein. \n\nMunz was born in Chemnitz, Germany in 1921, and educated in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. The Munz family were Jewish, and the rise of fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany led Munz and his mother and sister to emigrate to New Zealand. They arrived in Christchurch in January 1940.\n\nLater in 1940, Munz enrolled in Canterbury University College, where he studied German, history and philosophy. His philosophy lecturer was Karl Popper, who had also migrated from Europe to New Zealand to escape the Nazi regime. The two men became close friends.\n\nAfter graduating from Canterbury in 1944, Munz earned a PhD at Cambridge University in England. At Cambridge he studied under Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nMunz returned to New Zealand to lecture at Victoria University of Wellington, where he taught the history of the middle ages, 17th century France, and the French Revolution. He published work on medieval history, and translated the work of other writers from German and Italian into English.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Munz also researched and published on the place of religion in modern thought and the role of myth in society. From the mid 1970s, his work focused increasingly on philosophy. Some of his published work focused on his two mentors, Popper and Wittgenstein. He agreed with Popper that there is such a thing as certain knowledge, and that societies are better off when knowledge is free and open. \n\nOne of his former students wrote that Munz \"liked being provocative\", and in his later life he took several controversial positions. He was highly critical of postmodern history, and in 1994 published a long and scathing review of Anne Salmond's book Two Worlds in which he suggested that she was less interested in historical truth than \"faddish\" postmodernism and political correctness. The review also made a number of unflattering comments about traditional Maori society, saying that they \"found\" New Zealand but did not \"discover\" it, and that they \"were not good observers... a society in which people are unable to discern and diagnose life-threatening events is lacking in something that is essential.\"\n\nIn 2004 Munz appeared before the New Zealand Parliament's Law and Order select committee to argue that consensual incest should be legalised. He argued that \"the prohibition of incest is completely universal in early Palaeolithic societies and has lingered on ever since. But in modern civil societies it is an outmoded prohibition.\"\n\nHe was a frequent critic of the state of Israel, saying that \"I'm Jewish myself and I find it absolutely devastating how other Jews can do things like steal other people's lands and then kill them.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1272337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1272337", "title": "Pity", "text": "Pity\n\nPity is a sympathetic sorrow evoked by the suffering of others and is used in a comparable sense to \"compassion\", \"condolence\" or \"empathy\". Through frequent, insincere, pejorative usage, it is used to connote feelings of superiority, condescension, or contempt.\n\nThe word \"pity\" comes from the Latin \"pietās\", that is also etymon of \"piety\".\n\nThe word is often used in the translations from ancient Greek into English of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" and \"Rhetoric\". Aristotle argued (Rhetoric 2.8) that before a person can feel pity for another human, the person must first have experienced suffering of a similar type, and the person must also be somewhat distanced or removed from the sufferer. In Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\" he defines pity as follows: \"Let pity, then, be a kind of pain in the case of an apparent destructive or painful harm of one not deserving to encounter it, which one might expect oneself, or one of one's own, to suffer, and this when it seems near\". Aristotle also pointed out that \"people pity their acquaintances, provided that they are not exceedingly close in kinship; for concerning these they are disposed as they are concerning themselves...For what is terrible is different from what is pitiable, and is expulsive of pity\". Thus, from Aristotle's perspective, in order to feel pity, a person must believe that the person who is suffering does not deserve their fate. Developing a traditional Greek view in his work on poetry, Aristotle also defines tragedy as a kind of imitative poetry that provokes pity and fear. \n\nThe religious concept of pity was reinforced in the West after the acceptance of Judeo-Christian concepts of God by the proposition of a deity which felt pity for all humanity. Consistent references to the concept of God's pity can be found in the older Jewish tradition. The Hebrew word \"Hesed\" translated in the LXX by \"Eleos\" carries the meaning roughly equivalent to pity in the sense of compassion, mercy and loving-kindness. (See The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, 698a.) By the nineteenth century, two different kinds of pity had come to be distinguished, which we might call \"benevolent pity\" and \"contemptuous pity\" (see Kimball). David Hume observed that pity which has in it a strong mixture of good-will, is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of dislike, with a mixture of pride. Pity is an emotion that almost always results from an encounter with a real or perceived unfortunate, injured, or pathetic creature. Jean-Jacques Rousseau had the following opinion of pity as opposed to love for others: \"It is therefore certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, by moderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributes to the mutual preservation of the whole species. It is this pity which hurries us without reflection to the assistance of those we see in distress; it is this pity which, in a state of nature, stands for laws, for manners, for virtue, with this advantage, that no one is tempted to disobey her sweet and gentle voice: it is this pity which will always hinder a robust savage from plundering a feeble child, or infirm old man, of the subsistence they have acquired with pain and difficulty, if he has but the least prospect of providing for himself by any other means: it is this pity which, instead of that sublime maxim of argumentative justice, Do to others as you would have others do to you, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness a great deal less perfect, but perhaps more useful, Consult your own happiness with as little prejudice as you can to that of others. It is in a word, in this natural sentiment, rather than in fine-spun arguments, that we must look for the cause of that reluctance which every man would experience to do evil, even independently of the maxims of education.\" \n\nA person experiencing pity will experience a combination of intense sorrow and mercy for the person or creature, often giving the pitied some kind of aid, physical help, and/or financial assistance. Nietzsche, however, pointed out that since all people to some degree value self-esteem and self-worth, pity can negatively affect any situation. Additionally, pity may actually be psychologically harmful to the pitied: Self-pity and depression can sometimes be the result of the power imbalance fostered by pity, sometimes with extremely negative psychological and psycho-social consequences for the pitied party.\n\nThough in his later works he reverses his position and sees Pity as an emotion that can draw beings together, Mystic poet William Blake is known to have been ambivalent about the emotion Pity. In The Book of Urizen Pity begins when Los looks on the body of Urizen bound in chains (Urizen 13.50–51). However, Pity furthers the fall, \"For pity divides the soul\" (13.53), dividing Los and Enitharmon (Enitharmon is named Pity at her birth). Analyzers of this work assert that Blake shows that \"Pity defuses the power of righteous indignation and proper prophetic wrath that lead to action. Pity is a distraction; the soul is divided between it and the action a 'pitiable' state demands. This is seen as Los's division into active male and tearful female, the latter deluding the former.\" Again railing against Pity in \"The Human Abstract\", Blake exclaims: \"Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor\" (1–2).\n\nModern neurology asserts that pity consists of an initial aversion to the plight of the sufferer, after which the higher parts of the brain make a more nuanced assessment of the situation (e.g., considering the context and invoking empathy, etc.).\n\n\n"}

In Sweden and Finland courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar scheme—some Scottish universities, for example, divide philosophy into logic, metaphysics, and ethics—but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as Södertörns Högskola.\n\nPractical Philosophy is also the use of philosophy and philosophical techniques in everyday life. This can take a number of forms including reflective practice, personal philosophical thinking, and philosophical counselling.\n\nExamples of practical philosophy subjects are:\nScience, which emerged from philosophy, deals with material realities, arts with the various styles of expressions while philosophy deals with our experience of reality by essentially different methods.\nOntology provides techniques to deal the concept of reality, and how \"truth\" may be either \"doxa\" (informed opinion) or \"techa\" (demonstrable fact). This branch of philosophy also considers the relation of man to the measurable physical universe and to the virtual concept of divine influences. \nAxiology provides directions in determining what is socially correct opinion and behavior:\nEpistemology deals with knowledge. It tells us which knowledge is ultimate?\n\nEach social group develops its ideology of life according to epistemology. While science provides a measure of testable \"techa\", it is also partly a belief system with values.\n\nFirst, the practitioners (there must be at least two) must identify what is wanted from the process - the objective of the enterprise. Secondly we consider the resources we have to hand such as time, learning, experience, intelligence and so on, and finally we try to unite what we do now know as \"truth\" to the objective we wish to know, using techniques such as rhetoric,debate, discussion, argumentation. No matter what the protagonists actually think or believe, generally one person or group tries advocate the conventional point of view, while their opponents try to convince them of a radically opposing and controversial opinion.\n\n\n"}

It is usually used pejoratively.\n\nThe term \"selfism\" was used by Paul Vitz in his 1977 book \"Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship\". Vitz deconstructs the selfist movement(s) and tries to uphold God-centered altruism, and claims that all of modern-day liberalism and leftism are essentially selfist at their core. He lays the blame predominantly at the feet of Erik Erikson, Erich Fromm, and other prominent psychologists of the third quarter of the 20th century (c. 1950–1975 CE).\n\nExplicit selfishness as a desirable end and moral good had diverse manifestations during that period, for example, in the writings of David Seabury, Ayn Rand, and even among some of Rand's near-opposites, such as Erikson and Fromm. Rand called her philosophy Objectivism. Later popularizers of similar positions include Nathaniel Branden, Paul Lepanto, Robert Ringer, Harry Browne, and David Kelley, among others. None of these named the system they espoused \"selfism\" or characterized it as \"selfist\", although both Seabury and Rand included the word \"selfishness\" in the titles of books presenting their views. Many of these figures were pro-capitalist secularists (\"atheist capitalists\"), but Seabury was a Christian, while Erickson and Fromm were prominent leftists.\n\nAnton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and author of The Satanic Bible, acknowledges Ayn Rand and Objectivism as a source of inspiration for LaVeyan Satanism. This form of Satanism holds the self above all else in similar fashion to Objectivism. Despite some similarities, they remain separate entities, as there are clear differences between the two concepts.\n\nSome early examples of \"selfist\" thinking are the egoistic philosophies of Yangism in ancient China and of Cyrenaic hedonism in ancient Greece. Yangists followed the teachings of Yang Zhu and might have been influenced by Taoism. Cyrenaics, founded by Aristippus of Cyrene, were skeptics and materialists (but perhaps nominally Greek pagans). Thomas Hobbes, who could also be viewed as \"selfist\", was a materialist but also advocated loyalty to a strong government and state church. Joseph Butler, whose philosophy is unmistakably selfist, was generally regarded as an orthodox Christian and was canonized an Anglican saint. The views of Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner provide a more proximate link to the modern selfists.\n\n"}

Ettore Bresciani Filho (2001) recommends the following order in systemography modeling:\n\nTo systemograph consists, in a few words, in building a model, physical or mathematical, static or dynamic, analytical or numeric of a phenomenon that can be noticed as complex by the analyzer that intends to model it.\n\nThe elaboration of the operational systemographs (presenting the operations involved in the process), of the informational systemographs (where the information flow is highlighted) and of the decisional systemographs (where the decisions are shown) allows, during the activity analysis, to evaluate it and to improve it.\n\nThese systemographs allow to observe and to eliminate redundancies and cycles that are (or not) important for the process, providing its systemic visualization, identifying points to allow its rationalization, increase of flexibility, and activation.\n\nThe systemography was studied and presented theoretically by Jean-Louis LeMoigne (1990; 1994) in his \"Théorie du Système Général\" (1994).

He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece. Many, most notably Aristotle, regarded him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, and he is otherwise historically recognized as the first individual in Western civilization known to have entertained and engaged in scientific philosophy.\n\nThales is recognized for breaking from the use of mythology to explain the world and the universe, and instead explaining natural objects and phenomena by theories and hypotheses, in a precursor to modern science. Almost all the other pre-Socratic philosophers followed him in explaining nature as deriving from a unity of everything based on the existence of a single ultimate substance, instead of using mythological explanations. Aristotle reported Thales' hypothesis that the originating principle of nature and the nature of matter was a single material substance: water.\n\nIn mathematics, Thales used geometry to calculate the heights of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is the first known individual to use deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' theorem. He is the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.\n\nThales was probably born in the city of Miletus around the mid-620s BC. The ancient writer Apollodorus of Athens writing during the 2nd century BC, thought Thales was born about the year 625 BC. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, described Thales as \"a Phoenician by remote descent\". The later historian Diogenes Laertius, in his third century AD \"Lives of the Philosophers\", references Herodotus, Duris, and Democritus, who all agree \"that Thales was the son of Examyas and Cleobulina, and belonged to the Thelidae who are Phoenicians.\" He then states that \"Most writers, however, represent him as a native of Miletus and of a distinguished family.\"\n\nThe dates of Thales' life are not exactly known, but are roughly established by a few datable events mentioned in the sources. According to Herodotus (and as determined by modern methods) Thales predicted the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BC. Diogenes Laërtius quotes the chronicle of Apollodorus of Athens as saying that Thales died at the age of 78 during the 58th Olympiad (548–545 BC) and attributes his death to heat stroke while watching the games. \n\nDiogenes Laërtius states that \"according to Herodotus and Douris and Democritus\", Thales' parents were Examyes and Cleobuline, whose names are indigenous Carian and Greek, respectively. Diogenes then delivers conflicting reports: one that Thales married and either fathered a son (Cybisthus or Cybisthon) or adopted his nephew of the same name; the second that he never married, telling his mother as a young man that it was too early to marry, and as an older man that it was too late. Plutarch had earlier told this version: Solon visited Thales and asked him why he remained single; Thales answered that he did not like the idea of having to worry about children. Nevertheless, several years later, anxious for family, he adopted his nephew Cybisthus.\n\nThales involved himself in many activities, taking the role of an innovator. Some say that he left no writings, others say that he wrote \"On the Solstice\" and \"On the Equinox\". (No writing attributed to him has survived.) Diogenes Laërtius quotes two letters from Thales: one to Pherecydes of Syros, offering to review his book on religion, and one to Solon, offering to keep him company on his sojourn from Athens. Thales identifies the Milesians as Athenian colonists.\n\nThales' principal occupation was engineering.\n\nHe was aware of the existence of the lodestone, and was the first to be connected to knowledge of this in history. According to Aristotle, Thales thought lodestones had souls, because iron is attracted to them (by the force of magnetism). According to Hieronymus, historically quoted by Diogenes Laertius, Thales found the height of pyramids by comparison between the lengths of the shadows cast by a person and by the pyramids.\n\nSeveral anecdotes suggest Thales was not just a philosopher, but also a businessman.\n\nA story, with different versions, recounts how Thales achieved riches from an olive harvest by prediction of the weather.\n\nIn one version, he bought all the in Miletus after predicting the weather and a good harvest for a particular year. Another version of the story has Aristotle explain that Thales had reserved presses in advance, at a discount, and could rent them out at a high price when demand peaked, following his prediction of a particularly good harvest. This first version of the story would constitute the first historically known creation and use of futures, whereas the second version would be the first historically known of creation and use of options.\n\nAristotle explains that Thales' objective in doing this was not to enrich himself but to prove to his fellow Milesians that philosophy could be useful, contrary to what they thought, or alternatively, Thales had made his foray into enterprise because of a personal challenge put to him by an individual who had asked why, if Thales was an intelligent famous philosopher, he had yet to attain wealth.\n\nThales’ political life had mainly to do with the involvement of the Ionians in the defense of Anatolia against the growing power of the Persians, who were then new to the region. In neighbouring Lydia, a king had come to power: Croesus, who was somewhat too aggressive for the size of his army. He had conquered most of the states of coastal Anatolia, including the cities of the Ionians. The story is told in Herodotus.\n\nThe Lydians were at war with the Medes, who were a remnant of the first wave of migration of ancient Iranian peoples, who had subsequently settled into the region, over the issue of refuge the Lydians had given to some Scythian soldiers of fortune inimical to the Medes. The war endured for five years, but in the sixth an eclipse of the Sun (mentioned above) spontaneously halted a battle in progress (the Battle of Halys).\n\nIt seems that Thales had predicted this solar eclipse. The Seven Sages were most likely already in existence, as Croesus was also heavily influenced by Solon of Athens, another sage. Whether Thales was present at the battle is not known, nor are the exact terms of the prediction, but based on it the Lydians and Medes made peace immediately, swearing a blood oath.\n\nThe Medes were dependencies of the Persians under Cyrus. Croesus now sided with the Medes against the Persians and marched in the direction of Iran (with far fewer men than he needed). He was stopped by the river Halys, then unbridged. This time he had Thales with him, perhaps by invitation. Whatever his status, the king gave the problem to him, and he got the army across by digging a diversion upstream so as to reduce the flow, making it possible to ford the river. The channels ran around both sides of the camp.\n\nThe two armies engaged at Pteria in Cappadocia. As the battle was indecisive but paralyzing to both sides, Croesus marched home, dismissed his mercenaries and sent emissaries to his dependents and allies to ask them to dispatch fresh troops to Sardis. The issue became more pressing when the Persian army showed up at Sardis. Diogenes Laërtius tells us that Thales gained fame as a counselor when he advised the Milesians not to engage in a symmachia, a \"fighting together\", with the Lydians. This has sometimes been interpreted as an alliance, but a ruler does not ally with his subjects.\n\nCroesus was defeated before the city of Sardis by Cyrus, who subsequently spared Miletus because it had taken no action. Cyrus was so impressed by Croesus’ wisdom and his connection with the sages that he spared him and took his advice on various matters.\n\nThe Ionians were now free. Herodotus says that Thales advised them to form an Ionian state; that is, a bouleuterion (\"deliberative body\") to be located at Teos in the center of Ionia. The Ionian cities should be demoi, or \"districts\". Miletus, however, received favorable terms from Cyrus. The others remained in an Ionian League of 12 cities (excluding Miletus now), and were subjugated by the Persians.\n\nWhile Herodotus reported that most of his fellow Greeks believe that Thales did divert the river Halys to assist King Croesus' military endeavors, he himself finds it doubtful.\n\nDiogenes Laërtius tells us that the Seven Sages were created in the archonship of Damasius at Athens about 582 BC and that Thales was the first sage. The same story, however, asserts that Thales emigrated to Miletus. There is also a report that he did not become a student of nature until after his political career. Much as we would like to have a date on the seven sages, we must reject these stories and the tempting date if we are to believe that Thales was a native of Miletus, predicted the eclipse, and was with Croesus in the campaign against Cyrus.\n\nThales received instruction from an Egyptian priest. It was fairly certain that he came from a wealthy, established family, in a class which customarily provided higher education for their children. Moreover, the ordinary citizen, unless he was a seafaring man or a merchant, could not afford the grand tour in Egypt, and did not consort with noble lawmakers such as Solon.\n\nIn Diogenes Laërtius' \"Lives of Eminent Philosophers\" Chapter 1.39, Laërtius relates the several stories of an expensive object that is to go to the most wise. In one version (that Laërtius credits to Callimachus in his \"Iambics\") Bathycles of Arcadia states in his will that an expensive bowl \"'should be given to him who had done most good by his wisdom.' So it was given to Thales, went the round of all the sages, and came back to Thales again. And he sent it to Apollo at Didyma, with this dedication...'Thales the Milesian, son of Examyas [dedicates this] to Delphinian Apollo after twice winning the prize from all the Greeks.'\"\n\nThales predicted the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BC. Thales also described the position of Ursa Minor, and thought the constellation might be useful as a guide for navigation at sea. He calculated the duration of the year and the timings of the equinoxes and solstices. He is additionally attributed with the first observation of the Hyades and with calculating the position of the Pleiades. Plutarch indicates that in his day (c. AD 100) there was an extant work, the \"Astronomy\", composed in verse and attributed to Thales.\n\nEarly Greeks, and other civilizations before them, often invoked idiosyncratic explanations of natural phenomena with reference to the will of anthropomorphic gods and heroes. Instead, Thales aimed to explain natural phenomena via rational hypotheses that referenced natural processes themselves. For example, rather than assuming that earthquakes were the result of supernatural whims Thales explained them by hypothesizing that the Earth floats on water and that earthquakes occur when the Earth is rocked by waves.\n\nThales was a hylozoist (one who thinks that matter is alive, i.e. containing soul(s)). Aristotle wrote (\"De Anima\" 411 a7-8) of Thales: ...\"Thales thought all things are full of gods\". Aristotle posits the origin of Thales thought on matter generally containing souls, to Thales thinking initially on the fact of, because magnets move iron, the presence of movement of matter indicated this matter contained life.\n\nThales, according to Aristotle, asked what was the nature (Greek \"arche\") of the object so that it would behave in its characteristic way. Physis () comes from phyein (), \"to grow\", related to our word \"be\". \"(G)natura\" is the way a thing is \"born\", again with the stamp of what it is in itself.\n\nAristotle characterizes most of the philosophers \"at first\" () as thinking that the \"principles in the form of matter were the only principles of all things\", where \"principle\" is arche, \"matter\" is hyle (\"wood\" or \"matter\", \"material\") and \"form\" is eidos.\n\n\"Arche\" is translated as \"principle\", but the two words do not have precisely the same meaning. A principle of something is merely prior (related to pro-) to it either chronologically or logically. An arche (from , \"to rule\") dominates an object in some way. If the arche is taken to be an origin, then specific causality is implied; that is, B is supposed to be characteristically B just because it comes from A, which dominates it.\n\nThe archai that Aristotle had in mind in his well-known passage on the first Greek scientists are not necessarily chronologically prior to their objects, but are constituents of it. For example, in pluralism objects are composed of earth, air, fire and water, but those elements do not disappear with the production of the object. They remain as archai within it, as do the atoms of the atomists.\n\nWhat Aristotle is really saying is that the first philosophers were trying to define the substance(s) of which all material objects are composed. As a matter of fact, that is exactly what modern scientists are attempting to accomplish in nuclear physics, which is a second reason why Thales is described as the first western scientist, but some contemporary scholars reject this interpretation.\n\nThales was known for his innovative use of geometry. His understanding was theoretical as well as practical. For example, he said:\n\nTopos is in Newtonian-style space, since the verb, chorei, has the connotation of yielding before things, or spreading out to make room for them, which is extension. Within this extension, things have a position. Points, lines, planes and solids related by distances and angles follow from this presumption.\n\nThales understood similar triangles and right triangles, and what is more, used that knowledge in practical ways. The story is told in DL (loc. cit.) that he measured the height of the pyramids by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height. A right triangle with two equal legs is a 45-degree right triangle, all of which are similar. The length of the pyramid's shadow measured from the center of the pyramid at that moment must have been equal to its height.\n\nThis story indicates that he was familiar with the Egyptian \"seked\", or \"seqed\", the ratio of the run to the rise of a slope (cotangent). The \"seked\" is at the base of problems 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60 of the Rhind papyrus — an ancient Egyptian mathematical document.\n\nIn present-day trigonometry, cotangents require the same units for run and rise (base and perpendicular), but the papyrus uses cubits for rise and palms for run, resulting in different (but still characteristic) numbers. Since there were 7 palms in a cubit, the \"seked\" was 7 times the cotangent.\n\nTo use an example often quoted in modern reference works, suppose the base of a pyramid is 140 cubits and the angle of rise 5.25 \"seked\". The Egyptians expressed their fractions as the sum of fractions, but the decimals are sufficient for the example. What is the rise in cubits? The run is 70 cubits, 490 palms. X, the rise, is 490 divided by 5.25 or 93 cubits. These figures sufficed for the Egyptians and Thales. We would go on to calculate the cotangent as 70 divided by 93 to get 3/4 or .75 and looking that up in a table of cotangents find that the angle of rise is a few minutes over 53 degrees.\n\nWhether the ability to use the \"seked\", which preceded Thales by about 1000 years, means that he was the first to define trigonometry is a matter of opinion. More practically Thales used the same method to measure the distances of ships at sea, said Eudemus as reported by Proclus (\"in Euclidem\"). According to Kirk & Raven (reference cited below), all you need for this feat is three straight sticks pinned at one end and knowledge of your altitude. One stick goes vertically into the ground. A second is made level. With the third you sight the ship and calculate the \"seked\" from the height of the stick and its distance from the point of insertion to the line of sight.\n\nThe \"seked\" is a measure of the angle. Knowledge of two angles (the \"seked\" and a right angle) and an enclosed leg (the altitude) allows you to determine by similar triangles the second leg, which is the distance.\n\nThere are two theorems of Thales in elementary geometry, one known as Thales' theorem having to do with a triangle inscribed in a circle and having the circle's diameter as one leg, the other theorem being also called the intercept theorem. In addition Eudemus attributed to him the discovery that a circle is bisected by its diameter, that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal and that vertical angles are equal. According to a historical Note, when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.\n\nThales' most famous philosophical position was his cosmological thesis, which comes down to us through a passage from Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\". In the work Aristotle unequivocally reported Thales’ hypothesis about the nature of all matter – that the originating principle of nature was a single material substance: water. Aristotle then proceeded to proffer a number of conjectures based on his own observations to lend some credence to why Thales may have advanced this idea (though Aristotle didn’t hold it himself).\n\nAristotle laid out his own thinking about matter and form which may shed some light on the ideas of Thales, in \"Metaphysics\" 983 b6 8–11, 17–21. (The passage contains words that were later adopted by science with quite different meanings.)\n\nIn this quote we see Aristotle's depiction of the problem of change and the definition of substance. He asked if an object changes, is it the same or different? In either case how can there be a change from one to the other? The answer is that the substance \"is saved\", but acquires or loses different qualities (, the things you \"experience\").\n\nAristotle conjectured that Thales reached his conclusion by contemplating that the \"nourishment of all things is moist and that even the hot is created from the wet and lives by it.\" While Aristotle's conjecture on why Thales held water as the originating principle of matter is his own thinking, his statement that Thales held it as water is generally accepted as genuinely originating with Thales and he is seen as an incipient matter-and-formist.\n\nThales thought the Earth must be a flat disk which is floating in an expanse of water.\n\nHeraclitus Homericus states that Thales drew his conclusion from seeing moist substance turn into air, slime and earth. It seems likely that Thales viewed the Earth as solidifying from the water on which it floated and the oceans that surround it.\n\nWriting centuries later, Diogenes Laërtius also states that Thales taught \"Water constituted (, 'stood under') the principle of all things.\"\n\nAristotle considered Thales’ position to be roughly the equivalent to the later ideas of Anaximenes, who held that everything was composed of air.\n\nThe 1870 book \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\" noted\nLater scholastic thinkers would maintain that in his choice of water Thales was influenced by Babylonian or Chaldean religion, that held that a god had begun creation by acting upon the pre-existing water. Historian Abraham Feldman holds this does not stand up under closer examination. In Babylonian religion the water is lifeless and sterile until a god acts upon it, but for Thales water itself was divine and creative. He maintained that \"All things are full of gods\", and to understand the nature of things was to discover the secrets of the deities, and through this knowledge open the possibility that one could be greater than the grandest Olympian.\n\nFeldman points out that while other thinkers recognized the wetness of the world \"none of them was inspired to conclude that everything was ultimately aquatic.\" He further points out that Thales was \"a wealthy citizen of the fabulously rich Oriental port of Miletus...a dealer in the staples of antiquity, wine and oil...He certainly handled the shell-fish of the Phoenicians that secreted the dye of imperial purple.\" Feldman recalls the stories of Thales measuring the distance of boats in the harbor, creating mechanical improvements for ship navigation, giving an explanation for the flooding of the Nile (vital to Egyptian agriculture and Greek trade), and changing the course of the river Halys so an army could ford it. Rather than seeing water as a barrier Thales contemplated the Ionian yearly religious gathering for athletic ritual (held on the promontory of Mycale and believed to be ordained by the ancestral kindred of Poseidon, the god of the sea). He called for the Ionian mercantile states participating in this ritual to convert it into a democratic federation under the protection of Poseidon that would hold off the forces of pastoral Persia. Feldman concludes that Thales saw \"that water was a revolutionary leveler and the elemental factor determining the subsistence and business of the world\" and \"the common channel of states.\"\n\nFeldman considers Thales' environment and holds that Thales would have seen tears, sweat, and blood as granting value to a person's work and the means how life giving commodities travelled (whether on bodies of water or through the sweat of slaves and pack-animals). He would have seen that minerals could be processed from water such as life-sustaining salt and gold taken from rivers. He would’ve seen fish and other food stuffs gathered from it. Feldman points out that Thales held that the lodestone was alive as it drew metals to itself. He holds that Thales \"living ever in sight of his beloved sea\" would see water seem to draw all \"traffic in wine and oil, milk and honey, juices and dyes\" to itself, leading him to \"a vision of the universe melting into a single substance that was valueless in itself and still the source of wealth.\" Feldman concludes that for Thales \"...water united all things. The social significance of water in the time of Thales induced him to discern through hardware and dry-goods, through soil and sperm, blood, sweat and tears, one fundamental fluid stuff...water, the most commonplace and powerful material known to him.\" This combined with his contemporary's idea of \"spontaneous generation\" allow us to see how Thales could hold that water could be divine and creative.\n\nFeldman points to the lasting association of the theory that \"all whatness is wetness\" with Thales himself, pointing out that Diogenes Laërtius speaks of a poem, probably a satire, where Thales is snatched to heaven by the sun, \"Perhaps it was an elaborate paronomasia based on the fact that \"thal\" was the Phoenician word for dew.\"\n\nThales applied his method to objects that changed to become other objects, such as water into earth (or so he thought). Thales also applied his method to the act of change itself, approaching it through lodestone and amber (which, when electrified by rubbing together, also attracts). As for the ability of a mover to move something else without being changed itself, Thales saw a commonality between that and the power of a living thing to act. The lodestone and the amber must be alive, and if that were so, there could be no difference between the living and the dead. When asked why he didn’t die if there was no difference, he replied \"because there is no difference.\"\n\nAristotle defined the soul as the principle of life, that which imbues the matter and makes it live, giving it the animation, or power to act. The idea did not originate with him, as the Greeks in general believed in the distinction between mind and matter, which was ultimately to lead to a distinction not only between body and soul but also between matter and energy. If things were alive, they must have souls. This belief was no innovation, as the ordinary ancient populations of the Mediterranean did believe that natural actions were caused by divinities. Accordingly, Aristotle and other ancient writers state that Thales believed that \"all things were full of gods.\" In their zeal to make him the first in everything some said he was the first to hold the belief, which must have been widely known to be false. However, Thales was looking for something more general, a universal substance of mind. That also was in the polytheism of the times. Zeus was the very personification of supreme mind, dominating all the subordinate manifestations. From Thales on, however, philosophers had a tendency to depersonify or objectify mind, as though it were the substance of animation per se and not actually a god like the other gods. The end result was a total removal of mind from substance, opening the door to a non-divine principle of action.\n\nClassical thought, however, had proceeded only a little way along that path. Instead of referring to the person, Zeus, they talked about the great mind:\n\nThe universal mind appears as a Roman belief in Virgil as well:\n\nAccording to Henry Fielding, Diogenes Laërtius (1.35) affirmed that Thales posed \"the independent pre-existence of God from all eternity, stating \"that God was the oldest of all beings, for he existed without a previous cause even in the way of generation; that the world was the most beautiful of all things; for it was created by God.\"\n\nThales (who died around 30 years before the time of Pythagoras and 300 years before Euclid, Eudoxus of Cnidus, and Eudemus of Rhodes) is often hailed as \"the first Greek mathematician\". While some historians, such as Colin R. Fletcher, point out that there could have been a predecessor to Thales who would've been named in Eudemus' lost book \"History of Geometry\" it is admitted that without the work \"the question becomes mere speculation.\" Fletcher holds that as there is no viable predecessor to the title of first Greek mathematician, the only question is whether Thales qualifies as a practitioner in that field; he holds that \"Thales had at his command the techniques of observation, experimentation, superposition and deduction…he has proved himself mathematician.\"\n\nThe evidence for the primacy of Thales comes to us from a book by Proclus who wrote a thousand years after Thales but is believed to have had a copy of Eudemus' book. Proclus wrote \"Thales was the first to go to Egypt and bring back to Greece this study.\" He goes on to tell us that in addition to applying the knowledge he gained in Egypt \"He himself discovered many propositions and disclosed the underlying principles of many others to his successors, in some case his method being more general, in others more empirical.\"\n\nOther quotes from Proclus list more of Thales' mathematical achievements:\n\nIn addition to Proclus, Hieronymus of Rhodes also cites Thales as the first Greek mathematician. Hieronymus held that Thales was able to measure the height of the pyramids by using a theorem of geometry now known as the intercept theorem, (after gathering data by using his walking-stick and comparing its shadow to those cast by the pyramids). We receive variations of Hieronymus' story through Diogenes Laërtius, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch.\n\nDue to the scarcity of sources concerning Thales and the diversity among the ones we possess, there is a scholarly debate over possible influences on Thales and the Greek mathematicians that came after him.\n\nHistorian Roger L. Cooke points out that Proclus does not make any mention of Mesopotamian influence on Thales or Greek geometry, but \"is shown clearly in Greek astronomy, in the use of sexagesimal system of measuring angles and in Ptolemy's explicit use of Mesopotamian astronomical observations.\" Cooke notes that it may possibly also appear in the second book of Euclid's \"Elements\", \"which contains geometric constructions equivalent to certain algebraic relations that are frequently encountered in the cuneiform tablets.\" Cooke notes \"This relation however, is controversial.\"\n\nHistorian B.L. Van der Waerden is among those advocating the idea of Mesopotamian influence, writing \"It follows that we have to abandon the traditional belief that the oldest Greek mathematicians discovered geometry entirely by themselves…a belief that was tenable only as long as nothing was known about Babylonian mathematics. This in no way diminishes the stature of Thales; on the contrary, his genius receives only now the honour that is due to it, the honour of having developed a logical structure for geometry, of having introduced proof into geometry.\"\n\nSome historians, such as D. R. Dicks takes issue with the idea that we can determine from the questionable sources we have, just how influenced Thales was by Babylonian sources. He points out that while Thales is held to have been able to calculate an eclipse using a cycle called the \"Saros\" held to have been \"borrowed from the Babylonians\", \"The Babylonians, however, did not use cycles to predict solar eclipses, but computed them from observations of the latitude of the moon made shortly before the expected syzygy.\" Dicks cites historian O. Neugebauer who relates that \"No Babylonian theory for predicting solar eclipse existed at 600 B.C., as one can see from the very unsatisfactory situation 400 years later; nor did the Babylonians ever develop any theory which took the influence of geographical latitude into account.\" Dicks examines the cycle referred to as 'Saros' - which Thales is held to have used and which is believed to stem from the Babylonians. He points out that Ptolemy makes use of this and another cycle in his book \"Mathematical Syntaxis\" but attributes it to Greek astronomers earlier than Hipparchus and not to Babylonians. Dicks notes Herodotus does relate that Thales made use of a cycle to predict the eclipse, but maintains that \"if so, the fulfillment of the 'prediction' was a stroke of pure luck not science\". He goes further joining with other historians (F. Martini, J.L. E. Dreyer, O. Neugebauer) in rejecting the historicity of the eclipse story altogether. Dicks links the story of Thales discovering the cause for a solar eclipse with Herodotus' claim that Thales discovered the cycle of the sun with relation to the solstices, and concludes \"he could not possibly have possessed this knowledge which neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians nor his immediate successors possessed.\" Josephus is the only ancient historian that claims Thales visited Babylonia.\n\nHerodotus wrote that the Greeks learnt the practice of dividing the day into 12 parts, about the \"polos\", and the gnomon from the Babylonians. (The exact meaning of his use of the word \"polos\" is unknown, current theories include: \"the heavenly dome\", \"the tip of the axis of the celestial sphere\", or a spherical concave sundial.) Yet even Herodotus' claims on Babylonian influence are contested by some modern historians, such as L. Zhmud, who points out that the division of the day into twelve parts (and by analogy the year) was known to the Egyptians already in the second millennium, the gnomon was known to both Egyptians and Babylonians, and the idea of the \"heavenly sphere\" was not used outside of Greece at this time.\n\nLess controversial than the position that Thales learnt Babylonian mathematics is the claim he was influenced by Egyptians. Pointedly historian S. N. Bychkov holds that the idea that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal likely came from Egypt. This is because, when building a roof for a home - having a cross section be exactly an isosceles triangle isn't crucial (as it's the ridge of the roof that must fit precisely), in contrast a symmetric square pyramid cannot have errors in the base angles of the faces or they will not fit together tightly.\nHistorian D.R. Dicks agrees that compared to the Greeks in the era of Thales, there was a more advanced state of mathematics among the Babylonians and especially the Egyptians - \"both cultures knew the correct formulae for determining the areas and volumes of simple geometrical figures such as triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, etc.; the Egyptians could also calculate correctly the volume of the frustum of a pyramid with a square base (the Babylonians used an incorrect formula for this), and used a formula for the area of a circle...which gives a value for π of 3.1605--a good approximation.\" Dicks also agrees that this would have had an effect on Thales (whom the most ancient sources agree was interested in mathematics and astronomy) but he holds that tales of Thales' travels in these lands are pure myth.\n\nThe ancient civilization and massive monuments of Egypt had \"a profound and ineradicable impression on the Greeks\". They attributed to Egyptians \"an immemorial knowledge of certain subjects\" (including geometry) and would claim Egyptian origin for some of their own ideas to try and lend them \"a respectable antiquity\" (such as the \"Hermetic\" literature of the Alexandrian period).\n\nDicks holds that since Thales was a prominent figure in Greek history by the time of Eudemus but \"nothing certain was known except that he lived in Miletus\". A tradition developed that as \"Milesians were in a position to be able to travel widely\" Thales must have gone to Egypt. As Herodotus says Egypt was the birthplace of geometry he must have learnt that while there. Since he had to have been there, surely one of the theories on Nile Flooding laid out by Herodotus must have come from Thales. Likewise as he must have been in Egypt he had to have done something with the Pyramids - thus the tale of measuring them. Similar apocryphal stories exist of Pythagoras and Plato traveling to Egypt with no corroborating evidence.\n\nAs the Egyptian and Babylonian geometry at the time was \"essentially arithmetical\", they used actual numbers and \"the procedure is then described with explicit instructions as to what to do with these numbers\" there was no mention of how the rules of procedure were made, and nothing toward a logically arranged corpus of generalized geometrical knowledge with analytical 'proofs' such as we find in the words of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius.\" So even had Thales traveled there he could not have learnt anything about the theorems he is held to have picked up there (especially because there is no evidence that any Greeks of this age could use Egyptian hieroglyphics).\n\nLikewise until around the second century BC and the time of Hipparchus (c. 194-120 BC) the Babylonian general division of the circle into 360 degrees and their sexagesimal system was unknown. Herodotus says almost nothing about Babylonian literature and science, and very little about their history. Some historians, like P. Schnabel, hold that the Greeks only learned more about Babylonian culture from Berossus, a Babylonian priest who is said to have set up a school in Cos around 270 BC (but to what extent this had in the field of geometry is contested).\n\nDicks points out that the primitive state of Greek mathematics and astronomical ideas exhibited by the peculiar notions of Thales' successors (such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus), which historian J. L. Heiberg calls \"a mixture of brilliant intuition and childlike analogies\", argues against the assertions from writers in late antiquity that Thales discovered and taught advanced concepts in these fields.\n\nJohn Burnet (1892) noted\nIn the long sojourn of philosophy, there has existed hardly a philosopher or historian of philosophy who did not mention Thales and try to characterize him in some way. He is generally recognized as having brought something new to human thought. Mathematics, astronomy, and medicine already existed. Thales added something to these different collections of knowledge to produce a universality, which, as far as writing tells us, was not in tradition before, but resulted in a new field.\n\nEver since, interested persons have been asking what that new something is. Answers fall into (at least) two categories, the theory and the method. Once an answer has been arrived at, the next logical step is to ask how Thales compares to other philosophers, which leads to his classification (rightly or wrongly).\n\nThe most natural epithets of Thales are \"materialist\" and \"naturalist\", which are based on ousia and physis. The Catholic Encyclopedia notes that Aristotle called him a physiologist, with the meaning \"student of nature.\" On the other hand, he would have qualified as an early physicist, as did Aristotle. They studied corpora, \"bodies\", the medieval descendants of substances.\n\nMost agree that Thales' stamp on thought is the unity of substance, hence Bertrand Russell:\n\nRussell was only reflecting an established tradition; for example: Nietzsche, in his \"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\", wrote:\n\nThis sort of materialism, however, should not be confused with deterministic materialism. Thales was only trying to explain the unity observed in the free play of the qualities. The arrival of uncertainty in the modern world made possible a return to Thales; for example, John Elof Boodin writes (\"God and Creation\"):\n\nBoodin defines an \"emergent\" materialism, in which the objects of sense emerge uncertainly from the substrate. Thales is the innovator of this sort of materialism.\n\nIn the West, Thales represents a new kind of inquiring community as well. Edmund Husserl attempts to capture the new movement as follows. Philosophical man is a \"new cultural configuration\" based in stepping back from \"pregiven tradition\" and taking up a rational \"inquiry into what is true in itself;\" that is, an ideal of truth. It begins with isolated individuals such as Thales, but they are supported and cooperated with as time goes on. Finally the ideal transforms the norms of society, leaping across national borders.\n\nThe term \"Pre-Socratic\" derives ultimately from the philosopher Aristotle, who distinguished the early philosophers as concerning themselves with substance.\n\nDiogenes Laërtius on the other hand took a strictly geographic and ethnic approach. Philosophers were either Ionian or Italian. He used \"Ionian\" in a broader sense, including also the Athenian academics, who were not Pre-Socratics. From a philosophic point of view, any grouping at all would have been just as effective. There is no basis for an Ionian or Italian unity. Some scholars, however, concede to Diogenes' scheme as far as referring to an \"Ionian\" school. There was no such school in any sense.\n\nThe most popular approach refers to a Milesian school, which is more justifiable socially and philosophically. They sought for the substance of phenomena and may have studied with each other. Some ancient writers qualify them as Milesioi, \"of Miletus.\"\n\nThales had a profound influence on other Greek thinkers and therefore on Western history. Some believe Anaximander was a pupil of Thales. Early sources report that one of Anaximander's more famous pupils, Pythagoras, visited Thales as a young man, and that Thales advised him to travel to Egypt to further his philosophical and mathematical studies.\n\nMany philosophers followed Thales' lead in searching for explanations in nature rather than in the supernatural; others returned to supernatural explanations, but couched them in the language of philosophy rather than of myth or of religion.\n\nLooking specifically at Thales' influence during the pre-Socratic era, it is clear that he stood out as one of the first thinkers who thought more in the way of \"logos\" than \"mythos\". The difference between these two more profound ways of seeing the world is that \"mythos\" is concentrated around the stories of holy origin, while \"logos\" is concentrated around the argumentation. When the mythical man wants to explain the world the way he sees it, he explains it based on gods and powers. Mythical thought does not differentiate between things and persons and furthermore it does not differentiate between nature and culture. The way a \"logos\" thinker would present a world view is radically different from the way of the mythical thinker. In its concrete form, \"logos\" is a way of thinking not only about individualism, but also the abstract. Furthermore, it focuses on sensible and continuous argumentation. This lays the foundation of philosophy and its way of explaining the world in terms of abstract argumentation, and not in the way of gods and mythical stories.\n\nBecause of Thales' elevated status in Greek culture an intense interest and admiration followed his reputation. Due to this following, the oral stories about his life were open to amplification and historical fabrication, even before they were written down generations later. Most modern dissension comes from trying to interpret what we know, in particular, distinguishing legend from fact.\n\nHistorian D.R. Dicks and other historians divide the ancient sources about Thales into those before 320 BC and those after that year (some such as Proclus writing in the 5th century C.E. and Simplicius of Cilicia in the 6th century C.E. writing nearly a millennium after his era). The first category includes Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Aristophanes, and Theophrastus among others. The second category includes Plautus, Aetius, Eusebius, Plutarch, Josephus, Iamblichus, Diogenes Laërtius, Theon of Smyrna, Apuleius, Clement of Alexandria, Pliny the Elder, and John Tzetzes among others.\n\nThe earliest sources on Thales (living before 320 BC) are often the same for the other Milesian philosophers (Anaximander, and Anaximenes). These sources were either roughly contemporaneous (such as Herodotus) or lived within a few hundred years of his passing. Moreover, they were writing from an oral tradition that was widespread and well known in the Greece of their day.\n\nThe latter sources on Thales are several \"ascriptions of commentators and compilers who lived anything from 700 to 1,000 years after his death\" which include \"anecdotes of varying degrees of plausibility\" and in the opinion of some historians (such as D. R. Dicks) of \"no historical worth whatsoever\". Dicks points out that there is no agreement \"among the 'authorities' even on the most fundamental facts of his life--e.g. whether he was a Milesian or a Phoenician, whether he left any writings or not, whether he was married or single-much less on the actual ideas and achievements with which he is credited.\"\n\nContrasting the work of the more ancient writers with those of the later, Dicks points out that in the works of the early writers Thales and the other men who would be hailed as \"the Seven Sages of Greece\" had a different reputation than that which would be assigned to them by later authors. Closer to their own era, Thales, Solon, Bias of Priene, Pittacus of Mytilene and others were hailed as \"essentially practical men who played leading roles in the affairs of their respective states, and were far better known to the earlier Greeks as lawgivers and statesmen than as profound thinkers and philosophers.\" For example, Plato praises him (coupled with Anacharsis) for being the originator of the potter's wheel and the anchor.\n\nOnly in the writings of the second group of writers (working after 320 BC) do \"we obtain the picture of Thales as the pioneer in Greek scientific thinking, particularly in regard to mathematics and astronomy which he is supposed to have learnt about in Babylonia and Egypt.\" Rather than \"the earlier tradition [where] he is a favourite example of the intelligent man who possesses some technical 'know how'...the later doxographers [such as Dicaearchus in the latter half of the fourth century BC] foist on to him any number of discoveries and achievements, in order to build him up as a figure of superhuman wisdom.\"\n\nDicks points out a further problem arises in the surviving information on Thales, for rather than using ancient sources closer to the era of Thales, the authors in later antiquity (\"epitomators, excerptors, and compilers\") actually \"preferred to use one or more intermediaries, so that what we actually read in them comes to us not even at second, but at third or fourth or fifth hand. ...Obviously this use of intermediate sources, copied and recopied from century to century, with each writer adding additional pieces of information of greater or less plausibility from his own knowledge, provided a fertile field for errors in transmission, wrong ascriptions, and fictitious attributions\". Dicks points out that \"certain doctrines that later commentators invented for Thales...were then accepted into the biographical tradition\" being copied by subsequent writers who were then cited by those coming after them \"and thus, because they may be repeated by different authors relying on different sources, may produce an illusory impression of genuineness.\"\n\nDoubts even exist when considering the philosophical positions held to originate in Thales \"in reality these stem directly from Aristotle's own interpretations which then became incorporated in the doxographical tradition as erroneous ascriptions to Thales\". (The same treatment was given by Aristotle to Anaxagoras.)\n\nMost philosophic analyses of the philosophy of Thales come from Aristotle, a professional philosopher, tutor of Alexander the Great, who wrote 200 years after Thales' death. Aristotle, judging from his surviving books, does not seem to have access to any works by Thales, although he probably had access to works of other authors about Thales, such as Herodotus, Hecataeus, Plato etc., as well as others whose work is now extinct. It was Aristotle's express goal to present Thales' work not because it was significant in itself, but as a prelude to his own work in natural philosophy. Geoffrey Kirk and John Raven, English compilers of the fragments of the Pre-Socratics, assert that Aristotle's \"judgments are often distorted by his view of earlier philosophy as a stumbling progress toward the truth that Aristotle himself revealed in his physical doctrines.\" There was also an extensive oral tradition. Both the oral and the written were commonly read or known by all educated men in the region.\n\nAristotle's philosophy had a distinct stamp: it professed the theory of matter and form, which modern scholastics have dubbed hylomorphism. Though once very widespread, it was not generally adopted by rationalist and modern science, as it mainly is useful in metaphysical analyses, but does not lend itself to the detail that is of interest to modern science. It is not clear that the theory of matter and form existed as early as Thales, and if it did, whether Thales espoused it.\n\nWhile some historians, like B. Snell, maintain that Aristotle was relying on a pre-Platonic written record by Hippias rather than oral tradition, this is a controversial position. Representing the scholarly consensus Dicks states that \"the tradition about him even as early as the fifth century B.C., was evidently based entirely on hearsay...It would seem that already by Aristotle's time the early Ionians were largely names only to which popular tradition attached various ideas or achievements with greater or less plausibility\". He points out that works confirmed to have existed in the sixth century BC by Anaximander and Xenophanes had already disappeared by the fourth century BC, so the chances of Pre-Socratic material surviving to the age of Aristotle is almost nil (even less likely for Aristotle's pupils Theophrastus and Eudemus and less likely still for those following after them).\n\nThe main secondary source concerning the details of Thales' life and career is Diogenes Laërtius, \"Lives of Eminent Philosophers\". This is primarily a biographical work, as the name indicates. Compared to Aristotle, Diogenes is not much of a philosopher. He is the one who, in the Prologue to that work, is responsible for the division of the early philosophers into \"Ionian\" and \"Italian\", but he places the Academics in the Ionian school and otherwise evidences considerable disarray and contradiction, especially in the long section on forerunners of the \"Ionian School\". Diogenes quotes two letters attributed to Thales, but Diogenes wrote some eight centuries after Thales' death and that his sources often contained \"unreliable or even fabricated information\", hence the concern for separating fact from legend in accounts of Thales.\n\nIt is due to this use of hearsay and a lack of citing original sources that leads some historians, like Dicks and Werner Jaeger, to look at the late origin of the traditional picture of Pre-Socratic philosophy and view the whole idea as a construct from a later age, \"the whole picture that has come down to us of the history of early philosophy was fashioned during the two or three generations from Plato to the immediate pupils of Aristotle\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bruce Caldwell has questioned how far Bartley was the editor and how far the author.\n\nThe title of the book is a reference to a passage from Adam Smith, in his \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" (1759).\n\nIn the book, Hayek aims to refute socialism by demonstrating that socialist theories are not only logically incorrect but that their premises are also incorrect. According to Hayek, civilizations grew because societal traditions placed importance on private property, leading to expansion, trade, and eventually the modern capitalist system, which he calls the extended order. Hayek says this demonstrates a key flaw within socialist thought, which holds only purposefully designed changes can be the most efficient. Also, he says statist (e.g., \"socialist\") economies cannot be efficient because dispersed knowledge is required in a modern economy. Additionally, Hayek asserts that since modern civilization, and all of its customs and traditions, naturally led to the current order and are needed for its continuance, fundamental changes to the system that try to control it are doomed to fail since they are impossible or unsustainable in modern civilization. Price signals are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate tacit knowledge or dispersed knowledge with each other to solve the economic calculation problem.\n\nThere is scholarly debate on the extent of William Warren Bartley's influence on the work. Officially, Bartley was the editor who prepared the book for publication once Hayek fell ill in 1985. However, the inclusion of material from Bartley's philosophical point of view and citations that other people provided to Bartley have led to questions about how much of the book was written by Hayek and whether Hayek knew about the added material. Bruce Caldwell thinks the evidence \"clearly points towards a conclusion that the book was a product more of [Bartley's] pen than of Hayek's. ... Bartley may have written the book\".\n\n"}

It can be used as a source for identifying significant figures and places in ancient Japan. \"Utamakura\" enables poets to express ideas and themes concisely — thus allowing them to stay in the confines of strict waka structures.\n\nSome scholars see the use of geographical allusion as the evidence for a restricted scope of poetry writing. Although the poets' \"true\" meaning was true because the essence was initially pre-established, the poems were written within fixed topics (\"dai\"). The poet could inhabit a subjective position or persona and write about the topic but not necessarily about his/her personal feelings. \"Utamakura\" could have suppressed poets' individuality or creativity.\n\nThe history of \"utamakura\" is found in documents on the study of poetry such as the \"Utamakura of Noin\", by the poet and monk of the late Heian period, and lists of places in the \"Utamakura Nayose\" (Utamakura reference book).\n\n\"Utamakura\" were first used by traveling priests. They collected stories from the towns they traveled to. Since they saw many places, it was easier to remember the details of a story by using a single, consistent reference point for each recurring event in their tales. Over time, the people across the Japan came to identify \"utamakura\" place names by the psychological feelings associated with the references made by the wandering priests.\n\nAfter \"utamakura\" place names and people had become well established, eager waka poets went sightseeing to the sites of \"utamakura\". Beyond becoming familiar with the scenery of the poems, entering the locale of a poem or story deepened one's understanding of it.\n\n\"Utamakura\" was also used in \"renga\", a form of Japanese collaborative poetry that is the ancestor of \"renku\" and \"haiku\" poetry.\n\nThere are numerous instances of \"utamakura\" in Japanese literature, one of which is the \"Kokinshū\". The source of this particular \"utamakura\" example is poem #3 in the \"Spring\" section.\nIn the poem above, \"Yoshino\" refers to a place in the Yamato region in the vicinity of the capital. \"Yoshino\" is known for having both heavy snowfall and an abundance of cherry blossoms.\n\nPoem #1 in \"Spring 1\" of \"Shin Kokin Wakashū\" also uses \"Yoshino\" for depicting the beginning of spring.\nAnother instance of poetic place name comes from \"Tales of Ise\", a piece titled \"In the Provinces\" (#15).\n\"Mount Shinobu\" is a pun on the verb \"shinobu,\" meaning \"to conceal,\" \"endure,\" \"long for,\" and \"remember.\"\n\nIn Japan there are many examples of \"utamakura\" in everyday readings. Often, menu items will be named after their visual appearance with a reference to a well-known Japanese scenic area.\n\nFor example, the Tatsuta River is famous for its red autumn maples. Therefore, a menu that includes tatsuta age will have crispy fish or chicken that was marinated in soy sauce before it was dredged in cornstarch and deep fried. The cornstarch coating absorbs some of the soy, so that when it is fried it takes on a burnished, russet color.\n\n\"Utamakura\" can be described as \"descriptive epithets\" or \"circumlocutions designating geographical sites\" in poetry of other languages that conjure a memory, thought, image or association with the place referred to.\n\nIn Dante's \"Inferno\" (Canto VII, line 106) there is a poetic place name in reference to the river Styx.\n\n<poem>\nA lake is form'd, (the Stygian named of old)\n  By this sad stream, when downward it hath run\n  Neath the grey rocks that hem the baleful hold.\n</poem>\n\nThe adjective Stygian means \"of or relating to the River Styx\". In Ancient Greek literature, the River Styx forms the boundary between Earth and Hades, the Underworld.\n\nIn contemporary Western cultures, parallels to the Japanese \"utamakura\" can be found in many popular songs. Musicians use place names in their lyrics to invoke certain conformed thoughts.\n\nCalifornia is a common reference for artists in that it invokes thoughts of excess, splendor, wealth, and a sense of fakeness in body and spirit. Weezer references the excessiveness of Beverly Hills in their hit song \"Beverly Hills\", while the Red Hot Chili Peppers refer to the sense of things not being \"real\" in their song \"Californication\" by including lyrics about plastic surgery and the use of Hollywood sets in government conspiracy.\n\n"}
{"id": "15286852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15286852", "title": "Wenzi", "text": "Wenzi\n\nThe Wenzi () is a Daoist classic allegedly written by a disciple of Laozi. The text was widely read and highly revered in the centuries following its creation, and even canonized as Tongxuan zhenjing () in the year 742 CE. However, soon afterwards scholars started questioning its authenticity and dismissing it as a forgery that was created between the Han dynasty and the Tang dynasty. The text's fate changed in 1973, when archeologists excavated a 55 BCE tomb and discovered remnants of a \"Wenzi\" copied on bamboo strips, which offer us a glimpse of what the text looked like prior to its drastic revision into the textus receptus.\n\nThe title \"Wenzi\" 文子 \"Master Wen\", suffixed with \"-zi\" \"child; person; master (title of respect)\", is analogous with other Hundred Schools of Thought texts like \"Mozi\", \"Zhuangzi\", Guiguzi, and Baopuzi. Wen \"written character; literature; refinement; culture\" is an infrequent Chinese surname, and hence Wenzi is interpretable as \"Master Wen.\" Wen is also frequently used in given names, posthumous names, et cetera, due to its positive connotations. For example, King Wen of Zhou 周文王 or Kong Wenzi 孔文子 (\"Analects\" 5.15, tr. Ames and Rosemont 1998:98-99). Hence, Wenzi is also interpretable as a \"nom de plume\" denoting \"Master of Literature/Culture.\" Nothing can be said for certain about Wenzi, no matter how this name is interpreted. Although we do not know his true identity, various hypotheses have been proposed.\n\nThe bibliographical section of the 1st century CE \"Book of Han\" says Wenzi was a student of Laozi, a contemporary of Confucius 孔子 (551-479 BCE), and an adviser to King Ping of Zhou 周平王 (r. 770-720 BCE). This cannot be true, as King Ping and Confucius lived two centuries apart, and it fueled suspicion of the text's forged status in later centuries. To solve the chronological inconsistency, some commentators suggest a mistake for King Ping of Chu 楚平王 (r. 528-516 BCE), whose reign does coincide with Confucius' lifetime.\n\nThe early \"Wenzi\" commentary by Li Xian 李暹 (fl. 516 CE) records that Wenzi's surname was Xin 辛 and his sobriquet (\"hao\" ) was Jiran 計然, he served under Fan Li 范蠡 (fl. 517 BCE), and studied with Laozi.\n\nThe later \"Wenzi\" commentary by Du Daojian (1237-1318) furthermore notes Wenzi was a nobleman from the Spring and Autumn period state of Jin, his surname was Xin 辛 and courtesy name (\"zi\" ) was Xing 銒. He was also called Song Xing 宋銒 referring to his home of Kuiqiu 葵丘, which was in Song (state).\n\nWritten references to the \"Wenzi\" first appear in the Han Dynasty. The no longer extant 1st century BCE \"Qilue\" 七略 \"Seven Summaries\" by Liu Xiang and Liu Xin said the \"Wenzi\" had 9 \"pian\" 篇 \"chapters\". The bibliographical section of the 1st century CE \"Book of Han\" records the \"Wenzi\" text in 9 \"juan\" 卷 \"rolls; volumes\", says Wenzi was a student of Laozi, a contemporary of Confucius (551-479 BCE), and adviser to King Ping of Zhou (r. 770-720 BCE), but adds \"the work appears to be a forgery\" (tr. Sakade 2007:1041), presumably because King Ping and Confucius lived two centuries apart.\n\nIn his ca. 523 CE \"Qilu\" 七录錄 \"Seven Records\", the Liang Dynasty scholar Ruan Xiaoxu 阮孝绪 records the \"Wenzi\" text in 10 volumes. Bibliographies in the 636 CE Book of Sui and the 945 CE New Book of Tang both record 12 volumes.\n\nIn 742 CE, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang canonized the \"Wenzi\" as a Daoist scripture (along with the \"Daode jing\", \"Zhuangzi\", and \"Liezi\") honorifically called the \"Tongxuan zhenjing\" 通玄真經 \"True Scripture of Understanding the Mysteries\". The emperor posthumously styled Wenzi as the Tongxuan Zhenren 通玄真人 \"True Man Who Understands the Mysteries\".\n\nThe Daozang \"Daoist Canon\" includes three \"Wenzi\" redactions under the \"Yujue\" 玉訣 \"Commentaries\" subsection of the \"Dongshen\" 洞神 \"Spirit Grotto\" section. The oldest extant edition is the \"Tongxuan zhenjing zhu\" 通玄真經注 \"Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of Pervading Mystery\" by Xu Lingfu 徐灵府 (ca. 760-841) of the Tang Dynasty. The \"Tongxuan zhenjing zhengyi zhu\" 通玄真經正儀注 \"Commentary on the Correct Meaning of the Authentic Scripture of Pervading Mystery\" is by Zhu Bian (ca. 1085-1144) of the Song Dynasty. Third is the 1310 CE \"Tongxuan zhenjing zuanyi\" 通玄真經纘義 \"Collected Explanations to the Authentic Scripture of Pervading Mystery\" by Du Daojian 杜道坚 (1237–1318) of the Yuan Dynasty. Judith M. Boltz (1987:219) cites the opinion of Siku Quanshu bibliographers that Du's version was the most reliable \"Wenzi\" redaction. She notes that Du Daojian became the rightful literary heir to Wenzi when he discovered a copy of the classic at the Tongxuan Guan 通玄觀 \"Abbey of Pervading Mystery\" of Mount Jizhou 計籌 in Zhejiang, where hagiographic legend says Wenzi took refuge and wrote down his teachings.\n\nAlthough the \"Wenzi\" has traditionally been considered a Daoist text illustrating Laozi's thinking, it contains elements from Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, and School of Names. The textual format records Laozi answering Wenzi's questions about \"Daode jing\" concepts like \"Wu wei\". Besides citing passages from Daoist classics like \"Zhuangzi\" and \"Huainanzi\", the \"Wenzi\" also cites others like the \"Yijing\", \"Mengzi\", \"Lüshi Chunqiu\", and \"Xiao Jing\". Regarding the received \"Wenzi\" text, Yoshinobu Sakade concludes:\nWhile these references make the \"Wenzi\" appear as a source of ancient thought, in the form we know it today it is a forgery, with about eighty percent of the text quoted from the \"Huainan zi\", and the rest consisting of an amplification of the \"Daode jing\" or quotations from other texts. The present version contains expression similar to those found in the Taoist scriptures … These elements suffice to show that the extant \"Wenzi\" was written between the third and eight centuries, before the time of Xu Lingfu. (2007:1042) \n\nIn 1973, Chinese archeologists excavated a Han Dynasty tomb near Dingzhou 定州 (or Dingxian 定縣) in Hebei. Its occupant is identified as King Huai 懷王 of Zhongshan, who died in 55 BCE. Tomb furnishings included a precious Jade burial suit, jade ornaments, writing tools, and remnants of eight Chinese classic texts, including the \"Wenzi\" and Confucian \"Analects\" copied on hundreds of bamboo slips (\"jian\" ). These bamboo manuscripts were fragmented, disordered, and blackened by fire, perhaps accidentally caused by tomb robbers.\n\nThe specialized project of deciphering and transcribing this ancient \"Wenzi\" copy was delayed owing to a 1976 earthquake at Tangshan that further damaged the Dingzhou bamboo slips. The team published their first report in 1981 and their \"Wenzi\" transcription in 1995 (both in the archeological journal \"Wenwu\" 文物 \"Cultural Relics\").\n\nOngoing sinological studies of the so-called Dingzhou \"Wenzi\" (Le Blanc 2000, Ho 2002, van Els 2018) are providing both specific details of the presumed urtext edition and general insights in the early history of Daoist texts. Portions of the Dingzhou \"Wenzi\" are basically consistent with certain section in chapter 5 of the received text. Consensus is building that this excavated \"Wenzi\" dates from the 2nd century BCE, while the transmitted text was created after the 2nd century CE (van Els 2018:43-47, 129).\n\nThe question-and-answer format is a significant difference between the bamboo and received \"Wenzi\" versions. Ames and Rosemont explain:\nConsistent with the court bibliography in the \"History of the Han\", the Dingzhou \"Wenzi\" has Wenzi as teacher who is being asked questions by a King Ping of the Zhou 周平王. The received text, on the other hand, has the teacher Laozi 老子 being asked questions by the student Wenzi, certainly less appropriate given that texts are usually named for the teacher rather than the student. (1998:273-4)\n\nCompared with the numerous English translations of familiar Daoist texts like the \"Daode jing\" and \"Zhuangzi\", the presumably apocryphal \"Wenzi\" has been disregarded. Thomas Cleary (1991) wrote a popularized translation of the transmitted \"Wenzi\", which he attributes to Laozi.\n\nThere is no authoritative English \"Wenzi\" translation based on the groundbreaking Dingzhou readings, nothing comparable with the \"Analects\" translation by Ames and Rosemont (1998). English translations of select Dingzhou \"Wenzi\" bamboo strips can be found in the monograph by Paul van Els (2018).\n\n\n"}

On June 10, 2004, Pope John Paul II announced the dedication of an entire year to the Blessed Sacrament and invited the entire Church to reflect upon the Eucharist.\n\nPope John Paul II stated that the idea came from scheduled events to take place in the following liturgical year. The International Eucharistic Congress was scheduled for October 10, 2004 to October 17, 2004, and would mark the opening of \"Year of the Eucharist\". The year would close with the \"Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops\", held from October 2, 2005 to October 29, 2005.\n\nHe stated that the World Youth Day 2005 was another consideration in his decision of the dedication. He said, \"I would like the young people to gather around the Eucharist as the vital source which nourishes their faith and enthusiasm.\" \n\nSpecifically how the year was to be celebrated was left to the particular Churches. However, Pope John Paul II offered some basic guidelines. Suggestions were also presented by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. In the United States, many dioceses encouraged local parishes to conduct celebrations, to examine the place of the Eucharist in parish life, to encourage Eucharistic adoration separate from the Mass, and to evaluate how Eucharistic adoration is conducted locally. Many Bishops took the time to encourage their local parishes to institute 40-hour devotions.\n\nPope John Paul II made several suggestions to the Church in order to help the faithful benefit from the \"Year of the Eucharist\". He called on Catholics to understand the Eucharist as \"an urgent summons to testimony and evangelization,\" providing the necessary strength to carry out the \"charge\" given at the end of each Mass to spread the Gospel. John Paul II also asked for a commitment to a \"culture of the Eucharist,\" i.e. a commitment to providing witness to God's \"real\" presence in the world.\n\nAnother reflection offered by Pope John Paul II is that of the meaning of the word \"Eucharist\": Thanksgiving. John Paul II said, \"In Jesus, in his sacrifice, in his unconditional 'yes' to the will of the Father, is contained the 'yes', the 'thank you' and the 'amen' of all humanity.\" He asked for a commitment to giving thanks to God, which he called a \"'Eucharistic' attitude.\"\n\nAmong the many reflections published in honor of the year, Archbishop Alfred C. Hughes' of the Archdiocese of New Orleans wrote, \"On this side of heaven, one cannot experience a more substantial or intense communion with Christ's presence than in the Eucharist.\"\nThis year also saw the death of Pope John Paul II on April 2, 2005 (the one who established the year itself), and the subsequent election of Pope Benedict XVI on April 19, 2005.\n\nThere was an Eucharistic Congress in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., on September 25, 2004, the homily was given by Cardinal Francis Arinze, prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship. The closing Mass was attended by 3,000 Catholics.\n\n"}
