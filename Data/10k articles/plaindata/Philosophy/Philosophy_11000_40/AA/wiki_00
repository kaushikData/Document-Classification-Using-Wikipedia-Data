The \"made up\" crimes were in fact entirely the creation of ATF, and as described by two federal judges, carried severe sentences (typically 15 years) but were likely to cause grave unfairness and miscarriage of justice.\n\nA \"USA Today\" investigation in 2013 showed that over 1000 individuals have been incarcerated for lengthy periods since 2011 for such \"fake\" crimes, and that the strategy has become a \"key part\" of the Bureau's strategy. ATF officials stated that the strategy pre-emptively targeted people likely to commit serious crime rather than waiting for them to do so; opponents and critics, and later, judges, expressed concerns that it was tantamount to entrapment and punishing people for thoughts and possibilities rather than actual criminal acts, by presenting them with deliberately hard to resist fabricated inducements and goading them to become a participant, or to engage in more extreme criminal activities, up to an extent chosen almost completely by ATF.\n\nIn 2013 Illinois Chief Federal Judge Ruben Castillo expressed significant concerns over one such case (\"Brown et al\"). In 2014 California judge Otis Wright went further and dismissed another such case (\"Hudson\") as \"outrageous\" government conduct and \"unconstitutional\", stating that it had neither prevented nor detected crime, but cost the taxpayer dearly, and that the overwhelming extent of ATF direction of the purported crime, and the level of ATF involvement, made the ATF operative more of a participant rather than an observer, the sentence a reflection of ATF whim rather than defendant's own conduct, and the case into one that lacked due process.\n\nThe case was one of many US Government cases where a situation was presented to members of the public, who were tempted into committing a crime related to drugs, theft, or firearms, on the basis of a fabricated situation \"sting operation\". In this case, the judge Otis D. Wright II dismissed citing \"outrageous\" behavior. He found that by fabricating every aspect of the supposed circumstances in a manner calculated to entice the subjects' involvement, the government acted \"repugnant[ly] to the Constitution\" by creating a crime \"cut from whole cloth\" that was intended not to fail to entice involvement, and was not related to any actual or existent criminal enterprise, but was calculated to produce a sentence of around 15 years:\n\n\n"}

Marc, \"Institutiones Morales\", I, nn. 91-103). \nArguments for Æquiprobabilism: \nÆquiprobabilists say that in this Decree there is a clear expression of the mind of Innocent XI about the morality of teaching that it is permissible to act on the less safe opinion when the safe opinion is certainly more probable. The pope disapproves of this teaching, commends Father Gonzalez for his opposition to it, and orders the General of the Jesuits to allow full liberty so that anyone who pleases may write against it. \nProbabilists reply that, though Innocent XI was opposed to Probabilism, his official Decree merely commanded that liberty of teaching be allowed to the members of the order. Moreover, they point out that Gonzalez was not an Æquiprobabilist, but a Probabiliorist of a strict type whom St. Alphonsus Liguori regarded as an extremist.\n\n"}
{"id": "39336901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39336901", "title": "Alternative liability", "text": "Alternative liability\n\nAlternative liability is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to shift the burden of proving causation of her injury to multiple defendants, even though only one of them could have been responsible. The typical case showing the principle of alternative liability in action is Summers v. Tice, where the two defendants negligently shot in the direction of the plaintiff and only one of the bullets caused the plaintiff's injury. In the interest of justice, the innocent plaintiff's case is not defeated because she cannot prove which party was the actual cause (but-for cause) of her injury.\n\nThe doctrine requires that the plaintiff bring all possible defendants into court and that the plaintiff show the defendants all breached a duty of reasonable care. The burden then shifts to the defendants to provide evidence of who caused the injury.\n\nThe underpinning of this doctrine is that a plaintiff should not be barred from seeking recovery simply because she does not know who caused her injury. The defendants are usually the parties in the best position to have the relevant information.\n\nDistinguish alternative liability from the smoke-out function of res ipsa loquitur seen in the leading case of Ybarra v. Spangard. In \"Ybarra\", the plaintiff brought all defendants who could have \"possibly\" been negligent (breached a duty of reasonable care) so that they could show which party actually was negligent. Thus, in the smoke-out function of res ipsa, the burden is shifted on the defendants to show \"negligence\", whereas in alternative liability all defendants are all shown to have breached a duty of reasonable care and the plaintiff shifts the burden to show \"causation\".\n"}

Brook is Chancellor's Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Carleton University, President of the Canadian Psychoanalytic Society, and former President of the Canadian Philosophical Association.\n\nBrook was born in Edmonton, Alberta and received a BA in 1965 and a MA in 1966 from the University of Alberta. He then attended The Queen's College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, receiving a D. Phil from Oxford in 1973 with a dissertation \"On Self-Consciousness and Self-Reference\" supervised by Anthony Kenny.\nHe then joined the faculty of Carleton University, eventually becoming Director of the Institute of Cognitive Science and Chancellor's Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science. His first book, \"Kant and the Mind\" was published by Cambridge University Press in 1994. He subsequently co-authored \"Knowledge and Mind\" with Robert Stainton (MIT Press, 2000) and has edited several books on consciousness and cognitive science.\n\nHis work has primarily focused on Kant, theories of consciousness, and the relationship between philosophy and cognitive science, and also includes environmental ethics and psychoanalytic theory. He was elected President of the Canadian Psychoanalytic Society in 2013 and won the society's Douglas Levin Prize in 1991 and Miguel Prados Prize in 1994. He has been a Carnegie Mellon Fellow at Bryn Mawr College and a visiting professor in that college's Environmental Studies Program.\nBrook is married to Christine Koggel, Professor of Philosophy at Carleton University and former Harvey Wexler Professor of Philosophy at Bryn Mawr College. The couple have two sons.\n\n\"Kant and the Mind\" was first published in 1994 by Cambridge University Press: in 1996 a paperback edition appeared. As Brook notes in the preface, Kant and the Mind was written for two audiences. First, cognitive scientists, philosophers of mind, and students of cognition. Second, Kant scholars. The book thus has two parts: the first four chapters provide an overview of Kant's model of the mind for general audiences. The second part, written primarily for Kant scholars, attempts to justify the reading given in the first four chapters. Brook emphasizes in the book that Kant had something to offer contemporary psychology, cognitive science and philosophy of mind. he writes, \"I think that the discoveries he made about the mind not only were a contribution in their time, but continue to be important now.\"\nBrook attributes the following discoveries to Kant: 1) the mind has the ability to synthesize a single coherent representation of self and the world. 2) The mind has a unity that is necessary to produce representation. 3) The mind's awareness of itself has unique features stemming from the semantic apparatus that it uses to achieve this awareness. He also suggests that three of Kant's insights have been adopted by cognitive science: the transcendental method (inference to the best explanation), that experience requires both concepts and percepts; and his general picture of the mind as a system of concept-using functions for manipulating representations. He explains that Kant distrusted introspection as a means of revealing the structure of the mind, yet also had deep reservations about Cartesian \"a priori\" arguments. The theory of mind that Brook finds in Kant is not based on either approach, but instead explores what powers the mind must have in order to have experiences and representations that it has.\n\nBrook distinguishes four kinds of awareness, two of which are also kinds of self-awareness: simple awareness (awareness of an object without being aware of being aware), awareness with recognition, awareness of one's representational states and awareness of oneself as the subject of one's representational states. He divides the latter into empirical self-awareness (being aware of one's own mental states) and apperceptive self-awareness (ASA) (being aware of oneself as the subject of those states). ASA is not awareness of oneself as an object with properties; rather, ASA is a bald reference to oneself as existing as oneself. One need not ascribe to oneself any properties whatsoever. If Brook's reading of Kant is correct, then Kant discovered ASA 200 years before contemporary theories.\n\nIn addition to these distinctions, Brook writes that Kant thought the mind is not merely the subject that has representations, but is itself a representation. (\"The mind, the self, the understanding, the thing that thinks not only has representations; it is a representation.\")\nNot only is the mind a representation under this reading, but it is what Brook calls a global representation (the result of synthesis of a multitude of representations into a single intentional object). Brook argues that treating the mind as a global representation removes any risk of an homunculus problem (Hogan, 1996), and further argues that this global representation is the representational base for ASA.\n\nReviewing the book, Stevenson wrote in \"The Philosophical Quarterly\", \"I venture the judgement that this will be recognized as one of the most important books ever on Kant However, Eric Watkins in the \"Journal of the History of Philosophy\" raised concerns about the literature Brook cited and the more controversial interpretations: \"it should be noted, however, that Brook neglects almost entirely the relevant German scholarship on Kant's theory of mind, in the form of work by G. Prauss, W. Carl, M. Frank, G. Mohr, B. Thole and D. Sturma\" (Watkins, 1995, p. 3). Watkins further criticize Brook's claims that one can be aware of the mind as it is and that the mind is a global representation, since the latter directly conflicts with Kant's view that the noumenal self is immaterial, not a representation.\n\n\"Knowledge and Mind\" is an introductory text treating both epistemology and philosophy of mind l. Robert Stainton and Brook co-authored the book which was published in 2000. Divided into three parts, the first part discusses scepticism, knowledge of the external world and knowledge of language. The second part focuses on the metaphysics of mind, as well as free-will. The third discusses knowledge of mind, naturalism and how epistemology and philosophy of mind should resonate in cognitive science.\n\nIn addition to numerous scholarly papers, Brook's other publications include:\n\nHe has also written the following encyclopedia entries:\n"}

Though purported to be an authentic compilation of ancient Welsh bardic and druidic theology and lore, its contents are largely Iolo's own invention. The work was published by John Williams for the Welsh Manuscripts Society in two volumes, 1862 and 1874.\n\nFollowing Iolo Morganwg's death in 1826, his son Taliesin Williams set about collecting and publishing his unpublished manuscripts. This resulted in three volumes, including \"The Iolo Papers\" in 1848, published a year after Taliesin Williams' unexpected death. Subsequently, Iolo's papers were purchased by Benjamin and Augusta Hall, who made them accessible to other scholars. John Williams, alias \"Ab Ithel\", was among the first to take up the offer; he edited the two volumes now known as \"Barddas\" for the Welsh Manuscripts Society, which appeared in 1862 and 1874.\n\nWilliams claimed the \"Barddas\" material was based on authentic ancient manuscripts originally compiled by the 16th-century antiquarian Llywelyn Siôn. In reality, almost all of it was either Iolo's own work, or heavily edited by him. Volume I is divided into three sections. The first section, \"Symbols\", chiefly discusses \"coelbren\", a supposed Bardic alphabet devised by Iolo. The second section, \"Theology\", is the most significant. It discusses Iolo's elaborate philosophy and cosmology, which he claimed was the actual belief system of the ancient bards, though it is really a variegation of Iolo's own unconventional Christian beliefs and interpretation of Welsh tradition. This section includes a \"catechism\" in the form of a question and answer session regarding the cycle of re-incarnation. It discusses the \"circles of being\" from Annwn (lowest state, Hades or Fairyland) through circles of Abred (probation state), Gwynfyd (perfect liberty) and Ceugant (infinity). It also includes a number of \"Triads\" apparently derived from authentic Welsh Triads; according to scholar Rachel Bromwich this suggests Iolo had access to versions of the triads long before they were widely known or collected. The third section, \"Wisdom\", contains esoteric lore that may date to the 16th and 17th century, though not to ancient druidic tradition as Iolo claims. Volume II was left unfinished at Williams' death; it is largely a guidebook for bards and gorsedds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986739", "title": "Communitas", "text": "Communitas\n\nCommunitas is a Latin noun commonly referring either to an unstructured community in which people are equal, or to the very spirit of community. It also has special significance as a loanword in cultural anthropology and the social sciences. Victor Turner, who defined the anthropological usage of communitas, was interested in the interplay between what he called social 'structure' and 'antistructure'; \"Liminality\" and \"Communitas\" are both components of antistructure.\n\nCommunitas refers to an unstructured state in which all members of a community are equal allowing them to share a common experience, usually through a rite of passage. Communitas is characteristic of people experiencing liminality together. This term is used to distinguish the modality of social relationship from an area of common living. There is more than one distinction between structure and communitas. The most familiar is the difference of secular and sacred. Every social position has something sacred about it. This sacred component is acquired during rites of passages, through the changing of positions. Part of this sacredness is achieved through the transient humility learned in these phases, this allows people to reach a higher position.\n\nCommunitas is an acute point of community. It takes community to the next level and allows the whole of the community to share a common experience, usually through a rite of passage. This brings everyone onto an equal level: even if you are higher in position, you have been lower and you know what that is.\n\nTurner (1969, Pg.132; see also ) distinguishes between:\n\nCommunitas as a concept used by Victor Turner in his study of ritual has been criticized by anthropologists. See John Eade & Michael J. Sallnow's \"Contesting the Sacred\" (1991)\n\nEdith Turner, Victor's widow and anthropologist in her own right, published in 2011 a definitive overview of the anthropology of communitas, outlining the concept in relation to the natural history of joy, including the nature of human experience and its narration, festivals, music and sports, work, disaster, the sacred, revolution and nonviolence, nature and spirit, and ritual and rites of passage.\n\n\"Communitas\" is also the title of a book published in 1947 by the 20th-century American thinker and writer Paul Goodman and his brother, Percival Goodman. Their book examines three kinds of possible societies: a society centered on consumption, a society centered on artistic and creative pursuits, and a society which maximizes human liberty. The Goodmans emphasize freedom from both coercion by a government or church and from human necessities by providing these free of cost to all citizens who do a couple of years of conscripted labor as young adults.\n\nIn 1998, Italian philosopher Roberto Esposito published a book under the name \"Communitas\" challenging the traditional understanding of this concept. It was translated in English in 2010 by Timothy Campbell. In this book, Esposito offers a very different interpretation of the concept of \"communitas\" based on a thorough etymological analysis of the word: \"Community isn't a property, nor is it a territory to be separated and defended against those who do not belong to it. Rather, it is a void, a debt, a gift to the other that also reminds us of our constitutive alterity with respect to ourselves.\" He goes on with his \"deconstruction\" of the concept of \"communitas\": \"From here it emerges that \"communitas\" is the totality of persons united not by a \"property\" but precisely by an obligation or a debt; not by an \"addition\" but by a \"subtraction\": by a lack, a limit that is configured as an onus, or even as a defective modality for him who is \"affected\", unlike for him who is instead \"exempt\" or \"exempted\". Here we find the final and most characteristic of the oppositions associated with (or that dominate) the alternative between public and private, those in other words that contrast \"communitas\" to \"immunitas\". If \"communis\" is he who is required to carry out the functions of an office ― or to the donation of a grace ― on the contrary, he is called immune who has to perform no office, and for that reason he remains ungrateful. He can completely preserve his own position through a \"vacatio muneris\". Whereas the \"communitas\" is bound by the sacrifice of the \"compensatio\", the \"immunitas\" implies the beneficiary of the \"dispensatio\".\"\"Therefore the community cannot be thought of as a body, as a corporation in which individuals are founded in a larger individual. Neither is community to be interpreted as a mutual, intersubjective \"recognition\" in which individuals are reflected in each other so as to confirm their initial identity; as a collective bond that comes at a certain point to connect individuals that before were separate. The community isn't a mode of being, much less a \"making\" of the individual subject. It isn't the subject's expansion or multiplication but its exposure to what interrupts the closing and turns it inside out: a dizziness, a syncope, a spasm in the continuity of the subject.\"\n\nFor more on this perspective, see also Jean-Luc Nancy's paper \"The Confronted Community\" as well as his book \"The Inoperative Community\". See also Maurice Blanchot's book \"The Unavowable Community\" (1983) which is an answer to Jean-Luc Nancy's \"Inoperative Community\". Giorgio Agamben engages in a similar argument about the concept of community in his 1990 book \"The Coming Community\" (translated in English by Michael Hardt in 1993). Rémi Astruc, a French scholar, recently proposed in his essay \"Nous? L'aspiration à la Communauté et les arts\" (2015), to operate a distinction between Community with a capital C as the longing for \"communitas\" and communities (plural and small c) to name the numerous actualizations in human societies. Finally, on the American side, see \"The Community of Those Who Have Nothing in Common\" by Alphonso Lingis. Christian author Alan Hirsch used the term to describe a more active, tighter-knit community in his book \"The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "183081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183081", "title": "Dimitrie Cantemir", "text": "Dimitrie Cantemir\n\nDimitrie or Demetrius Cantemir (; 1673–1723), also known by other spellings, was a Moldavian soldier, statesman, and man of letters. He was twice voivode of Moldavia (March–April 1693 and 1710–1711). During his second term, he allied his state with Russia in their war against Moldavia's Ottoman overlords; Russia's defeat forced Cantemir's family into exile and the replacement of the native voivodes by the Greek phanariots. Cantemir was also a prolific writer, variously a philosopher, historian, composer, musicologist, linguist, ethnographer, and geographer. His son Antioch, Russia's ambassador to Great Britain and France and a friend of Montesquieu and Voltaire, would go on to be known as \"the father of Russian poetry\".\n\nDimitrie is the Romanian form of the name Latinized as Demetrius and, less often, anglicized as Demeter. The Russian form of his name was (). He is also known as \"Dimitri Kantemiroğlu\" in Turkish contexts, \"Dymitr Kantemir\" in Polish, and \"Dēmētrios Kantimērēs\" () in Greek.\n\nDimitrie was born in Silişteni, Moldavia (now Vaslui County, Romania) on 26 October 1673 to Constantin Cantemir and Ana Bantăș. His elderly father was from a noble family of Crimean Tatar extraction, which came to Moldavia in the mid-17th century. One of the explanations for the name \"Cantemir\" is that it's derived from \"Can Temur\", meaning \"the blood of Timur\", marking a direct descent from the conqueror Tamerlane. His mother was a learned daughter of a local noble family. In 1685, Constantin was named voivode of Moldavia by its Turkish overlords.\n\nAlthough Constantin himself was illiterate, he educated his sons Dimitrie and Antioh thoroughly. Dimitrie learned Greek and Latin to read the classics as a child. One of his tutors was the scholar John Komnenos Molyvdos. Between 1687 and 1710, Dimitrie spent most of his time as a hostage or envoy in Constantinople, living in the palace he owned, where he learned Turkish and studied Ottoman history at the Patriarchate's Greek Academy. While there, he also composed Turkish music.\n\nUpon Constantin's death in 1693, Dimitrie briefly succeeded him to the voivodeship but was passed over within three weeks in favor of Constantin Duca, whose candidacy was supported by his father-in-law, the Wallachian voivode Constantin Brâncoveanu. When his brother Antioh eventually succeeded to the control of Moldavia, Dimitrie served as his envoy to the Porte. During these years, he also served with distinction in the Turkish army on its campaigns.\n\nIn 1710, Dimitrie was appointed voivode in his own right. Believing Ottoman Turkey to be collapsing, he placed Moldavia under Russian control through a secret agreement signed at Lutsk. He then joined Peter the Great in his war against the Turks. This ended in failure at Stănilești (18–22 July 1711) and the Cantemirs were forced into Russian exile. Turkey then replaced the voivodeship with the rule of Greek phanariots.\n\nIn Russia, Dimitrie was created both a Russian prince (\"knyaz\") by Peter and a prince of the Holy Roman Empire by Charles VI. He lived on an estate at Dmitrovka near Oryol, with a sizable boyar retinue (including the chronicler Ion Neculce). There he died on 21 August 1723, on the very day he was awarded his German title. In 1935, his remains were returned to Iași.\n\nCantemir was married twice: to Princess Kassandra Cantacuzene (1682–1713), daughter of Prince Șerban Cantacuzino and supposed descendant of the Byzantine Kantakouzenoi, in 1699, and to Princess Anastasia Trubetskaya (1700–1755) in 1717.\n\nCantemir's children were rather prominent in Russian history. His elder daughter Maria Cantemir (1700–1754) so attracted Peter the Great that he allegedly planned to divorce his wife Catherine to be with her. Upon Catherine's own ascension to the throne, however, Maria was forced to enter a convent. Cantemir's son Antioch (1708–1744) was the Russian ambassador at London and Paris, a friend of Voltaire and Montesquieu, and so influential a poet, satirist, and essayist as to be considered \"the father of Russian poetry\". Another son Constantin (1703–1747) was implicated in the Golitsyn conspiracy against the empress Anna and was exiled to Siberia. Dimitrie's younger daughter Smaragda (1720–1761), reckoned one of the great beauties of her time, was the wife of Prince Dmitriy Mikhailovich Golitsyn and a friend of the empress Elizabeth.\n\nCantemir was a polyglot known as one of the greatest linguists of his time, speaking and writing eleven languages. Well versed in Oriental scholarship, his \"oeuvre\" is voluminous, diverse, and original, although some of his scientific writings contain unconfirmed theories or simple inaccuracies. Between 1711 and 1719 he wrote his most important creations. In 1714, he was named a member of the Royal Academy of Berlin.\n\nCantemir's best-known history work was his \"History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire\" (the original title was in Latin, \"Historia incrementorum atque decrementorum Aulae Othomanicae\"). This volume circulated throughout Europe in manuscript for a number of years. It was finally printed in 1734 in London and was later translated and printed in Germany and France. It remained the seminal work on the Ottoman Empire up to the middle of the 19th century; notably, it was used as a reference for Edward Gibbon's own \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\". Later scholarship contests many points owing to the dubiousness of some of Cantemir's sources.\n\nHe also published the first critical history of Romania as a whole, the \"Chronicle of the Antiquity of the Romano-Moldavo-Wallachians\" (\"\"), from 1719 to 1722. It asserted the Latin origin of the Romanian language and the Roman origin of the people living within the former land of Dacia.\n\nCantemir composed his \"Description of Moldavia\" () in 1714 at the request of the Royal Academy in Berlin. Covering geographical, ethnographical, and economic aspects of Moldavia, it was similarly circulated in manuscript and only published much later. It appeared in a German geographical magazine in 1769 and was published as a book in 1771. His manuscript map of Moldova was the first real map of the country, containing geographical detail as well as administrative information. Printed in 1737 in the Netherlands, it formed the basis of most European maps of the country for decades.\n\nA few of Cantemir's roughly forty Ottoman compositions are still performed today as part of the Turkish repertoire but his greatest service was in preserving 350 traditional instrumental pieces by publishing them in a musical notation he developed from the Ottoman Turkish alphabet in his work \"Edvar-i Musiki\", offered as a present to Sultan Ahmed III in 1703 or 1704 and recently reprinted with modern explanations. In 1999, the Bezmara ensemble recorded \"Yitik Sesin Peşinde\" (\"In Search of the Lost Sound\") from the Cantemir transcriptions using period instruments. In 2000, Golden Horn Records released \"Cantemir\", a CD exploring his compositions, his European contemporaries, and the folk music of Moldavia performed by İhsan Özgen and the Lux Musica ensemble under Linda Burman-Hall's direction. It features solo improvisations on the Turkish bowed fiddle (' or ') and the long-necked lute (\"\") and was intended to meld early European music styles and instruments with modern Turkish art music and instruments. Seven of Cantemir's compositions were also featured on Hespèrion XXI's 2009 \"Istanbul\", under the direction of Jordi Savall. The recording and accompanying booklet focus on Cantemir's “Book of the Science of Music”, along with the Turkish, Sephardic, and Armenian musical traditions.\n\nHis 1705 roman à clef \"A Hieroglyphic History\" was the first Romanian novel, representing the history of the Wallachian Brâncoveanu and Cantacuzino dynasties through allegorical and mythological animals.\n\nHe also wrote an introduction to Islam for Europeans, a biography of Jan Baptist van Helmont, a philosophical treatise in Romanian and Greek, and an unfinished second treatise on the \"Undepictable Image of Sacred Science\".\n\nDue to his many esteemed works he won great renown at the high courts of Europe. His name is among those who were considered to be the brightest minds of the world on a plaque at the Library of Sainte-Genevieve in Paris, next to those of Leibniz, Newton, Piron, and other great thinkers.\n\nOne of the houses inhabited by Dimitrie Cantemir during his exile in Constantinople was restored and opened as a museum in 2007. It lies in Fener quarter of the walled city between Phanar College and the Golden Horn\n\nIn late 1710 Dimitrie Cantemir took the Moldovan throne with strong support from Peter the First. On 14 July 1711 Dimitrie Cantemir battled the Turks and high nobility in Stanilesti with 500 Russian cavalry troops coming to his aid. The first day showed a clear victory for the Moldovian troops, but as the days passed, a huge 72,000 army led by Pasha annihilated them and in just 4 days Moldova was occupied. Dimitrie Cantemir died in 1721 after the Persian campaign. His mark on the Russian history didn't go unnoticed, with monuments in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Kiev and Iasi.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

She also wrote on archaeology, wrote fiction and produced translations. She was also an educator and was active in Greek left-wing politics and feminism from an early age. It has been claimed that her prominence in twentieth-century Greek philosophy has \"only recently become widely known\". Her life and work was acknowledged on 8 March 2017 at an event in the Senate Chamber of Athens Parliament.\n\nElli Lambridi was born in Athens on 22 January 1896. Her father, Ioanni Lambridi, from Doliana, Epirus, was a lawyer and senator in the first Venizelos administration, and known for his work concerning the liberation of Epirus. Her mother Sofia was Athenian, her family from Mytilene. Lambridi graduated from a boy’s grammar school in Athens, then studied Classics at the University of Athens (1911-1916).\n\nShe was awarded a postgraduate scholarship to study in Zurich in 1917, which she completed in philosophy and pedagogy. She received her PhD in 1919 with a thesis on Aristotle’s principles of knowledge. During this time in Zurich, she met Nikos Kazantzakis, with whom she went on a number of journeys through Switzerland between January and September 1918, beginning with a \"pilgrimage\" to the Upper Engadine in the footsteps of Nietzsche. Kazantzakis later nicknamed her \"Mudita\", meaning \"joy at the pleasure of others\". Their relationship continued on and off until 1957.\n\nAfter completing her PhD in 1919, she travelled from Zurich to London where she attended London Teacher's College in 1919. In 1920, she moved to Constantinople, commencing work at the American College for Girls, as well as teaching at Zappeion Teachers College and the Stavrodromiou Central School for Girls. She married Kostas Stylianopoulos in London in 1922. In the wake of the Catastrophe, they moved to Athens in 1923. Lambridi was appointed headmistress at the American College for Girls in Athens, where she organised the programme for the Greek department. Her daughter, Nike, was born in 1923; however, the couple were divorced soon afterwards.\nLambridi continued teaching and became engaged in philosophical and political issues. In 1926, she travelled to Paris as an envoy of the \"Free Press\" newspaper to participate in the 10th Congress of the International Alliance for Women's Vote. In 1928, she resigned from the College in Athens and over the following two years dedicated herself to philosophical research and writing . Among other projects, she undertook a philosophical series for Ellinika Philla, wrote numerous essays on philosophy and psychology for the periodical \"Anagennisi\" and philosophical entries for an encyclopaedia. In 1929, she published \"Bergson and his Philosophy\", and \"The Aegean: Cretan-Mycenean Political Structure\". In 1930, she travelled to Prague to attend the Congress of the International Federation of University Women.\nLambridi returned to teaching in 1930, having been appointed Deputy Director of Teaching at Marasleio Teachers College. In 1931, she travelled to America to attend the Congress of the International Federation of University Women. In 1932, she was Deputy Director, first at Tripoli and then at Lamia Teachers Colleges. Her formal pedagogical career ended when she was forced to leave her position in July 1935, for political reasons, following the failed attempt by Venizelos to regain power. \nLambridi worked as a private teacher in Athens, but devoted her time to studying and writing philosophy. She attended soirees in Kydhathineon Street, Plaka, Athens (the home of Konstantinos Tsatsos, later President of Greece), and in 1937-1939 presented a series of lectures in philosophy at the cultural association, Askraios. These were very successful, attracting large audiences, and from these courses eventually came her \"Introduction to Philosophy\" (1965, 2004). In 1939, she published an extended critical review of the \"\" by Kazantzakis in \"Neohellenica Grammata\" (\"Modern Greek Literature\") which drew a hostile response. She also published many other articles in various literary and philosophical publications.\n\nLambridi received a scholarship from the British Council to study the English education system at London’s Institute of Education and arrived in London in September, 1939. As well as her studies, she also attended lectures by Wittgenstein at Cambridge. The occupation of Europe during the war stopped her returning to Greece, and she offered her services to the Greek Government in exile in London, and in 1941 was appointed Director of the Ministry of Information, undertaking various activities, including BBC interviews, producing newsletters and teaching Greek to English SAS officers to be engaged in the Greek resistance movement.\n\nLambridi returned to Greece in early 1945, only to be informed that her daughter, who had spent the war with family and friends, had been hit by shrapnel from a British mortar a few days earlier. The ambulance carrying Niki to hospital had then been bombed. She died on 3 Jan 1945, aged 22, an innocent victim of the Dekemvriana. Lambridi later published an account of her daughter’s life told in parallel to contemporary Greek history entitled \"Nike\" (Victory).\nLambridi remained in Greece for about a year before returning to the UK. While in London, she became a member of the League for Democracy in Greece and sat on the Board with ten British Labour MPs. As a result of her association with the League, her passport was confiscated by the Greek Government in 1947 and she remained in London for another ten years. During this time she continued to write, working on \"Nike\", other fictional works, various philosophical projects and translations.\n\nAfter regaining her passport, she was able to return to Greece in 1960, where she published \"Nike\" and continued work on a number of philosophical and literary projects. She also became a member of the Socialist Democratic Union (SDE) and, in the 1964 election, was nominated as a candidate by the Socialist Party/Greek Popular Movement for Independence. In 1964, she became a member of the Société Européenne de Culture and in 1965 she travelled to Russia to participate in the Conference of the International Federation of Democratic Women. In 1967, the military dictatorship (21 April 1967 to 23 July 1974) cancelled her passport and banned the publication of the second volume of \"Introduction to Philosophy\". In her later years, she produced a manuscript on Empedocles in English (published posthumously in the US) and was contracted to produce another work on Protagoras. She died in Athens on 28 January 1970 and is buried in the First Cemetery.\n\nAt Lambridi’s request, the Elli Lambridi Philosophical Library was established after her death by the Academy of Athens and her brothers in Ypsilanto Street, Kolonaki, Athens on the basis of a small legacy and with the help of her executors. In her will, she explained that \"philosophy and philosophical education was completely neglected in Greece, and although she had studied philosophy constantly, she had not completed her mission, which was to make philosophy the ultimate purpose of her life\". The library is administered by the Academy of Athens and contains Lambridi’s personal collection which ranges from logic and analytic philosophy to the history of religion and a general range of philosophy texts in Greek, German, French and English. The library also holds many other philosophical works. Among Lambridi’s manuscripts is a comprehensive history of ancient Greek philosophy and many works on modern analytic philosophy, as well as papers on Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and others and the unfinished \"Fantasia Philosophica\". She also prepared a work on traditional and modern logic that she regarded as her written philosophical legacy, which is still unpublished.\n\nLambridi published over 100 works on many topics. A comprehensive bibliography has been produced by the Elli Lambridi Library. Elli Lambridi’s archive is held at ELIA, (ΕΛΙΑ, ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΟ ΛΟΓΟΤΕΧΝΙΚΟ ΙΣΤΟΡΙΚΟ ΑΡΧΕΙΟ), with an analytical index compiled by Yolanda Hatzi.\n\n\n\nVarious complete works including those by Bergson, Schiller, Laforgue and Esterlich \n\n\n"}

According to Fechner, aesthetics is an experiential perception which is empirically comprehensible in light of the characteristics of the subject undergoing the experience and those of the object. Experimental aesthetics is the second oldest research area in psychology, psychophysics being the only field which is older. In his central work \"Vorschule der Ästhetik\" (\"Introduction to aesthetics\") Fechner describes his empirical approach extensively and in detail. Experimental aesthetics is characterized by a subject-based, inductive approach.\n\nNowadays, psychologists and neuroscientists define the field of aesthetics more narrowly as considering the perception, creation, and evaluation of objects that evoke an intense feeling. It is a specialized sub-field of empirical aesthetics that distinguishes itself by using experiments to test causal hypotheses. In contrast, empirical aesthetics also embraces survey studies, field observations, and other non-experimental methods.\n\nExperimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the natural sciences. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of cognitive psychology or neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).\n\nThe analysis of individual experience and behavior based on experimental methods is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art, music, or modern items such as websites or other IT products is studied. Data can be examined and analyzed at three levels:\n\n\nHere it is difficult to assign an absolute value to the aesthetics of an object. However, one can measure, for example, what percentage of subjects classify an object as beautiful or how many prefer this object to others.\n\nDepending on the approach, a number of different methods are used in experimental aesthetics, such as pairwise comparisons, rank order methods, Likert scales and semantic differentials, production methods, statistical comparisons of groups, reaction time measurements, and also more complex methods such as eye tracking, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n"}
{"id": "8321281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8321281", "title": "Four Dissertations", "text": "Four Dissertations\n\nFour Dissertations is a collection of four essays by the Scottish enlightenment philosopher David Hume, first published in 1757. The four essays are:\n\nIn this essay, Hume offers a pioneering naturalist account of the causes, effects, and historical development of religious belief. Hume argues that a crude polytheism was the earliest religion of mankind and locates the origins of religion in emotion, particularly hope, fear, and the desire to control the future. He further argues that monotheism arises from competition between religions, as believers seek to distinguish their deities as superior to all rivals, magnifying those deities until they possess all perfections. Though an enlightened monotheism is more rationally defensible than a superstitious polytheism, in practice polytheism has many advantages. In particular, Hume argues, monotheistic religions tend to be more intolerant and hypocritical, result in greater intellectual absurdities, and foster socially undesirable \"monkish virtues,\" such as mortification, abasement, and passive suffering.\n\nHume concludes the \"Natural History\" on a note of characteristic skepticism:\n\nHume begins the passions by giving a trite example of what Good and Evil are. Good, being pleasure. Evil, being pain. He then begins to analyze emotion as a reasoning faculty of the human mind. He argues that not only can emotions mix, they can also destroy one another. He also argues that our imagination and sentiments combine to create an impression of something/someone. For example, you see your grade on a test and it is good, you then attribute that good grade to having a good teacher, and even maybe an interest in the class as well. Hume tries to exclude religion from our reasoning faculty of right and wrong in that we make our decisions based on the over-riding passion during that moment. Your wife may divorce you, but I bet winning the lottery would make you forget about it. He concludes by saying that this mixture of emotion and sentiments give rise to hope and fear, which gives rise to religion in ancient society.\n\n\"Of Tragedy\", is where Hume considered why we enjoy tragic drama. He was concerned with why spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He decided that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realizing that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction.\n\n\"Of the Standard of Taste\" was a seminal essay on aesthetics that is innovative because it requires Hume to address the apparent relativity of taste, a conclusion that appears to follow from his own assumption that the \"good\" or \"beauty\" of a good work of art is identical with the positive human responses it generates. The essay's focus on the subject (the viewer, the reader) rather than the object (the painting, the book) is typical of the British \"sentimentalists\" or moral sense theorists of the eighteenth century. Unlike the French philosophers of the eighteenth century, who sought an objective definition of beauty, the British school tended to look for the connections between taste and aesthetic judgments.\n\nHume begins with the observation that there is much variety in people's taste (or the aesthetic judgments people make). However, Hume argues that there is a common mechanism in human nature that gives rise to, and often even provides justification for, such judgments. He takes this aesthetic sense to be quite similar to the moral sense for which he argues in his Book 3 of \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1739–1740) and in \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\" (1751). Furthermore, he argues that this still leaves room for the ability to refine one's aesthetic palate. (Fieser, 2006, §2)\n\nHume took as his premise that the great diversity and disagreement regarding matters of taste had two basic sources - sentiment, which was to some degree naturally varying, and critical facility, which could be cultivated. Each person is a combination of these of two sources, and Hume endeavours to delineate the admirable qualities of a critic, that they might augment their natural sense of beauty into a reliable faculty of judgment. There are a variety of qualities of the good critic that he describes, each of which contributes to an ultimately reliable and just ability to judge.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 8, 2012.\n\nThe episode was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Raymie Muzquiz.\n\nEnrolling in college on a whim, Bender gets a questionable student loan from the Robot Mafia and falls in with a bad crowd. He then promptly drops out of college, gets addicted to robot drug \"Spark,\" does dubious acts for Hedonismbot, and ultimately attempts to rob Girl Scouts (only for them to turn the tables on him) to earn money. His downward spiral leads to his arrest and trial, but his lawyer argues that as a robot, Bender lacks free will and that it was his programming that led to the sequence of events. The judge rules Bender not guilty, much to Bender's dismay.\n\nThe Planet Express crew is hired to deliver a package to Chapek 9 (last seen in \"Fear of a Bot Planet\"), requiring a despondent Bender to come along due to the native robots' intense hatred of humans. After delivering the package, Bender decides to stay on the planet, going on a journey of self-discovery. He eventually finds a religious monastery control by robotic monk named Ab-bot who call their religion \"Order of the Binary Singularity\" to take him in. From them, he learns that every Mom Corp. robot has a free will slot, so that they could be upgraded if a corresponding free will unit were ever invented. Bender returns to Earth to find more answers (and walks in on Fry and Leela together in bed).\n\nBender, Fry, and Leela reach the secret laboratory where the module may be kept, but they find Mom waiting for them there. She reveals that a free will unit was designed by Prof. Farnsworth years earlier when he worked at Mom Corp. Farnsworth never completed it after learning of Mom's plan to use the unit to cause a robot uprising that would then be repelled by obedient robots. Bender returns to Planet Express and asks Farnsworth about the module. The Professor admits that he had finished making one complete free will unit, which he has hidden in a talking Bender toy. Bender attempts to use a gun on Farnsworth to force him to hand it over, but Bender discovers that the Professor had programmed a failsafe in all robots that prevents them from taking the unit or attacking Farnsworth. Farnsworth inserts the unit into Bender to give Bender a sample of what free will is like. At first, when Bender attempts to shoot Farnsworth again, it appears the unit is not working. Bender then remembers he forgot to turn off the gun's safety, and shoots the Professor. Bender is taken to court and, now that he has free will, is found guilty of attempted murder. The crew of Planet Express celebrate (except for a severely injured Farnsworth) with Bender as he is taken away.\n\nOver the end credits is a rap video featuring Bender and several floozy-bots from previous episodes (such as Hookerbot 5000 from \"Hell is Other Robots\" and the two Jewish-American princess robots from \"The Bots and the Bees\").\n\n\n"}

He made significant contributions to the study of medicine, politics and law.\n\nDescended from Lutheran clergy on both sides of his family, second-youngest of ten children, Conring showed early promise as a student. During his life as a professor in North Germany, Conring addressed himself first to medicine, producing significant studies on blood circulation, and later in his career addressed himself to politics.\n\nConring was born in Norden, a coastal town in East Frisia, a territory ruled at that time by the counts of Cirksena. Like many areas of what would later become Germany, Conring's homeland exhibited considerable religious variety and strife. Lutheran in the countryside (and in the piety of its counts), East Frisia nonetheless sheltered a bastion of Calvinism in its chief city, Emden. Conring and his family were no strangers to confessional altercations. Many of Conring's forebears were ministers, and his father and paternal grandfather, in particular, were apparently compelled to change their circumstances on several occasions in response to Protestant religious conflict.\n\nConring was one of ten siblings, two of whom died in infancy, six more of whom died of the plague in 1611.\n\nConring began his schooling early, as befit a descendant of literate clerical forebears, entering school in Norden at the age of six, and beginning his studies in Latin a year later. About ninety years earlier, Luther had bestowed a powerful legitimacy upon the German language with his translation of the Bible into German, but, as in other European countries, Latin remained the official language of learning for centuries. By the age of 14, Conring had developed into a skilled Latinist, broadly familiar with ancient classical writings and with the leading Latin writers of his own day and region.\n\nIn 1620, at the age of 14, Conring began to take courses in the philosophy curriculum at the University of Helmstedt, one of the leading northern European universities of its day, where he would study for the next five years.\n\nLindenfeld calls Conring a Neo-Aristotelian. The term \"philosophy\" meant something rather different in his time. It referred to a branch of inquiry that sought chiefly to explicate law, religion and politics in terms laid down by ancient thinkers, particularly Aristotle, who in Conring's circles would often have been known simply as \"the philosopher\". Lindenfeld says that in 1660 Conring was the first to lecture on \"Statistik\", the forerunner of modern government statistics; but the topic was political science.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "163154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163154", "title": "John Winthrop", "text": "John Winthrop\n\nJohn Winthrop (12 January 1587/88 – 26 March 1649) was an English Puritan lawyer and one of the leading figures in founding the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the second major settlement in New England, following Plymouth Colony. Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony's first 20 years. His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan \"city upon a hill\" dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies.\n\nWinthrop was born into a wealthy landowning and merchant family. He trained in the law and became Lord of the Manor at Groton in Suffolk. He was not involved in founding the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1628, but he became involved in 1629 when anti-Puritan King Charles I began a crackdown on Nonconformist religious thought. In October 1629, he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he led a group of colonists to the New World in April 1630, founding a number of communities on the shores of Massachusetts Bay and the Charles River.\n\nBetween 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 18 annual terms as governor or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative Thomas Dudley and the more liberal Roger Williams and Henry Vane. Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it \"the meanest and worst of all forms of government\". The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.\n\nWinthrop's son John was one of the founders of the Connecticut Colony, and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period. His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.\n\nJohn Winthrop was born on 12 January 1587/8 to Adam and Anne (née Browne) Winthrop in Edwardstone, Suffolk, England. His birth was recorded in the parish register at Groton. His father's family had been successful in the textile business, and his father was a lawyer and prosperous landowner with several properties in Suffolk. His mother's family was also well-to-do, with properties in Suffolk and Essex. When Winthrop was young, his father became a director at Trinity College, Cambridge. Winthrop's uncle John (Adam's brother) emigrated to Ireland, and the Winthrop family took up residence at Groton Manor.\n\nWinthrop was first tutored at home by John Chaplin and was assumed to have attended grammar school at Bury St. Edmunds. He was also regularly exposed to religious discussions between his father and clergymen, and thus came to a deep understanding of theology at an early age. He was admitted to Trinity College in December 1602, matriculating at the university a few months later. Among the students with whom he would have interacted were John Cotton and John Wheelwright, two men who also had important roles in New England. He was a close childhood and university friend of William Spring, later a Puritan Member of Parliament with whom he corresponded for the rest of his life. The teenage Winthrop admitted in his diary of the time to \"lusts ... so masterly as no good could fasten upon me.\" Biographer Francis Bremer suggests that Winthrop's need to control his baser impulses may have prompted him to leave school early and marry at an unusually early age.\n\nIn 1604, Winthrop journeyed to Great Stambridge in Essex with a friend. They stayed at the home of a family friend, and Winthrop was favorably impressed with their daughter Mary Forth. He left Trinity College to marry her on 16 April 1605 at Great Stambridge. Mary bore him five children, of whom only three survived to adulthood. The oldest of their children was John Winthrop, the Younger, who became a governor and magistrate of Connecticut. Their last two children, two girls, died not long after birth, and Mary died in 1615 from complications of the last birth. The couple spent most of their time at Great Stambridge, living on the Forth estate. In 1613, Adam Winthrop transferred the family holdings in Groton to Winthrop, who then became Lord of the Manor at Groton.\n\nAs Lord of the Manor, Winthrop was deeply involved in the management of the estate, overseeing the agricultural activities and the manor house. He eventually followed his father in practicing law in London, which would have brought him into contact with the city's business elite. He was also appointed to the county commission of the peace, a position that gave him a wider exposure among other lawyers and landowners, and a platform to advance what he saw as God's kingdom. The commission's responsibilities included overseeing countywide issues, including road and bridge maintenance and the issuance of licenses. Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses, although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate. The full commission met quarterly, and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities.\nWinthrop documented his religious life, keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings. In it, he described his failures to keep \"divers vows\", and sought to reform his failings by God's grace, praying that God would \"give me a new heart, joy in his spirit; that he would dwell with me\". He was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings, but he eventually observed that \"she proved after a right godly woman.\" He was more intensely religious than his father, whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters.\n\nHis wife Mary died in 1615, and he followed the custom of the time, marrying Thomasine Clopton soon after on 6 December 1615. She was more pious than Mary had been; Winthrop wrote that she was \"truly religious & industrious therein\". Thomasine died on 8 December 1616 from complications of childbirth; the child did not survive.\n\nIn approximately 1613 (records indicate that it may have been earlier), Winthrop was enrolled at Gray's Inn. There he read the law but did not advance to the Bar. His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of Great Maplestead, Essex and he began courting Margaret Tyndal in 1617, the daughter of Sir John Tyndal, a chancery judge, and his wife Anne Egerton, sister of the leading Puritan preacher Stephen Egerton. Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds; Winthrop countered by appealing to piety as a virtue that more than compensated for his modest income. The couple were married on 29 April 1618 at Great Maplestead. They continued to live at Groton, although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London, where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the Court of Wards and Liveries. His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away.\n\nIn the mid to late 1620s, the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed that the English Reformation was in danger. King Charles I had ascended the throne in 1625, and he had married a Roman Catholic. Charles was opposed to all manner of recusants and supported the Church of England in its efforts against religious groups such as the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices. This atmosphere of intolerance led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the New World as a viable means to escape persecution.\nThe first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the Plymouth Colony on the shores of Cape Cod Bay. An effort in 1624 orchestrated by pastor John White led to a short-lived colony at Cape Ann, also on the Massachusetts coast. In 1628, some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers. It was first styled the New England Company, then renamed the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter granting it permission to govern the territory. Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628, it sent a small group of settlers led by John Endecott to prepare the way for further migration. John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities, which involved primarily individuals from Lincolnshire; however, by early 1629, he was probably aware of the company's activities and plans. The exact connection is uncertain by which he became involved with the company, because there were many indirect connections between Winthrop and individuals directly associated with the company. Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places; his son Henry became involved in efforts to settle Barbados in 1626, which Winthrop financially supported for a time.\n\nIn March 1629, King Charles dissolved Parliament, beginning eleven years of rule without Parliament. This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor Matthew Cradock proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony. It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. He wrote, \"If the Lord seeth it wilbe good for us, he will provide a shelter & a hidinge place for us and others\". During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration and, on 12 August, he circulated a paper providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration. His name appears in formal connection with the company on the Cambridge Agreement, signed 26 August; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.\n\nThe company shareholders met on 20 October to enact the changes agreed to in August. Governor Cradock was not emigrating and a new governor needed to be chosen. Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock, and he won the election. The other two were Richard Saltonstall and John Humphrey; they had many other interests, and their dedication to settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain. Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor, a post that he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration.\n\nWinthrop and other company officials then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration. He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills that the new colony would require, including pastors to see to the colony's spiritual needs.\n\nIt was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over; she was due to give birth in April 1630, near the fleet's departure time. They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time; it was not until 1631 that the couple were reunited in the New World. To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation, the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday. Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration; John, Jr. and Henry both decided to do so, but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet.\n\nBy April 1630, Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order. Groton Manor had not yet been sold because of a long-running title dispute. The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure, and the property's sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John Jr. left for the colony.\n\nJohn Winthrop used a coat of arms that was reportedly confirmed to his paternal uncle by the College of Arms, London in 1592. It was also used by his sons. These arms appear on his tombstone in the King's Chapel Burying Ground. It is also the coat of arms for Winthrop House at Harvard University and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son Deane Winthrop at the Deane Winthrop House. The heraldic blazon of arms is \"Argent three chevronels Gules overall a lion rampant Sable.\"\n\nOn 8 April 1630, four ships left the Isle of Wight carrying Winthrop and other leaders of the colony. Winthrop sailed on the \"Arbella\", accompanied by his two young sons Samuel and Stephen. The ships were part of a larger fleet totalling 11 ships that carried about 700 migrants to the colony. Winthrop's son Henry Winthrop missed the \"Arbella\" sailing and ended up on the \"Talbot\", which also sailed from Wight. Winthrop wrote a sermon entitled \"A Modell of Christian Charity\", which was delivered either before or during the crossing. It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, while also comparing the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World with the story of Exodus. In it, he used the now-famous phrase \"City upon a Hill\" to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently \"the eyes of all people are upon us.\" He also said, \"In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection\"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient—and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.\nThe fleet arrived at Salem in June and was welcomed by John Endecott. Winthrop and his deputy Thomas Dudley found the Salem area inadequate for a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists, and they embarked on surveying expeditions of the area. They first decided to base the colony at Charlestown, but a lack of good water there prompted them to move to the Shawmut Peninsula where they founded what is now the city of Boston. The season was relatively late, and the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the Charles River in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack.\n\nThe colony struggled with disease in its early months, losing as many as 200 people to a variety of causes in 1630, including Winthrop's son Henry, and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions. Winthrop set an example to the other colonists by working side by side with servants and laborers in the work of the colony. According to one report, he \"fell to work with his own hands, and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation.\"\n\nWinthrop built his house in Boston where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land. In 1631, he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the Mystic River that he called Ten Hills Farm. On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock, where one of the colony's first boats was built, Winthrop's \"Blessing of the Bay\". Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England.\n\nThe issue of where to locate the colony's capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley. Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown (present-day Harvard Square, Cambridge) after the council had agreed that the capital would be established there. However, Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there. This upset Dudley, and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house. However, they seemed to reconcile after their children were married. Winthrop recounts the two of them, each having been granted land near Concord, going to stake their claims. At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers \"in remembrance that they were brothers by their children's marriage\". Dudley's lands became Bedford, and Winthrop's Billerica.\n\nThe colony's charter called for a governor, deputy governor, and 18 assistant magistrates who served as a precursor to the idea of a Governor's Council. All these officers were to be elected annually by the freemen of the colony. The first meeting of the General Court consisted of exactly eight men. They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants, in violation of the charter; under these rules, Winthrop was elected governor three times. The general court admitted a significant number of settlers, but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members. The colony saw a large influx of immigrants in 1633 and 1634, following the appointment of strongly anti-Puritan William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury.\nWhen the 1634 election was set to take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony's lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and the election of the deputy all rested with the freemen, not with the assistants. Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen, but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen. A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests. In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with Roger Ludlow as deputy. Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.\n\nIn the late 1630s, the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates. Winthrop opposed these moves, and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them. His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the common law tradition and the desire, as a magistrate, to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances. He also pointed out that adoption of written laws \"repugnant to the laws of England\" was not allowed in the charter, and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law. The Massachusetts Body of Liberties was formally adopted during Richard Bellingham's governorship in 1641. Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684.\n\nIn the 1640s, constitutional issues arose concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because \"a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.\"\n\nWinthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645, when he was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the Hingham militia. The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander, and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had several parties imprisoned on both sides of the dispute, pending a meeting of the court of assistants. Peter Hobart, the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute, vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions. Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant. He successfully defended himself, pointing out that he had not acted alone, and also that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors that they make on the bench. He also argued that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates. Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined.\n\nOne major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that \"civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English\", and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition. William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.\n\nIn 1634 and 1635, Winthrop served as an assistant, while the influx of migrants brought first John Haynes and then Henry Vane to the governorship. Haynes, Vane, Anne Hutchinson, and pastors Thomas Hooker and John Wheelwright all espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals, including Winthrop. Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the Antinomian view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more Legalist view. This religious rift is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy, and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy. By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views. (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, and not all of them have survived.) In the 1637 election, Vane was turned out of all offices, and Dudley was elected governor.\n\nDudley's election did not immediately quell the controversy. First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial, and both were banished from the colony. (Hutchinson and others founded the settlement of Portsmouth on Rhode Island; Wheelwright founded first Exeter, New Hampshire and then Wells, Maine in order to be free of Massachusetts rule.) Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters, but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate, claiming that Winthrop should \"make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves.\" Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the Connecticut River (the nucleus of the Connecticut Colony); Vane left for England after the 1637 election, suggesting that he might seek a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government. (Vane never returned to the colony, and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the English Civil Wars; he was beheaded after the Restoration.)\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1637 election, the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony, forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than three weeks without approval from the magistrates. Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests, arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to \"refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours\". Ironically, some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of banishing Roger Williams in 1635. Winthrop was then out of office, and he had a good relationship with Williams. The magistrates ordered Williams' arrest, but Winthrop warned him, making possible his flight which resulted in the establishment of Providence Plantation. Winthrop and Williams later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences.\n\nWinthrop's attitude toward the local Indian populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy. He described an early meeting with one local chief:\n\nChickatabot came with his [chiefs] and squaws, and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn. After they had all dined, and had each a small cup of sack and beer, and the men tobacco, he sent away all his men and women (though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder.) Himself and one squaw and one [chief] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and pease, and a mug, and other small things.\n\nThe colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands that they occupied in the early years, although they also practiced a policy that historian Alfred Cave calls \"vacuum domicilium\": if land is not under some sort of active use, it is free for the taking. This meant that lands could be claimed which were only used seasonally by the Indians (e.g., for fishing or hunting) and were empty otherwise. According to Alfred Cave, Winthrop claimed that the rights of \"more advanced\" peoples superseded the rights of the Indians.\n\nHowever, cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the Indians meant that clashes were inevitable, and the Pequot War was the first major conflict in which the colony engaged. Winthrop sat on the council which decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid Indian villages on Block Island in the war's first major action. Winthrop's communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the Narragansetts to side with the English against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies. The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe, whose survivors were scattered into other tribes or shipped to the West Indies.\n\nSlavery already existed in the Massachusetts Bay area prior to John Winthrop's arrival, since Samuel Maverick arrived in the area with slaves in 1624. In the aftermath of the Pequot War, many of the captured Pequots warriors were shipped to the West Indies as slaves. Winthrop kept one male and two female Pequots as slaves.\n\nIn 1641, the Massachusetts Body of Liberties was enacted, codifying rules about slavery, among many other things. Winthrop was a member of the committee which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived. C.S. Manegold claims that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation.\n\nRising tensions in England culminated in civil war and led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies. The colonists consequently began to expand trade and interaction with other colonies, non-English as well as English. This led to trading ventures with other Puritans on Barbados, a source of cotton, and with the neighboring French colony of Acadia.\n\nFrench Acadia covered the eastern half of present-day Maine, as well as New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. It was embroiled in a minor civil war between competing administrators; English colonists began trading with Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour in 1642, and his opponent Charles de Menou d'Aulnay warned Boston traders away from la Tour's territories. In June 1643, la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d'Aulnay. Governor Winthrop refused to provide official assistance, but allowed la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service.\n\nThis decision brought on a storm of criticism, principally from the magistrates of Essex County, which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute. John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses. The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy, and he was turned out of office. The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d'Aulnay as the victor. In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor's seat when d'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers. Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a sedan chair, originally given to him by an English privateer.\n\nIn addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government, Winthrop was a significant property owner. He owned the Ten Hills Farm, as well as land that became the town of Billerica, Governors Island in Boston Harbor (now the site of Logan International Airport), and Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay. He also engaged in the fur trade in partnership with William Pynchon, using the ship \"Blessing of the Bay\". Governors Island was named for him and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808, when it was purchased for the construction of Fort Winthrop.\n\nThe farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop's part. The steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that caused a cash crisis for Winthrop. The colony insisted on paying him his salary (which he had refused to accept in the past) as well as his expenses while engaged in official duties. Private subscriptions to support him raised about £500 and the colony also granted his wife of land.\n\nHis wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the \"Lyon\" in 1631, but their baby daughter Anne died during the crossing. Two more children were born to the Winthrops in New England before Margaret died on 14 June 1647. Winthrop married his fourth wife Martha Rainsborough some time after 20 December 1647 and before the birth of their only child in 1648. She was the widow of Thomas Coytmore and sister of Thomas and William Rainborowe. Winthrop died of natural causes on 26 March 1649, and is buried in what is now called the King's Chapel Burying Ground in Boston. He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons.\n\nWinthrop rarely published and his literary contribution was relatively unappreciated during his time, yet he spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations. His major contributions to the literary world were \"A Modell of Christian Charity\" (1630) and \"The History of New England\" (1630–1649, also known as \"The Journal of John Winthrop\"), which remained unpublished until the late 18th century.\n\nJohn Winthrop wrote and delivered the lay sermon that became \"A Model of Christian Charity\" either before the 1630 crossing to North America or while en route. It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, as well as the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World. He used the phrase \"city upon a hill\" (derived from the Bible's Sermon on the Mount) to characterize the colonists' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community. He encouraged the colonists to \"bear one another's burdens\" and to view themselves as a \"Company of Christ, bound together by Love.\" He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state. If they did so, God would \"make us a prayse and glory, that man shall say of succeeding plantacions: the lord make it like that of New England.\"\n\nWinthrop's sermon is often characterized as a forerunner to the concept of American exceptionalism. Recent research has shown, however, that the speech was not given much attention at the time of its delivery, unlike the farewell sermon of John Cotton. Furthermore, Winthrop did not introduce any significant new concepts, but merely repeated what were widely held Puritan beliefs. The work was not published until the nineteenth century, although it was known and circulated in manuscript before that time.\n\nWinthrop kept a journal of his life and experiences, starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through his time in Massachusetts, originally written in three notebooks. His account has been acknowledged as the \"central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s\". The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by Noah Webster. The third notebook was long thought lost but was rediscovered in 1816, and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by James Savage as \"The History of New England from 1630–1649. By John Winthrop, Esq. First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. From his Original Manuscripts\". The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage's office in 1825; the other two volumes now belong to the Massachusetts Historical Society. Richard Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle produced a modern transcription of the diaries in 1996, combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage's transcription of the second notebook.\n\nThe journal began as a nearly day-to-day recounting of the ocean crossing. As time progressed, he made entries less frequently and wrote at a greater length so that, by the 1640s, the work began to take the shape of a history. Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts: his journey from England, the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631, and the birth of his son in 1632. He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day. The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary, but merely observations of early New England life. Gradually, the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind-the-scenes views of political matters.\n\nWinthrop's earliest publication was likely \"The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects\" (London, 1630), which defended the emigrants' physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England. This work was republished by Joshua Scottow in the 1696 compilation \"MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New-England, The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES\".\n\nIn addition to his more famous works, Winthrop produced a number of writings, both published and unpublished. While living in England, he articulated his belief \"in the validity of experience\" in a private religious journal known as his \"Experiencia\". He wrote in this journal intermittently between 1607 and 1637 as a sort of confessional, very different in tone and style from the \"Journal\". Later in his life, he wrote \"A Short Story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists and Libertines, that Infected the Churches of New England\" which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson and other in 1636 and 1637. The work was first published in London in 1644. At the time of its publication, there was much discussion about the nature of church governance, and the Westminster Assembly of Divines had recently begun to meet. The evidence which it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as proving the book's worth, and by opponents as proving its failings. In some of its editions, it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane, who had become a leading Independent political leader in the discussion. Vane's opponents sought to \"tie Toleration round the neck of Independency, stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack, and sink them to the bottom of the sea.\"\n\nAccording to biographer Francis Bremer, Winthrop's writings echoed those of other Puritans which \"were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role [which] New Englanders believed themselves called to play.\"\n\nWinthrop's reference to the \"city upon a hill\" in \"A Modell of Christian Charity\" has become an enduring symbol in American political discourse. Many American politicians have cited him in their writings or speeches, going back to revolutionary times. Winthrop's reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century, when critics pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule, including Nathaniel Hawthorne and H. L. Mencken, and leading to modern assessments of him as a \"lost Founding Father\". Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop \"is at once a significant founding father of America's best and worst impulses\", with his calls for charity and public participation offset by what Holland views as rigid intolerance, exclusionism, and judgmentalism.\n\nWinthrop gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645, stating that there are two kinds of liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, \"evil as well as good,\" a liberty that he believed should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was \"the proper end and object of authority\", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare. He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds. Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson. He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.\n\nMany modern politicians refer to Winthrop's writings in their speeches, people as diverse as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Michael Dukakis, and Sarah Palin. Ronald Reagan described Winthrop as \"an early 'Freedom Man'\" who came to America \"looking for a home that would be free.\"\n\nWinthrop is a major character in Catharine Maria Sedgwick's 1827 novel \"Hope Leslie\", set in colonial Massachusetts. He also makes a brief appearance in Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\" in the chapter entitled \"The Minister's Vigil.\"\n\nJohn Winthrop's descendants number thousands today. His son John was the first governor of the Saybrook Colony, and later generations of his family continued to play an active role in New England politics well into the 19th century. Twentieth century descendants include former US Senator from Massachusetts and former Secretary of State John Kerry, and educator Charles William Eliot. The towns of Winthrop, Massachusetts and Winthrop, Maine are named in his honor. Winthrop House at Harvard University and Winthrop Hall at Bowdoin College are named in honor of him and of his descendant John Winthrop, who briefly served as President of Harvard.\n\nHe is also the namesake of squares in Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline. The Winthrop Building on Water Street in Boston was built on the site of one of his homes and is one of the city's first skyscrapers.\n\nA statue of Winthrop by Richard Greenough is one of Massachusetts' two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, Capitol in Washington D.C..\n\n\n"}
{"id": "668027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=668027", "title": "José Ortega y Gasset", "text": "José Ortega y Gasset\n\nJosé Ortega y Gasset (; 9 May 1883 – 18 October 1955) was a Spanish philosopher, and essayist. He worked during the first half of the 20th century, while Spain oscillated between monarchy, republicanism, and dictatorship. His philosophy has been characterized as a \"philosophy of life\" that \"comprised a long-hidden beginning in a pragmatist metaphysics inspired by William James, and with a general method from a realist phenomenology imitating Edmund Husserl, which served both his proto-existentialism (prior to Martin Heidegger's) and his realist historicism, which has been compared to both Wilhelm Dilthey and Benedetto Croce.\"\n\nJosé Ortega y Gasset was born 9 May 1883 in Madrid. His father was director of the newspaper \"El Imparcial\", which belonged to the family of his mother, Dolores Gasset. The family was definitively of Spain's end-of-the-century liberal and educated bourgeoisie. The liberal tradition and journalistic engagement of his family had a profound influence in Ortega y Gasset's activism in politics.\n\nOrtega was first schooled by the Jesuit priests of San Estanislao in Miraflores del Palo, Málaga (1891–1897). He attended the University of Deusto, Bilbao (1897–98) and the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the Central University of Madrid (now Complutense University of Madrid) (1898–1904), receiving a doctorate in Philosophy. From 1905 to 1907, he continued his studies in Germany at Leipzig, Nuremberg, Cologne, Berlin and, above all Marburg. At Marburg, he was influenced by the neo-Kantianism of Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp, among others.\n\nOn his return to Spain in 1908, he was appointed professor of Psychology, Logic and Ethics at the Escuela Superior del Magisterio de Madrid and in October 1910 he was named full professor of Metaphysics at Complutense University of Madrid, a vacant seat previously held by Nicolás Salmerón.\n\nIn 1917 he became a contributor to the newspaper \"El Sol\", where he published, as a series of essays, his two principal works: \"España invertebrada\" (\"Invertebrate Spain\") and \"La rebelión de las masas\" (\"The Revolt of the Masses\"). The latter made him internationally famous. He founded the \"\" in 1923, remaining its director until 1936. This publication promoted translation of (and commentary upon) the most important figures and tendencies in philosophy, including Oswald Spengler, Johan Huizinga, Edmund Husserl, Georg Simmel, Jakob von Uexküll, Heinz Heimsoeth, Franz Brentano, Hans Driesch, Ernst Müller, Alexander Pfänder, and Bertrand Russell.\n\nElected deputy for the Province of León in the constituent assembly of the Second Spanish Republic, he was the leader of a parliamentary group of intellectuals known as \"Agrupación al Servicio de la República\" (\"The Grouping at the Service of the Republic\"), which supported the platform of Socialist Republican candidates, but he soon abandoned politics, disappointed.\n\nLeaving Spain at the outbreak of the Civil War, he spent years of exile in Buenos Aires, Argentina until moving back to Europe in 1942. He settled in Portugal by mid-1945 and slowly began to make short visits to Spain. In 1948 he returned to Madrid, where he founded the Institute of Humanities, at which he lectured. Upon his return to Spain, he often privately expressed his hostility to the Franco regime, stating that the government did not deserve anyone's confidence and that his beliefs were \"incompatible with Franco.\"\n\n\"The Revolt of the Masses\" is Ortega's best known work. In this book he defends the values of meritocratic liberalism reminiscent of John Stuart Mill against attacks from both communists and right-wing populists. Ortega likewise shares Mill's fears of the \"tyranny of the majority\" and the \"collective mediocrity\" of the masses which threaten individuality, free thought, and protections for minorities. Ortega characterized liberalism as a politics of \"magnanimity.\"\n\nOrtega's rejection of the Spanish Conservative Party under Antonio Cánovas del Castillo and his successors was unequivocal, as was his distrust of the Spanish monarchy and Catholic Church. However, again in a manner similar to Mill, Ortega was open-minded toward certain socialists and non-Marxist forms of socialism, and even complimented Pablo Iglesias Posse as a \"lay saint.\" Under the influence of German social democrats such as Paul Natorp and Hermann Cohen, he adopted a communitarian ontology and could be critical of capitalism, particularly the laissez-faire variant, declaring that \"nineteenth-century capitalism has demoralized humanity\" and that it had \"impoverished the ethical consciousness of man.\"\n\nFor Ortega y Gasset, philosophy has a critical duty to lay siege to beliefs in order to promote new ideas and to explain reality. To accomplish such tasks, the philosopher must—as Husserl proposed—leave behind prejudices and previously existing beliefs, and investigate the essential reality of the universe. Ortega y Gasset proposes that philosophy must overcome the limitations of both idealism (in which reality centers around the ego) and ancient-medieval realism (in which reality is outside the subject) to focus on the only truthful reality: \"my life\"—the life of each individual. He suggests that there is no 'me' without things, and things are nothing without me: \"I\" (human being) cannot be detached from \"my circumstance\" (world). This led Ortega y Gasset to pronounce his famous maxim \"Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia\" (\"I am I and my circumstance\") (\"Meditaciones del Quijote\", 1914) which he always put at the core of his philosophy.\n\nFor Ortega y Gasset, as for Husserl, the Cartesian 'cogito ergo sum' is insufficient to explain reality. Therefore, the Spanish philosopher proposes a system wherein the basic or \"radical\" reality is \"my life\" (the first \"yo\"), which consists of \"I\" (the second \"yo\") and \"my circumstance\" (\"mi circunstancia\"). This \"circunstancia\" is oppressive; therefore, there is a continual dialectical interaction between the person and his or her circumstances and, as a result, life is a drama that exists between necessity and freedom.\n\nIn this sense Ortega y Gasset wrote that life is at the same time fate and freedom, and that freedom \"is being free inside of a given fate. Fate gives us an inexorable repertory of determinate possibilities, that is, it gives us different destinies. We accept fate and within it we choose one destiny.\" In this tied down fate we must therefore be active, decide and create a \"project of life\"—thus not be like those who live a conventional life of customs and given structures who prefer an unconcerned and imperturbable life because they are afraid of the duty of choosing a project.\n\nWith a philosophical system that centered around life, Ortega y Gasset also stepped out of Descartes' \"cogito ergo sum\" and asserted \"I live therefore I think\". This stood at the root of his Kantian-inspired perspectivism, which he developed by adding a non-relativistic character in which absolute truth does exist and would be obtained by the sum of all perspectives of all lives, since for each human being life takes a concrete form and life itself is a true radical reality from which any philosophical system must derive. In this sense, Ortega coined the terms \"razón vital\" (\"vital reason\" or \"reason with life as its foundation\") to refer to a new type of reason that constantly defends the life from which it has surged and \"raciovitalismo\", a theory that based knowledge in the radical reality of life, one of whose essential components is reason itself. This system of thought, which he introduces in \"History as System\", escaped from Nietzsche's vitalism in which life responded to impulses; for Ortega, reason is crucial to create and develop the above-mentioned project of life.\n\nFor Ortega y Gasset, vital reason is also \"historical reason\", for individuals and societies are not detached from their past. In order to understand a reality we must understand, as Dilthey pointed out, its history. In Ortega's words, humans have \"no nature, but history\" and reason should not focus on what \"is\" (static) but what \"becomes\" (dynamic).\n\nOrtega y Gasset's influence was considerable, not only because many sympathized with his philosophical writings, but also because those writings did not require that the reader be well-versed in technical philosophy.\n\nAmong those strongly influenced by Ortega y Gasset were Luis Buñuel, , , Xavier Zubiri, Ignacio Ellacuría, Emilio Komar, José Gaos, Luis Recasens, , Francisco Ayala, María Zambrano, , Máximo Etchecopar, Pedro Laín Entralgo, , Julián Marías, John Lukacs, Pierre Bourdieu, , Olavo de Carvalho, Vilém Flusser and Félix Martí-Ibáñez.\n\nThe Ortega hypothesis, based on a quote in \"The Revolt of the Masses\", states that average or mediocre scientists contribute substantially to the advancement of science.\n\nGerman grape breeder Hans Breider named the grape variety Ortega in his honor.\n\nThe American philosopher Graham Harman has recognized Ortega y Gasset as a source of inspiration for his own object-oriented ontology.\n\n\"La rebelión de las masas\" (\"The Revolt of the Masses\") has been translated into English twice. The first, in 1932, is by a translator who wanted to remain anonymous, generally accepted to be J.R. Carey.\nThe second translation was published by the University of Notre Dame Press in 1985, in association with W.W. Norton & Co. This translation was by Anthony Kerrigan (translator) and Kenneth Moore (editor), with an introduction by Saul Bellow.\n\nMildred Adams is the translator (into English) of the main body of Ortega's work, including \"Invertebrate Spain\", \"Man and Crisis\", \"What is Philosophy?\", \"Some Lessons in Metaphysics\", \"The Idea of Principle in Leibniz and the Evolution of Deductive Theory\", and \"An Interpretation of Universal History\".\n\nOrtega y Gasset had considerable influence on writers of the Generation of '27, a group of poets that arose in Spanish literature in the 1920s.\n\nMuch of Ortega y Gasset's work consists of course lectures published years after the fact, often posthumously. This list attempts to list works in chronological order by when they were written, rather than when they were published.\n\n\n\n"}

He remains famous for his short book, \"La Trahison des Clercs\" (\"The Treason of the Intellectuals\" or \"The Betrayal of the Intellectuals\"). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times and one time for the Goncourt Prize.\n\nBorn into a Jewish family in Paris, Benda became a master of French \"belles-lettres\". Yet he believed that science was superior to literature as a method of inquiry. He disagreed with Henri Bergson, the leading light of French philosophy of his day.\n\nBenda is now best remembered for his short 1927 book \"La Trahison des Clercs\", a work of considerable influence. It was translated into English in 1928 by Richard Aldington; the U.S. edition had the title \"The Treason of the Intellectuals\", while the British edition had the title \"The Great Betrayal.\" It was republished in 2006 as \"The Treason of the Intellectuals\" with a new introduction by Roger Kimball. This polemical essay argued that European intellectuals in the 19th and 20th century had often lost the ability to reason dispassionately about political and military matters, instead becoming apologists for crass nationalism, warmongering and racism. Benda reserved his harshest criticisms for his fellow Frenchmen Charles Maurras and Maurice Barrès. Benda defended the measured and dispassionate outlook of classical civilization, and the internationalism of traditional Christianity.\n\nClosing this work, Benda darkly predicts that the augmentation of the \"realistic\" impulse to domination of the material world justified by intellectuals into an \"integral realism\" risked producing an all-encompassing species-civilization which completely ceased \"to situate the good outside the real world\". Human aspirations, specifically after power, would become the sole end of society. In closing, bitterly, he concludes: \"And History will smile to think that this is the species for which Socrates and Jesus Christ died.\"\n\nOther works by Benda include \"Belphégor\" (1918), \"Uriel's Report\" (1926), and \"Exercises of a Man Buried Alive\" (1947), an attack on the contemporary French celebrities of his time. Most of the titles in the bibliography below were published during the last three decades of Benda's long life; he is emphatically a 20th-century author. Moreover, Benda survived the German occupation of France, 1940–1944, and the Vichy regime despite being a Jew and having called the Germans \"one of the plagues of the world\".\n\nHe died in Fontenay-aux-Roses.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1919 he was dismissed from vocational secondary school due to his sympathies with the Hungarian Soviet Republic. At the beginning of the 1920s, he took part in the illegal Communist movement for a few months.\n\nIn the first half of the 1920s, Lajos Szabó worked in Vienna and Budapest as a bookshop-assistant. Between 1928 and 1930 he became a member of the \"work circle\" of Lajos Kassák. He wrote two articles for the journal Munka. It was at this time that he got acquainted with Karl Korsch. Together with several other members of the Munkakör (Movement of Work), Lajos Szabó was expelled from this communist organisation. The secessionists called themselves the Hungarian movement of the opposition. This leftist, anti-capitalist and, at the same time, anti-Bolshevik social movement was also connected to the uncompromising Marxism of Karl Korsch\n\nIn 1930 Lajos Szabó got to know Béla Tábor with whom he had a close work relationship until the end of his life. Between 1931 and 1932, Lajos Szabó spent some months in Berlin and Frankfurt. He studied at the Institute for Social Research and in 1933 and 1934 he went on study tours to Vienna and to Paris.\n\nHe wrote \"Vádirat a szellem ellen\" (The Indictment of the Spirit) in 1936 together with Béla Tábor. In 1937 \"A hit logikája – Teocentrikus logika\" (The Logic of Faith: A Theocentric Logic) was published. The second part of this work was published only long after his death. Lajos Szabó wrote a number of studies that were published only after his death: \"Megjegyzések a marxizmus kritikájához\" [Remarks on the Critique of Marxism], \"A tudományos szocializmus bírálatához\" [A Contribution to the Critique of Scientific Socialism], \"A mammonizmus természetrajzához\" [On the Nature of Mammonism], \"Adalékok a halmazelmélet kérdéseihez\" [Contributions to the Theory of Sets], Nietzsche). \n\nA very important study by Lajos Szabó is \"Biblia és romantika\" (The Bible and Romanticism) which was written based on a lecture he gave in 1941.\n\nIn 1938 he married Magda Pallós who died in 1946. In 1940 he was called up for labour service, but a few weeks later he was dismissed from the army due to his tuberculosis. He was hospitalised at the New St John's Hospital in Budakeszi. His close friend Lajos Vajda was treated at the same hospital ward. In the spring of 1944 Szabó was deported to Auschwitz. He survived and returned home to Hungary at the end of 1945.\n\nLajos Szabó and Béla Tábor laid the foundations of the Budapest School of the Philosophy of the Dialogue in the post-war years. During these years they cooperated closely with Béla Hamvas, a writer and essayist and also with Lajos Fülep, an art historian. Lajos Szabó, Béla Tábor and Béla Hamvas came together regularly to discuss problems of philosophy and art theory, and their \"intellectual community\" came to be known as the \"Thursday Talks\". Stefánia Mándy, the wife of Béla Tábor and Katalin Kemény the wife of Béla Hamvas also took part in these conversations.\n\nLajos Szabó published two writings in 1946: Irodalom és rémület (Literature and Fright) \"Diárium\" and Művészet és vallás (Art and Religion) in \"Mouseion\". Between 1946 and 1948 he delivered lectures to young intellectuals. His talks included detailed value theoretical and value psychological analyses. In these lectures Lajos Szabó strove at a synthesis of the pre-philosophical situation (e.g. Indian tradition and the pre-Socratic philosophers) with the post-philosophical approach, i.e. the critique\nof philosophy, religion and art which is to be found in the works of the great figures of the 19th century, such as Søren Aabye Kierkegaard, Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche). \n\nLajos Szabó's thinking is closely related to the achievements of the philosophy of the dialogue as represented by Ferdinand Ebner, Franz Rosenzweig and Martin Buber, and he called himself also a \"language philosopher\". At the beginning of his lectures on value theory he pointed out that he identifies himself primarily with the Biblicism of Ferdinand Ebner, because he regards this approach basically unassailable, well-founded and as the one that goes furthest, although he believed that in important respects—primarily with regard to the evaluation of mathematics and art-- Biblicism has to be re-examined and also criticised.\n\nThe most active participants of the seminar lectures were Attila Kotányi and György Kunszt who also made written records of the lectures. The lectures covered the following topics: psychology, value and sign theory, economics, existentialism, the Indian traditions, theory of sets, the concept of language maths and prismatism. The printed version of these lectures could be published only after 1990, long after Szabó´s death.\nLajos Szabó participated actively in the activities of the Európai Iskola (European School), which was a neo-avantgarde group of visual artists and writers. From 1949 on, in the period of Stalinist dictatorship in Hungary, close relationships emerged between the then underground movement of the Budapest School of the Philosophy of the Dialogue and the banned avantgarde visual artists, especially those who were members of the European School.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s on, Lajos Szabó started to draw calligraphies. The year 1954 saw the creation of the first calligraphies which can be regarded to be \"meditations expressed through drawings\". After 1956 he left Hungary with his wife. He stayed in Vienna till the end of 1957 following which, till the end of 1961, he lived in Brussels. In 1960 Lajos Szabó travelled around West Germany, and his calligraphies were exhibited in Munich, Dortmund, Hamburg and Hagen. In 1962 he moved to Düsseldorf. In 1966 he had an exhibition in Paris. Lajos Szabó adopted the pseudonym \"AO\". On the one hand, this can be regarded as an ancronym formed from the adjective \"anti-organisational\", on the other hand, A and O were the vowels contained in his first and last names. For a period of time, he signed the calligraphies with \"AO\". Later, however, AO got transformed into a visual motif.\n\nLajos Szabó died on 21 October 1967 in Düsseldorf. His grave is in the Jewish cemetery of the town.\n\nAlthough the knowledge of Marxism and its ways of thinking were indeed present in Lajos Szabó's thinking, his main sources were existentialist thinkers in particular the twentieth-century philosophy of the dialogue represented by Franz Rosenzweig and, above all, Ferdinand Ebner (Das Wort and die geistigen Realitäten). \n\nThese are the most important topics in the writings of Lajos Szabó:\n\n\n\nHis most-cited work, written together with his close associate, Béla Tábor, is \"Vádirat a szellem ellen\" (Indictment of the Spirit) consists of three parts.\n\nThis book takes the whole of intellectual life to account: \"Someone should at last undertake performing the embarrassing task, and pull off the veil of innocence from the only factor which has remained intact so far in a world splintered along conflicting interests and characterised by the \"bellum omnium contra omnes\", the spirit. (…) We are aware that when we undertake revealing intellectual life we become traitors to the class of intelligentsia. The «creative intelligentsia» seems to have had a very good time in the position which it occupied in the invisible hierarchy of society. It was the social class which could accuse without being accused, which could pass judgements without being judged. (…) This is an elegant and risk-free position to take. Nations fought terrible battles, millions died and the spirit could be the accuser: come and behold the work of politicians! Masses live in abject poverty, classes lose the ground below their feet, the mechanism of production bogs down, and the spirit can assume the role of the accuser: come and behold the social structure! Terrible epidemics decimate whole peoples and sordid sins are revealed, and the spirit can become the accuser again: come and see today's health-care! And what if we also mentioned all the depraved standards of morality! And all the accusations brought up by the intelligentsia are accompanied by a gestures of being ignored: if only the spirit could assume power…!\"\n\nThe first part of the Indictment of the Spirit deals with the ongoing fragmentation of the spirit, which can be primarily seen in the arts and humanities. In this process language as a rational means of dialogue is ruined. The spirit renounces its leadership role, and pursues modest goals. This crisis can only be overcome if everyone who devotes their energies to researching a problem considers all the other proposed solutions to the problem as a personal challenge as a personal question addressed to them. The representatives of the spirit have to be aware of their own character traits, and also know, that in addition to influencing the masses, they themselves should learn from them.\n\nThe second part of this work deals with the practice and the theory of the spirit. The authors point out that the spirit has retreated into the theory, accepting at the same time the fact that practice has subjugated theory.\n\nThe third part of the book deals with the \"geography of the spirit\" The problem of Marxism, the authors point out, is that the objective of this movement, i.e. the creation of a new man, is not compatible with the dictatorial means whereby this objective is to be achieved. \nThe authors, followers of the philosophy of the dialogue, assert that the main cause of the crisis is the helplessness of the spirit.\n\nIn his review, Béla Hamvas pointed out that this book should be regarded an anthropological study. He finishes his evaluation with the following words: \"The real history of man is man's history of becoming godlike (…) Being a man means to have a fate, in which, in spite of errors and mistakes, there is always an opportunity for becoming godlike.\" This book review by Béla Hamvas, which at the time of its writing the publisher refused to publish because he thought the reviewer gave this work too much recognition, finishes with the highly topical, indeed poetic statement: \"Life becomes more and more difficult for man, because he knows more and more. And he who knows a lot, and does not live accordingly, points out Jan van Ruysbroek, is lost once and for all.\" \n\nIn the last stage of Szabó's life, a speculative graphic art played an important role. \"Szabó's genre within graphic art ist the abstract calligraphy (…) When calligraphy is substituted by abstract calligraphy, this means that the letters are substituted by signs and by the image. A religious person must have a great deal of courage to make this step towards abstraction. Lajos Szabó came to the recognition that signs, inspired by letters and replacing them, are the direct manifestations of the soul.\"\n\nLajos Szabó created his first calligraphies in 1954. \"The abstract line of the emerging works »is not the abstraction of something«. It is not the abstract reflection of something concrete in reality, but it is rather the primary reality. It is the sign, the reflection and the breakthrough of the growing soul, it is »non-representational« in a way defined by Malewitsch. It is an inventive, internal spiritual reality. The carrier of this reality is just the line. The manifestations of the line are the traces that the pencil or the pen leave on a sheet of paper.\n\nA meaningful number of calligraphies originating from the period preceding the end of 1956 was exhibited in 1980 in the Budapest Club of Young Artists. (The curators of the exhibition were Dániel Bíró and Botond Kocsis.) \n\nIn December 1957 Lajos Szabó's works were exhibited together with the works of Lajos Vajda, Endre Bálint, Attila Kotányi und Lyubomir Szabó in the Brussels Palais Des Beaux Arts. \n\nLajos Szabó's calligraphies are preserved in a number of non-Hungarian museums: Musée Royal, Brussels; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Rotterdam; Museum Kunstpalast, Düsseldorf; Staatliche Kunstsammlung Stuttgart; Sammlung Haubrich im Museum Ludwig Köln; Städtisches Kunstmuseum, Duisburg; Stiftung Lehmbruch Museum-Zentrum Internationalen Skulptur, Duisburg; Kunstmuseum Bochum Kunstsammlung. \n\nThe Berlin Calligraphy Collection in Berlin's Akademie der Künste has a total of 414 calligraphies by Lajos Szabó which were created before Szabó's emigration to the West. \n\n"}

{"id": "21911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21911", "title": "Naturism", "text": "Naturism\n\nNaturism, or nudism, is a cultural and political movement practicing, advocating, and defending personal and social nudity, most but not all of which takes place on private property. The term may also refer to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudism. Naturism may take a number of forms. It may be practiced individually, within a family, socially, or in public. Additionally, there is also militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism is sometimes considered a separate category.\n\nThe XIV Congress of the International Naturist Federation (Agde, France, 1974) defined naturism as:\n\nSeveral other terms (\"social nudity\", \"public nudity\", \"skinny dipping\", \"sunning\", and \"clothes-free\") have been proposed as alternative terms for naturism, but none has found the same widespread public acceptance as the older terms \"naturism\" and (in much of the United States) \"nudism\".\n\nPeople interested in social nudity can attend clothes-free beaches and other types of ad-hoc nudist events. At these venues, participants generally need not belong to a nudist club.\n\nMany contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations often oversimplify the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.\n\nThe International Naturist Federation explains:\n\nThe usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically. Though in the United States, naturism and nudism have the same meaning, in Britain there is a clear distinction.\n\nNudism is the \"act of being naked\", while naturism is a \"lifestyle\" which at various times embraced nature, environment, respect for others, self-respect, crafts, healthy eating, vegetarianism, teetotalism, non-smoking, yoga, physical exercise and pacifism as well as nudity.\n\nIn naturist parlance, \"textile\" or \"textilist\" is a non-naturist person, non-naturist behaviour or non-naturist facilities. e.g. \"the textile beach starts at the flag\", \"they are a mixed couple – he is naturist, she is textile\". \"Textile\" is the predominant term used in the UK ('textilist' is unknown in British naturist magazines including \"H&E naturist\"), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations. \"Textilist\" is said to be used interchangeably, but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for \"textile\". \"Clothing optional\" and \"nude optional\" (US specific) describe a policy or a venue that allows or encourages nudity but tolerates the wearing of clothes. The opposite is \"clothing compulsory\"; that is, prohibiting nudity. Adjectival phrases \"clothes free\" and \"clothing free\" prescribe where naturism is permitted in an otherwise textile environment, or define the preferred state of a naturist.\n\nThe social nudity movement includes a large range of variants including \"naturism\", \"nudism\", \"Freikörperkultur (FKK)\", the \"free beach movement\" as well as generalized \"public lands/public nudity\" advocacy. There is a large amount of shared history and common themes, issues and philosophy, but differences between these separate movements remain contentious.\n\nMany people are often nude in the privacy of their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists normally refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.\n\nA United States study by Alfred Kinsey (1948–1953) found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was \"seldom\" nudity in the home, 3% said \"often\", and 17% said that it was \"usual\". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.\nGordon and Schroeder in 1995 reported that parental nudity varies considerably from family to family. They say that \"there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them\", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They note that by ages 5 to 6 children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards.\n\nBarbara Bonner in 1999 cautioned against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.\n\nIn a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect. Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.\n\nSmith and Sparks in their study on the effects of social nudity on children conclude that \"the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign and totally harmless or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.\n\nThe rhetoric of the nudism and anti-nudism movements emphasizes freedom from many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.\n\nAt naturist organised events or venues clothing is usually optional, except by swimming pools or sunbathing lawns where complete nudity is expected, weather permitting. This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among some naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.\n\nFacilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' naturist club is one that owns its own facilities, while non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, and rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.\n\nSome clubs have stricter entrance requirements than some traditional 'country clubs', including the requirement to supply references, a sponsoring member, a trial membership, committee approval or, criminal background checks. UK clubs are now required to have child-protection policies in place, and designated child-protection officers. Many clubs promote frequent social activities.\n\nThe international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs. Nudist colony is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria, and in meta-data on naturist websites.\n\nA holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an INF card, that is, be a member of their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares. In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year. Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.\n\nA naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. Cap d'Agde in France, naturist village Charco del Palo on Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Vera Playa in Spain and Vritomartis in Greece are examples. Some residents use these resorts as a year-round home.\n\nIn US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre.\n\nFreikörperkultur (FKK) literally translated as 'free body culture' is the name for the general movement in Germany. The abbreviation is widely recognised all over Europe and often found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.\n\nClothing is optional at nude beaches (or \"free beaches\"). A feature of bathing on a nude beach is the anonymity it offers, with membership of a club not being required, nor detailed application processes, nor pre-booking of visits.\n\nIn some European countries, such as Denmark, all beaches are clothing optional, while in others like Germany and experimentally in France, there are naturist sunbathing areas in public parks, e.g., in Munich and Berlin. Beaches in some holiday destinations, such as Crete, are also clothing-optional, except some central urban beaches. There are two centrally located clothes-optional beaches in Barcelona.\n\nNaturism encourages a healthy life style, and many naturist clubs at times organize and encourage members to take part in local and international sport events and competitions. The German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK) promotes recreational sports and is a member of the German Olympic Sport Federation (DOSB).\n\nFrom Woodstock to Edinburgh, and Nambassa in the southern hemisphere communal nudity is commonly recorded at music and counterculture festivals.\n\nThe series of 1970s Nambassa hippie festivals held in New Zealand is a further example of non-sexualized naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3 day counterculture Festival an estimated 35% of festival attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing, preferring complete or partial nudity.'\n\nRoskilde festival in Denmark hosts a naked run, that has become one of the most popular events there.\n\nPerhaps nowadays the biggest and most famous festival where participants spontaneously decide to go naked or take part in nude events is Burning Man: it's got its own naked bike ride aka 'Naked Pub Crawl', and a few camps organize activities in the nude, including the famous oil wrestling by camp Gymnasium.\nFlorida Young Naturists has organized seasonal \"Bashes\" hosted by several Florida nudist/naturist clubs and resorts since 2008.\n\nOrganized by the Federación Nudista de México (Mexican Nudist Federation) since 2016 when Zipolite beach nudity was legalized, FESTIVAL NUDISTA ZIPOLITE occurs annually on the first weekend of February.\n\nNudist festivals are also held to celebrate particular days of the year, and in many such events nude bodypainting is also common, such as Neptune Day Festival held in Koktebel, Crimea to depict mythological events; the Solstice Cyclists nudist events celebrating the summer solstice held in Fremont, Seattle, United States; the Naked Pumpkin Run held in US to celebrate Halloween; and the World Naked Gardening Day held to celebrate gardening.\nThe prevalence of naturism tends to increase during the summer months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist. Some studies have observed that among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists. This quiddity has caught the public perception and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.\n\nNudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many cultures at all time periods. In Western society nowadays, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of bathing, swimming and in saunas, whether in single-sex groups, within the family or with mixed-sex friends, but throughout history and in many tropical cultures until now, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.\n\nIt is difficult to nominate exactly when naturism started as a movement. The word 'naturism' was used for the first time in 1778 by a French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734–1781), and was advocated as a means of improving the \"hygiène de vie\" or healthy living.\n\nThe earliest known naturist club in the \"western\" sense of the word was established in British India in 1891. The 'Fellowship of the Naked Trust' was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower, who was a District and Sessions Judge for the Bombay Civil Service. The commune was based in Matheran and had just three members at the beginning; Crawford and two sons of an Anglican missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood.\nThe commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to Ratnagiri; he died soon after in 1894.\n\nIn 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in Germany by Dr. Heinrich Pudor, under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term \"Nacktkultur\". In 1906 he went on to write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing. Richard Ungewitter (\"Nacktheit\", 1906, \"Nackt\", 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view. Major promoters of these ideas included Adolf Koch and Hans Suren. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.\n\nThe wide publication of those papers and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism, in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, \"Freilichtpark\" (Free-Light Park), was opened near Hamburg in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.\nIn 1919, German doctor Kurt Huldschinsky discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure rickets in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.\n\nIn France in the early 20th century, the brothers Gaston and André Durville, both of them physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept . The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.\n\nNaturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s, in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and other European countries and spread to the United States where it became established in the 1930s.\n\nBy 1951, the national federations united to form the International Naturist Federation or INF. Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure was put to designate beaches for naturist use.\nFrom the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same – or better – standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists. More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.\n\nNaturism had many different philosophical sources and means many things to different people. There is no one definition. In 1974, the INF defined naturism as:\n\nAt one end of the spectrum are the nudists who just enjoy a nude life style, and at the other are the naturists, who have deeply held beliefs and see communal nudity as just one of many important principles.\n\nThe naturist philosophy has several sources, many of which can be traced back to early 20th century health and fitness philosophies in Germany and England, although the concepts of returning to nature and creating equality have much deeper roots.\n\nIn the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great encountered, in India, wandering groups of naked holy men whom he dubbed the \"naked philosophers\". (\"Gr \"gymnos\": naked; \"sophist\": knowledge\"). The philosopher Onesicritus investigated their beliefs and lifestyle. Pyrrho the Sceptic was impressed and incorporated nudity into his philosophy. The Gymnosophists were Hindus, but Jain and Ajivika monks practiced nudity as a statement that they had given up all worldly goods. Nudity was not a new concept to the Greeks as the Olympic Games (founded in 776 BC) were exclusively male and nude events. \n\nHistorically, the Adamites, a Gnostic sect, practiced religious nudism.\nA religious sect in Canada that immigrated from Russia, the Sons of Freedom, went so far in the 1900s (1903-1950s) as to publicly strip in mass public demonstrations to protest against government policies which were meant to assimilate them. Today, Christian naturism contains various members associated with most denominations. Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the Garden of Eden, and God was displeased with Adam and Eve for covering their bodies with fig leaves.\n\nThe first English naturists adopted the name Gymnosophy as a thinly disguised euphemism for their pastime. The English Gymnosophical Society was formed in 1922 and became the New Gymnosophy Society in 1926; they purchased land at 'Bricketts Wood' to become Britain's first nudist colony. One of the first members was Gerald Gardner, who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club' nearby, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for Wiccans, as witchcraft was illegal in England until 1951.\n\nThe Digambar, one of the two main divisions of the Jain religion of India, remain skyclad, or naked, though generally it is practiced by males. Digambar means 'clothed with the sky'. Wiccans have adopted this wording and some practice their rituals skyclad.\n\n\nIndividuals have formed naturist groups for a variety of specific purposes. It is generally agreed by naturist organisations that eroticism and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, antithetical to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given:\n\n\nWalt Whitman American writer, A Sun-bathed Nakedness:\n\nHenry David Thoreau, \"In wildness is the preservation of the world.\", Walking:\n\nNaturism was part of a literary movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of André Gide) which also influenced the art movements of the time specifically Henri Matisse and other Fauve painters. This movement was based on the French concept of \"joie de vivre\", the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.\n\nSunlight has been shown to be beneficial in some skin conditions and enables the body to make vitamin D, but with the increased awareness of skin cancer, wearing of sunscreen is now part of the culture. Sun exposure prompts the body to produce nitric oxide that helps support the cardiovascular system and the feelgood brain-chemical serotonin.\n\nThere are also documented psychological benefits of naturist activities including greater life satisfaction, more positive body image, and higher self-esteem.\n\nThe World Naked Bike Ride (WNBR) is an international clothing-optional bike ride and exercise in public nudity, that has developed outside the organised naturism movement. Participants plan, meet and ride together \"en masse\" on human-powered transport (the vast majority on bicycles, but some on skateboards and inline skates), to \"deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world.\" The WNBR shares some aspects of the philosophy of naturism in that it promotes a return to healthy exercise in unpolluted air at the same time promoting positive body image.\n\n\n\nIn Finnish culture, nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than many other countries.\n\nIn 1903 la \"Revue des deux mondes\" published a report on German naturism and S. Gay created a naturist community at Bois-Fourgon. In 1907, supported by his superiors, Abbé Legrée encouraged the students at his Catholic college to bathe nude on the rocky beaches near Marseille.\n\nMarcel Kienné de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine \"Vivre intégralement\" (later called \"Vivre\") and the first French naturist club, \"Sparta Club\" at Garambouville, near Evreux. The court action that he initiated, established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.\n\nDrs. André and Gaston Durville bought a 70 hectare site on the Île du Levant where they established the village of Héliopolis. The village was open to the public. In 1925 Dr François Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on heliotherapy. and in that year opened the \"Club gymnique de France\". In 1936, the naturist movement was officially recognised.\n\nAlbert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but after disagreements left and In 1944 Albert and Christine Lecocq founded the \"Club du Soleil\" with members in 84 cities. In 1948 they founded the , in 1949 they started the magazine, \"Vie au Soleil\" and in 1950 opened the CHM Montalivet, the world's first naturist holiday centre where the INF was formed.\n\nThe naturist village Leucate and Cap d'Agde offers a different form of social nudity. Euronat is the largest holiday centre (335ha) situated 10 km north of Montalivet. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth 250 million Euro to the French economy. France is represented on the INF by the .\n\nGerman naturism was part of the Lebensreform movement and the Wandervogel youth movement of 1896, from Steglitz, Berlin which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the were using heliotherapy, treating diseases such as TB, rheumatism and scrofula with exposure to sunlight.\n\nNacktkultur, a term coined in 1903 by Heinrich Pudor, flourished. Nacktkultur connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform. It was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s as offering a health giving life-style with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal between 1902 and 1932.\nIt became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a breaking down of society. It became associated with pacificism.\n\nIn 1926, Adolf Koch established a school of naturism in Berlin; encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of \"sexual hygiene\". In 1929, the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.\n\nDuring the National Socialist \"Gleichschaltung\" era, all naturist clubs had to register with the \"Reichsbund für Leibesübungen\", which meant excluding Jews and Communists. Also, they had to keep all activities hidden in the countryside where there was little chance of being seen by others. The status as a West German \"sports federation\" member gave the clubs rights and privileges (e.g. tax exemptions) so the naturist clubs remained in the federation after the war had ended.\n\nAfter the war, East Germans were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations being regarded as potentially subversive). Naturism became a large element in DDR politics. The \"Proletarische Freikörperkulturbewegung\" subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60,000 members.\nToday, following reunification there are many clubs, parks and beaches open to naturists.\nthough nudity has become less common in the former eastern zone. Germans are typically the most commonly seen foreigners at nude beaches in France and around Europe.\n\nPublic nudity is prohibited in Greece and there are no official nude beaches. There are, however, numerous unofficial nude beaches especially on the islands frequented by tourists, like Crete, Mykonos or Karpathos but also on smaller islands like Skopelos or Skiathos where nudity is tolerated, usually at the more remote ends or secluded areas of beaches.\n\nPublic nudity is prohibited in Italy and can be punished with high fines, but in the recent decade, a few regions have created naturism laws to help the tourism industry. There are only a few permitted nude beaches in those regions, where nudity is allowed without risking legal consequences. On all other public beaches in Italy as well as normally tolerated nude beaches, police can potentially impose substantial fines.\n\nFirst reported naturist society was established in 1897 in Grudziądz. In pre-war and post-war Poland, naturism was practised in closed and secluded areas. Reported places for naturism were Zaleszczyki (in today's Ukraine) and Otwock. Under the communism regime, Poland's naturism became unofficial and was practiced mostly by the artistic boheme near Krynica Morska, Misdroy and Dębki.\n\nIn the early 1980s naturism became popular mostly due to increased interest in media. As the pop song \"Chałupy Welcome To\" (about the naturist beach in Chałupy, featuring beach nudity in the clip) became the 1985 summer hit in Poland, the nude seaside locations like Chałupy or Rowy became known to an average Polish sunbather. Polish Naturist Society was formed and after the number of lawsuits, naturism became tolerated in selected \"unofficial\" beaches and distant spots.\n\nIn today's Poland naturism is practiced in number of the seaside and inland beaches. Most Polish beaches are actually clothes-optional rather than naturist. Among the most popular locations are Misdroy-Lubiewo, Grzybowo, Rowy, Dębki, Gdańsk-Stogi and Piaski. The most popular inland locations include Warsaw (Wał Miedzeszyński), Kazimierz Dolny and Kryspinów near Kraków. In the winter season, naturism is practiced by organized groups in Warsaw and Tri-City. Public naturist events are held bi-monthly in Poznań-Koziegłowy and Łódź waterpark.\n\nNaturism in Portugal had its first historical record around 1920, linked to the Portuguese Naturist Society, of which the anarcho-syndicalist José Peralta was a prominent member. Nudity was already being practiced on Costa da Caparica beaches. With the beginning of the New State authoritarian regime in the 1930s, the naturist movement was limited to vegetarian and alternative medicines, since nudity was banned and associated to the crime of \"indecency\". Only after the end of the New State regime in 1974 (April, 25th) the activities linked to the practice of nudity were resumed.\n\nThe \"Federação Portuguesa de Naturismo\" (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on the March 1st, 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon.\n\nAt the present, there are seven official naturist beaches in Portugal. Besides these, there are several dozens of beaches were the practice of naturism is common. There are also several naturist campings and resorts.\n\nBeginnings of naturism in Slovenia started in the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss physician Arnold Rikli visited Bled for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light to be the source for his healing therapy. He continued to build spa centers which included light therapy and hydrotherapy treatment. His first visitors were most likely pilgrims from Slovenia and Friuli-Venezia Giulia region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spread across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used in the healing therapy process included sunbathing and visitors were often seen walking nude in public. Rikli continued to promote his healing tourism for the next 52 years, when he lived in Bled.\n\nPublic nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation. However, people do not normally use this right to be naked to do it anywhere, and most usually perform this activity in places where nudism is a tradition.\n\nThere are however some municipalities (like San Pedro del Pinatar) where public nudity has been regulated (banned) by means of by-laws. Other municipalities (like Barcelona, Salou, Platja de Palma and Sant Antoni de Portmany) have also used these provisions to regulate the practice of semi-nudism, forcing people to cover their torso on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right (freedom of expression, as they understand that nudism is a way of self-expression) cannot be regulated with this mechanism. Some judicial instances have ruled in favour of nudist associations.\n\nNudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition on naturism. In Vera (Andalusia), there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations that constitute some kind of nudist town. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory (like hiking on the mountains close to Madrid), but these kind of activities are negligible. Madrid municipality enables nudist use of some of their public swimming pools one day during summer.\n\nTextile use of traditionally nudist public spaces (like beaches or streets nearby) is allowed, mainly due to lack of regulation. Mixed groups of nudist and textile individuals are frequent in these kind of spaces. In order to chase voyeuristic persons away, nudist people will normally clap their hands.\n\nLegal aspects regarding topless are analogue to those regarding nudism, but social tolerance towards topless is higher. This let people not cover their breasts in public swimming pools and on any beach in Spain.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the first official nudist club was established in Wickford, Essex in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for British Naturism the club adopted the name \"Moonella Group\" from the name of the owner of the ground, \"Moonella\", and called its site The Camp. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the New Gymnosophy Society. This society had been founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the English Gymnosophical Society. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 High Holborn in London, the headquarters of the Women's Freedom League. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an \"aristocracy\" of the original members, all of whom had \"club names\" to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of building on adjacent land.\nBy 1943 there were a number of these so-called \"sun clubs\" and together they formed the British Sun Bathers Association or BSBA. In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split off to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist. The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the Central Council for British Naturism or CCBN. This organisation structure has remained much the same but it is now called British Naturism which is often abbreviated to BN. BN is currently a company limited by guarantee.\n\nThe first official nude beach was opened at Fairlight Glen in Covehurst Bay near Hastings in 1978 (not to be confused with Fairlight Cove, which is 2 km to the east) followed later by the beaches at Brighton and Fraisthorpe. Bridlington opened in April 1980.\n\nIn Canada, individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, \"Sunbathing & Health\", which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land. The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC., and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.\n\nCanadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.\n\nMost of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation – Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.\n\nIn 1977 the Fédération québécoise de naturisme (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Vaïs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the Federation of Canadian Naturists (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the FQN-FCN Union as the official Canadian representative in the International Naturist Federation (INF).\n\nIn 1925, Katherine and Herman Shoshinki were familiar with nudism from Germany from 1918 to 1923. Kurt Barthel founded the American League for Physical Culture in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the American Gymnosophical Association. Barthel founded America's first official nudist camp, Sky Farm in New Jersey, in May, 1932. Around 1932, AGA established the Rock Lodge Club as a nudist facility in Stockholm, New Jersey and Ilsley Boone, a Dutch Reformed minister, formed the Christian naturism movement. Naturism began expanding nationwide. Nudism venues were teetotal until 1970,\n\nThe American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) is the national naturist organization. Arnd Krüger compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects (\"Zuchtwahl\") were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties. The AANR withdrew from the INF in 2010.\n\nIn 2008, a young adults group organized as Florida Young Naturists held their first Naked Bash which has since been repeated 3-4 times a year, growing into one of the largest young naturist gatherings in the world.\n\nIn 2009, a campaign to promote Nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by AANR to record the largest simultaneous Skinny Dip at several U.S. Clubs and beaches, occurring on July 11 of that year.\n\nIn 2010, A new organization formed called Young Naturists and Nudists America which was mostly focused around the younger generation as well as social issues, such as body image. Young Naturists and Nudists America closed in 2017.\n\nIn 2014, an organization called Unconstitutional Arkansas was created to highlight the unconstitutionality of laws that prohibit or impede nudism. The organization uses Arkansas law § 5-68-204 as a case study, but claims all anti-nudism laws infringe the constitutional right to assemble.\n\nBeach nudity in Playa Zipolite is legal. Elsewhere, Mexican law condemns only \"immorality\" and thus the issue ends up being a matter of the judge's discretion. Private libertine or lifestyle type resorts exist in Mexico that might not be characterized as naturist (see List of social nudity places in North America#Mexico).\n\nAs of 2016, Playa Zipolite is Mexico's first and only legal public nude beach. A \"free beach\" and unofficially nudist for more than 30 years, this beach is reputed to be the best place for nudism in the country. The numerous nudists, and the long tradition, make it safe for nudism and naturism. Annually since 2016, on the first weekend of February, Zipolite has hosted Festival Nudista Zipolite organized by the Federación Nudista de México.\n\nHotel Nude is Zipolite's first nude-optional resort/hotel. Intima Resort is another clothing optional resort in Tulum, Mexico.\n\nGenerally, public nudity in Asia is not tolerated. However, some traditional, religious or cultural nudity has survived the introduction of Western moral values against nudity, such as the Jain Digambara monks in India, hot springs in Taiwan and Japan, and some traditional tribes in Papua. Nudism and naked recreation is slowly developing in some countries, mainly Indonesia (Bali) and Thailand. Nudists meet on the internet (e.g. Bareskinasia.com) and organize activities in remote or private locations. Several nudists also have their own blogs.\n\nIn the seventies, nudity on Bali's remote and deserted beaches was common but with the massive growth of tourism, this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in Seminyak that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added from two more swimming pools.\n\nNudism is considered taboo in Nepal. Although there are no laws governing nudism, people may be detained, arrested and fined for public nudity. Nevertheless, many Hindu male sages practice nudism and they are not legally detained. Nudist sages can be seen in Pashupatinath.\n\nNudism was successfully introduced 10 years ago in Pattaya (Chan Resort), and six more nudist resorts have been created all over Thailand. Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Huay Yai, and Family Naturist Camp in Petchaburi all belong to the Naturist Association of Thailand as well as other international naturist organizations. A gay hotel and sauna (Sansuk Hotel) located in Pattaya now also authorizes nudity in and around the swimming pool.\n\nNaturism addresses, challenges and explores a myriad of sometimes taboo subjects: stereotypes and mores relating to the nude appearance of the human body, mixed sex nudity, personal space, human sexuality, gymnophobia, modesty, physical attractiveness, vanity, objectification, exploitation and consent. It can thus be controversial. Descamps assembled a list of criticisms of naturism: it is too cold; normal bodies look ugly—it is only for the physically beautiful; it is too embarrassing; it is against the laws of nature, against the law, or against religion; \"nudism makes me think of sex\"; it is for primitive people or animals.\n\nNaturism can sometimes contain aspects of eroticism, although the debate about this is often simplified and seen negatively in the media and the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.\n\nSmith states This statement is in response to the quote \"The world of naturism is in trouble. Membership is falling, and fewer young people than ever are getting involved. Has the great nude adventure run its course? \"\n\nSmith and King pose the further points in their 2009 peer reviewed paper \"Naturism and Sexuality:broadening our approach to sexual wellbeing \"\n\nMany countries and states have laws which adversely affect naturists. Oftentimes, these laws are intended to address \"indecent exposure\", but are so broadly written that they criminalize ordinary, non-sexual nudity. Some laws, however, specifically target naturism. For example, in Arkansas in the United States, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to \"promote\" or \"advocate\" (i.e. express a favourable opinion about) nudism.\n\nAny social group is said to go through four phases:\nforming, storming, norming, performing, wrote Bruce Tuckman in 1965. In this context one can understand some of the current pressures on various aspects of naturism:\n\n\nMagazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped:\n\n\nMagazines in the second and, occasionally, third grouping feature naturist editorial and advertising, while some naturists argue over which magazines belonged in which of these categories – these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefitted from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it. (These days, the information and advertising provided online, and the wide availability of free online porn, has meant the disappearance of old-style 'skin' magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as or alongside naturist content. Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed – they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour.)\nSome naturists still feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.\n\nSome naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media as the norm.\n\nSome commercial 'naturist' DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children.

{"id": "100390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100390", "title": "Opus Dei", "text": "Opus Dei\n\nOpus Dei, formally known as The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei (), is an institution of the Roman Catholic Church which teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity. The majority of its membership are lay people; the remainder are secular priests under the governance of a prelate elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope. \"Opus Dei\" is Latin for \"Work of God\"; hence the organization is often referred to by members and supporters as \"the Work\".\n\nOpus Dei was founded in Spain in 1928 by Catholic saint and priest Josemaría Escrivá and was given final Catholic Church approval in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. St. John Paul II made it a personal prelature in 1982 by the apostolic constitution \"Ut sit\"; that is, the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei wherever they are, rather than geographical dioceses.\n\nAs of 2016, there were 94,776 members of the Prelature: 92,667 lay persons and 2,109 priests. These figures do not include the diocesan priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005. Members are in more than 90 countries. About 70% of Opus Dei members live in their private homes, leading traditional Catholic family lives with secular careers, while the other 30% are celibate, of whom the majority live in Opus Dei centers. Aside from their personal charity and social work, Opus Dei members organize training in Catholic spirituality applied to daily life; members are involved in running universities, university residences, schools, publishing houses, hospitals, and technical and agricultural training centers.\n\nOpus Dei was founded by a Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he experienced a vision in which he \"saw Opus Dei\". He gave the organization the name \"Opus Dei\", which in Latin means \"Work of God\", in order to underscore the belief that the organization was not his (Escrivá's) work, but was rather God's work. Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character. Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians \"to understand that their life... is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice.\"\n\nInitially, Opus Dei was open only to men, but in 1930, Escrivá started to admit women, based on what he believed to be a communication from God. In 1936, the organization suffered a temporary setback with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, as many Catholic priests and religious figures, including Escrivá, were forced into hiding (the Catholic Church actively supported the Nationalist-Fascist rebels). The many atrocities committed during the civil war included the murder and rape of religious figures by anti-Franco Anarchists. After the civil war was won by General Francisco Franco, Escrivá was able to return to Madrid. Escrivá himself recounted that it was in Spain where Opus Dei found \"the greatest difficulties\" because of traditionalists who he felt misunderstood Opus Dei's ideas. Despite this, Opus Dei flourished during the years of the Franquismo, spreading first throughout Spain, and after 1945, expanding internationally.\n\nIn 1939, Escrivá published \"The Way\", a collection of 999 maxims concerning spirituality for people involved in secular affairs. In the 1940s, Opus Dei found an early critic in the Jesuit Superior General Wlodimir Ledóchowski, who told the Vatican that he considered Opus Dei \"very dangerous for the Church in Spain,\" citing its \"secretive character\" and calling it \"a form of Christian Masonry.\"\n\nIn 1947, a year after Escrivá moved the organization's headquarters to Rome, Opus Dei received a decree of praise and approval from Pope Pius XII, making it an institute of \"pontifical right\", i.e. under the direct governance of the Pope. In 1950, Pius XII granted definitive approval to Opus Dei, thereby allowing married people to join the organization, and secular clergy to be admitted to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross.\n\nIn 1975, Escriva died and was succeeded by Álvaro del Portillo. In 1982, Opus Dei was made into a personal prelature. This means that Opus Dei is part of the universal Church, and the apostolate of the members falls under the direct jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei wherever they are. As to \"what the law lays down for all the ordinary faithful\", the lay members of Opus Dei, being no different from other Catholics, \"continue to be ... under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop\", in the words of John Paul II's \"Ut Sit\". In 1994, Javier Echevarria became Prelate upon the death of his predecessor.\n\nOne-third of the world's bishops sent letters petitioning for the canonization of Escrivá. Escriva was beatified in 1992 in the midst of controversy prompted by questions about Escriva's suitability for sainthood. In 2002, approximately 300,000 people gathered in St. Peter's Square on the day Pope John Paul II canonized Josemaría Escrivá. According to one author, \"Escrivá is... venerated by millions\".\n\nThere are other members whose process of beatification has been opened: Ernesto Cofiño, a father of five children and a pioneer in pediatric research in Guatemala; Montserrat Grases, a teenage Catalan student who died of cancer; Toni Zweifel, a Swiss engineer; Tomás Alvira and wife, Paquita Domínguez, a Spanish married couple; Isidoro Zorzano Ledesma, an Argentinian engineer; Dora del Hoyo, a domestic worker; and Father José Luis Múzquiz de Miguel.\n\nDuring the pontificate of John Paul II, two members of Opus Dei, Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne and Julián Herranz Casado, were made cardinals.\n\nIn September 2005, Pope Benedict XVI blessed a newly installed statue of Josemaría Escrivá placed in an outside wall niche of St Peter's Basilica, a place for founders of Catholic organizations.\n\nDuring that same year, Opus Dei received some unwanted attention due to the extraordinary success of the novel \"The Da Vinci Code\", in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.\n\nIn 2014, Pope Francis through a delegate beatified Alvaro del Portillo and said that \"he teaches us that in the simplicity and ordinariness of our life we can find a sure path to holiness.\n\nAt the end of 2014, the prelature has been established in 69 countries, while its members are present in 90 countries.\n\nBishop Echevarría died on 12 December 2016, and was succeeded by Msgr. Fernando Ocáriz. He was elected the new prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017, and on the same day was appointed by Pope Francis as such.\n\nOpus Dei is an organization of the Catholic Church. As such, it shares the doctrines of the Catholic Church and has \"no other teaching than the teaching of the Magisterium of the Holy See\", as per the founder.\n\nOpus Dei places special emphasis on certain aspects of Catholic doctrine. A central feature of Opus Dei's theology is its focus on the lives of the ordinary Catholics who are neither priests nor monks. Opus Dei emphasizes the \"universal call to holiness\": the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint, as per Jesus' commandment to \"Love God with all your heart\" () and \"Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.\" () Opus Dei also teaches that sanctity is within the reach of everyone, not just a few special individuals, given Jesus' teaching that his demands are \"easy\" and \"light,\" as his divine assistance is assured. ()\n\nOpus Dei does not have monks or nuns, and only a minority of its members are priests. Opus Dei emphasizes uniting spiritual life with professional, social, and family life. Members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives, with traditional families and secular careers, and strive to \"sanctify ordinary life\". Indeed, Pope John Paul II called Escrivá \"the saint of ordinary life\".\n\nSimilarly, Opus Dei stresses the importance of work and professional competence. While some religious institutes encourage their members to withdraw from the material world, Opus Dei exhorts its members and all lay Catholics to \"find God in daily life\" and to perform their work excellently as a service to society and as a fitting offering to God. Opus Dei teaches that work not only contributes to social progress but is \"a path to holiness\", and its founder advised people to: \"Sanctify your work. Sanctify yourself in your work. Sanctify others through your work.\"\n\nThe biblical roots of this Catholic doctrine, according to the founder, are in the phrase \"God created man to work\" (Gen 2:15) and Jesus's long life as an ordinary carpenter in a small town. Escrivá, who stressed the Christian's duty to follow Christ's example, also points to the gospel account that Jesus \"has done everything well\" (Mk 7:37).\n\nThe foundation of the Christian life, stressed Escrivá, is \"divine filiation\": Christians are children of God, identified with Christ's life and mission. Other main features of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are: \"freedom\", respecting choice and taking personal responsibility; and \"charity\", love of God above all and love of others.\n\nAt the bottom of Escrivá's understanding of the \"universal call to holiness\" are two dimensions, subjective and objective, according to Fernando Ocariz, a Catholic theologian and Prelate of Opus Dei since 2017. The subjective is the call given to each person to become a saint, regardless of his place in society. The objective refers to what Escrivá calls Christian materialism: all of creation, even the most material situation, is a meeting place with God, and leads to union with Him.\n\nDifferent qualifiers have been used to describe Opus Dei's doctrine: radical, reactionary, faithful, revolutionary, ultraconservative, most modern, conservative, and liberal.\n\nAll members – whether married or unmarried, priests or laypeople – are trained to follow a 'plan of life', or 'the norms of piety', which are some traditional Catholic devotions. This is meant to follow the teaching of the Catholic Catechism: \"pray at specific times...to nourish continual prayer,\" which in turn is based on Jesus' \"pray at all times\" (), echoed by St. Paul's \"pray without ceasing\" (). According to Escriva, the vocation to Opus Dei is a calling to be a \"contemplative in the middle of the world,\" who converts work and daily life into prayer.\n\n\"Daily norms:\" \n\n\n\"Weekly norms:\"\n\nAdditionally, members should participate yearly in a spiritual retreat; a three-week seminar every year is obligatory for numeraries, and a one-week seminar for supernumeraries. Also members are expected to make a day-trip pilgrimage where they recite 3 5-decade rosaries on the month of May in honor of Mary.\n\nMuch public attention has focused on Opus Dei's practice of mortification—the voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to God; this includes fasting, or for some of its members self-inflicted pain such as self-flagellation. Mortification has a long history in many world religions, including the Catholic Church. It has been endorsed by Popes as a way of following Christ, who died in a bloody crucifixion and who speaking of anybody that sought to be his disciple: \"let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me.\" (Lk 9:23) Supporters say that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost (1) the \"sense of the enormity of sin\" or offense against God, and the consequent penance, both interior and exterior, (2) the notions of \"wounded human nature\" and of concupiscence or inclination to sin, and thus the need for \"spiritual battle,\" and (3) a spirit of sacrifice for love and \"supernatural ends,\" and not only for physical enhancement.\n\nAs a spirituality for ordinary people, Opus Dei focuses on performing sacrifices pertaining to normal duties and to its emphasis on charity and cheerfulness. Additionally, Opus Dei celibate members practice \"corporal mortifications\" such as sleeping without a pillow or sleeping on the floor, fasting, and remaining silent for certain hours during the day.\n\nIn Pope John Paul II's 1982 decree known as the Apostolic constitution \"Ut Sit\", Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature, a new official structure of the Catholic Church, similar to a diocese in that it contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop. However, whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese, the prelate of Opus Dei is pastor to the members and priests of Opus Dei worldwide, no matter what diocese they are in. To date, Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in existence. In addition to being governed by \"Ut Sit\" and by the Catholic Church's general law, Opus Dei is governed by the Church's Particular Law concerning Opus Dei, otherwise known as Opus Dei's statutes. This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the Congregation for Bishops.\n\nThe head of the Opus Dei prelature is known as the Prelate. The Prelate is the primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils—the General Council (made up of men) and the Central Advisory (made up of women). The Prelate holds his position for life. The current prelate of Opus Dei is Msgr. Fernando Ocáriz Braña, who became the third Prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017. The first Prelate of Opus Dei was Álvaro del Portillo, who held the position from 1982 until his death in 1994.\n\nOpus Dei's highest assembled bodies are the General Congresses, which are usually convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses for the men and women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.\n\nBased on the language of Catholic Church law and theology, the prelature calls the people under the pastoral care of the prelate as \"faithful of the prelature\", since the term member connotes an association rather than a hierarchical structure such as a prelature or a diocese.\n\nAs of 2016, the faithful of the Opus Dei Prelature numbered 94,776 members, of which 92,667 are lay persons, men and women, and 2,109 priests. These figures do not include the priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of Opus Dei faithful reside in Europe, and 35 per cent reside in the Americas. Women comprise 57% of total membership. According to the study of John Allen, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle to low levels in society, in terms of education, income, and social status.\n\nOpus Dei is made up of several different types of faithful. According to the Statutes of Opus Dei, the distinction derives from the degree to which they make themselves available for the official activities of the Prelature and for giving formation according to the spirit of Opus Dei. \n\nSupernumeraries, the largest type, currently account for about 70% of the total membership. Typically, supernumeraries are married men and women with careers. Supernumeraries devote a portion of their day to prayer, in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats. Due to their career and family obligations, supernumeraries are not as available to the organization as the other types of faithful, but they typically contribute financially to Opus Dei, and they lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit.\n\nNumeraries, the second largest type of the faithful of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership. Numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in \"full availability\" (plena disponibilitas) for the official undertakings of the Prelature. This includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the regional directors, and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the Prelate. Because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever needs to be done for the undertakings of the Prelature, numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs. \"Numerary\" is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. Therefore in order to maintain a family atmosphere in the centers (rather than an institutional one), it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and \"get-togethers\" in which they converse and share news. Both men and women may become numeraries in Opus Dei, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated. Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time and many modify the way that they go about their professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. They devote the bulk of their income to the organization.\n\nNumerary assistants are a type of numerary that exists in the Women's Branch of Opus Dei. Their full availability for the Prelature is lived out as full availability for doing a specific type of work, namely looking after the domestic needs of the conference centers and the residential centers of Opus Dei. Hence they live in special centers run by Opus Dei and do not have jobs outside the centers.\n\nAssociates are celibate faithful who make themselves fully available to God and to others in apostolic celibacy, and stably take on at least one (sometimes more) apostolic assignment(s) from the Prelature in giving doctrinal and ascetical formation and/or coordinating activities. They differ from numeraries in not making themselves \"fully\" available to staff the official undertakings of the Prelature, instead giving themselves in additional social realities, such as through their profession or to their own families. Because of this difference in availability for the official activities of Opus Dei, unlike numeraries the associates do not live in Opus Dei centers but maintain their own abodes. Some of their family life (emotional and social support) comes from the centers of Opus Dei, some from other associates of Opus Dei, and some from their personal families and friends; the precise ratio of this distribution depends upon the circumstances of the individual associate. \n\nThe Clergy of the Opus Dei Prelature are priests who are under the jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei. They are a minority in Opus Dei—only about 2% of Opus Dei members are part of the clergy. Typically, they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood.\n\nThe consists of priests associated with Opus Dei. Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature—priests who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society. Other members in the society are diocesan priests—clergymen who remain under the jurisdiction of a geographically defined diocese. These priests are considered full members of Opus Dei who are given its spiritual training. They do not however report to the Opus Dei Prelate but to their own diocesan bishop. As of 2005, there were roughly two thousand of these priests.\n\nThe Cooperators of Opus Dei are non-members who collaborate in some way with Opus Dei—usually through praying, charitable contributions, or by providing some other assistance. Cooperators are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements. Indeed, cooperators are not even required to be Christian. There were 164,000 cooperators in the year 2005.\n\nIn accordance with Catholic theology, membership is granted when a vocation, or divine calling is presumed to have occurred.\n\nLeaders of Opus Dei describe the organization as a teaching entity whose main activity is to train Catholics to assume personal responsibility in sanctifying the secular world from within. This teaching is done by means of theory and practice.\n\nIts lay people and priests organize seminars, workshops, retreats, and classes to help people put the Christian faith into practice in their daily lives. Spiritual direction, one-on-one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest, is considered the \"paramount means\" of training. Through these activities they provide religious instruction (doctrinal formation), coaching in spirituality for lay people (spiritual formation), character and moral education (human formation), lessons in sanctifying one's work (professional formation), and know-how in evangelizing one's family and workplace (apostolic formation).\n\nThe official Catholic document which established the prelature states that Opus Dei strives \"to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work.\" Thus, the founder and his followers describe members of Opus Dei as resembling the members of the early Christian Church—ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens.\n\nOpus Dei runs residential centers throughout the world. These centers provide residential housing for celibate members, and provide doctrinal and theological education. Opus Dei is also responsible for a variety of non-profit institutions called \"Corporate Works of Opus Dei\". A study of the year 2005, showed that members have cooperated with other people in setting up a total of 608 social initiatives: schools and university residences (68%), technical or agricultural training centers (26%), universities, business schools and hospitals (6%). The University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain or the Austral University in Buenos Aires, Argentina are both examples of the corporate work of Opus Dei. These universities usually perform very high in international rankings. IESE, the University of Navarra's Business School, was adjudged one of the best in the world by the \"Financial Times\" and the \"Economist Intelligence Unit\". The total assets of non-profits connected to Opus Dei are worth at least $2.8 billion.\n\nLeopoldo Eijo y Garay, the bishop of Madrid where Opus Dei was born, supported Opus Dei and defended it in the 1940s by saying that \"this \"opus\" is truly \"Dei\"\" (this work is truly God's). Contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy, the bishop described Opus Dei's founder as someone who is \"open as a child\" and \"most obedient to the Church hierarchy\".\n\nIn the 1950s, Pope Pius XII told the most senior Australian bishop, Cardinal Norman Gilroy that Escrivá \"is a true saint, a man sent by God for our times\". Pius XII gave Opus Dei the canonical status of \"pontifical right\", an institution depending directly and exclusively on the Vatican in its internal governance.\n\nIn 1960, Pope John XXIII commented that Opus Dei opens up \"unsuspected horizons of apostolate\". Furthermore, in 1964, Pope Paul VI praised the organization in a handwritten letter to Escrivá, saying:\n\nOpus Dei is \"a vigorous expression of the perennial youth of the Church, fully open to the demands of a modern apostolate... We look with paternal satisfaction on all that Opus Dei has achieved and is achieving for the kingdom of God, the desire of doing good that guides it, the burning love for the Church and its visible head that distinguishes it, and the ardent zeal for souls that impels it along the arduous and difficult paths of the apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life.\"\nThe relationship between Paul VI and Opus Dei, according to Alberto Moncada, a doctor of sociology and ex-member, was \"stormy\". After the Second Vatican Council concluded in 1965, Pope Paul VI denied Opus Dei's petition to become a personal prelature, Moncada stated.\n\nPope John Paul I, a few years before his election, wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the universal call to holiness. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escrivá \"it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity\", thus providing a lay spirituality.\n\nCriticisms against Opus Dei have prompted Catholic scholars and writers like Piers Paul Read and Vittorio Messori to call Opus Dei a sign of contradiction, in reference to the biblical quote of Jesus as a \"sign that is spoken against\". Said John Carmel Heenan, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster: \"One of the proofs of God's favor is to be a sign of contradiction. Almost all founders of societies in the Church have suffered. Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer is no exception. Opus Dei has been attacked and its motives misunderstood. In this country and elsewhere an inquiry has always vindicated Opus Dei.\"\n\nOne of Opus Dei's most prominent supporters was Pope John Paul II. John Paul II cited Opus Dei's aim of sanctifying secular activities as a \"great ideal.\" He emphasized that Escrivá's founding of Opus Dei was \"ductus divina inspiratione,\" led by divine inspiration, and he granted the organization its status as a personal prelature. Stating that Escrivá is \"counted among the great witnesses of Christianity,\" John Paul II canonized him in 2002, and called him \"the saint of ordinary life.\" Of the organization, John Paul II said:\n\n[Opus Dei] has as its aim the sanctification of one's life, while remaining within the world at one's place of work and profession: to live the Gospel in the world, while living immersed in the world, but in order to transform it, and to redeem it with one's personal love for Christ. This is truly a great ideal, which right from the beginning has anticipated the theology of the lay state of the Second Vatican Council and the post-conciliar period.\nOne-third of the world's bishops petitioned for the canonization of Escrivá. During the canonization, there were 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world, generals superior of many religious institutes, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During those days, these Church officials commented on the universal reach and validity of the message of the founder. For his canonization homily, John Paul II said: With the teachings of St. Josemaría, \"it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, \"Gaudium et spes,\" n. 34).\"\n\nConcerning the group's role in the Catholic Church, critics have argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a \"church within a church\" and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid , which some considered to be irregular. In contrast, Catholic officials say that Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope, and its status as a prelature \"precisely means dependence.\" Allen says that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.\n\nPope Benedict XVI has been a particularly strong supporter of Opus Dei and of Escrivá. Pointing to the name \"Work of God\", Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger), wrote that \"The Lord simply made use of [Escrivá] who allowed God to work.\" Ratzinger cited Escrivá for correcting the mistaken idea that holiness is reserved to some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners: Even if he can be very weak, with many mistakes in his life, a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy.\n\nRatzinger spoke of Opus Dei's \"surprising union of absolute fidelity to the Church's great tradition, to its faith, and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world, whether in the academic world, in the field of work, or in matters of the economy, etc.\" He further explained:\n\nthe theocentrism of Escrivá ... means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal ... This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the 'Big Bang' God retired from history.\nPope Francis is \"the first Pope who has dealt with Opus Dei closely as a bishop\", and according to James V. Schall, S.J., is a \"friend of Opus Dei.\" Francis referred to St. Josemaria as \"a precursor of Vatican II in proposing the universal call to holiness.\" In the analysis of John Allen, Pope Francis' strong dislike for clericalism, which he calls \"one of the worst evils\" in the Church is a key factor for \"what Francis admires about Opus Dei, since Escrivá’s emphasis on the dignity of the laity was a challenge to the ultra-clerical ethos of Spanish Catholicism in the late 1920s.\" He has a devotion to St. Josemaria, and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes, when he once visited the church of the prelature in Rome. Francis beatified Alvaro del Portillo, the successor of Escriva. What Bergoglio most liked about Opus Dei was the work done for the poor by one of its schools in Buenos Aires. He thanks Opus Dei for its work to further the holiness of priests in the Roman Curia.\n\nThroughout its history, Opus Dei has been criticized from many quarters, prompting journalists to describe Opus Dei as \"the most controversial force in the Catholic Church\" and founder Saint Josemaría Escrivá as a \"polarizing\" figure. Criticism of Opus Dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness, controversial and aggressive recruiting methods, strict rules governing members, elitism and misogyny, and support of or participation in authoritarian or right-wing governments, especially the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978. The mortification of the flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized. Opus Dei has also been criticized for allegedly seeking independence and more influence within the Catholic Church. \n\nOn the other hand, according to several journalists who researched Opus Dei separately, many criticisms against Opus Dei are based on fabrications by opponents, and it has been said that Opus Dei is a sign of contradiction. Several popes and other Catholic leaders have endorsed what they see as its innovative teaching on the sanctifying value of work, and its fidelity to Catholic beliefs. In 2002, Pope John Paul II canonized Escrivá, and called him \"the saint of ordinary life.\" \n\nIn recent years, Opus Dei has received international attention due to the novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" and its film version of 2006, both of which prominent Christians and non-believers criticized as misleading, inaccurate and anti-Catholic.\n\nCritics such as the Jesuit Wladimir Ledóchowski sometimes refer to Opus Dei as a \"Catholic\", \"christian\", or \"white\" form of Freemasonry.\nAccording to several journalists who have worked independently on Opus Dei, such as John Allen, Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales. Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say that most of these myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practise what they preach.\n\nAllen, Messori, and Plunkett also state that accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations stem from a clerical paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei can be found in influential clerical circles.\n\nAs to its alleged participation in right-wing politics, especially the Francoist regime, distinguished British historians Paul Preston and Brian Crozier state that the Opus Dei members who were Franco's ministers were appointed for their talent and not for their Opus Dei membership. Also, there were notable members of Opus Dei who were vocal critics of the Franco Regime such as Rafael Calvo Serer and Antonio Fontán, who was the first President of the Senate in Spain, following the adoption of a democratic Constitution. The German historian and Opus Dei member Peter Berglar calls any connection made between Opus Dei and Franco's regime a \"gross slander.\" At the end of Franco's regime, Opus Dei members were 50:50 for and against Franco, according to John Allen. Similarly Álvaro del Portillo, the former Prelate of Opus Dei, said that any statements that Escrivá supported Hitler were \"a patent falsehood,\" that were part of \"a slanderous campaign\". He and others have stated that Escriva condemned Hitler as a \"rogue\", a \"racist\" and a \"tyrant\". Opus Dei spokespersons also deny claims that Opus Dei members worked with General Pinochet. Various authors and researchers state that Escriva was staunchly non-political, and detested dictatorships. Allen wrote that, compared with other Catholic organizations, Opus Dei's stress on freedom and personal responsibility is extraordinarily strong. There are many Opus Dei members who are identified with left-wing politics, including Ruth Kelly, Jorge Rossi Chavarría, Mario Fernández Baeza, Antonio Fontán, Mario Maiolo, and Jesus Estanislao.\n\nWhile Opus Dei spokespersons have admitted mistakes in dealing with some members and do not, as a rule, contest their grievances, supporters have rejected generalizations merely based on negative experiences of some members. Sociologists like Bryan R. Wilson write about some former members of any religious group who may have psychological motivations such as self-justification to criticise their former groups. Wilson states that such individuals are prone to create fictitious \"atrocity stories\" which have no basis in reality. Many supporters of Opus Dei have expressed the belief that the criticisms of Opus Dei stem from a generalized disapproval of spirituality, Christianity, or Catholicism. Expressing this sentiment, one Opus Dei member, Cardinal Julián Herranz, stated \"Opus Dei has become a victim of Christianophobia.\" Massimo Introvigne, author of an encyclopedia of religion, argues that critics employ the term \"cult\" in order to intentionally stigmatize Opus Dei because \"they could not tolerate 'the return to religion' of the secularized society\".\n\nOpus Dei is not \"elitist\" in the sense in which people often invoke the term, meaning an exclusively white-collar phenomenon, concluded John Allen. He observed that among its members are barbers, bricklayers, mechanics and fruit sellers. Most supernumeraries are living ordinary middle-class lives, he said.\n\nRegarding alleged misogyny, John Allen states that half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei are held by women, and they supervise men. The Catholic Church defends its male priesthood by saying that \"the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven are not the ministers but the saints.\"\n\nCritics of Opus Dei include María del Carmen Tapia, an ex-member who was a high-ranking officer of Opus Dei for many years, liberal Catholic theologians such as Fr. James Martin, a Jesuit writer and editor, and supporters of Liberation theology, such as journalist Penny Lernoux and Michael Walsh, a writer on religious matters and former Jesuit. \n\nCritics state that Opus Dei is \"intensely secretive\"—for example, members generally do not disclose their affiliation with Opus Dei in public. Further, under the 1950 constitution, members were expressly forbidden to reveal themselves without the permission of their superiors. This practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member. Due in part to its secrecy, \"Jesuit America\" magazine referred to it as, \"...the most controversial group in the Catholic Church today.\n\nOpus Dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices, such as showering potential members with intense praise (\"Love bombing\"), and instructing numeraries to form friendships and attend social gatherings explicitly for recruiting purposes.\n\nCritics allege that Opus Dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members—for instance, past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection, and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors. Critics charge that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non-members, including their own families. Exit counselor David Clark has described Opus Dei as \"very cult-like\".\n\nCritics assert that Escrivá and the organization supported radical right-wing governments, such as those of Franco, Augusto Pinochet and Alberto Fujimori of Peru during the 1990s. Both Pinochet's and Fujimori's ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei, but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments. Likewise, among Opus Dei members there were also strong detractors of Franco, such as Antonio Fontán. There have also been allegations that Escrivá expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler. One former Opus Dei priest, Vladimir Felzmann, who has become a vocal Opus Dei critic, says that Escrivá once remarked that Hitler had been \"badly treated\" by the world and he further declared that \"Hitler couldn't have been such a bad person. He couldn't have killed six million [Jews]. It couldn't have been more than four million.\"\n\nOpus Dei has also been accused of elitism through targeting of \"the intellectual elite, the well-to-do, and the socially prominent.\"\n\nAs members of Opus Dei are Catholics, Opus Dei has been subjected to the same criticisms targeted to Catholicism in general. For example, Opus Dei's position has been \"to oppose sexual freedoms and promote conservative morals,\" according to an investigative report produced by the advocacy group Catholics for Choice. The report further cites a study from sociologist Marco Burgos alleging Opus Dei interference in sex education programs in Honduras that contradict the Catholic faith.\n\nAfter conducting a critical study of Opus Dei, Catholic journalist John L. Allen, Jr. concluded that Opus Dei should (1) be more transparent, (2) collaborate with members of religious institutes, and (3) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution.\n\nSociologists Peter Berger and Samuel Huntington suggest that Opus Dei is involved in \"a deliberate attempt to construct an alternative modernity,\" one that engages modern culture while at the same time is resolutely loyal to Catholic traditions. Van Biema of \"Time\" magazine emphasises Opus Dei's Spanish roots as a source of misunderstandings in the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggests that as the United States becomes more Hispanic, controversies about Opus Dei (and similar Catholic organizations) will decrease.\n\nIn her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, argues that the relative autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the issues raised by \"The Da Vinci Code\" and other critics.\n\nAside from Escriva (canonized in 2002) and Alvaro del Portillo (beatified in 2014), there a number of members of Opus Dei who have been proposed for beatification: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1693811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1693811", "title": "Philosophical theology", "text": "Philosophical theology\n\nPhilosophical theology is both a branch and form of theology in which philosophical methods are used in developing or analyzing theological concepts. It therefore includes natural theology as well as philosophical treatments of orthodox and heterodox theology. Philosophical theology is also closely related to the philosophy of religion.\n\nMortimer J. Adler distinguishes philosophical theology from natural theology. While the former is, according to him, theology done by non-Christian philosophers, the latter is done by those who are already Christians and are actually trying to find rational proofs for their faith. Adler thinks that the term \"natural theology\" is a misnomer and is actually apologetics, and cites as an example Thomas Aquinas' \"Summa Contra Gentiles\", addressed to the Jews and Moors in Spain, which though written as if it were philosophical theology, was in fact, apologetics and not philosophical theology, as it was written by a Christian and not by a pagan. In Adler's view, few if any of the books on natural theology, are sound as works in philosophical theology, because they are not written by pagans. An example of philosophical theology, according to Adler, is Aristotle's theology as found in his \"Metaphysics.\"\n\nContrary to Adler's view, Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister think that doing philosophical theology may not be restricted by whether the doer is an insider to faith or not, for anyone doing philosophical theology only tries to consider whether a theological doctrine can make philosophical sense or not. But, as Adler points it out, a pagan doing philosophical theology and coming to a theological conclusion has a different route than an insider using philosophy to examine or seek to understand his faith.\n\nThe relationship between theology and philosophy has been long-debated and discussed with the Christian tradition. Tertullian, an influential early Christian theologian and apologist, believed that philosophy has little to do with theology, arguing that the use of philosophy often corrupted theology, leading to unorthodox beliefs that were not grounded in the early Christian tradition. He famously asked the question 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'. (Athens symbolized the philosophical approach because of its role as a leading center of Hellenistic philosophy, while Jerusalem represented Christianity because of its role as an important location and intellectual centre in the early church.) Other leaders, however, saw a closer relationship between philosophy and theology. Justin Martyr looked at people like Heraclitus and Socrates as possessing the divine light of revelation and believed them to be true philosophers. Justin saw Christianity as the True Philosophy and argued for Christianity using philosophical methods and terminology. St. Augustine, who became one of the most influential theologians in history and whose works laid the foundation for much of Western philosophy (as well as much of Western theology), espoused a more middle-of-the-road, moderate approach, arguing that philosophy and theology often complement each other while at the same time cautioning that philosophy should not always be used in theological discourse. Instead, he argued, one should make sure that a philosophical approach toward a particular issue was grounded in prior Christian commitments.\nThe disciplines of Philosophy and Theology have often been connected, with theologians and philosophers interacting and debating similar and sometimes overlapping issues. Philosophy played a key role in the formation of Western theology. Thomas Aquinas, one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in history, for instance, borrowed much of his concepts from Aristotle. Scholasticism dominated both the philosophical and theological landscape in the Middle Ages, with theologians such as Aquinas, Anselm of Canterbury, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Peter Abelard, Bonaventure, and Albertus Magnus playing key role in both philosophy and theology.\n\nIn modern times, Anthony Thiselton has shown in his \"Fusion of Horizons\" the role that philosophy has played in the interpretation of scriptures, i.e., in the field of hermeneutics. Philosophy provides interpretive grids for apprehension of revelation. There are others, like Sadhu Sundar Singh, for instance, who believed that it is the illumination of the Holy Spirit that gives the truest meaning of revelation. Yet, one can't fail to see that cultural grids play an important role in the development of theology.\n\nMany contemporary philosophers continue to write and argue from a Christian perspective, with Christian concepts undergirding their philosophical work. In recent decades some of the most well-known philosophers who have written from a Christian perspective are Alvin Plantinga, Alasdair MacIntyre, William Lane Craig, Jean-Luc Marion, Paul Tillich, Charles Taylor, Richard Swinburne, and James K. A. Smith.\n\nDuring the 18th, 19th centuries, and 20th centuries many theologians reacted against the modernist, Enlightenment, and positivist attacks on Christian theology. Some existentialistic or neo-orthodox Protestant intellectuals like the Swiss Reformed theologian Karl Barth turned away from philosophy (called fideism) and argued that faith should be based strictly upon divine revelation. A popular approach in some circles is the approach of Reformed epistemologists, such as Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, who assert that belief in God might be foundational (or, properly 'basic') and warranted without the need for logical or evidential justification, like belief in other minds or the external world, rather than inferentially derived from other beliefs; it can, however, be subject to defeaters, rationally requiring that one give up the belief. Many other philosophers and theologians, however, disagree with this perspective and provide alternative views. Many other theologians have turned to continental philosophy, analytic philosophy, and postmodern philosophy in attempts to analyze and reframe the Christian theology in contemporary contexts.\n\nWhile philosophical theology can denote an approach to theology which is philosophical in nature, it can also denote a specific area of theology in which philosophical methods and terminology are used to analyze theological concepts. One task of philosophical theologians is to attempt to reconcile certain aspects of Christian doctrine with developments in philosophy. One question concerns how to prove the existence and nature of God. The knowledge of God is dealt with in the epistemology of religion. There are many different perspectives with philosophical theology on such questions. In modern times process theology, open theism and Christian panentheism have tried to look at God as the Being who is not only the Source and Ground of all being but also influenced by the people and processes of the world which he created and to which he belongs—rejecting or at least amending the classical medieval doctrine of impassibility.\n\nWithin Christology, a number of philosophical questions have been raised, such as how the divine can incarnate as a human, how the eternal can enter the temporal, and how the divine and the human can be united in one yet remain distinct. Such questions led to earlier heresies like Arianism, Sabellianism, Docetism, etc. Often, one's epistemic theory can play an important role in how one answers such questions. There is, for instance, sometimes a clash between those who want to emphasize the rational foundation for theology and those who want to emphasize the empirical foundation for theology. There has also been a contrast made between Christology from above and Christology from below. The former emphasizes the divine side of Christ; the latter, the human side. The human side obviously tends to look at it more empirically. The Scriptures call the Incarnation as a mystery of godliness. It baffles human imagination, leading many to call it a divine mystery. Yet, philosophical theologians argue that it is also important to find a philosophical ground for asserting both the divinity and humanity of Christ. Others theologians, however, like Rudolph Bultmann, ventured to remove any myths from the Bible, a hermeneutical approach they called demythology. They have therefore looked at the New Testament Christology as greatly tampered with and in need of being demythologized. There has been a separation made between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith (see also the Quest for the Historical Jesus).\n\n"}

Whether one considers rationalism or empiricism, either of them ultimately tends to \"belief\" in reason or experience respectively as the absolute basis for their methods. Thus, faith is basic to knowability.\n\n\"Rational fideism\" has been defined variously. The following are some definitions.\n\nFor Joseph Glanvill rational fideism is the view that \"Faith, and faith alone, is the basis for our belief in our reason. We believe in our reason because we believe in God's veracity. We do not try to prove that God is truthful; we believe this. Thus, faith in God gives us faith in reason, which in turn \"justifies\" our belief that God is no deceiver.\"\n\nRichard Popkin sees rational fideism as the opposite of \"pure, blind, fideism\".\n\nSimilarly, Domenic Marbaniang sees rational fideism as \"the view that the knowledge of God can be certified through faith alone that is based on a revelation that is rationally verified.\" Observing that the way of both rationalism and empiricism towards the knowledge of ultimate or transcendent reality is bleak, he thinks that while fideism is the view that truth in religion rests solely on faith and not on a reasoning process, rational fideism \"holds that truth in religion rests solely on faith; not blind faith, but faith that can give rational and cogent answers or reason to warrant the belief.\" \n\nAccording to C. Stephen Evans, rational fideism involves the possibility of reason becoming self-critical. Seeing it as the kind of responsible fideism, he states, \"If human reason has limitations and also has some ability to recognise those limitations, then the possibility of responsible fideism emerges.\" Evans states that not only does reason have limitations, it is also tainted by sin making one entitled to faith where reason fails..\n\nPatrick J. Clarke defines rational fidesm as the approach that sees \"reason as capable of providing the intellectual foundation of faith, not \"a priori\" but \"a posteriori\", much as philosophy provides an intellectual foundation to theology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3541416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3541416", "title": "Relevance theory", "text": "Relevance theory\n\nRelevance theory is framework for understanding utterance interpretation first proposed by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson and used within cognitive linguistics and pragmatics. It was originally inspired by the work of H. Paul Grice and developed out of his ideas, but has since become a pragmatic framework in its own right.\n\nThere are two ways to conceive of how thoughts are communicated from one person to another. The first way is through \nthe use of strict coding and decoding (such as is used with Morse code), also known as the Shannon-Weaver_model. In this approach the speaker/author encodes \ntheir thoughts and transmits them to their audience. The audience receives the encoded message and decodes it to arrive at the meaning the speaker/author intended. This can be visualized as follows:\n\nThis is usually referred to as the code model or the \nconduit metaphor of communication.\nHuman communication however, is almost never this simple. Context almost always plays a part in communication \nas do other factors such as the author's intentions, the relationship between the sender and receiver and so forth.\n\nThe second way of conceiving how thoughts are communicated is by the author/speaker only conveying as much \ninformation as is needed in any given context, so that the audience can recover their intended meaning from \nwhat was said/written as well as from the context and implications. In this conceptual model, the author takes into account the context of the communication and the mutual cognitive environment between the author and the audience. (That is what the author/speaker thinks that audience already knows). They then say just enough to communicate what they intend – relying on the audience to fill in the details that they did not explicitly communicate. This can be visualized as follows:\n\nSperber and Wilson's theory begins with some watershed assumptions that are typical of pragmatic \ntheories. Namely, it argues that all utterances are encountered in some context and that utterances convey a \nnumber of implicatures. In addition, they posit the notion of \"manifestness\", which is when something is grasped either consciously or unconsciously by a person.\n\nThey further note that it will be manifest to people who are engaged in inferential communication that each other have the notion of relevance in their minds. This will cause each person engaged in the interaction to arrive at the \"presumption of relevance\", which is the notion that \"(a) implicit messages are relevant enough to be worth bothering to process, and (b) the speaker will be as economical as they possibly can be in communicating it\".\n\nThe core of the theory is the \"communicative principle of relevance\", which states that by the act of making an \nutterance the speaker is conveying that what they have said is worth listening to, i.e. it will provide \"cognitive \neffects\" worthy of the processing effort required to find the meaning. In this way, every ostensive act \nof communication (that is the lexical \"clues\" that are explicitly conveyed when we speak/write) will look \nsomething like this:\n\n\nFor Sperber and Wilson, relevance is conceived as relative or subjective, as it depends upon the state of knowledge of a hearer when they encounter an utterance. However, they are quick to note that their theory does not attempt to exhaustively define the concept of \"relevance\" in everyday use, but tries to show an interesting and important part of human communication, in particular ostensive-inferential communication.\n\nRelevance theory's central insights are formalized in the following two-part principle, the Presumption of \nOptimal Relevance (see Postface to Sperber and Wilson 1995, p. 270):\n\n"}

It is used both alternatively and side-by-side with the term \"sexual orientation\", and is based on the perspective that sexual attraction is but a single component of a larger dynamic. For example, although a pansexual person may feel sexually attracted to people regardless of gender, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For asexual people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.\n\nPeople may or may not engage in purely emotional romantic relationships. The main identities relating to this are:\n\nThe implications of the distinction between romantic and sexual orientations have not been fully recognized, nor have they been studied extensively. It is common for sources to describe sexual orientation as including components of both sexual and romantic (or romantic equivalent) attractions. Similarly, \"romantic love\" has been noted as \"love with strong components of sexuality and infatuation\", although some sources contradict this notion, stating that sexual and romantic attraction are not necessarily linked. With regard to asexuality, while asexuals usually do not experience sexual attraction (see gray asexuality), they may still experience romantic attraction.\n\nOne of the attributes of aromantics is that despite feeling little or no romantic attraction, they can still enjoy sex. Aromantics are not necessarily incapable of feeling love. For example they may still feel familial love, or the type of platonic love that is expressed between friends. Some aromantics may claim that they are able to appreciate the type of love or romance that exists in popular culture, such as in movies, romantic books or songs, but only vicariously, and that they do not intuitively experience these feelings themselves.\n\nSome publications have argued that there is an underrepresentation of asexuals and aromantics in media and in research, and that they are often misunderstood. Aromantics sometimes face stigma and are stereotyped with labels such as being heartless, callous or deluded. Amatonormativity, a concept that elevates romantic relationships over non-romantic relationships, has been said to be damaging to aromantics. Representation of aromantics in the media is increasing.\n\nMany aromantics are asexual, but the term \"aromantic\" can be used in relation to various sexual identities, such as aromantic bisexual, aromantic heterosexual, aromantic lesbian, aromantic gay man or aromantic asexual. This is because aromanticism primarily deals with emotion rather than with sexuality or with the libido. Some activists have argued for adding aromantics to the LGBT community.\n\nThe antonym of aromanticism is alloromanticism, the state of experiencing romantic love or romantic attraction to others, while such a person is called an alloromantic. An informal term for an aromantic person is \"aro\". The A in the expanded LGBT acronym LGBTQIA, is interpreted by some to stand for aromantic.\n\n"}

Some schools, especially Western Buddhist ones, take more progressive stances regarding social issues.\n\nThe appearance of secular Buddhism is understood as part of the broad trend of secularization that has been developing in the West since the recovery of classical Greek culture in the Renaissance, rather than merely as a consequence of the supposed triumph of scientific rationalism over religion in the modern period. Moreover, many aspects of secular Buddhism have been prompted by organizational developments that began in a minority of lay Buddhist practice communities (\"sanghas\") in the West during the last decades of the 20th century, when the hierarchical features of Buddhist monastic culture were abandoned in favor of democratic principles of civic association. In particular, the need to include women on an equal footing produced organizational innovations, which disrupted older patterns of patriarchal authority and gender exclusivity.\n\nIn the 21st century, the new information and communication technologies have provided a seedbed for secular Buddhism by making teachings and discussion more freely available and readily accessible, thus facilitating the formation of virtual and actual practice communities. Today there are websites explicitly dedicated to secular Buddhism in Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Spain, the UK and the USA.\n\nSecular Buddhism has its roots in Buddhist modernism and secular humanism. The Insight meditation movement in the United States was founded on modernist secular values. Jack Kornfield, an American teacher and former Theravadin monk, stated that the Insight Meditation Society wanted to present Buddhist meditation “without the complications of rituals, robes, chanting and the whole religious tradition.” S. N. Goenka, a popular teacher of Buddhist Vipassana meditation, taught that his practice was not a sectarian doctrine, but “something from which people of every background can benefit: an art of living.” This essentially treats Buddhism as an applied philosophy, rather than a religion, or relies on Buddhist philosophy without dogmatism.\n\nStephen Batchelor is a self-proclaimed Secular Buddhist who promotes a strictly secular form of Buddhism. Batchelor was a Buddhist monk ordained in the more traditional forms of Buddhism. From his experience as a monk practicing Tibetan Buddhism and later Zen, he felt the need for a more secular and agnostic approach. In his books \"Buddhism Without Beliefs\" and \"Confession of a Buddhist Atheist\" he articulates his approach to the Buddha's teaching, describes Siddhattha Gautama as a historic person rather than an idealized religious icon, and scrutinizes typical Buddhist doctrines dealing with the concept of an afterlife.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat peer Lord Avebury was a secular Buddhist and a humanist and a patron of the British Humanist Association until his death. He was instrumental in securing the abolition of blasphemy as a crime in England and Wales.\n\nSecular Buddhism is a newly emerging, predominantly lay movement within Buddhism. Unlike the various kinds of Buddhist modernism, which tend to be modifications of traditional schools of Buddhist thought and practice in the light of the discourses of modernity, secular Buddhism is founded on a reconfiguration of core elements of the dharma itself. To this end it seeks to recover the original teachings of Siddhattha Gotama, the historical Buddha, yet without claiming to disclose \"what the Buddha really meant\". Rather, it interprets the early canonical teachings in a way that draws out their meaning in the Buddha's own historical context (the culture of the Gangetic plains in the fifth century BCE) while demonstrating their value and relevance to people living in our own time. Both aspects of this interpretation are literally \"secular\" in that they evoke the Latin root word \"saeculum\" – a particular age or generation. The ethos of the movement is perhaps best captured in Stephen Batchelor's \"Confession of a Buddhist Atheist\".\n\nSecular Buddhism proposes that we leave behind the metaphysical beliefs and soteriology of Indian religious culture. This culture saw human life as an irredeemable realm of suffering, from which one should seek transcendence in an enduring beyond-human condition – a stance that virtually all Buddhist schools, as well as Hinduism and Jainism, perpetuate. Secular Buddhism, on the other hand, seeks to deploy the Buddha's teaching as a guide to full human flourishing in this life and this world. In adopting this post-metaphysical position, it parts company with existing religious forms of Buddhist orthodoxy, which have evolved since the Buddha's death. Instead, it aligns itself with today's post-metaphysical philosophy, not least phenomenology, so finding itself on a convergent path with similar movements in radical Christian theology, as exemplified by the work of thinkers such as Don Cupitt and Gianni Vattimo.\n\nSecular Buddhism likewise rejects the authoritarian structures of power legitimated by the metaphysics of orthodox Buddhist belief. It questions notions of spiritual progress based on standardized prescriptions for meditation practice, as well as the widespread idea that Buddhist practice is essentially concerned with gaining proficiency in a set of meditative techniques endorsed by the authority of a traditional school or teacher. Instead, secular Buddhism emphasizes a praxis that encourages autonomy and encompasses equally every aspect of one's humanity, as modeled by the noble eight-fold path (right vision, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration). Such an approach is open to generating a wide range of responses to specific individual and communal needs, rather than insisting on there being \"one true way\" to \"enlightenment\" valid for all times and places.\n\n\n"}

For a time McMurrin worked for the LDS Church Educational System, first as a seminary teacher in 1937, then a teacher at Arizona State University, and Institute of Religion director at the University of Arizona.\n\nRegarding his religion, McMurrin argued that the LDS Church concealed parts of its history and had been declining in intellectual freedom. He believed that an honest study of religion would erode faith, and he personally did not believe in the historicity of the Book of Mormon. However, he remained devoted to Mormonism, despite his lack of faith and criticism from more \"orthodox\" church members. In the early 1950s, Joseph Fielding Smith and Harold B. Lee believed McMurrin should be excommunicated. David O. McKay met with McMurrin and agreed to testify on McMurrin's behalf, but the apostles did not pursue the excommunication. Joseph Fielding Smith suggested again that McMurrin be excommunicated in 1965, but McKay declined to take action.\n\nIn McMurrin's noted career, he worked with universities, large corporations, foundations, and governmental agencies, as a teacher, an administrator, and an advisor.\n\nA Critical Exposition of the Epistemological Function of Faith in the Philosophy of Augustine, Anselm and Aquinas\n\n\n\n\n"}

Like everyone he knows, he spends his life climbing the social ladder. Enduring marriage to a woman whom he often finds too demanding, he works his way up to be a magistrate, thanks to the influence he has over a friend who has just been promoted, focusing more on his work as his family life becomes less tolerable.\n\nWhile hanging curtains for his new home one day, he falls awkwardly and hurts his side. Though he does not think much of it at first, he begins to suffer from a pain in his side. As his discomfort grows, his behavior towards his family becomes more irritable. His wife finally insists that he visit a physician. The physician cannot pinpoint the source of his malady, but soon it becomes clear that his condition is terminal. Confronted with his diagnosis, Ivan attempts every remedy he can to obtain a cure for his worsening situation, until the pain grows so intense that he is forced to cease working and spend the remainder of his days in bed. Here, he is brought face to face with his mortality and realizes that, although he knows of it, he does not truly grasp it.\n\nDuring the long and painful process of dying, Ivan dwells on the idea that he does not deserve his suffering because he has lived rightly. If he had not lived a good life, there could be a reason for his pain; but he has, so pain and death must be arbitrary and senseless. As he begins to hate his family for avoiding the subject of his death, for pretending he is only sick and not dying, he finds his only comfort in his peasant boy servant, Gerasim, the only person in Ivan's life who does not fear death, and also the only one who, apart from his own son, shows compassion for him. Ivan begins to question whether he has, in fact, lived a good life.\n\nIn the final days of his life, Ivan makes a clear split between an artificial life, such as his own, which masks the true meaning of life and makes one fear death, and an authentic life, the life of Gerasim. Authentic life is marked by compassion and sympathy, the artificial life by self-interest. Then \"some force\" strikes Ivan in the chest and side, and he is brought into the presence of a bright light. His hand falls onto his nearby son's head, and Ivan pities his son. He no longer hates his daughter or wife, but rather feels pity for them, and hopes his death will release them. In so doing, his terror of death leaves him, and as Tolstoy suggests, death itself disappears.\n\nIn 1984, philosopher Merold Westphal said that the story depicts \"death as an enemy which (1) leads us to deceive ourselves, (2) robs us of the meaning of life, and (3) puts us in solitary confinement.\" In 1997, psychologist Mark Freeman wrote:\n\nIndeed, the mundane portrayal of Ivan's life coupled with the dramatization of his long and grueling battle with death seems to directly reflect Tolstoy's theories about moral living, which he largely derived during his sabbatical from personal and professional duties in 1877. In his lectures on Russian literature, Russian-born novelist and critic Vladimir Nabokov argues that, for Tolstoy, a sinful life (such as Ivan's) is moral death. Therefore, death, the return of the soul to God, is, for Tolstoy, moral life. To quote Nabokov: \"The Tolstoyan formula is: Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life – Life with a capital L.\"\n\nDeath permeates the narrative in a realistic and absorbing fashion, but the actual physicality of death is only present in the early chapters during Ivan's wake. Instead, the story leads the reader through a pensive, metaphysical exploration of the reason for death and what it means to truly live. Tolstoy was a man who struggled greatly with self-doubt and spiritual reflection, especially as he grew close to his own death in 1910. In his book \"A Confession\", Tolstoy writes:\n\nThis personal epiphany caused significant spiritual upheaval in Tolstoy's life, prompting him to question the Russian Orthodox Church, sexuality, education, serfdom, etc. The literature Tolstoy composed during this period is some of his most controversial and philosophical, among which falls \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" and other famous short stories such as \"The Kreutzer Sonata\" and \"The Devil\". From a biographical standpoint, therefore, it is possible to interpret \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" as a manifestation of Tolstoy's embroilment with death and the meaning of his own life during his final years. In other words, by dramatizing a particular sort of lifestyle and its unbearable decline, Tolstoy is able to impart his philosophy that success, such as Ivan Ilyich's, comes at a great moral cost and if one decides to pay this cost, life will become hollow and insincere and therefore worse than death.\n\nMartin Heidegger's \"magnum opus\", \"Being and Time\" (1927), refers to the novella as an illustration of Being towards death.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53066655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53066655", "title": "The Occult World", "text": "The Occult World\n\nThe Occult World is a book originally published in 1881 in London; it was compiled by a member of the Theosophical Society A. P. Sinnett. It was the first theosophical work by the author; according to Goodrick-Clarke, this book \"gave sensational publicity to Blavatsky's phenomena\" and the letters from the mahatmas, and drew the attention of the London Society for Psychical Research.\n\nIn September and October 1880 Blavatsky and Olcott visited Sinnett at Simla. Sinnett expressed serious interest in the work and teachings of the Theosophical Society, and it prompted Blavatsky help him into contact and correspondence with two adepts who sponsored the Society, the mahatmas Kuthumi and Morya. He was able to gather the material for his first theosophical book, which was based mostly on his notes of Blavatsky's occult work, and which \"made her name widely known, though it contained nothing from her pen.\"\n\nIn the second half of 1880, Anglo-Indian newspaper \"The Pioneer\" published several individual and collective reports of witnesses of Blavatsky's occult phenomena, in particular on 7 November 1880 a report which was written by Sinnett himself. In 1881, he incorporated these reports into his book. In February 1881 Kuthumi, writing that he is interested in Sinnett's book and its success, gave permission to use his letters: \"I lay no restrictions upon your making use of anything I may have written to you..., having full confidence in your tact and judgment as to what should be printed and how it should be presented.\" In March 1881 the Sinnetts went on vacation to England, expecting to find a publisher for \"The Occult World.\" The book was published in June 1881 during the author's stay in London. In July 1881 Sinnett returned to India, and on the next day after the arrival he received a letter in which Kuthumi congratulated him on the publication. Kuthumi wrote: \"When the first hum and ding-dong of adverse criticism is hushed, thoughtful men will read and ponder over the book.\"\n\nThe book is dedicated by author \"to the Mahatma Koot Hoomi whose gracious friendship has given the present writer his title to claim the attention of the European world.\"\n\nIntroduction.\nOccultism and its Adepts.\nThe Theosophical Society.\nFirst Occult Experiences.\nTeachings of Occult Philosophy.\nLater Occult Phenomena.\nAppendix.\nThe book begins with the author's allegation that there is a school of thought which modern culture has forgotten, and that the metaphysics, and to a large degree the present physical science, \"have been groping for centuries blindly after knowledge which occult philosophy has enjoyed in full measure all the while.\" Sinnett takes the liberty to express his belief that his knowledge is certainly true. He argues:\n\"I have come into some contact with persons who are heirs of a greater knowledge concerning the mysteries of Nature and humanity than modern culture has yet evolved... Modern science has accomplished grand results by the open method of investigation, and is very impatient of the theory that persons who ever attained to real knowledge, either in sciences or metaphysics, could have been content to hide their light under a bushel... But there is no need to construct hypotheses in the matter. The facts are accessible if they are sought for in the right way.\"\nSinnett explains that \"the ultimate development\" of an occultist requires him to comply with \"absolute physical purity.\" The candidate is obliged from the beginning to provide evidence that he is willing to comply with this requirement. Throughout the trial period, he should observe complete celibacy, and to refrain from all physical pleasures. However, this way of life does not presuppose any particular rigid discipline or hard asceticism, or \"withdrawal from the world.\" The author says:\n\"There would be nothing to prevent a gentleman in ordinary society from being in some of the preliminary stages of training for occult candidature without anybody about him being the wiser. For true occultism, the sublime achievement of the real adept, is not attained through the loathsome asceticism of the ordinary Indian fakir, the \"yogi\" of the woods and wilds, whose dirt accumulates with his sanctity—of the fanatic who fastens iron hooks into his flesh, or holds up an arm until it is withered.\"\n\nOn 29 September 1880 during an evening walk with Mrs. Sinnett, Blavatsky, responding to the suddenly expressed desire of her companion to get a little note from one of the \"Brothers\", tore off a corner of a letter received that day, and held it in her hand until it disappeared. Then Blavatsky asked her to specify where there should be a note. Mrs. Sinnett pointed to a tree, and then among its branches, she found the same corner of the paper, but now it contained a brief message written in English and signed in Tibetan symbols.According to Barborka, this note was the first message of the mahatmas, which had come in response to an oral request, and after it Sinnett decided to write his first letter to the \"Unknown Brother.\" The author says:\n\"One day, therefore, I asked Madame Blavatsky whether if I wrote a letter to one of the Brothers explaining my views, she could get it delivered for me. I hardly thought this was probable, as I knew how very unapproachable the Brothers generally are; but as she said that at any rate she would try, I wrote a letter, addressing it 'to the Unknown Brother', and gave it to her to see if any result would ensue. It was a happy inspiration that induced me to do this, for out of that small beginning has arisen the most interesting correspondence in which I have ever been privileged to engage.\"\n\nDuring Blavatsky's first visit to the Sinnetts' house at Allahabad, they were able to observe, in addition to the raps, one more phenomenon. For a few days they had gone with their guest to Benares, where they had settled at a house which had been lent by the maharaja of Vizianagaram. One evening after dinner, they sat in the great hall of the house. \"Suddenly three or four flowers – cut roses – fell\" right between them.\n\nAt Simla a picnic was planned, and a group of six men had intended to go into the forest. The supplies were designed for six men, but a seventh person suddenly joined the group. In preparation for the midday meal, the lack of a coffee cup and saucer was revealed. Someone jestingly suggested to Blavatsky to materialize the additional cup. Blavatsky held a \"mental conversation\" with one of her outlying \"Brothers\" and then pointed to a specific place, overgrown with grass and bushes. One of the participants began to dig there with a knife. After some time a white object was found, which was a tea-cup, and near it was a saucer, and as such they were no different from the other six cups and saucers brought from the Sinnetts' house. Plant roots around the utensils were found intact, and it has reportedly been proved that no one pre-dug there. When Mrs. Sinnett reached the house she counted the cups and saucers of this design and found one extra cup and saucer. However, it was impossible to buy such utensils at Simla. This outing had one more event, when it turned out that they could not make coffee because all the water bottles were empty, and the water in the nearest stream was dirty. Their servants, sent to the brewery, were unable to get water. Then Blavatsky put the empty bottle into one of the baskets, and then pulled it out, already filled with clean water.\n\nDuring another outing occurred the \"incident with pillow.\" Blavatsky turned to Sinnett with the question of where he would like to find a thing that Kuthumi is going to send. Sinnett decided to choose the most inconvenient place and pointed to one of several cushions, but at the insistence of his wife, he chose another. Once the firmly sewn pillow was ripped, they found among the feathers a note from Kuthumi and the brooch, which Mrs. Sinnett left at home.\n\n\"While the letters [from the mahatmas] are the most valuable portion of the book,\" the most likely cause of its widespread popularity was the occult phenomena described by the author, which he observed personally.\n\nGuénon wrote that Sinnett, who \"at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make Theosophism known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks.\" In the Hodgson Report Blavatsky's phenomena described in the book by Sinnett are discussed in a section \"\"The Occult World\" Phenomena\". At the end of this section, Hodgson claimed:\n\"I think I am justified in saying that the phenomena relied upon by Mr. Sinnett in \"The Occult World\" can be accounted for much more satisfactorily than can the performances of any ordinary professional conjurer by the uninitiated observer, however acute; that the additional details which I have been enabled to furnish in connection with some of the incidents Mr. Sinnett has recorded, clearly show that he has not been in the habit of exercising due caution for the exclusion of trickery; and that he has not proceeded in accordance with those 'scientific modes of investigation' which he explicitly declares (\"Occult World,\" p. 35) he regarded as necessary for the task he attempted.\"\nSolovyov (with irony in relation to Sinnett) stated that from the analysis of the phenomena described in \"The Occult World\" in the Hodgson Report, \"we can draw a conclusion: what a 'serious and honest' \"researcher\" we are dealing with in the case of Mr. Sinnett, this 'famous apostle' of the modern Theosophy and main defender of H. P. Blavatsky.\" Nevertheless, according to Goodrick-Clarke, \"a thorough analysis of the Hodgson Report by Vernon Harrison of the SPR effectively demolished... the conclusions of the Report.\"\n\nAn American Spiritualist Henry Kiddle addressed in 1883 in a London spiritualist magazine \"Light\" letter to the editor, in which he said that after reading Sinnett's book \"The Occult World,\" he was \"very greatly surprised,\" when he discovered that one of Kuthumi's letters published in the book contains text which \"was for the most part quite simply the copy of a lecture,\" which he made at Lake Pleasant 15 August 1880, and published the same month in \"Banner of Light.\" In this connection, Kiddle asked: \"As Mr. Sinnett's book did not appear till a considerable time afterwards (about a year, I think), it is certain that I did not quote, consciously or unconsciously, from its pages. How, then, did it get into Kuthumi's mysterious letter?\"\nAccording to Guénon, \"the Professor Kiddle incident\" was the first strike to hit the Theosophical Society overtly. He wrote that Sinnett has presented in the fourth edition of \"The Occult World\" \"a rather awkward explanation,\" which came from Kuthumi himself. Kuthumi stated that what looked like plagiarism was due to the awkwardness and carelessness of a pupil. The \"Master\" was forced to admit that he was negligent when he allowed his letter to be sent without checking and correction. He has written so:\n\"The letter in question was framed by me while on a journey and on horseback. It was dictated mentally in the direction of and precipitated by a young \"chela\" not yet expert at this branch of psychic chemistry, and who had to transcribe it from the hardly visible imprint. Half of it, therefore, was omitted, and the other half more or less distorted by the 'artist'. When asked by him at the time whether I would look over and correct it, I answered—imprudently, I confess—'Anyhow will do, my boy; it is of no great importance if you skip a few words.' I was physically very tired by a ride of forty-eight hours consecutively, and (physically again) half asleep. Besides this, I had very important business to attend to psychically, and therefore little remained of me to devote to that letter. When I awoke I found it had already been sent on, and as I was not then anticipating its publication, I never gave it from that time a thought... Yet had I dictated my letter in the form it now appears in print, it would certainly look suspicious, and however far from what is generally called plagiarism, yet in the absence of any inverted commas it would lay a foundation for censure. But I did nothing of the kind, as the original impression now before me clearly shows.\"\n\nAfter its first publication in 1881 the book was reprinted several times: in 1882 came the 2nd edition, in 1883 – 3rd, 1913 – 9th. This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and Russian.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1678145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1678145", "title": "Underdetermination", "text": "Underdetermination\n\nIn the philosophy of science, underdetermination refers to situations where the evidence available is insufficient to identify which belief one should hold about that evidence. For example, if all that was known was that exactly $10 was spent on apples and oranges, and that apples cost $1 and oranges $2, then one would know enough to eliminate some possibilities (e.g., 6 oranges could not have been purchased), but one would not have enough evidence to know which specific combination of apples and oranges was purchased. In this example, one would say that belief in what combination was purchased is underdetermined by the available evidence.\n\nAncient Greek skeptics argued for \"equipollence\", the view that reasons for and against claims are equally balanced. This captures at least one sense of saying that the claims themselves are underdetermined.\n\nUnderdetermination, again under different labels, arises in the modern period in the work of René Descartes. Among other skeptical arguments, Descartes presents two arguments involving underdetermination. His dream argument points out that experiences perceived while dreaming (for example, falling) do not necessarily contain sufficient information to deduce the true situation (being in bed). He concluded that since one cannot always distinguish dreams from reality, one cannot rule out the possibility that one is dreaming rather than having veridical experiences; thus the conclusion that one is having a veridical experience is underdetermined. His demon argument posits that all of one's experiences and thoughts might be manipulated by a very powerful and deceptive \"evil demon\". Once again, so long as the perceived reality appears internally consistent to the limits of one's limited ability to tell, the situation is indistinguishable from reality and one cannot logically determine that such a demon does not exist.\n\nTo show that a conclusion is underdetermined, one must show that there is a rival conclusion that is equally well supported by the standards of evidence. A trivial example of underdetermination is the addition of the statement \"whenever we look for evidence\" (or more generally, any statement which cannot be falsified). For example, the conclusion \"objects near earth fall toward it when dropped\" might be opposed by \"objects near earth fall toward it when dropped but only when one checks to see that they do.\" Since one may append this to any conclusion, all conclusions are at least trivially underdetermined. If one considers such statements to be illegitimate, e.g. by applying Occam's Razor, then such \"tricks\" are not considered demonstrations of underdetermination.\n\nThis concept also applies to scientific theories: for example, it is similarly trivial to find situations that a theory does not address. For example, classical mechanics did not distinguish between non-accelerating reference frames. As a result, any conclusion about such a reference frame was underdetermined; it was equally consistent with the theory to say that the solar system is at rest, as it is to say that it moves at any constant velocity in any particular direction. Newton himself stated that these possibilities were indistinguishable. More generally, evidence may not always be sufficient to distinguish between competing theories (or to determine a different theory that will unify both), as is the case with general relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\nAnother example is provided by Goethe's Theory of Colours — \"Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments, he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light. Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit. By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena, Goethe revealed our own free, creative contribution to theory construction. And Goethe's insight is surprisingly significant, because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton's prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well. If this is correct, then by suggesting an alternative to a well-established physical theory, Goethe developed the problem of underdetermination a century before Duhem and Quine's famous arguments.\" (Mueller, 2016) Hermann von Helmholtz says of this — 'And I for one do not know how anyone, regardless of what his views about colours are, can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent, that its assumptions, once granted, explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply'. (Helmholtz 1853)\n\nArguments involving underdetermination attempt to show that there is no reason to believe some conclusion because it is underdetermined by the evidence. Then, if the evidence available at a particular time can be equally well explained by at least one other hypothesis, there is no reason to believe it rather than the equally supported rival (although many other hypotheses may still be eliminated).\n\nBecause arguments involving underdetermination involve both a claim about what the evidence is and that such evidence underdetermines a conclusion, it is often useful to separate these two claims within the underdetermination argument as follows:\nThe first premise makes the claim that a theory is underdetermined. The second says that rational decision (i.e. using available evidence) depends upon insufficient evidence.\n\nAny phenomenon can be explained by a multiplicity of hypotheses. How, then, can data ever be sufficient to prove a theory? This is the \"epistemological problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory\".\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus argument and W.V.O. Quine's 1960 'Gavagai' example are perhaps the most commented variants of the epistemological problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory.\n\nSome skeptical arguments appeal to the fact that no possible evidence could be incompatible with 'skeptical hypotheses' like the maintenance of a complex illusion by Descartes' evil demon or (in a modern version) the machines who run the Matrix. A skeptic may argue that this undermines any claims to knowledge, or even (by internalist definitions), justification.\n\nPhilosophers have found this argument very powerful. Hume felt it was unanswerable, but observed that it was in practice impossible to accept its conclusions. Influenced by this, Kant held that while the nature of the 'noumenal' world was indeed unknowable, we could aspire to knowledge of the 'phenomenal' world. A similar response has been advocated by modern anti-realists.\n\nUnderdetermined ideas are not implied to be incorrect (taking into account present evidence); rather, we cannot know if they are correct.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, underdetermination is often presented as a problem for scientific realism, which holds that we have reason to believe in entities that are not directly observable (such as electrons) talked about by scientific theories. One such argument proceeds as follows: \n\nParticular responses to this argument attack both the first and the second premise (1 and 2). It is argued against the first premise that the underdetermination must be strong and/or inductive. It is argued against the second premise that there is evidence for a theory's truth besides observations; for example, it is argued that simplicity, explanatory power or some other feature of a theory is evidence for it over its rivals.\n\nA more general response from the scientific realist is to argue that underdetermination is no special problem for science, because, as indicated earlier in this article, all knowledge that is directly or indirectly supported by evidence suffers from it—for example, conjectures concerning unobserved observables. It is therefore too powerful an argument to have any significance in the philosophy of science, since it does not cast doubt uniquely on conjectured unobservables.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1355819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1355819", "title": "Yamas", "text": "Yamas\n\nYamas (), and its complement, Niyamas, represent a series of \"right living\" or ethical rules within Hinduism and Yoga. It means \"reining in\" or \"control\". These are restraints for Proper Conduct as given in the Holy Veda. They are a form of moral imperatives, commandments, rules or goals. The \"Yamas\" are the \"don't do these\" list of self-restraints, typically representing commitments that affect one's relations with others and self. The complementary Niyamas represent the \"do these\" list of observances, and together Yamas and Niyamas are personal obligations to live well.\n\nThe earliest mention of the word \"Yamas\" is in the Rigveda, and over fifty texts of Hinduism, from its various traditions, discuss Yamas. Patañjali lists five \"yamas\" in his Yoga Sūtras. Ten yamas are codified as \"the restraints\" in numerous Hindu texts including Yajnavalkya Smriti in verse 3.313, the Śāṇḍilya and Vārāha Upanishads, the \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\" by Svātmārāma, and the Tirumantiram of Tirumular.\n\nThe most often mentioned Yamas are – Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (non-falsehood, truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Mitahara (non-excess in food, moderation in food), Kṣamā (non-agitation about suffering, forgiveness), Dayā (non-prejudgment, compassion) are among the widely discussed Yamas. The Yamas apply broadly and include self-restraints in one's actions, words and thoughts.\n\nThe earliest mention of \"Yamas\" is found in the Hindu scripture Rigveda, such as in verse 5.61.2. The word in the Rigveda means a \"rein, curb\", the act of checking or curbing, restraining such as by a charioteer or a driver. The term evolves into a moral restraint and ethical duty in the Upanishads, the Dharmasutras, the Mahabharata and numerous later texts, where it means self-control, voluntary and inner-directed forbearance.\n\nYamas is the Sanskrit word for \"restraint,\" states Stephen Sturgess, particularly \"from actions, words, or thoughts that may cause harm\".\n\nThe five yamas listed by Patañjali in \"Yogasūtra\" 2.30 are:\n\n\nThe ten yamas listed by Śāṇḍilya Upanishad, as well as by Svātmārāma are:\n\n\nAt least sixty (60) ancient and medieval era Indian texts are known so far that discuss \"Yamas\". Most are in Sanskrit, but some are in regional Indian languages. Of the sixty, the lists in eleven of these texts are similar, but not the same, as that of Patanjali's. Other texts list between 1 and 10 \"Yamas\", however 10 is the most common.\n\nThe order of listed yamas, the names and nature of each yamas, as well as the relative emphasis vary between the texts. Some texts use the reverse of \"Niyamas\" in other texts, as Yamas; for example, \"Vairagya\" (dispassion from hedonism, somewhat reverse of the niyama \"Tapas\") is described in verse 33 of Trishikhi Brahmana Upanishad in its list for Yamas. Many texts substitute one or more different concepts in their list of \"Yamas\". For example, in the ten \"Yamas\" listed by Yatidharma Sangraha, Akrodha (non-anger) is included as a \"Yamas\". Ahirbudhnya Samhita in verse 31.19 and Darshana Upanishad in verses 1.14-15 include \"Dayā\" as a Yamas, and explain it as the ethical restraint of not jumping to conclusions, being compassionate to every being and considering suffering of others as one's own. In verse 31.21, Ahirbudhnya Samhita includes Kṣamā as the virtue of forgiveness and restraint from continued agitation from wrong others have done. Mahakala Samhita in verses II.11.723 through II.11.738 lists many of the 10 \"Yamas\" above, but explains why it is a virtue in a different way. For example, the text explains \"Dayā\" (or Dayaa) is an ethical precept and the restraint from too much and too little emotions. It suggests \"Dayā\" reflects one's inner state, is the expression of kindness towards kin, friend, stranger and even a hostile person, and that one must remain good and kind no matter what the circumstances. This view for the Yamas of \"Dayā\" is shared in Shandilya Upanishad and Jabala Darshana Upanishad. Atri Samhita in verse 48, lists \"Anrshamsya\" (आनृशंस्य) as the restraint from cruelty to any living being by one's actions, words or in thoughts. Shivayoga Dipika in verse 2.9 substitutes \"Sunrta\" for \"Satya\", defining Sunrta as \"sweet and true speech\".\n\nAhimsa, Satya, Asteya, Mitahara, Kṣamā, Dayā are among the widely discussed Yamas ethical concepts by majority of these texts.\n\nYamas are related to Niyamas in ancient and medieval era Indian texts. The former are restraints (the \"don'ts\") of virtuous life, while the latter are observances (the \"dos\").\n\nSome texts such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika use the classification flexibly, where yamas (restraints, the \"don'ts\") are understood as reverse of niyamas (positive attitudes, behaviors, the \"dos\"). For example, \"Ahimsa\" and \"Mitahara\" are called as yama as well as niyama in verses 17 and 40 of Book 1. In verse 1.40, Hatha Yoga Pradipika calls \"Ahimsa\" (non-violence and non-injuring anyone by one's actions, words or in thoughts) as the highest virtuous habit, \"Mitahara\" (moderation in one's eating and drinking habits) as the best personal restraint, and Siddhasana as the foremost of Asanas.\n\n"}

{"id": "5014815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5014815", "title": "Étienne Tempier", "text": "Étienne Tempier\n\nÉtienne (Stephen) Tempier (; also known as Stephanus of Orleans; died 3 September 1279) was a French bishop of Paris during the 13th century. He was Chancellor of the Sorbonne from 1263 and bishop of Paris from 1268.\n\nHe is best remembered for promulgating a Condemnation of 219 philosophical and theological propositions (or articles) that addressed concepts that were being disputed in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris.\n\nBorn in Orléans, Tempier studied in Paris, where he became master of theology and canon of Notre Dame. During a period of about five years (1263–ca. 1268), Tempier was the Chancellor of the chapter of Notre Dame at Paris, succeeding Erich von Veire. At that time, the Chancellor of the Chapter was also the Chancellor of the University of Paris.\n\nHe served as bishop of Paris from 7 October 1268 until his death on 3 September 1279. Tempier had been a master in the faculty of theology.\n\nIn 1270 Tempier, encouraged by Henry of Ghent (died 1293), had issued a formal condemnation of thirteen doctrines held by \"radical Aristotelians.\" These included the unity of intellect, causal necessity, and the eternity of the world. Further investigation into perceived errors then prevalent at the university was prompted by the Portuguese cleric Juliani, who was elected Pope John XXI on 13 September 1276. A former professor of theology at the University of Paris, he wrote Tempier on 28 January 1277. The pope told Tempier that he had heard reports of heretical opinions in the Paris area, and requested to be informed of the situation. By this time Tempier was already investigating possible heretical opinions at the University of Paris.\n\nOn 7 March 1277, Tempier expanded the number of condemned doctrines to 219. He was assisted by a commission of theologians from the University. Henry of Ghent sat on Tempier's episcopal commission (\"assessores episcopi\") of sixteen masters, which produced the syllabus of 219 propositions condemned by Tempier on 7 March 1277. The condemnations against Aristotelianism in Paris involved Giles of Rome, Siger of Brabant, the arts faculty, and certain doctrines of Thomas Aquinas. The forty-ninth item on the list was the assertion that God is incapable of moving the universe because it implies the existence of a void.\n\nTempier also overturned Aristotle on one point: God could have created more than one world (given His omnipotence) yet we know by revelation He made only one. Tempier's stress on God's omnipotence also opened up all kinds of possibilities for the understanding of the cosmos. In his effort to defend the abilities and unique rights of the Creator, Tempier's propositions led to the new approach taken to understand the workings of celestial and terrestrial bodies. By rejecting that astral bodies were animated, incorruptible and eternal, refuting the idea that their motion was the result of something comparable to animal desires and denying that stars had any influence over individuals, he showed that Christians were prepared to refute Aristotle's world view along with some basic assumptions held by Greek learning.\n\nIt is not clear what Tempier's intentions were in issuing this condemnation. Nevertheless, scholars have written that \"the Parisian Condemnation of 1277 is symbolic of an intellectual crisis in the University. It is indicative of fundamental shifts in speculative thought and cultural perception which occurred in the late 13th century, which portend aspects of modern thought.\"\n\nTempier's prohibitions did not curtail the free discussion of Thomist doctrines and did little to limit their influence at the University of Paris.\nHis decree was actively opposed and eventually overturned in 1325.\n\n\n"}
