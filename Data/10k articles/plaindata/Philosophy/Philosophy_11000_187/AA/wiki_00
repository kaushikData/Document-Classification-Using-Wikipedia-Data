A fundamental feature of these theories is that the rate of evolution of stars depends on their mass: The greater the mass, the faster this evolution, and the more quickly it leaves the main-sequence, entering either a subgiant or giant phase.\n\nIn the case of Algol and other binary stars, something completely different is observed: The less massive star is already a subgiant while the star with much greater mass is still on the main-sequence. Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. The more massive star, rather than the less massive one, should have left the main sequence.\n\nThe paradox is resolved by the fact that in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution. As the flow progresses, their evolutionary stage will advance, even as the relative masses change. Eventually, the originally more massive star will reach the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its mass to its companion.\n\n"}

She had a thirty-year friendship (and occasional academic collaboration) with Pope John Paul II.\n\nAnna-Teresa Tymieniecka was born into an aristocratic Polish-French family. Her acquaintance with philosophy started at an early age with reading of the fundamental work of Kazimierz Twardowski, the founder of the Lvov–Warsaw Philosophical School, \"Zur Lehre vom Inhalt und Gegenstand der Vorstellungen\" (\"On the content and object of presentations\"), as well as works by Plato and Bergson. To the philosophy of the latter she was introduced by her mother, Maria-Ludwika de Lanval Tymieniecka.\n\nAfter the end of World War II she began systematic studies of philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków under the guidance of Roman Ingarden, student of the famous teachers Kazimierz Twardowski and Edmund Husserl. Simultaneously she studied at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nAfter completing the entire university course within two years she moved to Switzerland to continue studies under another important Polish philosopher and logician, Józef Maria Bocheński, at the University of Fribourg. Her doctoral study, dedicated to explorations of the fundamentals of phenomenology in Nicolai Hartmann and Roman Ingarden's philosophies, was later published as \"Essence and Existence\" (1957). She obtained her second Ph.D., this time in French philosophy and literature, at the Sorbonne in 1951.\n\nIn the years 1952-1953 she did postdoctoral researches in the field of social and political sciences at the College d'Europe in Brugge, Belgium. From that moment on Tymieniecka started her own way in philosophy by developing a special phenomenological attitude that was neither entirely Husserlian, nor entirely Ingardenian.\n\nIn 1956 she married Hendrik S. Houthakker, Professor of Economy at Stanford University (1954-1960) and Harvard University (from 1960) and member of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers from 1969 to 1971.\n\nIn 1979 she published, in collaboration with Karol Wojtyła, who had become Pope John Paul II in 1978, an English translation of Wojtyla's book \"Osoba i czyn\" (Person and Act). \"Person and Act\", one of Pope John Paul II's foremost literary works, was initially written in Polish; it has been translated into French, Italian, German, Spanish, English and other languages. Tymieniecka's English translation is widely criticized. Critics of this work claim that Tymieniecka \"changed the Polish translation, confusing its technical language and bending the text to her own philosophical concerns.\" It is also said that John Paul II did not agree with this translation. Besides, it was published before the definitive edition of the Polish version, which shows that it was not the final version that the author desired. Her critics suggest that the English title used by Tymieniecka, \"The Acting Person\" is indicative of the problems involved with the work, as the author's title was meant to convey the tension between subjective consciousness (person) and objective reality (act), an idea central to the written work and the message the author tried to convey. Despite widespread disagreement, Tymieniecka insisted in 2001 that her work is the \"definitive\" English edition of \"Osoba i czyn\".\n\nShe served as Assistant Professor in Mathematics at the Oregon State College (1955–1956) and Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (from 1957). She spent the years 1961–1966 at the Institute for Independent Study at Radcliffe College. In 1972–1973 she was Professor of Philosophy at St. John's University.\n\nTymieniecka and Wojtyla, later Pope John Paul II, began a friendship in 1973 while he was the archbishop of Kraków. The friendship lasted thirty years until his death. She served as his host when he visited New England in 1978, and photos show them together on skiing and camping trips. Letters that he wrote to her were part of a collection of documents sold by Tymieniecka's estate in 2008 to the National Library of Poland. According to the BBC the library had initially kept the letters from public view, partly because of John Paul's path to sainthood, but a library official announced in February 2016 the letters would be made public. In February 2016 the BBC documentary programme \"Panorama\" 'revealed' that John Paul II had had a close relationship with Polish-born philosopher Tymieniecka. The pair exchanged personal letters over 30 years, and Stourton believes that in some of these Tymieniecka had told Wojtyła that she loved him. The Vatican described the documentary as \"more smoke than fire\", and Tymieniecka had earlier denied being involved with John Paul II. Writers Carl Bernstein, the veteran investigative journalist of the Watergate scandal, and Vatican expert Marco Politi, were the first journalists to talk to Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka in the 1990s about her importance in John Paul's life. They interviewed her and dedicated 20 pages to her in their 1996 book \"His Holiness\".<ref name=\"Bernstein/Politi\">Did Pope John Paul II Have a Secret Lover? by Barbi Latzu Nadeau, 15 February 2016</ref> Bernstein and Politi even asked her if she had ever developed any romantic relationship with John Paul II, \"however one-sided it might have been.\" She responded, \"No, I never fell in love with the cardinal. How could I fall in love with a middle-aged clergyman? Besides, I'm a married woman.\" The secret letters of Pope John Paul programme was aired on UK's BBC One on Monday, 15 February 2016, at 20:30.\n\nIn 1969 Tymieniecka founded the 'International Husserl and Phenomenological Research Society', in 1974 the 'International Society for Phenomenology and Literature', in 1976 the 'International Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences', in 1993 the 'International Society of Phenomenology, Aesthetics, and Fine Arts' (1993) and in 1995 the 'Sociedad Ibero-Americana de Fenomenologia'. The first three societies comprised the foundation for creation of the World Institute for Advanced Phenomenological Research and Learning in 1976, reorganized later into The World Phenomenology Institute. The initiative to establish this institute was supported by Roman Ingarden, Emmanuel Levinas, Paul Ricoeur, and Hans-Georg Gadamer as well as by the Director of the Husserl-Archives in Leuven, (Belgium) Herman Leo Van Breda. Since its foundation and for many years Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka remained its permanent President.\n\nAs the president of the 'World Phenomenology Institute' she organized numerous phenomenological congresses, conferences and symposia.\n\nSince its creation in 1968 (though the first book of the series seems to have formally appeared only in 1971), Tymieniecka was the editor of the book series \"Analecta Husserliana: The Yearbook of Phenomenological Research\", which aims to develop and disseminate Edmund Husserl's ideas and phenomenological approach. The series was created as a continuation of \"Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Phänomenologische Forschung\" edited by Husserl himself (main themes: the human being and the human life condition). \n\nIn addition to \"Analecta Husserliana\", The World Phenomenology Institute publishes the journal \"Phenomenological Inquiry\", and Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka acted also as Editor of the Springer (formerly Kluwer Academic Publishers) book series: \"Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology in Dialogue\", with co-Editors Gholamreza Aavani and the Lebanese/British philosopher Nader El-Bizri.\n\n\n\n"}

The building was never officially called a church, only a chapel, though it could contain 3,000 people; indeed, the chapel encroached upon the parish of Sts. Philip and James, and John of Milheim paid the pastor of that church 90 grossi as compensation. \nHus became a rector and a preacher in March 1402. After Hus's excommunication in 1412, the Pope ordered the Bethlehem chapel to be pulled down, although this action was rejected by the Czech majority on the Old Town council. After Hus's death, he was succeeded by Jacob of Mies.\n\nIn the 17th century, the building was acquired by the Jesuits. It fell into disrepair and in 1786 it was demolished; in 1836–1837 an apartment building was built in its place. Under the Czechoslovakian communist regime the building was restored by the government to its state at the time of Hus. Most of the chapel's exterior walls and a small portion of the pulpit date back to the medieval chapel.

The tradition began in the working-class cafés of Naples, where someone who had experienced good luck would order a \"sospeso\", paying the price of two coffees but receiving and consuming only one. A poor person enquiring later whether there was a \"sospeso\" available would then be served a coffee for free. Coffee shops in other countries have adopted the sospeso to increase sales, and to promote kindness and caring.\n\nOne 2010 account claims the tradition was over 100 years old, but declined during the , so that it is mainly observed around Christmas time. A 2008 article reported the tradition was obsolescent, the reporter having visited three bars where it had not been observed for at least 15 years. Aurelio De Laurentiis is reported to pay for ten \"sospesi\" after each victory by S.S.C. Napoli, the football club of which he is chairman.\nThe \"sospeso\" gave the title to a 2008 journalism collection by Neapolitan Luciano De Crescenzo, \"Il caffe sospeso: Saggezza quotidiana in piccoli sorsi\", which helped publicise the tradition throughout Italy. The idea has been reported in cafés in Bulgaria, Ukraine, Australia, Canada, Romania, Russia, Spain, Argentina, the United States, and Costa Rica. The idea received a revival in Italy in 2011 with several small Italian festivals forming a Suspended Coffee Network to encourage solidarity in response to cultural budget cuts, and a Dutch campaign at Christmas 2011 gave a discount on the price of the donated coffee. In December 2011, Neapolitan authorities declared an annual \"Suspended Coffee Day\".\n\nIn March 2013, John Sweeney launched a Facebook page for \"Suspended Coffees\", which by 2015 had led to the purchase of over 15 million coffees in 34 countries.\n\nThe UK arm of coffee chain Starbucks signed up for a charity initiative based on the suspended coffee concept in April 2013, in which it said it would match the value of each suspended coffee with a cash donation to the Oasis charity. The growth of the trend in other coffee shops in the UK also received media coverage around the same time.\n\nOn 22 July 2013, a Tuesday, an anonymous customer in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, North America paid for 500 large coffees at Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons. This started a trend that spread to a total of 30 locations with over 10,000 cups of coffee being paid for by donors.\n\nThe \"caffè sospeso\" has been identified as a symbol of grassroots social solidarity, prompting its revival in response to the 2008 recession and ensuing eurozone crisis. In 2004, a \"giornata nazionale del sospeso\" at Easter was announced by the \"Ronde della carità\" charity. In 2011, a \"Giornata del Caffè Sospeso\" was scheduled to coincide with Human Rights Day in December. A collection of Italian arts festivals emphasising social solidarity in 2010 came together under the umbrella \"Rete del Caffè Sospeso\". An Italian fundraising website started by Luca Argentero is called 1caffe.org.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37196", "title": "Causality", "text": "Causality\n\nCausality (also referred to as causation, or cause and effect) is what connects one process (the \"cause\") with another process or state (the \"effect\"), where the first is partly responsible for the second, and the second is partly dependent on the first. In general, a process has many causes,\nwhich are said to be causal factors for it, and all lie in its past (more precise: none lie in its future). An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its future. Causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space.\n\nCausality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses, so basic a concept that it is more apt as an explanation of other concepts of progression than as something to be explained by others more basic. The concept is like those of agency and efficacy. For this reason, a leap of intuition may be needed to grasp it. Accordingly, causality is implicit in the logic and structure of ordinary language.\n\nAristotelian philosophy uses the word \"cause\" to mean \"explanation\" or \"answer to a why question\", including Aristotle's material, formal, efficient, and final \"causes\"; then the \"cause\" is the explanans for the explanandum. In this case, failure to recognize that different kinds of \"cause\" are being considered can lead to futile debate. Of Aristotle's four explanatory modes, the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the \"efficient\" one.\n\nThe topic of causality remains a staple in contemporary philosophy.\n\nThe nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics.\n\nA general metaphysical question about cause and effect is what kind of entity can be a cause, and what kind of entity can be an effect.\n\nOne viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same kind of entity, with causality an asymmetric relation between them. That is to say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either \"\"A\" is the cause and \"B\" the effect\" or \"\"B\" is the cause and \"A\" the effect\", though only one of those two can be actually true. In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical principle in process philosophy, is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening. An example is 'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the effect'. Another view is that causes and effects are 'states of affairs', with the exact natures of those entities being less restrictively defined than in process philosophy.\n\nAnother viewpoint on the question is the more classical one, that a cause and its effect can be of different kinds of entity. For example, in Aristotle's efficient causal explanation, an action can be a cause while an enduring object is its effect. For example, the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause, with Socrates being the effect, Socrates being regarded as an enduring object, in philosophical tradition called a 'substance', as distinct from an action.\n\nSince causality is a subtle metaphysical notion, considerable effort is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances.\n\nCausality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity. These are topological, and are ingredients for space-time geometry. As developed by Alfred Robb, these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and space. Max Jammer writes \"the Einstein postulate ... opens the way to a straightforward construction of the causal topology ... of Minkowski space.\" Causal efficacy propagates no faster than light.\n\nThus, the notion of causality is metaphysically prior to the notions of time and space. In practical terms, this is because use of the relation of causality is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments. Interpretation of experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time and space.\n\nCauses may sometimes be distinguished into two types: necessary and sufficient. A third type of causation, which requires neither necessity nor sufficiency in and of itself, but which contributes to the effect, is called a \"contributory cause.\"\n\n\nJ. L. Mackie argues that usual talk of \"cause\" in fact refers to INUS conditions (insufficient but non-redundant parts of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect). An example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down. Consider the collection of events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, and the absence of firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house's burning down (since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down, for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down.\n\nConditional statements are \"not\" statements of causality. An important distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede or coincide with the consequent in time, whereas conditional statements do not require this temporal order. Confusion commonly arises since many different statements in English may be presented using \"If ..., then ...\" form (and, arguably, because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of causality). The two types of statements are distinct, however.\n\nFor example, all of the following statements are true when interpreting \"If ..., then ...\" as the material conditional:\n\n\nThe first is true since both the antecedent and the consequent are true. The second is true in sentential logic and indeterminate in natural language, regardless of the consequent statement that follows, because the antecedent is false.\n\nThe ordinary indicative conditional has somewhat more structure than the material conditional. For instance, although the first is the closest, neither of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading. But the sentence:\n\nintuitively seems to be true, even though there is no straightforward causal relation in this hypothetical situation between Shakespeare's not writing Macbeth and someone else's actually writing it.\n\nAnother sort of conditional, the counterfactual conditional, has a stronger connection with causality, yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality. Consider the following two statements:\n\n\nIn the first case, it would not be correct to say that A's being a triangle \"caused\" it to have three sides, since the relationship between triangularity and three-sidedness is that of definition. The property of having three sides actually determines A's state as a triangle. Nonetheless, even when interpreted counterfactually, the first statement is true. An early version of Aristotle's \"four cause\" theory is described as recognizing \"essential cause\". In this version of the theory, that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be the \"essential cause\" of its being a triangle. This use of the word 'cause' is of course now far obsolete. Nevertheless, it is within the scope of ordinary language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides.\n\nA full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to understanding the literature on causality. In everyday language, loose conditional statements are often enough made, and need to be interpreted carefully.\n\nFallacies of questionable cause, also known as causal fallacies, \"non-causa pro causa\" (Latin for \"non-cause for cause\"), or false cause, are informal fallacies where a cause is incorrectly identified.\n\nSubjunctive conditionals are familiar from ordinary language. They are of the form, if A \"were\" the case, then B \"would\" be the case, or if A \"had been\" the case, then B \"would have been\" the case. Counterfactual conditionals are specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents are in fact false, hence the name. However the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true antecedents as well.\n\nPsychological research shows that people's thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of counterfactual alternatives, and conversely, their counterfactual thinking about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments of the causal role of events and agents. Nonetheless, their identification of the cause of an event, and their counterfactual thought about how the event could have turned out differently do not always coincide. People distinguish between various sorts of causes, e.g., strong and weak causes. Research in the psychology of reasoning shows that people make different sorts of inferences from different sorts of causes, as found in the fields of cognitive linguistics and accident analysis for example.\n\nIn the philosophical literature, the suggestion that causation is to be defined in terms of a counterfactual relation is made by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume. Hume remarks that we may define the relation of cause and effect such that \"where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed.\"\n\nMore full-fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals only came in the 20th century after development of the possible world semantics for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals. In his 1973 paper \"Causation,\" David Lewis proposed the following definition of the notion of \"causal dependence\":\n\nCausation is then defined as a chain of causal dependence. That is, C causes E if and only if there exists a sequence of events C, D, D, ... D, E such that each event in the sequence depends on the previous.\n\nNote that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation, but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events. If correct, the analysis has the power to explain certain features of causation. Knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence, we may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the nature of causation. For example, in his paper \"Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow,\" Lewis sought to account for the time-directedness of counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual conditional. If correct, this theory can serve to explain a fundamental part of our experience, which is that we can only causally affect the future but not the past.\n\nInterpreting causation as a deterministic relation means that if \"A\" causes \"B\", then \"A\" must \"always\" be followed by \"B\". In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does smoking cause cancer or emphysema. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation. Informally, \"A\" (\"The person is a smoker\") probabilistically causes \"B\" (\"The person has now or will have cancer at some time in the future\"), if the information that \"A\" occurred increases the likelihood of \"B\"s occurrence. Formally, P{\"B\"|\"A\"}≥ P{\"B\"} where P{\"B\"|\"A\"} is the conditional probability that \"B\" will occur given the information that \"A\" occurred, and P{\"B\"}is the probability that \"B\" will occur having no knowledge whether \"A\" did or did not occur. This intuitive condition is not adequate as a definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect. For example, if \"A\" denotes the event \"The person is a smoker,\" \"B\" denotes the event \"The person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future\" and \"C\" denotes the event \"The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future,\" then the following three relationships hold: P{\"B\"|\"A\"} ≥ P{\"B\"}, P{\"C\"|\"A\"} ≥ P{\"C\"} and P{\"B\"|\"C\"} ≥ P{\"B\"}. The last relationship states that knowing that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer. The reason for this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that the person is a smoker, thus indirectly increasing the likelihood that the person will have cancer. However, we would not want to conclude that having emphysema causes cancer. Thus, we need additional conditions such as temporal relationship of \"A\" to \"B\" and a rational explanation as to the mechanism of action. It is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions.\n\nWhen experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal, the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in causal graphs such as Bayesian networks or path diagrams. The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between \"conditional probabilities\", as in formula_1, and \"interventional probabilities\", as in formula_2. The former reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so at an unspecified time in the past\", while the latter reads: \"the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past\". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter, while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic of quantal phenomena that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In classical thermodynamics, processes are initiated by interventions called thermodynamic operations. In other branches of science, for example astronomy, the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention.\n\nThe theory of \"causal calculus\" permits one to infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal Bayesian networks with unmeasured variables. One very practical result of this theory is the characterization of confounding variables, namely, a sufficient set of variables that, if adjusted for, would yield the correct causal effect between variables of interest. It can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the causal effect of formula_3 on formula_4 is any set of non-descendants of formula_3 that formula_6-separate formula_3 from formula_4 after removing all arrows emanating from formula_3. This criterion, called \"backdoor\", provides a mathematical definition of \"confounding\" and helps researchers identify accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement.\n\nWhile derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph, parts of the causal structure can, under certain assumptions, be learned from statistical data. The basic idea goes back to Sewall Wright's 1921 work on path analysis. A \"recovery\" algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl (1987) which rests on Wright's distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a directed acyclic graph (DAG):\n\n\nType 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies (i.e., formula_3 and formula_14 are independent given formula_4) and are, therefore, indistinguishable within purely cross-sectional data. Type 3, however, can be uniquely identified, since formula_3 and formula_14 are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent. Thus, while the \"skeletons\" (the graphs stripped of arrows) of these three triplets are identical, the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable. The same distinction applies when formula_3 and formula_14 have common ancestors, except that one must first condition on those ancestors. Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and, then, orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed.\n\nAlternative methods of structure learning search through the \"many\" possible causal structures among the variables, and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed correlations. In general this leaves a set of possible causal relations, which should then be tested by analyzing time series data or, preferably, designing appropriately controlled experiments. In contrast with Bayesian Networks, path analysis (and its generalization, structural equation modeling), serve better to estimate a known causal effect or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses.\n\nFor nonexperimental data, causal direction can often be inferred if information about time is available. This is because (according to many, though not all, theories) causes must precede their effects temporally. This can be determined by statistical time series models, for instance, or with a statistical test based on the idea of Granger causality, or by direct experimental manipulation. The use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre-existing theory of causal direction. For instance, our degree of confidence in the direction and nature of causality is much greater when supported by cross-correlations, ARIMA models, or cross-spectral analysis using vector time series data than by cross-sectional data.\n\nNobel Prize laureate Herbert A. Simon and philosopher Nicholas Rescher claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes. Rather, a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables, but a function of one variable (the cause) on to another (the effect). So, given a system of equations, and a set of variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering. The system of equations must have certain properties, most importantly, if some values are chosen arbitrarily, the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal. They postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields, including physics and economics.\n\nSome theorists have equated causality with manipulability. Under these theories, \"x\" causes \"y\" only in the case that one can change \"x\" in order to change \"y\". This coincides with commonsense notions of causations, since often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world. For instance, we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might find ways of reducing it.\n\nThese theories have been criticized on two primary grounds. First, theorists complain that these accounts are circular. Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction. But describing manipulations in non-causal terms has provided a substantial difficulty.\n\nThe second criticism centers around concerns of anthropocentrism. It seems to many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we can harness for our desires. If causality is identified with our manipulation, then this intuition is lost. In this sense, it makes humans overly central to interactions in the world.\n\nSome attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that don't claim to reduce causality to manipulation. These accounts use manipulation as a sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more fundamental than causation.\n\nSome theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and non-causal processes (Russell 1948; Salmon 1984). These theorists often want to distinguish between a process and a pseudo-process. As an example, a ball moving through the air (a process) is contrasted with the motion of a shadow (a pseudo-process). The former is causal in nature while the latter is not.\n\nSalmon (1984) claims that causal processes can be identified by their ability to transmit an alteration over space and time. An alteration of the ball (a mark by a pen, perhaps) is carried with it as the ball goes through the air. On the other hand, an alteration of the shadow (insofar as it is possible) will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along.\n\nThese theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions, but rather identifying causal processes. The former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes.\n\nFor the scientific investigation of efficient causality, the cause and effect are each best conceived of as temporally transient processes.\n\nWithin the conceptual frame of the scientific method, an investigator sets up several distinct and contrasting temporally transient material processes that have the structure of experiments, and records candidate material responses, normally intending to determine causality in the physical world. For instance, one may want to know whether a high intake of carrots causes humans to develop the bubonic plague. The quantity of carrot intake is a process that is varied from occasion to occasion. The occurrence or non-occurrence of subsequent bubonic plague is recorded. To establish causality, the experiment must fulfill certain criteria, only one example of which is mentioned here. For example, instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the hypothesized cause; such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical evidence. A mere observation of a correlation is not nearly adequate to establish causality. In nearly all cases, establishment of causality relies on repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning. Hardly ever is causality established more firmly than as more or less probable. It is often most convenient for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs are fully comparable, and differ through only one variable factor, perhaps measured by a real number. Otherwise, experiments are usually difficult or impossible to interpret.\n\nIn some sciences, it is very difficult or nearly impossible to set up material states of affairs that closely test hypotheses of causality. Such sciences can in some sense be regarded as \"softer\".\n\nOne has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics. Properly speaking, the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes. For example, force is a useful concept for the explanation of acceleration, but force is not by itself a cause. More is needed. For example, a temporally transient process might be characterized by a definite change of force at a definite time. Such a process can be regarded as a cause. Causality is not inherently implied in equations of motion, but postulated as an additional constraint that needs to be satisfied (i.e. a cause always precedes its effect). This constraint has mathematical implications such as the Kramers-Kronig relations.\n\nCausality is one of the most fundamental and essential notions of physics. Causal efficacy cannot propagate faster than light. Otherwise, reference coordinate systems could be constructed (using the Lorentz transform of special relativity) in which an observer would see an effect precede its cause (i.e. the postulate of causality would be violated).\n\nCausal notions appear in the context of the flow of mass-energy. For example, it is commonplace to argue that causal efficacy can be propagated by waves (such as electromagnetic waves) only if they propagate no faster than light. Wave packets have group velocity and phase velocity. For waves that propagate causal efficacy, both of these must travel no faster than light. Thus light waves often propagate causal efficacy but de Broglie waves often have phase velocity faster than light and consequently cannot be propagating causal efficacy.\n\nCausal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the existence of an arrow of time demands that the universe's semi-Riemannian manifold be orientable, so that \"future\" and \"past\" are globally definable quantities.\n\nA causal system is a system with output and internal states that depends only on the current and previous input values. A system that has \"some\" dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible past or current input values) is termed an acausal system, and a system that depends \"solely\" on future input values is an anticausal system. Acausal filters, for example, can only exist as postprocessing filters, because these filters can extract future values from a memory buffer or a file.\n\nAustin Bradford Hill built upon the work of Hume and Popper and suggested in his paper \"The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?\" that aspects of an association such as strength, consistency, specificity and temporality be considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in the epidemiological situation. (See Bradford-Hill criteria.) He did not note however, that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used in epidemiology to help enlighten causal thinking.\n\nPsychologists take an empirical approach to causality, investigating how people and non-human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information, prior experience and innate knowledge.\n\nAttribution theory is the theory concerning how people explain individual occurrences of causation. Attribution can be external (assigning causality to an outside agent or force—claiming that some outside thing motivated the event) or internal (assigning causality to factors within the person—taking personal responsibility or accountability for one's actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event). Taking causation one step further, the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior.\n\nThe intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of action. See also accident; blame; intent; and responsibility.\n\nWhereas David Hume argued that causes are inferred from non-causal observations, Immanuel Kant claimed that people have innate assumptions about causes. Within psychology, Patricia Cheng (1997) attempted to reconcile the Humean and Kantian views. According to her power PC theory, people filter observations of events through a basic belief that causes have the power to generate (or prevent) their effects, thereby inferring specific cause-effect relations.\n\nOur view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events. Another way to view the statement, \"Lightning causes thunder\" is to see both lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event, viz., an electric discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally.\n\nDavid Sobel and Alison Gopnik from the Psychology Department of UC Berkeley designed a device known as \"the blicket detector\" which would turn on when an object was placed on it. Their research suggests that \"even young children will easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object.\"\n\nSome researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move. Both temporal and spatial factors can be manipulated.\n\nSee Causal Reasoning (Psychology) for more information.\n\nStatistics and economics usually employ pre-existing data or experimental data to infer causality by regression methods. The body of statistical techniques involves substantial use of regression analysis. Typically a linear relationship such as\n\nis postulated, in which formula_21 is the \"i\"th observation of the dependent variable (hypothesized to be the caused variable), formula_22 for \"j\"=1...,\"k\" is the \"i\"th observation on the \"j\"th independent variable (hypothesized to be a causative variable), and formula_23 is the error term for the \"i\"th observation (containing the combined effects of all other causative variables, which must be uncorrelated with the included independent variables). If there is reason to believe that none of the formula_24s is caused by \"y\", then estimates of the coefficients formula_25 are obtained. If the null hypothesis that formula_26 is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis that formula_27 and equivalently that formula_24 causes \"y\" cannot be rejected. On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that formula_26 cannot be rejected, then equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of formula_24 on \"y\" cannot be rejected. Here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality as discussed above: If the true value formula_31, then a change in formula_24 will result in a change in \"y\" \"unless\" some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a change in formula_24 is \"not sufficient\" to change \"y\". Likewise, a change in formula_24 is \"not necessary\" to change \"y\", because a change in \"y\" could be caused by something implicit in the error term (or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model).\n\nThe above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation, in which \"y\" would cause formula_24. This belief can be established in one of several ways. First, the variable formula_24 may be a non-economic variable: for example, if rainfall amount formula_24 is hypothesized to affect the futures price \"y\" of some agricultural commodity, it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount (provided that cloud seeding is never attempted). Second, the instrumental variables technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables (instruments) that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable. Third, the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked, by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable; this principle is invoked, for example, in testing for Granger causality and in its multivariate analog, vector autoregression, both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables.\n\nRegression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors (explanatory variables). This helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable: its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest.\n\nGiven the above procedures, coincidental (as opposed to causal) correlation can be probabilistically rejected if data samples are large and if regression results pass cross-validation tests showing that the correlations hold even for data that were not used in the regression.\n\nThe deterministic world-view holds that the history of the universe can be exhaustively represented as a progression of events following one after as cause and effect. The incompatibilist version of this holds that there is no such thing as \"free will\". Compatibilism, on the other hand, holds that determinism is compatible with, or even necessary for, free will.\n\nFor quality control in manufacturing in the 1960s, Kaoru Ishikawa developed a cause and effect diagram, known as an Ishikawa diagram or fishbone diagram. The diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here. These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies \"causes\" in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering. Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction.\n\nIn the discussion of history, events are sometimes considered as if in some way being agents that can then bring about other historical events. Thus, the combination of poor harvests, the hardships of the peasants, high taxes, lack of representation of the people, and kingly ineptitude are among the \"causes\" of the French Revolution. This is a somewhat Platonic and Hegelian view that reifies causes as ontological entities. In Aristotelian terminology, this use approximates to the case of the \"efficient\" cause.\n\nSome philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that \"explanations in history and elsewhere\" describe \"not simply an event—something that happens—but a change\". Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about \"larger changes\", in Danto's words: to decide \"what are the elements which persist through a change\" is \"rather simple\" when treating an individual's \"shift in attitude\", but \"it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism\".\n\nMuch of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions. John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between \"routine\" and \"distinctive links\" in causal relationships: \"in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders.\" He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four \"general concepts of causation\" used in history: the \"metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause\"; \"the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events\"; \"the functional/teleological/consequential concept\", which is \"goal-directed, so that goals are causes\"; and the \"realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena\".\n\nAccording to law and jurisprudence, legal cause must be demonstrated to hold a defendant liable for a crime or a tort (i.e. a civil wrong such as negligence or trespass). It must be proven that causality, or a \"sufficient causal link\" relates the defendant's actions to the criminal event or damage in question. Causation is also an essential legal element that must be proven to qualify for remedy measures under international trade law.\n\nNote the concept of omnicausality in Abrahamic theology, which is the belief that God has set in motion all events at the dawn of time; he is the determiner and the cause of all things. It is therefore an attempt to rectify the apparent incompatibility between determinism and the existence of an omnipotent god.\n\nVedic period (c. 1750–500 BCE) literature has karma's Eastern origins. Karma is the belief held by Sanathana Dharma and major religions that a person's actions cause certain effects in the current life and/or in future life, positively or negatively. The various philosophical schools (darsanas) provide different accounts of the subject. The doctrine of satkaryavada affirms that the effect inheres in the cause in some way. The effect is thus either a real or apparent modification of the cause. The doctrine of asatkaryavada affirms that the effect does not inhere in the cause, but is a new arising. See Nyaya for some details of the theory of causation in the Nyaya school. In Brahma Samhita, Brahma describes Krishna as the prime cause of all causes.\n\nBhagavad-gītā 18.14 identifies five causes for any action (knowing which it can be perfected): the body, the individual soul, the senses, the efforts and the supersoul.\n\nAccording to Monier-Williams, in the Nyāya causation theory from Sutra I.2.I,2 in the Vaisheshika philosophy, from causal non-existence is effectual non-existence; but, not effectual non-existence from causal non-existence. A cause precedes an effect. With a threads and cloth metaphors, three causes are:\n\nMonier-Williams also proposed that Aristotle's and the Nyaya's causality are considered conditional aggregates necessary to man's productive work.\n\nThe general or universal definition of pratityasamutpada (or \"dependent origination\" or \"dependent arising\" or \"interdependent co-arising\") is that everything arises in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions; nothing exists as a singular, independent entity. A traditional example in Buddhist texts is of three sticks standing upright and leaning against each other and supporting each other. If one stick is taken away, the other two will fall to the ground.\n\nCausality in the Chittamatrin Buddhist school approach, Asanga's (c. 400 CE) mind-only Buddhist school, asserts that objects cause consciousness in the mind's image. Because causes precede effects, which must be different entities, then subject and object are different. For this school, there are no objects which are entities external to a perceiving consciousness. The Chittamatrin and the Yogachara Svatantrika schools accept that there are no objects external to the observer's causality. This largely follows the Nikayas approach.\n\nThe Abhidharmakośakārikā approach is Vasubandhu's Abhidharma commentary text in the Sarvāstivāda school (c. 500 CE). It has four intricate causal conditioning constructions with the: 1) root cause, 2) immediate antecedent, 3) object support, and 4) predominance. Then, the six causes are: 1) instrumentality (kāraṇahetu), deemed the primary factor in result production; 2) simultaneity or coexistence, which connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity, explaining the homogenous flow that evokes phenomena continuity; 4) association, which operates only between mental factors and explains why consciousness appears as assemblages to mental factors; 5) dominance, which forms one's habitual cognitive and behaviorist dispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the actively wholesome or unwholesome result. The four conditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal experience: for instance, each conscious moment acts both as the homogenous cause, as well as the immediate antecedent consciousness condition rise, and its concomitants, in a subsequent moment.\n\nThe Vaibhashika (c. 500 CE) is an early buddhist school which favors direct object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects. This is based in the consciousness example which says, intentions and feelings are mutually accompanying mental factors that support each other like poles in tripod. In contrast, simultaneous cause and effect rejectors say that if the effect already exists, then it cannot effect the same way again. How past, present and future are accepted is a basis for various Buddhist school's causality viewpoints.\n\nAll the classic Buddhist schools teach karma. \"The law of karma is a special instance of the law of cause and effect, according to which all our actions of body, speech, and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects.\"\n\nThe Baha'i concept of causation has been a unifying force for this young religion. The belief in a common biological and ideological ancestry has made it possible for Baha'is to recognize Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. Unfortunately, this has led to the systematic persecution of Baha'is by many caliphates.\n\nAristotle identified four kinds of answer or explanatory mode to various \"Why?\" questions. He thought that, for any given topic, all four kinds of explanatory mode were important, each in its own right. As a result of traditional specialized philosophical peculiarities of language, with translations between ancient Greek, Latin, and English, the word 'cause' is nowadays in specialized philosophical writings used to label Aristotle's four kinds. In ordinary language, there are various meanings of the word cause, the commonest referring to efficient cause, the topic of the present article.\n\n\nOf Aristotle's four kinds or explanatory modes, only one, the 'efficient cause' is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article. The other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition, structure and dynamics, and, again, criterion of completion. The word that Aristotle used was . For the present purpose, that Greek word would be better translated as \"explanation\" than as \"cause\" as those words are most often used in current English. Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant \"the four Becauses\" as four kinds of answer to \"why\" questions.\n\nAristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of experience, not explicable by, or reducible to, anything more fundamental or basic.\n\nIn some works of Aristotle, the four causes are listed as (1) the essential cause, (2) the logical ground, (3) the moving cause, and (4) the final cause. In this listing, a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it. A statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is true. These are further examples of the idea that a \"cause\" in general in the context of Aristotle's usage is an \"explanation\".\n\nThe word \"efficient\" used here can also be translated from Aristotle as \"moving\" or \"initiating\".\n\nEfficient causation was connected with Aristotelian physics, which recognized the four elements (earth, air, fire, water), and added the fifth element (aether). Water and earth by their intrinsic property \"gravitas\" or heaviness intrinsically fall toward, whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property \"levitas\" or lightness intrinsically rise away from, Earth's center—the motionless center of the universe—in a straight line while accelerating during the substance's approach to its natural place.\n\nAs air remained on Earth, however, and did not escape Earth while eventually achieving infinite speed—an absurdity—Aristotle inferred that the universe is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that held planet Earth and its atmosphere, the sublunary sphere, centered in the universe. And since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual, unaccelerated motion orbiting planet Earth in unchanging relations, Aristotle inferred that the fifth element, \"aither\", that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual circles, the only constant motion between two points. (An object traveling a straight line from point \"A\" to \"B\" and back must stop at either point before returning to the other.)\n\nLeft to itself, a thing exhibits \"natural motion\", but can—according to Aristotelian metaphysics—exhibit \"enforced motion\" imparted by an efficient cause. The form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and reproduction, the form of animals adds locomotion, and the form of humankind adds reason atop these. A rock normally exhibits \"natural motion\"—explained by the rock's material cause of being composed of the element earth—but a living thing can lift the rock, an \"enforced motion\" diverting the rock from its natural place and natural motion. As a further kind of explanation, Aristotle identified the final cause, specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in light of which something should be understood.\n\nAristotle himself explained,\n\nAristotle further discerned two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and accidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and actual effects to operating causes.\n\nAverting infinite regress, Aristotle inferred the first mover—an unmoved mover. The first mover's motion, too, must have been caused, but, being an unmoved mover, must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire.\n\nIn line with Aristotelian cosmology, Thomas Aquinas posed a hierarchy prioritizing Aristotle's four causes: \"final > efficient > material > formal\". Aquinas sought to identify the first efficient cause—now simply \"first cause\"—as everyone would agree, said Aquinas, to call it \"God\". Later in the Middle Ages, many scholars conceded that the first cause was God, but explained that many earthly events occur within God's design or plan, and thereby scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous \"secondary causes\".\n\nFor Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas, the word cause had a broad meaning. It meant 'answer to a why question' or 'explanation', and Aristotelian scholars recognized four kinds of such answers. With the end of the Middle Ages, in many philosophical usages, the meaning of the word 'cause' narrowed. It often lost that broad meaning, and was restricted to just one of the four kinds. For authors such as Niccolò Machiavelli, in the field of political thinking, and Francis Bacon, concerning science more generally, Aristotle's moving cause was the focus of their interest. A widely used modern definition of causality in this newly narrowed sense was assumed by David Hume. He undertook an epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause. He denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect, except by developing a habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or event, always contiguous and occurring one after the other. In Part III, section XV of his book \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", Hume expanded this to a list of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect. The first three:\n\nAnd then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are \"the source of most of our philosophical reasonings\":\nAnd then two more:\n\nIn 1949, physicist Max Born distinguished determination from causality. For him, determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from sufficient present data about them. For him, there are two kinds of causation, which we may here call nomic or generic causation, and singular causation. Nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws covering many possible or potential instances; we may recognize this as a probabilized version of criterion 3. of Hume mentioned just above. An occasion of singular causation is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically linked by antecedence and contiguity, which we may here recognize as criteria 1. and 2. of Hume mentioned just above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7638", "title": "Consilience", "text": "Consilience\n\nIn science and history, consilience (also convergence of evidence or concordance of evidence) refers to the principle that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can \"converge\" on strong conclusions. That is, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be very strong even when none of the individual sources of evidence is significantly so on its own. Most established scientific knowledge is supported by a convergence of evidence: if not, the evidence is comparatively weak, and there will not likely be a strong scientific consensus.\n\nThe principle is based on the unity of knowledge; measuring the same result by several different methods should lead to the same answer. For example, it should not matter whether one measures the distance between the Giza pyramid complex by laser rangefinding, by satellite imaging, or with a meter stick – in all three cases, the answer should be approximately the same. For the same reason, different dating methods in geochronology should concur, a result in chemistry should not contradict a result in geology, etc.\n\nThe word \"consilience\" was originally coined as the phrase \"consilience of inductions\" by William Whewell (\"consilience\" refers to a \"jumping together\" of knowledge). The word comes from Latin \"com-\" \"together\" and \"-siliens\" \"jumping\" (as in resilience).\n\nConsilience requires the use of independent methods of measurement, meaning that the methods have few shared characteristics. That is, the mechanism by which the measurement is made is different; each method is dependent on an unrelated natural phenomenon. For example, the accuracy of laser rangefinding measurements is based on the scientific understanding of lasers, while satellite pictures and meter sticks rely on different phenomena. Because the methods are independent, when one of several methods is in error, it is very unlikely to be in error in the \"same way\" as any of the other methods, and a difference between the measurements will be observed. If the scientific understanding of the properties of lasers were inaccurate, then the laser measurement would be inaccurate but the others would not.\n\nAs a result, when several different methods agree, this is strong evidence that \"none\" of the methods are in error and the conclusion is correct. This is because of a greatly reduced likelihood of errors: for a consensus estimate from multiple measurements to be wrong, the errors would have to be similar for all samples and all methods of measurement, which is extremely unlikely. Random errors will tend to cancel out as more measurements are made, due to regression to the mean; systematic errors will be detected by differences between the measurements (and will also tend to cancel out since the direction of the error will still be random). This is how scientific theories reach high confidence – over time, they build up a large degree of evidence which converges on the same conclusion.\n\nWhen results from different strong methods do appear to conflict, this is treated as a serious problem to be reconciled. For example, in the 19th century, the Sun appeared to be no more than 20 million years old, but the Earth appeared to be no less than 300 million years (resolved by the discovery of nuclear fusion and radioactivity, and the theory of quantum mechanics); or current attempts to resolve theoretical differences between quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nBecause of consilience, the strength of evidence for any particular conclusion is related to how many independent methods are supporting the conclusion, as well as how different these methods are. Those techniques with the fewest (or no) shared characteristics provide the strongest consilience and result in the strongest conclusions. This also means that confidence is usually strongest when considering evidence from different fields, because the techniques are usually very different.\n\nFor example, the theory of evolution is supported by a convergence of evidence from genetics, molecular biology, paleontology, geology, biogeography, comparative anatomy, comparative physiology, and many other fields. In fact, the evidence within each of these fields is itself a convergence providing evidence for the theory. (As a result, to disprove evolution, most or all of these independent lines of evidence would have to be found to be in error.) The strength of the evidence, considered together as a whole, results in the strong scientific consensus that the theory is correct. In a similar way, evidence about the history of the universe is drawn from astronomy, astrophysics, planetary geology, and physics.\n\nFinding similar conclusions from multiple independent methods is also evidence for the reliability of the methods themselves, because consilience eliminates the possibility of all potential errors that do not affect all the methods equally. This is also used for the validation of new techniques through comparison with the consilient ones. If only partial consilience is observed, this allows for the detection of errors in methodology; any weaknesses in one technique can be compensated for by the strengths of the others. Alternatively, if using more than one or two techniques for every experiment is infeasible, some of the benefits of consilience may still be obtained if it is well-established that these techniques usually give the same result.\n\nConsilience is important across all of science, including the social sciences, and is often used as an argument for scientific realism by philosophers of science. Each branch of science studies a subset of reality that depends on factors studied in other branches. Atomic physics underlies the workings of chemistry, which studies emergent properties that in turn are the basis of biology. Psychology is not separate from the study of properties emergent from the interaction of neurons and synapses. Sociology, economics, and anthropology are each, in turn, studies of properties emergent from the interaction of countless individual humans. The concept that all the different areas of research are studying one real, existing universe is an apparent explanation of why scientific knowledge determined in one field of inquiry has often helped in understanding other fields.\n\nConsilience does not forbid deviations: in fact, since not all experiments are perfect, some deviations from established knowledge are expected. However, when the convergence is strong enough, then new evidence inconsistent with the previous conclusion is not usually enough to outweigh that convergence. Without an equally strong convergence on the new result, the weight of evidence will still favor the established result. This means that the new evidence is most likely to be wrong.\n\nScience denialism (for example, AIDS denialism) is often based on a misunderstanding of this property of consilience. A denier may promote small gaps not yet accounted for by the consilient evidence, or small amounts of evidence contradicting a conclusion without accounting for the pre-existing strength resulting from consilience. More generally, to insist that all evidence converge precisely with no deviations would be naïve falsificationism, equivalent to considering a single contrary result to falsify a theory when another explanation, such as equipment malfunction or misinterpretation of results, is much more likely.\n\nHistorical evidence also converges in an analogous way. For example: if five ancient historians, none of whom knew each other, all claim that Julius Caesar seized power in Rome in 49 BCE, this is strong evidence in favor of that event occurring even if each individual historian is only partially reliable. By contrast, if the same historian had made the same claim five times in five different places (and no other types of evidence were available), the claim is much weaker because it originates from a single source. The evidence from the ancient historians could also converge with evidence from other fields, such as archaeology: for example, evidence that many senators fled Rome at the time, that the battles of Caesar’s civil war occurred, and so forth.\n\nConsilience has also been discussed in reference to Holocaust denial. \nThat is, individually the evidence may underdetermine the conclusion, but together they overdetermine it. A similar way to state this is that to ask for one \"particular\" piece of evidence in favor of a conclusion is a flawed question.\n\nIn addition to the sciences, consilience can be important to the arts, ethics and religion. Both artists and scientists have identified the importance of biology in the process of artistic innovation.\n\nConsilience has its roots in the ancient Greek concept of an intrinsic orderliness that governs our cosmos, inherently comprehensible by logical process, a vision at odds with mystical views in many cultures that surrounded the Hellenes. The rational view was recovered during the high Middle Ages, separated from theology during the Renaissance and found its apogee in the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nWhewell’s definition was that:\nMore recent descriptions include:\n\nAlthough the concept of consilience in Whewell's sense was widely discussed by philosophers of science, the term was unfamiliar to the broader public until the end of the 20th century, when it was revived in \"Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge,\" a 1998 book by the humanist biologist Edward Osborne Wilson, as an attempt to bridge the culture gap between the sciences and the humanities that was the subject of C. P. Snow's \"The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution\" (1959).\n\nWilson held that with the rise of the modern sciences, the sense of unity gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. He asserted that the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give a purpose to understanding the details, to lend to all inquirers \"a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws.\" And important point made by Wilson is that hereditary human nature and evolution itself profoundly effect the evolution of culture, in essence a sociobiological concept. Wilson's concept is a much broader notion of consilience than that of Whewell, who was merely pointing out that generalizations invented to account for one set of phenomena often account for others as well.\n\nA parallel view lies in the term universology, which literally means \"the science of the universe.\" Universology was first promoted for the study of the interconnecting principles and truths of all domains of knowledge by Stephen Pearl Andrews, a 19th-century utopian futurist and anarchist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4407137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4407137", "title": "Cross-fostering", "text": "Cross-fostering\n\nCross-fostering is a technique used in animal husbandry, animal science, genetic and nature versus nurture studies, and conservation, whereby offspring are removed from their biological parents at birth and raised by surrogates. This can also occasionally occur in nature.\n\nCross-fostering young animals is usually done to equalize litter size. Individual animals born in large litters are faced with much more competition for resources, such as breast milk, food and space, than individuals born in smaller litters. Herd managers will typically move some individuals from a large litter to a smaller litter where they will be raised by a non-biological parent. This is typically done in pig farming because litters with up to 15 piglets are common. A sow with a large litter may have difficulty producing enough milk for all piglets, or the sow may not have enough functional teats to feed all piglets simultaneously. When this occurs, smaller or weaker piglets are at risk of starving to death. Herd managers will often transfer some piglets from a large litter to another lactating sow which either has a smaller litter or has had her own biological piglets recently weaned. Herd managers will typically try to equalize litters by number and also weight of individuals. When done successfully, cross-fostering reduces piglet mortality.\n\nCross-fostering can be used to study the impact of postnatal environment on genetic-linked diseases as well as on behavioural pattern. In behavioral studies, if cross-fostered offspring show a behavioral trait similar to their biological parents and dissimilar from their foster parents, a behavior can be shown to have a genetic basis. Similarly if the offspring develops traits dissimilar to their biological parents and similar to their foster parents environmental factors are shown to be dominant. In many cases there is a blend of the two, which shows both genes and environment play a part.\n\nIn animal studies, genetically hypertensive offspring reared by normotensive dams have been shown to have lower blood pressure compared to the controls. This shows that hypertensive genotype could be modified by the changes of the postnatal environment. Besides this, hyperkinetic animals reared by a normal dam have been shown to have lower locomotor activity compared to its controls.\n\nIn one experiment, siblicide was shown to be somehow related to parental care. When non-obligate siblicidal blue-footed boobies were swapped with obligate siblicidal masked booby chicks, it was found that the blue-footed chicks exhibited more siblicidal behavior.\n\nIn selective livestock breeding cross-fostering can be used to combine desirable genetic qualities such as weight, fat distribution or appearance with environmentally influenced ones such as temperament.\n\nIn humans, studies of children in foster care have shown that alcoholism is both genetic and environmental: early onset alcoholism can be linked to biological parentage, whereas adult onset alcoholism is often influenced by the alcohol abuse by foster parents.\n\nCross fostering has been used in conservation biology such as the rearing of black robin chicks by other species. In this instance the species was so close to extinction, with literally a handful of surviving individuals and a single mother, there was little chance of raising many offspring. In this case a related species were used to raise the eggs, with their own eggs being replaced by conservation workers with those of the robin. In this case imprinting is one of the concerns, as species raised in a different environment may not be able to recognize their own species. In a world first, the Adelaide Zoo successfully cross-fostered a baby tree kangaroo, whose mother was killed when it was five weeks old, with a surrogate rock-wallaby mother. The Zoo has had a successful cross-fostering program between wallaby species, but this is the first time it was tried with a tree kangaroo and wallaby.\n\nCross fostering may occasionally occur in natural situations. In Australia, the closely related species from the cockatoo family, \"Eolophus roseicapilla\" (the galah) and \"Cacatua leadbeateri\" (the pink cockatoo), have overlapping ranges, and compete for nesting holes. However, two pairs of birds may share the same nest for a time, as they do not become aggressive until several eggs have been laid and incubation begins. When they do, the pink cockatoos are always the victors, evicting the galahs in what is termed interference competition. They are not consciously aware that some of the eggs in the nest were laid by the other bird however, and thus raise offspring of both species. These natural experiments have been used by Australian ornithologists Graeme Chapman and Ian Rowley to investigate the relative importance of genes and environment. For example, they discovered that the galah chicks gave normal begging calls and alarm calls, but their contact calls (used to maintain social cohesion) were more like those of the pink cockatoos with which they lived.\n\nSuch natural instances of cross fostering can also lead to hybridization between species that would not normally breed. A case of this is offered by the Galapagos finches. Two species of the genus \"Geospiza\", the medium ground-finch (\"Geospiza fortis\") and the common cactus-finch (\"Geospiza scandens\") occasionally hybridize. The birds' songs are a barrier to interbreeding, but sometimes young birds will not learn their own species song, e.g. if their father dies and they are nesting near another species. Another situation where birds can imprint on the wrong song is when one species takes over the nest of another, but fails to remove all of its eggs. Cross fostered young can then hybridize with their foster parents' species, allowing gene flow between the two populations. Hybrids experience reduced fitness, however, so the two species can remain separate.\n\n\n"}

A disciple of Zen Master Jeongang, he received Dharma transmission from his teacher and thereby becoming the 78th patriarch in the Dharma Lineage of the Buddha in 1962.\n\nAfter a period spent in isolation in 1988 he founded Moonzen and the Moonzen Zen Centers in order to widely spread the teaching he received from his master, Zen Master Jeongang. Zen Master Daewon educates and trains his disciples at Moonzen Zen Centers around the country.\n\nFaced with the many phenomena that accompany climate change, in 2009 Zen Master Daewon established the International Union to Prevent Desertification (IUPD). He is active in participating in the resolution of climate change. For example, through IUPD, Zen Master Daewon opened the measures to prevent the desertification at the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) and made an agreement with Burkina Faso and the Republic of Niger in order to stop the desertification. At present, after a successful test, the process to change barren desert into grass land is in steady process in the two countries.\n\nHe is recognized as a disciple of Zen Master Jeongang, the 77th patriarch and Zen Master of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Zen Master Daewon received Dharma Transmission from Zen Master Jeongang. When Master Daewon was 12, his father died in front of his eyes, and this experience left an indelible imprint on the young man's view of the world. As soon as he was able to leave his house, in 1954 he entered into the large monastery, Hae-in-sa temple under the mentorship of his preceptor Master Pak In-gok.\n\nSince he was motivated to understand about life and death he searched around the country for an enlightened master with whom he could practice with. After practicing for several years he finally was able to meet with the famous Zen Master Jeongang sunim. In 1962 while he was practicing at Dong-hwa-sa temple the following story has been left behind.\n\nPrior to the summer monastic retreat, the abbot of the Dong-hwa-sa temple, Wolsan sunim had publicly announced that the Zen Master Jeongang would be overseeing the 3 month retreat so meditators from around the country gathered there to practice. One evening, during a session of sitting meditation, all of the seats in the meditation hall were empty except for those of a couple elder monks. The young Daewon thought this to be unusual and then saw a young monk furtively call him out, quietly waving at him from outside the hall. When he went to him, the young monk told Daewon sunim that a group of monks were waiting for him up on the mountain out back. Daewon sunim followed the young monk into the mountain and found a gathering of twenty monks, waiting for him in stony silence. Immediately upon seeing Daewon sunim, one of the monks named Beopseong (presently known as the Zen Master Jinje, a disciple of Zen Master Hyanggok), called out to him, \"Say something about Bodhidharma's 'I don't know.' Kong-an (Koan).\" Daewon sunim answered without a moment's hesitation, \"Revealed.\" Songam sunim, who was standing nearby asked him about the Ansujeongdeung Kong-an(Koan), \"How would you save yourself?\" Daewon sunim spoke loudly, \"An (岸)! Su (樹)! Jeong (井)! Deung (藤)!\" All the gathered monks stood still with their lips pursed in silence as Daewon sunim turned around and walked away. The next day after breakfast, Myeongheo sunim, who was serving as monitor for the retreat, called a temple hearing to find out why the monks had been absent without notice the night before. During the hearing, all that had happened up on the mountain was laid out in the open and as a result, the monks who had been absent during the sitting meditation session assumed their formal robes and bowed in penance before Zen Master Jeongang, who was serving as the Josil of the temple at the time.\n\nThe next day, Zen Master Jeongang called on Daewon sunim. He told Daewon that his first Song of Enlightenment was clear evidence of his enlightenment but that a Song of Enlightenment is customarily kept short. To this, Daewon sunim recited the second Song of Enlightenment he had composed when he saw the sun and the moon in the setting sky while passing the fields of Gimje. After Zen Master Jeongang heard the second Song of Enlightenment, he again asked Master Daewon to make up another song on the spot that would encapsulate the same stage of enlightenment. Immediately upon this request, Master Daewon produced the following song:\n\nZen Master Jeongang listened to the first two lines with his eyes gently closed; then upon hearing the last two lines, he opened his eyes, revealing delight. However, he didn't stop there and asked once more, \"When the others called you out on the mountain and Beopseong asked you to speak on the 'I don't know.' Kong-an (Koan), you said, 'Revealed.' If you were Emperor Wu of Liang, how wouldyou respond to Bodhidharma's 'I don't know.'?\" \"If I was Emperor Wu of Liang, I'd respond by saying 'Even though there is no such thing as a saint, wouldn't it be much better to enjoy the flowering of my virtue together, just like this?' and take him by the hand.\" Zen Master Jeongang spoke with astonishment, \"How have you reached such a stage?\" \"How could one say that he has reached it, that he has it, or that it is of his nature? It is only just like this.\" In this manner, the reverend Daewon, received Dharma Transmission from the Master Jeongang and in 1962 became the 78th patriarch in the Korean tradition of Zen.\n\nAt his ordination ceremony in 2009, Zen Master Daewon was received into the Academic Lineages of Buddhist Doctrine by Zen Masters: Hoegwang Saseonbul (晦光 師璿佛) and Yongseong Jinjong (龍城 震鍾).\n\nZen Master Daewon has translated and published collections of kong-ans, famous sutras, analects of Buddhist patriarchs and many profound Buddhist texts. Furthermore, he has reinterpreted these works with a modern viewpoint and added his own gathas and incisive comments.\n\n, Zen Master Daewon is translating 80 volumes of the Avatamsaka Sutra and is also preparing to publish more Buddhist texts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The dialogue concerns the state of mind of Seneca's friend Annaeus Serenus, and how to cure Serenus of anxiety, worry and disgust with life.\n\nAround 400 .., Democritus wrote a treatise \"On Cheerfulness\" (Greek: Περι εύθυμίης; \"Peri euthymiés\"). The term euthymia, or \"cheerfulness\", can mean \"steadiness of the mind\", \"well-being of the soul\", \"self-confidence\". Seneca laudes Democritus in relation to his treatise on the subject, and states that he will use the Latin word \"tranquillitas\" as a rough translation of \"euthymia\".\n\nWriting a little later than Seneca, Plutarch wrote a similar work, described in the 1589 translation as, \"a philosophical treatise concerning the quietness of the mind\".\n\n\"De Tranquillitate Animi\" is thought to be written during the years 49 to 62 A.D. It has often been dated to around 60 AD on the (possibly wrong) assumption that the theme of the dialogue reflects Seneca's own deteriorating political situation at court.\n\nThe title when translated into English means \"on the tranquility of the mind\" (or) \"soul\". The word \"animi\" is translated, in a general sense, as the rational soul, and in a more restricted sense, as the mind as a thing thinking, feeling, willing. T. M. Green provides definitions of animus, animi as being soul, mind and also \"courage, passion\". Monteleone translated \"tranquillitas animi\" as, mental equilibrium.\n\n\"De Tranquillitate Animi\" is part of Seneca's series of \"Dialogi\" (\"dialogues\"). The dialogue concerns the state of the \"animi\" of Seneca's friend Annaeus Serenus, and how to cure Serenus of anxiety, worry and disgust with life.\n\nSeneca finishes \"De Tranquillitate\" with a quote by Aristotle:\n\nSeneca, as with other Stoics, was concerned with providing insight for the development of a practice of life, for others to develop into virtuous individuals and to achieve inner harmony. \"De Tranquillitate Animi\" is one of a trio of dialogues to his friend Serenus, which includes \"De Constantia Sapientis\" and \"De Otio\". The superior position \"ho sophos\" (the sage) inhabits, of detachment from earthly (\"terena\") possibilities of future events of a detrimental nature, is the unifying theme of the dialogues.\n\nCompared with the other two works, the intention of \"De Tranquillitate Animi\" is more therapeutic. The work opens with Serenus asking Seneca for counsel, and this request for help takes the form of a medical consultation. Serenus explains that he feels agitated, and in a state of unstable immobility, \"as if I were on a boat that doesn't move forward and is tossed about.\" Seneca uses the dialogue to address an issue that cropped up many times in his life: the desire for a life of contemplation and the need for active political engagement. Seneca argues that the goal of a tranquil mind can be achieved by being flexible and seeking a middle way between the two extremes.\n\nThe first extant copy of the work is as part of the \"codex Ambrosianus\" (no. 90), of the Ambrosianus library in Milan, dating from the 11th century A.D.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45487739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45487739", "title": "Differential outcomes effect", "text": "Differential outcomes effect\n\nThe differential outcomes effect is a theory in behaviorism, a branch of psychology, that shows that a positive effect on accuracy occurs in discrimination learning between different stimuli when unique rewards are paired with each individual stimulus. The DOE was first demonstrated in 1970 by Milton Trapold on an experiment with rats. Rats were trained to discriminate between a clicker and a tone by pressing the left and right levers. Half of the rats were trained using the differential outcomes procedure, where the clicker was paired with sucrose and tone with food pellets. The remaining rats were trained with only sucrose or only food pellets. The rats trained with the differential outcomes procedure were significantly more accurate than those trained with only one type of reinforcement (common outcome). Since then it has been established through a myriad of experiments that the Differential Outcome Effect exists in most species capable of learning.\n\nThe Differential Outcomes Effect not only states that an association between a stimulus and a response is formed as traditional Classical Conditioning states, but that a simultaneous association is formed between a stimulus and a reinforcer in the subject. If one were to pair a stimulus with a reinforcer, that is known as a differential condition. When this is employed, one can expect a higher accuracy in tests when discriminating between two stimuli, due to this increased amount of information available to the subject than in a nondifferential condition.\n\nIn 1970 the Differential Outcome Effect was discovered by Trapold when testing the reasoning behind the theory. He created an experiment where rats were taught to discriminate between a clicking noise and a tone. He associated the left bar with the clicking noise and the right bar with the tone. The experimental group was given sucrose for one response and food for the other. The control group was randomly given either food or sucrose for each response. The rats in the experimental group were able to discriminate between the two stimuli faster than the rats in the control group.\n\nThe Differential Outcome Effect was then found to exist in various species including but not limited to rats, pigeons and horses, over the years and was then finally explored in humans by Pauline Maki, J. Bruce Overmier, Sandra Delos, and Arlyne Gutmann in 1995. They tested children who were from 4 to 7 years old to discriminate between two different shapes. Children who were given either a reinforcer consisting of food for one response or given a verbal reinforcer for another response gave far more accurate answers than those who were given random reinforcers for different responses.\n\nThen in 2002; Odette Miller, Kevin Waugh and Karen Chambers proved that Differential Outcome Effect exists in adults. This experiment was novel because it first used average adults (college students) in the experiment, and had a complex discrimination task which required participants to be able to distinguish between 15 different Kanji characters. In prior experiments, participants were only required to discriminate between two different stimuli. For the participants in the group given a differential condition, each Kanji character was given a unique photo and prize for answering correctly. Participants in the group given a nondifferential condition were given a random photo and prize for answering the question correctly. The group given a differential condition fared far better than those in the group with the nondifferential condition, demonstrating that the Differential Outcome Effect not only exists in adult humans but also can be applied to tasks requiring discrimination of more than two stimuli.\n\nMore recently several studies have looked at the applications of the differential outcomes effect for populations with intellectual disabilities and pervasive developmental disabilities. Scientist have theorised that this procedure may be useful in overcoming barriers to learning.\n"}

{"id": "1736734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1736734", "title": "Ensoulment", "text": "Ensoulment\n\nIn religion, ensoulment is the moment at which a human being gains a soul. Some religions say that a soul is newly created within a developing child and others, especially in religions that believe in reincarnation, that the soul is pre-existing and added at a particular stage of development.\n\nIn the time of Aristotle, it was widely believed that the human soul entered the forming body at 40 days (male embryos) or 90 days (female embryos), and quickening was an indication of the presence of a soul. Other religious views are that ensoulment happens at the moment of conception; or when the child takes the first breath after being born; at the formation of the nervous system and brain; at the first brain activity; or when the fetus is able to survive independently of the uterus (viability).\n\nThe concept is closely related to debates on the morality of abortion as well as the morality of contraception. Religious beliefs that human life has an innate sacredness to it have motivated many statements by spiritual leaders of various traditions over the years. However, the three matters are not exactly parallel, given that various figures have argued that some kind of life without a soul, in various contexts, still has a moral worth that must be considered.\n\nAmong Greek scholars, Hippocrates (c.460 – c.370 BC) believed that the embryo was the product of male semen and a female factor. But Aristotle (384 – 322 BC) held that only male semen gave rise to an embryo, while the female only provided a place for the embryo to develop, (a concept he acquired from the preformationist Pythagoras). Aristotle believed a fetus in early gestation has the soul of a vegetable, then of an animal, and only later became \"animated\" with a human soul by \"ensoulment\". For him, ensoulment occurred 40 days after conception for male fetuses and 90 days after conception for female fetuses, the stage at which, it was held, movement is first felt within the womb and pregnancy was certain. This is called epigenesis, which is \"the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction,\" in contrast to the theory of preformation, which asserts the \"supposed existence of all the parts of an organism in rudimentary form in the egg or the seed;\" modern embryology, which finds both that an organism begins with an inherited genetic code and that embryonic stem cells can develop epigenetically into a variety of cell types, may be seen as supporting a balance between the views.\n\nStoicism maintained that the living animal soul was received only at birth, through contact with the outer air, and was transformed into a rational soul only at fourteen years of age.\n\nEpicureanism saw the origin of the soul (considered to consist of only a small number of atoms even in adults) as simultaneous with conception.\n\nPythagoreanism also considered ensoulment to occur at conception.\n\nFrom the 12th century, when the West first came to know more of Aristotle than his works on logic, mediaeval declarations by Popes and theologians on ensoulment were based on the Aristotelian hypothesis.\n\nAristotle's epigenetic view of successive life principles (\"souls\") in a developing human embryo—first a vegetative and then a sensitive or animal soul, and finally an intellective or human soul, with the higher levels able to carry out the functions also of the lower levels—was the prevailing view among early Christians, including Tertullian, Augustine, and Jerome. Lars Østnor says this view was only \"presaged\" by Augustine, who belongs to a period later than that of early Christianity. According to David Albert Jones, this distinction appeared among Christian writers only in the late fourth and early fifth century, while the earlier writers made no distinction between formed and unformed, a distinction that Saint Basil of Caesarea explicitly rejected. While the Hebrew text of the Bible only required a fine for the loss of a fœtus, whatever its stage of development, the Greek Septuagint (LXX) translation of the Hebrew text, a pre-Christian translation that the early Christians used, introduced a distinction between a formed and an unformed fœtus and treated destruction of the former as murder. It has been commented that \"the LXX could easily have been used to distinguish human from non-human fœtuses and homicidal from non-homicidal abortions, yet the early Christians, until the time of Augustine in the fifth century, did not do so.\"\n\nThe view of early Christians on the moment of ensoulment is also said to have been not the Aristotelian, but the Pythagorean:\nThrough the Latin translations of Averroes's (1126–1198) work, beginning in the 12th century, the legacy of Aristotle was recovered in the West. Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas (1224–1274) adapted largely to his views and because they believed that the early embryo did not have a human soul, they did not necessarily see early abortion as murder, although they condemned it nonetheless. Aquinas, in his main work, the \"Summa Theologica\", states (Question 118 article 2 ad 2)\"…that the intellectual soul is created by God at the end of human generation\". Although Jesus may have been exceptional, Aquinas did believe that the embryo first possessed a vegetative soul, later acquired sensitive (animal) soul, and after 40 days of development, God gave humans a rational soul.\n\nThe 1312 Council of Vienne declared that the substance of the rational or intellectual soul is essentially the form of the human body and affirmed Aquinas's stance on delayed hominization.\n\nIn 1588, Pope Sixtus V issued the Bull \"Effraenatam\", which subjected those that carried out abortions at any stage of gestation with automatic excommunication and the punishment by civil authorities applied to murderers. Three years later after finding that the results had not been as positive as was hoped, his successor Pope Gregory XIV limited the excommunication to abortion of a formed fœtus.\n\nIn 1679, Pope Innocent XI publicly condemned sixty-five propositions taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, Suarez and other casuists (mostly Jesuit casuists who had been heavily attacked by Pascal in his \"Provincial Letters\") as \"propositiones laxorum moralistarum\" (propositions of lax moralists) as \"at least scandalous and in practice dangerous\". He forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of excommunication. The condemned propositions included:\n\nIn the 1869 Bull \"Apostolicae Sedis\", Pius IX rescinded Gregory XIV's not-yet-animated fetus exception and re-enacted the penalty of excommunication for abortions at any stage of pregnancy, which even before that were never seen as merely venial sin. Since then, canon law makes no distinction as regards excommunication between stages of pregnancy at which abortion is performed.\n\nIn spite of the difference in ecclesiastical penalties imposed during the period when the theory of delayed ensoulment was accepted as scientific truth, abortion at any stage has always been condemned by the Church and continues to be so. However, in its official declarations, the Catholic Church avoids taking a position on the philosophical question of the moment when a human person begins to be:\n\nCiting the possibly first-century Didache and the Letter of Barnabas of about the same period, the Epistle to Diognetus and Tertullian, the Catholic Church declares that \"since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\"\n\nEven when the prevailing scientific theory considered that early abortion was the killing of what was not yet a human being, the condemnation of abortion at any stage was sometimes expressed in the form of making it equivalent to homicide. Accordingly, the 1907 article on abortion in the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" stated:\nThe early Christians are the first on record as having pronounced abortion to be the murder of human beings, for their public apologists, Athenagoras, Tertullian, and Minutius Felix (Eschbach, \"Disp. Phys.\", Disp. iii), to refute the slander that a child was slain, and its flesh eaten, by the guests at the Agapæ, appealed to their laws as forbidding all manner of murder, even that of children in the womb. The Fathers of the Church unanimously maintained the same doctrine. In the fourth century the Council of Eliberis decreed that Holy Communion should be refused all the rest of her life, even on her deathbed, to an adulteress who had procured the abortion of her child. The Sixth Ecumenical Council determined for the whole Church that anyone who procured abortion should bear all the punishments inflicted on murderers. In all these teachings and enactments no distinction is made between the earlier and the later stages of gestation. For, though the opinion of Aristotle, or similar speculations, regarding the time when the rational soul is infused into the embryo, were practically accepted for many centuries still it was always held by the Church that he who destroyed what was to be a man was guilty of destroying a human life.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the embryo \"must be treated from conception as a person.\" \"The church has not determined officially when human life actually begins\" and respect for life at all stages, even potential life, is generally the context of church documents.\n\nOn 27 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI stated \"from the moment of its conception life must be guarded with the greatest care.\" [...] With regard to the embryo in the mother's womb, science itself highlights its autonomy, its capacity for interaction with the mother, the coordination of biological processes, the continuity of development, the growing complexity of the organism.It is not an accumulation of biological material but rather of a new living being, dynamic and marvelously ordered, a new individual of the human species. This is what Jesus was in Mary's womb; this is what we all were in our mother's womb. We may say with Tertullian, an ancient Christian writer: \"the one who will be a man is one already\" (\"Apologeticum\" IX, 8), there is no reason not to consider him a person from conception.\n\nIn relation to elective abortion, Pope John Paul II wrote about ensoulment in his 1995 encyclical letter \"Evangelium Vitae\" that:Throughout Christianity's two thousand year history, this same doctrine of condemning all direct abortions has been constantly taught by the Fathers of the Church and by her Pastors and Doctors. Even scientific and philosophical discussions about the precise moment of the infusion of the spiritual soul have never given rise to any hesitation about the moral condemnation of abortion.\n\nWhile the Church has always condemned abortion, changing beliefs about the moment the embryo gains a human soul have led their stated reasons for such condemnation, and the classification in canon law of the sin of abortion, to change over time.\n\nJewish views on ensoulment have varied. Rabbi David Feldman states that the Talmud discusses the time of ensoulment, but considers the question unanswerable and irrelevant to the abortion question. In recounting a purported conversation in which the rabbi Judah the Prince, who said the soul (\"neshama\") comes into the body when the embryo is already formed, was convinced by Antoninus Pius that it must enter the body at conception, and considered the emperor's view to be supported by , the tractate \"Sanhedrin\" of the Talmud mentions two views on the question.\n\nIn a variant reading the rabbi's first statement was that the soul entered the body only at birth.\n\nOther passages in the Talmud, such as \"Yevamot\" 69a and \"Nidda\" 30b have been interpreted as implying that ensoulment may occur only after forty days of gestation. The Talmud passages, whether speaking of ensoulment at conception or only after forty days, place the views of the rabbis within Greco-Roman culture, whose ideas the rabbis then linked with texts of Scripture and endowed with theological significance.\n\nThe view of ensoulment at conception harmonizes with general lore among rabbis about conscious activity before birth. However, most of them did not apply the word \"nefesh\", meaning soul or person, to a fetus still in the womb. The latter half of the Second Temple period saw increasing acceptance of the idea of the soul as joining the body at birth and leaving it again at death.\n\nOne Jewish view put ensoulment even later than birth, saying that it occurs when the child first answers \"Amen\".\n\nThe rabbis in fact formulated no fully developed theory of the timing or nature of ensoulment. It has been suggested that the reason why they were not more concerned about the exact moment of ensoulment is that Judaism does not believe in strict separation of soul and body.\n\nIslam does not traditionally hold that ensoulment occurs at the point of conception. Two passages in the Qur'an describe the fetal development process:\n\nTraditional scholarship places the point of ensoulment anywhere between 40 and 120 days after conception based on a Hadith of the Prophet Muhammed narrated in Saheeh Muslim:\n\nAll schools of Sunni law have forbidden abortion before and after ensoulment. Most schools of thought, traditional and modern, make allowances for circumstances threatening the health or life of the mother.\n\nMost Hindu's believe that personhood begins with the reincarnation that happens at conception. But the flexibility of Hinduism allows for destruction of embryos to save a human life, or embryonic stem cell research to benefit humankind using surplus blastocysts from fertility clinics.\n\n\n"}

He was of the same family as the Cardinals Lorenzo Pucci, Roberto Pucci, and Antonio Pucci. He worked began in a mercantile house at Lyon and came into contact with the Protestant Reformation. He made his way to London, where he became acquainted with Antonio de Corro.\n\nIn 1572 he went to Oxford, apparently expecting to find sympathy with his antagonism to the Calvinistic tendency in Protestantism. On 18 May 1574 he was admitted M.A. He applied for a post of lecturer in theology, but his disputations soon annoyed the authorities, who expelled him (before June 1575) from the university. John Rainolds noted his departure with approval. In 1575–7 he was in London, communicating with the Italian congregation of the strangers' church, but unsettled in his views.\n\nHe corresponded with Francesco Betti, a Roman of noble family, who advised him to come to Basle and lay his difficulties before Fausto Paulo Sozzini (Socinus). Pucci reached Basle about May 1577, and held a written disputation with Sozzini on the question of immortality. Pucci regarded all creatures as imperishable; Sozzini denied the natural immortality of man, treating a future life as a conditional privilege. On 4 June Pucci formulated his positions, under ten heads; Sozzini replied on 11 June; Pucci finished a rejoinder on 1 July. The discussion was interrupted by the expulsion of Pucci from Basle. He had publicly maintained an extreme form of Pelagianism, printing theses, ‘De Fide natura hominibus universis insita,’ in which he claimed that all men are by nature in a state of salvation. Soon afterwards an epidemic drove Sozzini from Basle; he completed an answer to Pucci at Zürich on 27 January 1578. This, in the following October, he forwarded to Pucci, who made notes on the margin of the manuscript, but wrote no formal reply.\n\nFrom Basle Pucci had returned by way of Nuremberg and Flanders to London, where Sozzini believed him to be still staying in December 1580. His views exposed him to persecution and imprisonment; on his release he went to Holland, where he met Justus Lipsius at Leyden. In Holland he attached himself to a ‘concilium peregrinantium Christianorum,’ and invited the adhesion of Sozzini. He soon moved on to Antwerp.\n\nBy 1585 he had joined Sozzini in Poland. At Cracow he fell in with John Dee and Edward Kelley, who initiated Pucci into their angelic experiences; and about the middle of 1585, despite objections from Sozzini, he accompanied them to Prague. On his arrival there, an angelic voice bade him re-enter the Roman communion, which he at once did. He wrote to Sozzini and other friends, entreating them to follow his example. Dee and Kelley suspected him of bad faith in treating against them with Roman Catholic ecclesiastics; he exculpated himself in a letter of 17 September 1585, which was printed.\n\nReverting to the theme which had caused his expulsion from Basle, he printed a treatise ‘De Christi Servatoris Efficacitate in omnibus et singulis hominibus ... Assertio Catholica,’ &c., Gouda, 1592, with a dedication to Pope Clement VIII. A ‘Refutatio’ of this ‘Satanic’ treatise was published by Lucas Osiander at Tübingen in 1593; Nicholas Serarius also published ‘Contra Novos … Puccii … Errores libri duo,’ &c., Würzburg, 1593, and there were other replies. He projected a journey to Rome, to present his book in person; but in November 1592, while on the way, he was thrown from a moving vehicle. He was for some months with a broken thigh at Salzburg, where he probably died, under arrest, in 1593.\n\n"}

{"id": "1877499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877499", "title": "Gratis versus libre", "text": "Gratis versus libre\n\nThe English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings: \"for free\" (\"gratis\") and \"with little or no restriction\" (\"libre\"). This ambiguity of \"free\" can cause issues where the distinction is important, as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents.\n\nThe terms \"gratis\" and \"libre\" may be used to categorise intellectual property, particularly computer programs, according to the licenses and legal restrictions that cover them, in the free software and open source communities, as well as the broader free culture movement. For example, they are used to distinguish freeware (software \"gratis\") from free software (software \"libre\").\n\nRichard Stallman summarised the difference in a slogan: \"Think free as in free speech, not free beer.\"\n\n\"Gratis\" in English is adopted from the various Romance and Germanic languages, ultimately descending from the plural ablative and dative form of the first-declension noun \"grātia\" in Latin. It means \"free\" in the sense that some good or service is supplied without need for payment, even though it may have value.\n\n\"Libre\" in English is adopted from the various Romance languages, ultimately descending from the Latin word \"līber\"; its origin is closely related to \"liberty\". It denotes \"the state of being free\", as in \"liberty\" or \"having freedom\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) considers \"libre\" to be obsolete, but the word has come back into limited use. Unlike \"gratis\", \"libre\" appears in few English dictionaries, although there is no other English single-word adjective signifying \"liberty\" exclusively, without also meaning \"at no monetary cost\".\n\nIn software development, where the cost of mass production is relatively small, it is common for developers to make software available at no cost. One of the early and basic forms of this model is called freeware. With freeware, software is licensed freely for regular use: the developer does not gain any monetary compensation.\n\nWith the advent of the free software movement, license schemes were created to give developers more freedom in terms of code sharing, commonly called open source or free and open-source software (called FLOSS, FOSS, or F/OSS). As the English adjective \"free\" does not distinguish between \"for free\" and \"liberty\", the phrases \"free as in freedom of speech\" (\"libre\", free software) and \"free as in free beer\" (\"gratis\", freeware) were adopted. Many in the free software movement feel strongly about the freedom to use the software, make modifications, etc., whether or not this freely usable software is to be exchanged for money. Therefore, this distinction became important.\n\nThese phrases have become common, along with \"gratis\" and \"libre\", in the software development and computer law fields for encapsulating this distinction. The distinction is similar to the distinction made in political science between positive liberty and negative liberty. Like \"free beer\", positive liberty promises equal access by all without cost or regard to income, of a given good (assuming the good exists). Like \"free speech\", negative liberty safeguards the right to use of something (in this case, speech) without regard to whether in each case there is a cost involved for this use (you still have free speech even though it costs money to acquire a newspaper).\n\nIn order to reflect real-world differences in the degree of open access, the distinction between gratis open access and libre open access was added in 2006 by two of the co-drafters of the original Budapest Open Access Initiative definition of open access publishing. Gratis open access refers to online access free of charge (which Wikipedia indicates with the icon ), and libre open access refers to online access free of charge plus some additional re-use rights (Wikipedia icon ). Libre open access is equivalent to the definition of open access in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities. The re-use rights of libre OA are often specified by various specific Creative Commons licenses; these almost all require attribution of authorship to the original authors.\n\nThe original gratis/libre distinction concerns software (i.e., code), with which users can potentially do two kinds of things: 1. access and use it; and 2. modify and re-use it. \"Gratis\" pertains to being to access and use the code, without a price-barrier, while \"libre\" pertains to being to modify and re-use the code, without a permission barrier. The target content of the open access movement, however, is not software but published, peer-reviewed research journal article texts.\n\n1. Source code accessibility and use. For published research articles, the case for making their text accessible free for all online (Gratis) is even stronger than it is for software code, because in the case of software, some developers may wish to give their code away for free, while others may wish to sell it, whereas in the case of published research article texts, \"all\" their authors, without exception, give them away for free: None seek or get royalties or fees from their sale. On the contrary, any access-denial to potential users means loss of potential research impact (downloads, citations) for the author's research—and researcher-authors' employment, salary, promotion and funding depends in part on the uptake and impact of their research.\n\n2. Source code modifiability and re-use. For published research articles, the case for allowing text modification and re-use is much weaker than for software code, because, unlike software, the \"text\" of a research article is not intended for modification and re-use. (In contrast, the \"content\" of research articles is and always was intended for modification and re-use: that is how research progresses.) There are no copyright barriers to modifying, developing, building upon and re-using an author's ideas and findings, once they have been published, as long as the author and published source are credited—but modifications to the published text are another matter. Apart from verbatim quotation, scholarly/scientific authors are not in general interested in allowing other authors to create \"mashups\" of their texts. Researcher-authors are all happy to make their texts available for harvesting and indexing for search as well as data-mining, but not for re-use in altered form (without the permission of the author).\n\nThe formal analogy between open software and open access has been made, along with the generalization of the gratis/libre distinction from the one field to the other.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "198206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198206", "title": "Herman Dooyeweerd", "text": "Herman Dooyeweerd\n\nHerman Dooyeweerd (7 October 1894, Amsterdam – 12 February 1977, Amsterdam) was a professor of law and jurisprudence at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam from 1926 to 1965. He was also a philosopher and principal founder of Reformational philosophy with Dirk Vollenhoven, a significant development within the Neocalvinist (or Kuyperian) school of thought. Dooyeweerd made several contributions to philosophy and other academic disciplines concerning the nature of diversity and coherence in everyday experience, the transcendental conditions for theoretical thought, the relationship between religion, philosophy, and scientific theory, and an understanding of meaning, being, time and self. Dooyeweerd is most famous for his suite of fifteen aspects (or 'modalities', 'modal aspects', or 'modal law-spheres'), which are distinct ways in which reality exists, has meaning, is experienced, and occurs. This suite of aspects is finding application in practical analysis, research and teaching in such diverse fields as built environment, sustainability, agriculture, business, information systems and development. Danie Strauss, the editor of Dooyeweerd's Collected Works, has provided a systematic look at Dooyeweerd's philosophy here.\n\nDooyeweerd made both immanent and transcendental critiques of Western philosophy, following the traditions of Continental philosophy.\n\nIn his immanent critique, he sought to understand each philosophic thinker's work or each tradition from the inside, and uncover, in its own terms, its basic presuppositions, to reveal deep problems. By such immanent critique of philosophic thinkers from the pre-Socratic Greeks onwards through to the middle of the twentieth century (including mediaeval period, into the modern periods), Dooyeweerd claimed to have demonstrated that theoretical thinking has always been based on presuppositions of a religious nature, which he called \"ground motives\". A ground motive is a spiritual driving force that impels each thinker to interpret reality under its influence. Dooyeweerd identified four major ground-motives of Western thought, three of them dualistic in nature:\n\nThis means that theoretical thought \"never has been\" neutral or autonomous of the thinker.\n\nHowever, Dooyeweerd remained unsatisfied \"with an argument that shows that in fact philosophy always has been influenced by religious convictions\". Rather, \"He wants to show that it cannot be otherwise, because it is part of the nature of philosophy or theoretical thought.\"\n\nThis led Dooyeweerd to undertake a transcendental critique of theoretical thought, of the kind Immanuel Kant pioneered. Whereas Kant and Husserl sought the conditions that make theoretical \"thinking\" possible, they still presupposed that a theoretical \"attitude\" is possible. Dooyeweerd sought to understand the conditions that make a \"theoretical attitude\" possible, and argued that all theoretical thought takes place with reference to an \"Origin of Meaning\", which is a ground-motive to which we adhere extra-rationally. The means that theoretical thought \"never can be\" neutral or autonomous of the thinker.\n\nFrom this, Dooyeweerd argued that all \"good\" philosophy addresses three fundamental parts to an idea: \n\nThis, he proposed, can enable disparate theoretical and philosophical approaches to enter into discourse with each other, as long as each thinker openly admits their own ground-motive. Dooyeweerd, accordingly, made very explicit his own grounding in Creation-Fall-Redemption, with a neo-Calvinist flavour and a debt to Abraham Kuyper.\n\nDooyeweerd's cosmonomic philosophy is different from most extant philosophy in at least three ways, which intertwine:\n\nFirst, it takes seriously the pre-theoretical attitude of thought, as a starting point from which to begin to understand what makes theoretical thought possible. Most other philosophical thinking begins by presupposing a theoretical attitude and either ignores everyday experience or attempts to explain it theoretically, either way presupposing the possibility of theoretical thought as a way to knowledge. In making the possibility of theoretical thought a philosophical problem to address, Dooyeweerd went deeper and further than Kant, Husserl and Heidegger and others.\n\nSecond, it is rooted in different presuppositions ('ground motives') about the nature of reality, which are religious in nature. Whereas Greek philosophy is rooted in the Form/Matter divide, Scholastic thinking of mediaeval Christianity in the Nature/Grace divide, and Humanistic philosophy in the Nature/Freedom divide, Dooyeweerd began from the Biblical idea of Creation Fall and Redemption. He may be said to have explored the philosophical (rather than theological) implications of this idea. He called his philosophy 'Christian philosophy', though what usually claims that label is of a Scholastic nature and very different.\n\nThird, it posits that Meaning is more fundamental than Being or Process. Dooyeweerd expressed it:\nMeaningfulness originates in the Creator (God) rather than in sovereign human attribution. All things, not just those linked with humanity, are meaningful. Strictly, Dooyeweerd says, things \"are\", rather than \"have\", Meaning. Thus, Meaning is like an ocean in which we swim, an enabler of all our existence and functioning, rather than a property we attribute to things or words.\n\nThis has implications for science. Science – whether mathematical, natural, human or social sciences - is seen as the abstracting of certain aspects for study. For example, even though a lawyer and a biologist might study the same things (say, fingerprints), they are interested in different aspects. They are looking at the meaning of a thing with different focus, though equally concerned with what is real. Perceptions of reality through this kind of scientific attitude, selecting one aspect as distinct from others for study, will necessarily be governed by fundamental assumptions about how these various kinds of meaning are related to one another in a coherent whole, belonging within the total range of all experiences.\n\nLikewise, in everyday life, we can be aware of distinct aspects, though most of the time we function in them tacitly.\n\nThe positing of meaning as fundamental, and the priority given to our pre-theoretical experience of diverse meaning, prompts the thinker to ask, what ways are there of being meaningful, which cannot be reduced to each other? What different aspects are there of things? He delineated fifteen, which are not mere categories, but modalities (ways of being, functioning, etc.):\n\nDooyeweerd claimed that since the discovery of these is addressed by our theoretical functioning, which is fallible, no suite of aspects, including his own, can \"lay claim to material completion\".\n\nBriefly, aspects are ways of being meaningful and are the 'law side' of created reality. All that occurs does so by 'answering to' the laws of each aspect (i.e. being subject to their laws). e.g. physical waves or particles occur by the laws of the physical aspect, poetry occurs by the laws of the aesthetic aspect. Thus, each aspect or 'law sphere' may be seen as defining a distinct kind of possibility.\n\nEarlier aspects are determinative; later ones are normative. Human beings function as subject in or to all aspects, animals as subject up to the sensitive aspect, plants up to the biotic, and non-living things up to the physical. As you are reading this, you are functioning lingually by understanding it, analytically by conceptualizing, sensitively by seeing or hearing, etc. In fact, all our functioning is multi-aspectual, though some aspects might be latent.\n\nThings exist by reference to each aspect. For example, a car exists physically as a load of steel, plastic, etc., kinematically as a mode of transport, socially as a status symbol, economically as a dent in our finances, aesthetically as a thing of beauty, biotically as a polluter, pistically as an idol, and so on. The being of things is multi-aspectual in principle.\n\nKnowledge may be seen as multi-aspectual knowing. For example, analytical knowing gives categories and theories, formative knowing gives skills, lingual knowing gives 'bodies of knowledge' as found in libraries, and so on.\n\nEach aspect defines a different rationality. In this way, Dooyeweerd echoes Winch and Habermas, though with more precision.\n\n\"The following attempted to give an overview of Cosmonomic Philosophy, but was deemed insufficient, and some of its material has been used in the above. However, it is being retained for the present because it contains useful material that has not been used above but which readers might find useful.\"\n\nDooyeweerd attempted to provide a philosophy which accounted for not only the differences in non-human reality, but also, between one thinker and another. Following Abraham Kuyper, and other, earlier Neo-Calvinists, Dooyeweerd attempted to describe reality as a creation of God, which has its meaning from God. This God-given meaning is displayed in all of the aspects of temporal reality – which has implications for science.\n\nFor example, even though a lawyer and a biologist might study the same things (say, fingerprints), they are interested in different aspects. They are looking at the meaning of a thing with different focus, though equally concerned with what is real. Perceptions of reality through this kind of scientific attitude, selecting one aspect as distinct from others for study, will necessarily be governed by fundamental assumptions about how these various kinds of meaning are related to one another in a coherent whole, belonging within the total range of all experiences. Dooyeweerd argued that this showed the need for a consistent and radically Christian philosophy which he sought to provide. Furthermore, he attempted to show that even the imaginations of men are part of that same created reality, and even where misguided they cannot escape being subject to the rule of God exposed by the Christian revelation.\n\nDooyeweerd self-consciously allowed his Christian perspective to guide his understanding, but in a philosophical rather than a theological mode of thought. He believed that this permitted the philosopher to gain insight into the principle by which diversity of meaning is held together as a unity, as he directs his thought toward the origin of things, which is God, and God's purpose for making things, which is found in Christ. This basic religious orientation should affect the way that the Christian understands things. In contrast to a dualistic type of religious ground motive, Dooyeweerd suggested that the Christian's basic orientation to the world ought to be derived not from human speculation, but from God's revealed purposes: Creation, the Fall into sin, and Redemption in Christ. This Christian \"religious ground motive\" is a fundamentally different posture toward things, compared to say, the \"Form/Matter\" scheme of the Greeks, the \"Nature/Grace\" synthesis of Medieval Christianity, or the \"Nature/Freedom\" approach of the Enlightenment, all of which are orientations divided against themselves by their reliance upon two contradictory principles. While the Christian religious view of things as Created, Fallen and being Redeemed has often been blended with speculative and dualistic schemes, it has never really become fully identified with them, so that there is historical continuity in Christian thought despite the fact that it has undergone numerous significant shifts, in Dooyeweerd's view. But the fact that they are capable of being blended convincingly exposes the transcendental rules to which both false and true theories are subject.\n\nA religious ground motive is a spiritual driving force that impels each thinker to interpret reality under its influence. Dooyeweerd wrote that, in the case of thinkers who presume that human thought is autonomous, who operate by the dictum that it does not matter whether God exists or not, such a thinker's basic commitment to autonomous thought forces him to pick out some aspect of the creation as the origin of all meaning. In doing so, the supposedly autonomous thinker is made captive to a kind of idol of his own making, which bends his understanding to conform to its dictates, according to Dooyeweerd.\n\nAlthough he self-consciously exposes the religious nature of his philosophy, Dooyeweerd suggests that in fact, all thought is inescapably religious in character. This religious stamp is disguised when the supposed origin of meaning, toward which various thinkers direct their thought, is not called God, but is rather said to be some aspect of creation. This, he suggests, explains why humanistic science will produce bitterly conflicting ideologies. It helps to locate the \"antithesis\", the source of irreducible differences, between various perspectives. The \"antithesis\" must be accounted for as a foundational issue, in any complete philosophy, and this antithesis is religious in nature, according to Dooyeweerd.\n\nBorrowing language and concepts from a wide variety of philosophical schools, especially Edmund Husserl, the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism, Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms—and, as some contend, Franz Xaver von Baader, Dooyeweerd builds on this foundation of a supposed \"antithesis\" to make distinctions between one kind of thinking and another, theorizing that diverse kinds of thinking disclose diverse kinds of meaning, and that this meaning corresponds in some way to the actual state of affairs.\n\nDooyeweerd developed an anti-reductionist ontology of \"modal aspects\", concerning diverse kinds of meaning which are disclosed in the analysis of every existent thing. He considered such modes to be irreducible to each other and yet indissolubly linked. Dooyeweerd at first suggested that there were 14 modes but later postulated 15. The indissoluble coherence of these modal aspects is evinced through their analogical relationship to one another, and finally in their concentration in the central religious selfhood which has a direct relationship to its origin: God.\n\nThe majority of Dooyeweerd's published articles and multi-volume works originally appeared only in Dutch. During his lifetime efforts were already underway to make his work available to English-speakers. Translation of Dooyeweerd's writing has continued since 1994 under the oversight of the Dooyeweerd Centre (see link below). To date, thirteen books have been published in English, including his magnum opus, \"De Wijsbegeerte der Wetsidee\" (1935–6), which was revised and expanded in English as \"A New Critique of Theoretical Thought\" (1953–8).\n\nDooyeweerd's influence has continued through the \"Association for Reformational Philosophy\" and its journal \"Philosophia Reformata\" which he and Vollenhoven founded in 1932. The title of the journal is something of an arcane philosophical joke, which repristinates and shifts the meaning of the title from a 1622 book, authored by Johann Daniel Mylius, Philosophia Reformata, a compendius work on alchemy, then regarded by some as a science. There are also a number of institutions around the world that draw their inspiration from Dooyeweerd's philosophy.\n\nDooyeweerd became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948.\n\nIn a commemoration editorial appearing in the newspaper \"Trouw\" on 6 October 1964 upon the occasion of Dooyeweerd's 70th birthday, G.E. Langemeijer, Chairman of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences, professor at the University of Leiden, and appellate Attorney General lauded Dooyeweerd as \"...the most original philosopher Holland has ever produced, even Spinoza not excepted.\"\n\n\n\n\nA special issue of the journal Axiomathes was devoted to the subject of \"Philosophy and Science in the Thought of Herman Dooyeweerd\".\n\n\n\n"}

It concerns the application of his 'three modes’ (trairūpya), conditions or aspects of the middle term called \"hetu\" (\"reason\" for a conclusion) or \"linga\" (\"mark\", \"sign\" of a sound argument) in a valid inference within the Indian logico-epistemic tradition, sometimes referred to as Buddhist logic.\n\nAnacker (2005: p. 34), in introducing his English rendering of the \"Method for Argumentation (Vāda-vidhi)\" of Vasubandhu (fl. 4th century)—a text composed in Sanskrit which is now only extant in a reconstructed composite extracted from Tibetan works, collated by Frauwallner (1957)—holds that:\n\nVasubandhu's criteria for a valid inference-schema are concise and precise, and there is nothing essential omitted. Dignāga's 'wheel of justifications' (\"hetu-cakra\"), sometimes held to be the first complete Indian formulation of what constitutes the validity and invalidity of an argument, is in fact nothing of the kind: it is a pedagogic device mapping out in detail what Vasubandhu's criteria already presuppose. \nDignaga formulated the 'three modes’ (trairūpya) which are three conditions required for a logical ‘sign’ or ‘mark’ (linga), which to fulfill in order to establish the 'valid cognition' (pramana) of an 'inference' (anumana): \n\nWhen a ‘sign’ or ‘mark’ (linga) is identified, there are three possibilities: the sign may be present in all, some, or none of the \"sapakṣas\". Similarly, the sign may be present in all, some or none of the \"vipakṣas\". To identify a sign, by convention we accept the first condition as being satisfied. \n\nCombining these, Dignaga constructed his ‘Wheel of Reasons’ (Hetucakra) with nine distinct possibilities, which may be tabulated as follows (adapted from Matilal, 1998: p. 9):\n\nOf the nine possibilities within the cakra or 'wheel', Dignaga asserted that only two are illustrative of sound inference, that is they meet all three conditions, namely Numbers 2 and 8: either \"+ sapakṣa − & vipakṣa\" or \"± sapakṣa & − vipakṣa\" would fulfill the required conditions. Dignaga is insistent that at least one sapaksa must have the positive sign. Number 5 is not a case of sound inference as this is a pseudo-sign for although it satisfies the two conditions 1 and 3, it does not fulfill condition 2.\n\nDignaga required all three conditions to be met in order to establish valid cognition. The second row does not satisfy condition 2 and hence none of Numbers 4, 5, and 6 are logical signs; they are pseudo-signs. Numbers 4 and 6 are called “contradictory” pseudo-signs—an improvement upon the old \"Nyāya Sūtras\" definition of contradictory. The middle one, Number 5, is called “uniquely deviating” (asādhāraṇa), perhaps for the reason that this sign becomes a unique sign of the paksa itself, and is not found anywhere else. In Dignaga’s system, this sign cannot be a sign for anything else, it can only point to itself reflexively or to its own locus. Numbers 1, 3, 7, and 9 are also pseudo-signs. They are called the “deviating” signs, for in each case the sign occurs in some vipaksa or other, although each fulfills the second condition. This shows that, at least in Dignaga’s own view, the second condition (when it is combined with the first) gives only a necessary condition for being an adequate sign, not a sufficient one. In other words, Dignaga intended all three conditions jointly to formulate a sufficient condition.\n\n"}

As the oldest son, he was brought up to inherit the ministry of his father's parish temple. His early education included the Chinese classics and Western subjects like geography and English. In 1878, his Buddhist order sent him to Tokyo in order to study at Japan's first modern university. Before entering Tokyo University in 1881 Inoue received additional secondary education in English, history, and mathematics in the university's Preparatory School.\n\nRegistering for philosophy as single major at Tokyo University first became possible in 1881. Inoue was the first and only student in 1881 to do so. As a student, Inoue initiated Japan's first Society of Philosophy (1884). On the occasion of his graduation in 1885, he created a Philosophy Ceremony that commemorated Buddha, Confucius, Socrates and Kant as the Four Sages of world philosophy. In 1887, he set up a Philosophy Publishing House , edited the first issue of the \"Journal of the Philosophy Society\"and founded the Philosophy Academy , the predecessor of today's Toyo University . His early works \"Epitome of Philosophy\"(1886/86) and \"Outline of Ethics\"(1887) are the first Japanese introductions to philosophy in East and West.\n\nBesides establishing and popularizing philosophy, Inoue dedicated himself as a lay scholar to the critique of Christianity and the reform of Buddhism. The latter project he announced in the \"Prolegomena to a Living Discourse on Buddhism\"(1887), which is the introduction to a tripartite work that aimed to give Buddhism a new doctrinal foundation for the modern world. In the \"Prolegomena\" Inoue first proclaimed his lifelong slogan \"Protection of Country and Love of Truth\" . Inoue attempted to demonstrate Buddhism's consistency with philosophical and scientific truth and its benefit to the modern Japanese nation state.\n\nIn 1888, Inoue departed on his first of three world tours. The nationalist spirit he observed in the Western imperial countries and the promulgation of the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890) after his return, gave Inoue's maxim of the Protection of Country concrete meaning. The spread of the Education Rescript as the moral foundation of the rising Japanese Empire became one of his main objectives for the rest of his life.\n\nIn his lectures at the Philosophy Academy, Inoue pioneered several academic fields. Inoue's lecture records which were published as textbooks for the Academy's distance learning program cover subjects like Psychology, Pedagogy, Religious Studies, Buddhist Philosophy and the original science Inoue called Mystery Studies . In a large-scale project, he recorded, categorized and rationally explained every kind of folk belief and superstition he heard about in Japan. This ambitious program made him famous among his contemporaries as Doctor Specter .\n\nInoue managed the Philosophy Academy as an institution that promoted the revival of Eastern scholarship. Most pioneers of modern Buddhist studies were lecturing in the Academy. Inoue interpreted his role as a lobbyist for Buddhism in the capital and worked to consolidate the position of private education with the Ministry of Education. In 1896, Inoue was the first to be awarded a Doctor of Letters by submitting a thesis to the Faculty of Literature of Tokyo Imperial University.\n\nWhile Inoue was on his second world tour, the so-called Philosophy Academy Incident (1903/04) took its course. Inspectors from the Education Ministry became aware that one student received a full score in the ethics examination for answering that regicide under certain circumstances could be legitimate. The ministry threatened to close down the Academy, demanded that the responsible teacher resign and withdrew the Academy's right to grant certificates for teaching in public schools.\n\nIn the years after the Philosophy Academy Incident several factors played together which eventually led to Inoue's resignation from the Academy in 1905/06: (1) internal differences about the Academy's management, (2) estrangement from other Buddhist leaders, (3) health problems.\n\nDuring the same period, Inoue started two new projects that became seminal for his late activities: the foundation of the Morality Church (1903) and the building of the Philosophy Hall (1904).\n\nStarting in 1890, lecture tours were important for Inoue to raise funds for the Philosophy Academy. After 1906, the fund raising served to create the Temple Garden of Philosophy around the Philosophy Hall in today's Nakano District in Tokyo. Inoue started his lecture tours during his late period in the name of the Morality Church initiative, which aimed at establishing Sunday schools in shrines and temples all over the country. In 1912, he renamed the organization into the Society for the Spread of Civic Morality . The venue of his lectures moved away from temples into primary schools. The main objective however stayed the same, namely teaching national morals and spreading the Imperial Rescript on Education. It was Inoue's ambition to lecture literally everywhere in Japan. During his late life, he extended his radius to the new Japanese colonies in Korea, Manchuria, Hokkaidō, Sakhalin, Okinawa, Taiwan, and China.\n\nInoue died on June 6 1919 after giving a lecture in Dalian, China.\n\nBelow is a list of Inoue's monographs. Not included are travel diaries, lecture records, texts in Chinese, primary school textbooks, and essay collections. The listed works are accessible via the Inoue Enryo Research Database.\n\n\nDuring his lifetime, Inoue was a widely read author, of whom more than ten books were translated into Chinese. His works were influential in spreading the terminology of modern East Asian humanities. Due to his prolific writing, the distance learning program of the Philosophy Academy and his lectures tours, Inoue probably had a larger audience than any other public intellectual before the First World War. He must have contributed considerably to the decline of superstition and the spread of the imperial ideology during the late Meiji period.\n\nHis prominence during his lifetime stands in stark contrast to the minimal attention paid to his work after his death. His uncritical speculative metaphysics and his ethics being based solely on imperially decreed virtues, make any future affirmative philosophical reception unlikely. Japanese Buddhist studies have passed over Inoue, because his Buddhist scholarship was not yet based on Sanskrit philology. Any philosophical discussion about the doctrinal foundations of Buddhism will nonetheless have to acknowledge Inoue's pioneering work.\n\nToyo University, Tokyo University's Society of Philosophy, and the Temple Garden of Philosophy are Inoue's lasting institutional heritage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "169262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169262", "title": "Intuitionistic logic", "text": "Intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic, sometimes more generally called constructive logic, refers to systems of symbolic logic that differ from the systems used for classical logic by more closely mirroring the notion of constructive proof. In particular, systems of intuitionistic logic do not include the law of the excluded middle and double negation elimination, which are fundamental inference rules in classical logic. Intuitionistic logic is one example of a logic in a family of non-classical logics called paracomplete logics: logics that refuse to tautologically affirm the law of the excluded middle.\n\nFormalized intuitionistic logic was originally developed by Arend Heyting to provide a formal basis for Brouwer's programme of intuitionism. From a proof-theoretic perspective, Heyting’s calculus is a restriction of classical logic in which the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination have been removed. Excluded middle and double negation elimination can still be proved for some propositions on a case by case basis, however, but do not hold universally as they do with classical logic.\n\nSeveral systems of semantics for intuitionistic logic have been studied. One of these semantics mirrors classical Boolean-valued semantics but uses Heyting algebras in place of Boolean algebras. Another semantics uses Kripke models. These, however, are technical means for studying Heyting’s deductive system rather than formalizations of Brouwer’s original informal semantic intuitions. Semantical systems claiming to capture such intuitions, due to offering meaningful concepts of “constructive truth” (rather than merely validity or provability), are Gödel’s dialectica interpretation, Kleene’s realizability, Medvedev’s logic of finite problems, or Japaridze’s computability logic. Yet such semantics persistently induce logics properly stronger than Heyting’s logic. Some authors have argued that this might be an indication of inadequacy of Heyting’s calculus itself, deeming the latter incomplete as a constructive logic.\n\nIn the semantics of classical logic, propositional formulae are assigned truth values from the two-element set formula_1 (\"true\" and \"false\" respectively), regardless of whether we have direct evidence for either case. This is referred to as the 'law of excluded middle', because it excludes the possibility of any truth value besides 'true' or 'false'. In contrast, propositional formulae in intuitionistic logic are \"not\" assigned a definite truth value and are \"only\" considered \"true\" when we have direct evidence, hence \"proof\". (We can also say, instead of the propositional formula being \"true\" due to direct evidence, that it is inhabited by a proof in the Curry–Howard sense.) Operations in intuitionistic logic therefore preserve justification, with respect to evidence and provability, rather than truth-valuation .\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a commonly-used tool in developing approaches to constructivism in mathematics. The use of constructivist logics in general has been a controversial topic among mathematicians and philosophers (see, for example, the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy). A common objection to their use is the above-cited lack of two central rules of classical logic, the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination. These are considered to be so important to the practice of mathematics that David Hilbert wrote of them: \"Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists. To prohibit existence statements and the principle of excluded middle is tantamount to relinquishing the science of mathematics altogether.\" \n\nDespite the serious challenges presented by the inability to utilize the valuable rules of excluded middle and double negation elimination, intuitionistic logic has practical use. One reason for this is that its restrictions produce proofs that have the existence property, making it also suitable for other forms of mathematical constructivism. Informally, this means that if there is a constructive proof that an object exists, that constructive proof may be used as an algorithm for generating an example of that object, a principle known as the Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and algorithms. One reason that this particular aspect of intuitionistic logic is so valuable is that it enables practitioners to utilize a wide range of computerized tools, known as proof assistants. These tools assist their users in the verification (and generation) of large-scale proofs, whose size usually precludes the usual human-based checking that goes into publishing and reviewing a mathematical proof. As such, the use of proof assistants (such as Agda or Coq) is enabling modern mathematicians and logicians to develop and prove extremely complex systems, beyond those which are feasible to create and check solely by hand. One example of a proof which was impossible to formally verify before the advent of these tools is the famous proof of the four color theorem. This theorem stumped mathematicians for more than a hundred years, until a proof was developed which ruled out large classes of possible counterexamples, yet still left open enough possibilities that a computer program was needed to finish the proof. That proof was controversial for some time, but it was finally verified using Coq.\n\nThe syntax of formulas of intuitionistic logic is similar to propositional logic or first-order logic. However, intuitionistic connectives are not definable in terms of each other in the same way as in classical logic, hence their choice matters. In intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) it is customary to use →, ∧, ∨, ⊥ as the basic connectives, treating ¬\"A\" as an abbreviation for . In intuitionistic first-order logic both quantifiers ∃, ∀ are needed.\n\nIntuitionistic logic can be understood as a weakening of classical logic, meaning that it is more conservative in what it allows a reasoner to infer, while not permitting any new inferences that could not be made under classical logic. Each theorem of intuitionistic logic is a theorem in classical logic, but not conversely. Many tautologies in classical logic are not theorems in intuitionistic logic - in particular, as said above one of its chief points is to not affirm the law of the excluded middle so as to vitiate the use of non-constructive proof by contradiction which can be used to furnish existence claims without providing explicit examples of the objects that it proves exist. We say \"not affirm\" because while it is not necessarily true that the law is upheld in any context, no counterexample can be given: such a counterexample would be an inference (inferring the negation of the law for a certain proposition) disallowed under classical logic and thus is not allowed in a strict weakening like intuitionistic logic. Indeed, the double negation of the law is retained as a tautology of the system: that is, it is a theorem that formula_2 regardless of the proposition formula_3.\n\nGentzen discovered that a simple restriction of his system LK (his sequent calculus for classical logic) results in a system which is sound and complete with respect to intuitionistic logic. He called this system LJ. In LK any number of formulas is allowed to appear on the conclusion side of a sequent; in contrast LJ allows at most one formula in this position.\n\nOther derivatives of LK are limited to intuitionistic derivations but still allow multiple conclusions in a sequent. LJ' is one example.\n\nIntuitionistic logic can be defined using the following Hilbert-style calculus. This is similar to a way of axiomatizing classical propositional logic.\n\nIn propositional logic, the inference rule is modus ponens\nand the axioms are\nTo make this a system of first-order predicate logic, the generalization rules\nare added, along with the axioms\n\nIf one wishes to include a connective formula_30 for negation rather than consider it an abbreviation for formula_31, it is enough to add:\n\nThere are a number of alternatives available if one wishes to omit the connective formula_34 (false). For example, one may replace the three axioms FALSE, NOT-1', and NOT-2' with the two axioms\nas at Propositional calculus#Axioms. Alternatives to NOT-1 are formula_37 or formula_38.\n\nThe connective formula_39 for equivalence may be treated as an abbreviation, with formula_40 standing for formula_41. Alternatively, one may add the axioms\n\n\nIFF-1 and IFF-2 can, if desired, be combined into a single axiom formula_45 using conjunction.\n\nThe system of classical logic is obtained by adding any one of the following axioms:\n\n\nIn general, one may take as the extra axiom any classical tautology that is not valid in the two-element Kripke frame formula_51 (in other words, that is not included in Smetanich's logic).\n\nAnother relationship is given by the Gödel–Gentzen negative translation, which provides an embedding of classical first-order logic into intuitionistic logic: a first-order formula is provable in classical logic if and only if its Gödel–Gentzen translation is provable intuitionistically. Therefore, intuitionistic logic can instead be seen as a means of extending classical logic with constructive semantics.\n\nIn 1932, Kurt Gödel defined a system of logics intermediate between classical and intuitionistic logic; Gödel logics are concomitantly known as intermediate logics.\n\nIn classical propositional logic, it is possible to take one of conjunction, disjunction, or implication as primitive, and define the other two in terms of it together with negation, such as in Łukasiewicz's three axioms of propositional logic. It is even possible to define all four in terms of a sole sufficient operator such as the Peirce arrow (NOR) or Sheffer stroke (NAND). Similarly, in classical first-order logic, one of the quantifiers can be defined in terms of the other and negation.\n\nThese are fundamentally consequences of the law of bivalence, which makes all such connectives merely Boolean functions. The law of bivalence does not hold in intuitionistic logic, only the law of non-contradiction. As a result, none of the basic connectives can be dispensed with, and the above axioms are all necessary. Most of the classical identities are only theorems of intuitionistic logic in one direction, although some are theorems in both directions. They are as follows:\n\nConjunction versus disjunction:\nConjunction versus implication:\nDisjunction versus implication:\nUniversal versus existential quantification:\n\nSo, for example, \"a or b\" is a stronger propositional formula than \"if not a, then b\", whereas these are classically interchangeable. On the other hand, \"not (a or b)\" is equivalent to \"not a, and also not b\".\n\nIf we include equivalence in the list of connectives, some of the connectives become definable from others:\nIn particular, {∨, ↔, ⊥} and {∨, ↔, ¬} are complete bases of intuitionistic connectives.\n\nAs shown by Alexander Kuznetsov, either of the following connectives – the first one ternary, the second one quinary – is by itself functionally complete: either one can serve the role of a sole sufficient operator for intuitionistic propositional logic, thus forming an analog of the Sheffer stroke from classical propositional logic:\n\nThe semantics are rather more complicated than for the classical case. A model theory can be given by Heyting algebras or, equivalently, by Kripke semantics. Recently, a Tarski-like model theory was proved complete by Bob Constable, but with a different notion of completeness than classically.\n\nUnproved statements in intuitionistic logic are not given an intermediate truth value (as is sometimes mistakenly asserted). One can prove that such statements have no third truth value, a result dating back to Glivenko in 1928. Instead they remain of unknown truth value, until they are either proved or disproved. Statements are disproved by deducing a contradiction from them.\n\nA consequence of this point of view is that intuitionistic logic has no interpretation as a two-valued logic, nor even as a finite-valued logic, in the familiar sense. Although intuitionistic logic retains the trivial propositions formula_1 from classical logic, each \"proof\" of a propositional formula is considered a valid propositional value, thus by Heyting's notion of propositions-as-sets, propositional formulae are (potentially non-finite) sets of their proofs.\n\nIn classical logic, we often discuss the truth values that a formula can take. The values are usually chosen as the members of a Boolean algebra. The meet and join operations in the Boolean algebra are identified with the ∧ and ∨ logical connectives, so that the value of a formula of the form \"A\" ∧ \"B\" is the meet of the value of \"A\" and the value of \"B\" in the Boolean algebra. Then we have the useful theorem that a formula is a valid proposition of classical logic if and only if its value is 1 for every valuation—that is, for any assignment of values to its variables.\n\nA corresponding theorem is true for intuitionistic logic, but instead of assigning each formula a value from a Boolean algebra, one uses values from an Heyting algebra, of which Boolean algebras are a special case. A formula is valid in intuitionistic logic if and only if it receives the value of the top element for any valuation on any Heyting algebra.\n\nIt can be shown that to recognize valid formulas, it is sufficient to consider a single Heyting algebra whose elements are the open subsets of the real line R. In this algebra we have:\n\nwhere int(\"X\") is the interior of \"X\" and \"X\" its complement.\n\nThe last identity concerning \"A\" → \"B\" allows us to calculate the value of ¬\"A\":\n\nWith these assignments, intuitionistically valid formulas are precisely those that are assigned the value of the entire line. For example, the formula ¬(\"A\" ∧ ¬\"A\") is valid, because no matter what set \"X\" is chosen as the value of the formula \"A\", the value of ¬(\"A\" ∧ ¬\"A\") can be shown to be the entire line:\n\nSo the valuation of this formula is true, and indeed the formula is valid. But the law of the excluded middle, \"A\" ∨ ¬\"A\", can be shown to be \"invalid\" by using a specific value of the set of positive real numbers for \"A\":\n\nThe interpretation of any intuitionistically valid formula in the infinite Heyting algebra described above results in the top element, representing true, as the valuation of the formula, regardless of what values from the algebra are assigned to the variables of the formula. Conversely, for every invalid formula, there is an assignment of values to the variables that yields a valuation that differs from the top element. No finite Heyting algebra has both these properties.\n\nBuilding upon his work on semantics of modal logic, Saul Kripke created another semantics for intuitionistic logic, known as Kripke semantics or relational semantics.\n\nIt was discovered that Tarski-like semantics for intuitionistic logic were not possible to prove complete. However, Robert Constable has shown that a weaker notion of completeness still holds for intuitionistic logic under a Tarski-like model. In this notion of completeness we are concerned not with all of the statements that are true of every model, but with the statements that are true \"in the same way\" in every model. That is, a single proof that the model judges a formula to be true must be valid for every model. In this case, there is not only a proof of completeness, but one that is valid according to intuitionistic logic.\n\nIntuitionistic logic is related by duality to a paraconsistent logic known as \"Brazilian\", \"anti-intuitionistic\" or \"dual-intuitionistic logic\".\n\nThe subsystem of intuitionistic logic with the FALSE axiom removed is known as minimal logic.\n\nKurt Gödel's work involving many-valued logic showed in 1932 that intuitionistic logic is not a finite-valued logic. (See the section titled Heyting algebra semantics above for an infinite-valued logic interpretation of intuitionistic logic.)\n\nAny finite Heyting algebra which is not equivalent to a Boolean algebra defines (semantically) an intermediate logic. On the other hand, validity of formulae in pure intuitionistic logic is not tied to any individual Heyting algebra but relates to any and all Heyting algebras at the same time.\n\nAny formula of the intuitionistic propositional logic may be translated into the normal modal logic S4 as follows:\n\nand it has been demonstrated that the translated formula is valid in the propositional modal logic S4 if and only if the original formula is valid in IPC. The above set of formulae are called the Gödel–McKinsey–Tarski translation.\n\nThere is also an intuitionistic version of modal logic S4 called Constructive Modal Logic CS4.\n\nThere is an extended Curry–Howard isomorphism between IPC and simply-typed lambda calculus.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7244181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7244181", "title": "István Mészáros (philosopher)", "text": "István Mészáros (philosopher)\n\nIstván Mészáros (, ; 19 December 1930 – 1 October 2017) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher. Described as \"one of the foremost political philosophers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries\" by \"Monthly Review\", Mészáros wrote mainly about the possibility of a transition from capitalism to socialism. His \"magnum opus\", \"Beyond Capital: Toward a Theory of Transition\" (1995), was concerned not only with this theme but aimed to construct an analysis of the current capitalist society and its \"structural crisis\". He was also interested to critique the so-called \"bourgeois ideology\", including the idea of \"there is no alternative\", and to analyse the failures of \"real socialism\".\n\nMészáros was born in Budapest, Hungary. He was raised by his single mother and his maternal grandmother, and at age twelve falsified his birth date to work along with his mother in an airplane factory building engines. The poor working conditions would later arise \"his lifelong hatred of exploitation and oppression\". When he was 15 or 16, Mészáros was introduced to the Marxist philosophy during visits to a bookshop. After having contact with Karl Marx's \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon\", Friedrich Engels's \"Anti-Dühring\", and Marx and Engels's \"The Communist Manifesto\", he became interested in the works of Georg Lukács about Hungarian literature. Mészáros liked Lukács's works \"so much\" that he even sold personal belongings to buy them and decided to enter the University of Budapest. He did so in 1949 when he won a scholarship with the emergence of a Communist state in Hungary. \n\nAt the university, he affiliated himself to the so-called \"Budapest School\", a group of Hungarian philosophers who were taught or influenced by Lukács, including Ágnes Heller and György Márkus. During this period, Lukács was very criticised by the Hungarian Communist Party and Mátyás Rákosi's government banned some of his works between 1949 and the mid-1950s. Because of his allegiance to Lukács and his attendance of Lukács's seminars, Mészáros almost got expelled from the university. Later, Lukács nominated Mészáros as his assistant at the Institute of Aesthetics because of his public contestation of the censorship of Mihály Vörösmarty's play \"Csongor és Tünde\" denounced as a \"pessimist aberration\". His pro-Vörösmarty essay, published in the literary magazine \"Csillag\", earned him the 1951 Attila József Prize and helped the reincorporation of the play in the National Theatre's repertoire.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Mészáros was an active member of the Hungarian Writers' Union and was involved in artistic and literary circles, notably in the anti-Stalnist Petőfi circle—a group associated with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. This interest for cultural issues reverberated in his 1955 doctoral dissertation in philosophy entitled \"Szatíra és valóság\" (\"Satire and Reality\"). In the following year, he was made editor of the cultural magazine \"Eszmélet\", created by Lukács, composer Zoltán Kodály, and other personalities. Mészáros was also chosen to be an associate professor of philosophy and Lukács's successor at the Institute of Aesthetics. However, after the defeat of the revolution and Lukács's imprisonment for supporting it, Mészáros verified that \"there was no hope for socialist transformation in Hungary\". So, after the Soviet invasion in 1956, he left the country, becoming one of the first citizens from a Communist country to criticise Stalinism.\n\nMészáros moved to Italy and was a professor at the University of Turin. During his time in Turin, he wrote a book of memoirs about the Hungarian uprising titled \"La rivolta degli intellettuali in Ungheria\" (\"The Revolt of the Intellectuals in Hungary\") that was published in 1958 by Giulio Einaudi Editore. He worked in Italy until moving to the United Kingdom, where he worked at Bedford College, London (1959–1961) and the University of St. Andrews (1961–1966). In 1964, he released the book \"Attila József e l'arte moderna\" through the Milanese publisher . He joined the University of Sussex in 1966, where he held the Chair of Philosophy. His 1970 book \"Marx's Theory of Alienation\" established his reputation in the English-speaking world, and won him that year Isaac Deutscher Memorial Prize. Receiving the award, he got the opportunity to do the first Isaac Deutscher Memorial Lecture at the London School of Economics in the following year. Originally conceived as \"Alienation and Social Control\" in late 1970, the lecture was renamed \"The Necessity of Social Control\". In 1971, it appeared under the title \"Alienation and the Necessity of Social Control\" in the \"Socialist Register\", and was also published by Merlin Press in book-format as \"The Necessity of Social Control\". \n\nIn late 1972, Mészáros was appointed professor of philosophy to teach political theory courses at York University, Toronto, and then resigned his position at Sussex. However, he had his visa refused by the Canadian government because his entry was not \"in the best interests of the country\" and he posed a \"security risk\". Sussex's fellows Tom Bottomore, Roy Edgeley and Laurence Lerner spoke against the government decision, as well as did York university officials, and 30 University of British Columbia's faculty members and students led by historian Jan M. Bak. After allegadely accusations of being a \"Russian spy\" for KGB, a letter to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau by political scientist C. B. Macpherson, Mészáros's deportation, and the change of immigration minister from Bryce Mackasey to Bob Andras, Mészáros was allowed to enter Canada legally in January 1973. After that, he worked as a senior professor of York's Social and Political Thought Program for three years before returning to Sussex.\n\nMészáros collected and edited thirteen 1958–1976 essays by Philippine historian Renato Constantino in a book titled \"Neo-Colonial Identity and Counter-Consciousness: Essays in Cultural Decolonisation\". First published by Merlin Press in 1978 and then by M. E. Sharpe in 1979, it contained a 23-page introduction, which would be later re-published in \"Journal of Contemporary Asia\" as a part of a tribute done in 2000 after Constantino's death.\n\nMészaros was appointed emeritus professor by Sussex in 1991, and he won the Lukács Prize in 1992. In 1995, he retired from Sussex, was nominated for the Michael Harrington Award for his work \"Beyond Capital\", and was also elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the late 1990s, he became an advisor to \"Monthly Review\" editors Harry Magdoff and John Bellamy Foster, and also contributed to the magazine and its parent Monthly Review Press.\n\nIn 2009, he won the Venezuelan Premio Libertador al Pensamiento Crítico (\"Libertador Prize for Critical Thinking\") for his work \"The Challenge and Burden of Historical Time\". After this work, he also published the two-volume critique of \"bourgeois ideology\" \"Social Structure and Forms of Consciousnes\": \"The Social Determination of Method\" in 2010 and \"The Dialectic of Structure and History\" in 2011. Following the publication of latter, he planned to write a sequel for \"Beyond Capital\", entitled \"Beyond Leviathan: Critique of the State\". Meszáros drafted three volumes, \"The Historic Challenge\", \"The Harsh Reality\", and \"The Necessary Alternative\", with the first volume almost completed. However, in 2017, he died in Margate, where he was being cared for after a stroke in September made him leave his home in Ramsgate, Kent.\n\nMészáros was a critic of politicians and philosophers who constantly used the sentence \"there is no alternative\". Usually associated with conservative figures like Margaret Thatcher, Mészáros stated it reached Labour parties, Communist statesmen like Mikhail Gorbachev, and former radicals turned post-modernists. Because of this, he believed Jean-Paul Sartre was an important philosopher to whom \"Marxists owed a great debt to\". Critical of Sartre's existentialism, Mészáros praised his opposition to the \"there is no alternative\" motto and affirmed, \"I don't embrace his ideas but I embrace the aim\". Mészáros declared, \"Sartre was a man who always preached the diametrical opposite: there is an alternative, there must be an alternative; you as an individual have to rebel against this power, this monstrous power of capital. Marxists on the whole failed to voice that side\". This was reflected on Mészáros's \"The Work of Sartre: Search for Freedom\", first published in 1979 and expanded in 2012 with a new section, \"The Challenge of History\".\n\nMészáros believed it was important to do a distinction between capitalism and capital to theorise about a transition to socialism. He posited that capital appeared \"thousand of years\" prior to capitalism and that it can continue without capitalism, which is the case of Soviet Union (USSR) in his understanding. In this sense, a revolutionary upheaval can overthrow capitalism in a limited area by the expropriation of the capitalist class, but the power of capital can still control the system through the division of labour and the \"hierarchical command structure of capital\". Mészáros defined capital as \"command system whose mode of functioning is accumulation-oriented\". In his conception, the extraction of surplus value can be done in a \"political way\"—like in the case of USSR—or through \"an economically regulated extraction of surplus labour and surplus value\"—like in the West. Mészáros argued that the acummulation process \"was done in a very improper fashion from the point of view of productivity\" and in a 1982 essay said that it would eventually collpse because of this fact—and not because of US-backed anticommunist military policies.\n\nMészáros met the Italian Donatella Morisi in 1955 in Paris, and married her on 14 February 1956. They had three children: Laura, born 1956; Susie, born 1960; and Giorgio, born 1962. They were married until Donatella died in 2007.\n\n\n"}

His commitment to French Resistance and to the protection of persecuted Jews earned him the recognition of Yad Vashem as a \"Righteous Among the Nations.\" He died in Die on 23 July 2001.\n\nJacques Martin was born on 24 June 1906 in Sainte-Colombe, Rhône where his father was teaching. His grandfather was a methodist minister. From 1923 to 1927, he studied at the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris. There he became friends with André Trocmé, who was a few years older than him. He also met another student, Henri Roser, whose militant pacifist and internationalist ideas shook French protestant society of that time. Jacques Martin then became a pacifist himself, and wished to contribute personally to international reconciliation, starting with France and Germany. \nHe crisscrossed Germany walking through the 1925 summer. As a member of the French branch of the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF, which is casually referred to as the “Fédé”), he took part in the 1926 German gathering of the WSCF. The same year he took charge of the editing of “Cahiers de la Réconciliation » (at the time a simple information bulletin which would be taken over and developed by Henri Roser from November 1927 on).\nIn 1927, he took part in an \"international reconciliation youth camp\" in Vaumarcus, Switzerland, studied one semester in Berlin in 1929, where he got in touch with German pacifist Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze. In 1930, he welcomed Gandhi in Paris. From 1930 to 1932 he was the secretary of the WSCF.\n\nIn spite of his pacifist convictions, Jacques Martin performed military service in 1927-1928 - out of care for his father who had just been shaken by the loss of two sons. However, in December 1930, he returned his military papers, specifying that, as a Christian, he could not bear arms. In 1932, he refused to take part in a training session of the military reserve force and he was consequently arrested, tried and condemned to 12 months in prison on 11 October 1932.\nOn 23 janvier 1934, Jacques Martin married Jacqueline Élié in Alès.\nIn the summer of 1934, the young couple was expecting its first child when a new call-in letter arrived for a new follow-up military training, which he again refused to attend. He is arrested in the midst of the “Fédé”’s summer camp, and condemned to another 18 months in prison in February 1935. He was released in January 1936 and again briefly imprisoned in 1937, 1938 and 1939. His only companions on this harsh road of conscience objection were at this stage a protestant theology student, Philippe Vernier and a protestant primary school teacher Camille Rombault. His failing health ensured his definitive exemption from military service before the start of WWII.\n\nJacques Martin turned each of his trials into a platform to advertise for conscience objection. His defence counsel was solicitor and socialist MP André Philip, who called upon leading intellectuals like Jean Guéhenno or Marc Sangnier and upon representatives of the French Human Rights League. As early as 1928, Martin had temporarily given up on his career in church ministry because of the staunch opposition of institutional protestantism towards his pacifist and anti-militaristic positions. In 1938, still unable to become a pastor, he accepted a position of administrative and human resources director in a silk stockings manufacturing plant in Ganges, Hérault.\n\nIn the wake of the first Vichy anti-Jewish legislation by Marshall Pétain’s government on 3 October 1940, Jacques Martin decided jointly with Ganges’ pastor Élie Gounelle to call for a regional meeting of all protestant pastors in the area, in order to pray and reflect on the new situation, including the apparent support apparently extended to the Vichy government by the church authorities – including, at that early stage, by the president of the Protestant Federation of France, pastor Marc Boegner. According to Jacques Martin’s own account, the day was “dedicated to the problem of anti-Semitism or rather to anti-Semitism and the Bible”. A second such meeting, in November 1942, would be organised to respond to the new situation created by the roundups of 26 August 1942 in the southern zone of France. In both of these meetings, Jacques Martin shared a very well-informed and accurate documentation which allowed pastors to prepare themselves for resistance to the anti-Semitic policy of the Vichy regime. \nAt the same time, the Martins had joined the CIMADE in close cooperation with Madeleine Barot. They intervened in several ways: supplying packages with food or warm clothes for the Gurs internment camp internees, sheltering fleeing Jews and routing them towards safe caches or appropriate underground escape routes, forging identity cards and ration tickets for the hidden Jews. They also hid Jacques’ brother-in-law, pastor André Trocmé when he had to go underground in their family house in Drôme. On 22 June 1944, Jacques Martin was reported to the police by his direct neighbour. He was arrested by the Milice and detained in Montpellier’s prison. Strangely, the local Resistance managed to negotiate his release in exchange for a flock of 1’000 sheep. He was freed three days before the liberation of his area. \nDuring the war years he became friends with historian Jules Isaac who had sought refuge in Ganges.\n\nAfter the war, Jacques Martin was back in touch with the « Social Christians », a mainly protestant movement seeking to join together evangelism and care for the poorer classes of society; after meeting with Élie Gounelle at “Musée Social “ (a Parisian think tank), he prepared the relaunching of the movement and of its magazine, the “Revue du Christianisme Social”. He also organised the 25th Christian Social Congress in Paris.\n\nIn 1948, he participated in the creation of the French branch of the International Council of Christians and Jews, called les Amitiés judéo-chrétiennes (A.J.C. - Jewish Christian Friendships) whose first president was catholic theologian Henri-Irénée Marrou, while Jacques Martin was both the first vice-president and the AJC bulletin’s editor.\nWhile continuing with its commitments with the CIMADE, A.J.C., and Social Christians, Jacques Martin still didn’t apply to become a pastor although the institutional opposition had then faded away. (Henri Roser was for instance now in charge of a parish.) He preferred to experience the position of a \"committed layman\".\n\nFrom 1947 to 1950, he ran a bookshop in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon where he also taught Latin at the Collège Cévenol, then from 1950 to 1966 he ran another bookshop in Lyon.\n\nOn 29 March 1966, he welcomed Martin Luther King on his visit in Lyon.\nFinally he felt the need to \"bind the sheaf\" and was ordained on 9 January 1966 by the French Reformed Church (after a last hesitation from the institution, as the candidate is already 60!) and took a position with the Geneva state church. He is put in charge of the creation of a new parish in a newly built area of the greater Geneva. This parish is now known as the Centre Communautaire Protestant du Lignon.\nHaving retired in 1973, he still performed pastoral tasks in Mens from 1973 to 1977, and finally took full retirement in the area of Die, still acting as a substitute pastor in case of vacancies).\n\nHe died in Die on 23 July 2001. His wife had died 5 years earlier on 30 September 1996. They had had six children: André (1934-1934), Violaine (born 1937), Daniel (born 1937), Amy-Christiane (1939-1945), Jean-Marc (born 1941) et Ariane (born 1950).\n\nAfter WWII, he was awarded the Croix de guerre in tribute to his fight \"to help Compulsory Work Service dodgers, les réfractaires, les maquisards and all victims of enemy repression.\"!\nOn 22 June 1998, Yad Vashem awarded the recognition of « Righteous Among the Nations» both to pastor Jacques Martin and to his wife Jacqueline.\n\nProbably unique among pacifists, Jacques Martin was \"one of the very few\" who rejected the \"hopes of a nebulous French-German reconciliation\" stemming from the Munich agreement and who therefore were immediately \"in Resistance\", according to Jacques Martin’s own words in 1938: \"I remain more than ever non-violent. But I do not harbour any confusion between non-violence and non-resistance. Non-violence means placing resistance on another level than the test of military forces. This resistance is necessary… ».\"\nIn a context where justifications of anti-Semitism abound, sometimes even from protestants, Jacques Martin published in August 1939 an article entitled « Pagan … and Christian anti-Semitism” (L’Antisémitisme païen… et chrétien). In its first part, the article gives a detailed list, country by country, of anti-Semitic persecutions in Europe, while the second part deals with the Christians’ attitude and sometimes responsibility. Referring to the traditional Christian accusation of Jewish deicide, he asks : « Who does not reject Christ ? Does Christianity not bear the same responsibility than the Jews for the crucifixion of its Master ? Is our own so-called Christian civilisation not bearing more witness of a deeper and more serious rejection and blasphemy than the shouts of a versatile crowd or the calculations of a sanhedrin lost in its clericalism and its pride? ».\n\nWith their two pastoral meeting held in Ganges, Jacques Martin and Elie Gounelle prepared their colleagues to exert solidarity towards the persecuted Jews. « We had gathered all the pastors of this area of the Cevennes to study this question. These were necessary preliminaries. Caring for the Jews didn’t happen spontaneously, not even from the camisards’ memory ! A long preparation phase, a reflection were needed first, often in opposition with certain protestant theological concepts, where Judaism was regarded as a mere preamble to Christianity, whereas there was a real spiritual problem, alongside a humanitarian situation from 1942 onwards ». For these meetings, Jacques Martin had gathered very significant documentation, first on the events on the ground which he had ample information about through the Cimade network and through other pastors operating on the ground like Henri Manen, then on the Vichy anti-Semitic laws through articles found in the Swiss protestant Press and in internal French protestant churches texts, like the .\n\nWith a few of his fellow protestant theology students, Jacques Martin was a pionnier of pacifism in France ; in 1923, he was the first editor of the review of \"Mouvement international de la réconciliation\" (MIR), the French branch of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation. \nAt his two trials, Jacques Martin was defended by sollicitor André Philip, who also defended Camille Rombault and Philippe Vernier. All these trials for draft dodging made big headlines in 1932 and 1933. André Philip used them as platforms for conscientious objectors, developing his arguments further at each trial. He called upon pastors such as Marc Boegner, Henri Nick, André Trocmé and Charles Westphal and leading intellectuals such as Marc Sangnier, Jean Guehenno and Julien Benda. These trials were a wake-up call for French society and foremost for the French protestants who not only became more visible on the national scene at this occasion but whose internal opinion was also shifted at the same time. In 1948, the French Reformed Church officially adopted the position that conscientious objection was legitimate and requested the State to grant a legal status to conscientious objectors; the French Catholic Church will wait until 1965 to take the same position.\n"}

{"id": "15102027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15102027", "title": "John Russon", "text": "John Russon\n\nJohn Russon (born 1960) is a Canadian philosopher, working primarily in the tradition of Continental Philosophy. In 2006, he was named Presidential Distinguished Professor at the University of Guelph, and in 2011 he was the Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute's Canadian Lecturer to India.\n\nRusson received his Ph.D. in 1990 from the University of Toronto. His dissertation was entitled \"Hegel on the Body\".\n\nRusson is known for his original philosophical contributions, and also for his scholarly interpretations of G.W.F. Hegel, Contemporary Continental Philosophy and Ancient Philosophy.\n\nRusson is known as an original philosopher, primarily through his books \"Human Experience\", \"Bearing Witness to Epiphany\", and \"Sites of Exposure\". Leonard Lawlor describes Russon as \"one of the few original voices working in Continental Philosophy today.\" \"Human Experience\", which won the 2005 Broadview Press/Canadian Philosophical Association Book Prize, brought together themes from Hegel, Contemporary Continental Philosophy and Ancient Philosophy, and produced an original interpretation of the development of personal identity. In this work Russon argues that the experiences through which we are inaugurated into any distinctive domain of meaning necessarily leave the stamp of their specific (and contingent) character on our subsequent experiences in that domain. He uses this notion to interpret the significance of family experience in the formation of personal identity, and he finds this aspect of our experience to be the key to understanding mental health (and mental illness).\nRusson's approach to mental health—in particular his interpretation of neurosis—is specially striking for its bringing together of the theme of embodiment that has been prominent in existential phenomenology with the theme of dialectical self-transformation that is prominent in the philosophy of Hegel and with the theme of the \"system\" of family life that is prominent in the work of such psychologists and family theorists as Salvador Minuchin, R.D. Laing and D.W. Winnicott. This work is also important for its use of these ideas to criticize the \"individualist\" premises of much political and economic theory, and to develop of a political theory of multiculturalism. His interpretation of the dynamic and transformative role of sexuality (eros) provides an important link between his work and the philosophy of Plato.\nThe importance of sexuality to personal development, and especially its relationship to ethical life and to artistic creativity is further explored in \"Bearing Witness to Epiphany\". Like \"Human Experience\", this work stands out for its emphasis on the way that the important dimensions of our experience are embodied in the most basic material dimensions of our lives—everyday \"things\" and basic bodily practices—and this work thus offers a new metaphysics of \"the thing\" and of reality in general, arguing that issues of metaphysics cannot be separated from issues of ethics. His most recent book, \"Sites of Exposure\", broadens the perspective of these earlier books to address issues of politics and history. Russon analyzes the dynamic process by which we make ourselves at home in a culture, and at the same time come into conflict with other cultures. Investigating this process throughout history, with a special emphasis on ancient Athenian democracy, the history of Islam, and the history of British Empire in Asia, Russon argues for a pluralist multiculturalism as the only viable political direction. He concludes the book with a study of art, which is relevant because it is art that can transform our perspective in a way that opens us to the new possibilities of social and cultural life that are necessary if we are to get beyond simple situations of cultural conflict. He offers original studies of Thomas Cole, Rachel Whiteread, Anselm Kiefer, and Gerhard Richter, among others.\n\nIn addition to his original philosophical contributions, Russon has also published substantial scholarly work in the history of philosophy.\n\nThough his doctoral supervisor was the Heidegger scholar Graeme Nicholson, his interpretation of Hegel's philosophy is more often thought of as continuing the tradition of his teacher H.S. Harris (1926–2007), the pre-eminent Hegel scholar in the English-speaking world. Russon's Hegel-interpretation is also distinctive because of its attempt to show the continuity of Hegel's philosophy with the philosophical traditions of phenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction. This interpretation has been developed through many scholarly articles, and especially through three books: \"The Self and Its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit,\" \"Reading Hegel's Phenomenology,\" and \"Infinite Phenomenology: The Lessons of Hegel's Science of Experience\".\n\nRusson's philosophical orientation is largely derived from existential phenomenology, and he has published a number of scholarly articles in this area, especially focusing on the work of Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jacques Derrida. His most recent works include, \"The Self as Resolution: Heidegger, Derrida and the Intimacy of the Question of the Meaning of Being,\" and \"The Spatiality of Self-Consciousness: Originary Passivity in Kant, Merleau-Ponty and Derrida.\"\n\nRusson is also known as a scholar of ancient philosophy, especially for his use of the methods of 20th Century European philosophy (phenomenology, hermeneutics and deconstruction) to interpret the texts of Plato and Aristotle. Along with John Sallis, he organized an influential conference at the Pennsylvania State University in 1997 entitled \"Retracing the Platonic Text,\" (the papers from which were published as \"Retracing the Platonic Text\" by Northwestern University Press in 2000). This conference helped to inaugurate the growing North American movement to interpret the texts of Greek Philosophy through the lens of Contemporary Continental Philosophy, a movement especially associated with the Ancient Philosophy Society. He is currently the editor of a book series from Northwestern University Press entitled \"Rereading Ancient Philosophy\", a series that publishes books on ancient philosophy that are informed by the insights of continental philosophy.\n\nRusson has supervised the dissertations of many current professors of philosophy across North America on topics in Plato, Aristotle, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, John Dewey and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.\nRusson has held academic appointments at Harvard University, the University of Toronto, Acadia University, the Pennsylvania State University, Stony Brook University, and the University of Guelph.\nHe is also the founder and main organizer of the Toronto Seminar, an annual private seminar for the study of philosophy, held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7962398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7962398", "title": "Literary realism", "text": "Literary realism\n\nLiterary realism is part of the realist art movement beginning with mid-nineteenth-century French literature (Stendhal), and Russian literature (Alexander Pushkin) and extending to the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Literary realism attempts to represent familiar things as they are. Realist authors chose to depict everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of using a romanticized or similarly stylized presentation.\n\nBroadly defined as \"the representation of reality\", realism in the arts is the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, as well as implausible, exotic and supernatural elements.\n\nRealism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization. In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. Realist works of art may emphasize the ugly or sordid, such as works of social realism, regionalism, or Kitchen sink realism.\n\nThere have been various realism movements in the arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism and Italian neorealist cinema. The realism art movement in painting began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution. The realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.\n\nRealism as a movement in literature was a post-1848 phenomenon, according to its first theorist Jules-Français Champfleury. It aims to reproduce \"objective reality\", and focused on showing everyday, quotidian activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization. It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person objective reality, without embellishment or interpretation and \"in accordance with secular, empirical rules.\" As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such reality is ontologically independent of man's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As literary critic Ian Watt states in \"The Rise of the Novel\", modern realism \"begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses\" and as such \"it has its origins in Descartes and Locke, and received its first full formulation by Thomas Reid in the middle of the eighteenth century.\"\n\nIn the late 18th-century Romanticism was a revolt against the aristocratic social and political norms of the previous Age of Reason and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature found in the dominant philosophy of the 18th century, as well as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education and the natural sciences.\n\n19th-century realism was in its turn a reaction to Romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as traditional or \"bourgeois realism\". However, not all writers of Victorian literature produced works of realism. The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of Victorian realism, prompted in their turn the revolt of modernism. Starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.\n\nSocial Realism is an international art movement that includes the work of painters, printmakers, photographers and filmmakers who draw attention to the everyday conditions of the working classes and the poor, and who are critical of the social structures that maintain these conditions. While the movement's artistic styles vary from nation to nation, it almost always uses a form of descriptive or critical realism.\n\nKitchen sink realism (or kitchen sink drama) is a term coined to describe a British cultural movement that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in theatre, art, novels, film and television plays, which used a style of social realism. Its protagonists usually could be described as angry young men, and it often depicted the domestic situations of working-class Britons living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore social issues and political controversies.\n\nThe films, plays and novels employing this style are set frequently in poorer industrial areas in the North of England, and use the rough-hewn speaking accents and slang heard in those regions. The film \"It Always Rains on Sunday\" (1947) is a precursor of the genre, and the John Osborne play \"Look Back in Anger\" (1956) is thought of as the first of the genre. The gritty love-triangle of \"Look Back in Anger\", for example, takes place in a cramped, one-room flat in the English Midlands. The conventions of the genre have continued into the 2000s, finding expression in such television shows as \"Coronation Street\" and \"EastEnders\".\n\nIn art, \"Kitchen Sink School\" was a term used by critic David Sylvester to describe painters who depicted social realist–type scenes of domestic life.\n\nSocialist realism is the official Soviet art form that was institutionalized by Joseph Stalin in 1934 and was later adopted by allied Communist parties worldwide. This form of realism held that successful art depicts and glorifies the proletariat's struggle toward socialist progress. The Statute of the Union of Soviet Writers in 1934 stated that socialist realism\n\nThe strict adherence to the above tenets, however, began to crumble after the death of Stalin when writers started expanding the limits of what is possible. However, the changes were gradual since the social realism tradition was so ingrained into the psyche of the Soviet literati that even dissidents followed the habits of this type of composition, rarely straying from its formal and ideological mold. The Soviet socialist realism did not exactly emerge on the very day it was promulgated in the Soviet Union in 1932 by way of a decree that abolished independent writers' organizations. This movement has been existing for at least fifteen years and was first seen during the Bolshevik Revolution. The 1934 declaration only formalized its canonical formulation through the speeches of the revolutionary Maxim Gorky and Andrea Zhdanov, the representative of the Party's Central Committee. \n\nThe official definition of social realism has been criticized for its conflicting framework. While the concept itself is simple, discerning scholars struggle in reconciling its elements. According to Peter Kenez, \"it was impossible to reconcile the teleological requirement with realistic presentation,\" further stressing that \"the world could either be depicted as it was or as it should be according to theory, but the two are obviously not the same.\"\n\nNaturalism was a literary movement or tendency from the 1880s to 1930s that used detailed realism to suggest that social conditions, heredity, and environment had inescapable force in shaping human character. It was a mainly unorganized literary movement that sought to depict believable everyday reality, as opposed to such movements as Romanticism or Surrealism, in which subjects may receive highly symbolic, idealistic or even supernatural treatment.\n\nNaturalism was an outgrowth of literary realism, a prominent literary movement in mid-19th-century France and elsewhere. Naturalistic writers were influenced by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Whereas realism seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also attempts to determine \"scientifically\" the underlying forces (e.g., the environment or heredity) influencing the actions of its subjects. Naturalistic works often include supposed sordid subject matter, for example, Émile Zola's frank treatment of sexuality, as well as a pervasive pessimism. Naturalistic works tend to focus on the darker aspects of life, including poverty, racism, violence, prejudice, disease, corruption, prostitution, and filth. As a result, naturalistic writers were frequently criticized for focusing too much on human vice and misery.\n\nCritics of realism cite that depicting reality is not often realistic. This argument is based on the idea that we do not often get what is real correctly. To present reality, we draw on what is \"real\" according to how we remember it as well as how we experience it. However, remembered or experienced reality does not always correspond to what the truth is. Instead, we often obtain a distorted version of it that is only related to what is out there or how things really are. Realism is criticized for its supposed inability to address this challenge and such failure is seen as tantamount to a complicity in a creating a process wherein \"the artefactual nature of reality is overlooked or even concealed.\" \n\nThere are also critics who fault realism in the way it supposedly defines itself as a reaction to the excesses of literary genres such as romanticism and Gothic - those that focus on the exotic, sentimental, and sensational narratives. Some scholars began to call this an impulse to contradict so that in the end, the limit that it imposes on itself leads to \"either the representation of verifiable and objective truth or the merely relative, some partial, subjective truth, therefore no truth at all.\"\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, there was growing impetus to establish an Australian culture that was separate from its English Colonial beginnings. Common artistic motifs and characters that were represented in Australian realism were the Australian Outback, known simply as \"the bush\", in its harsh and volatile beauty, the British settlers, the Indigenous Australian, the squatter and the digger–although some of these bordered into a more mythic territory in much of Australia's art scene. A significant portion of Australia's early realism was a rejection of, according to what the \"Sydney Bulletin\" called in 1881 a \"romantic identity\" of the country.\n\nMost of the earliest writing in the colony was not literature in the most recent international sense, but rather journals and documentations of expeditions and environments, although literary style and preconceptions entered into the journal writing. Oftentimes in early Australian literature, romanticism and realism co-existed, as exemplified by Joseph Furphy's \"Such Is Life\" (1897)–a fictional account of the life of rural dwellers, including bullock drivers, squatters and itinerant travellers, in southern New South Wales and Victoria, during the 1880s. Catherine Helen Spence's \"Clara Morison\" (1854), which detailed a Scottish woman's immigration to Adelaide, South Australia, in a time when many people were leaving the freely settled state of South Australia to claim fortunes in the gold rushes of Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nThe burgeoning literary concept that Australia was an extension of another, more distant country, was beginning to infiltrate into writing: \"[those] who have at last understood the significance of Australian history as a transplanting of stocks and the sending down of roots in a new soil\". Henry Handel Richardson, author of post-Federation novels such as \"Maurice Guest\" (1908) and \"The Getting of Wisdom\" (1910), was said to have been heavily influenced by French and Scandinavian realism. In the twentieth century, as the working-class community of Sydney proliferated, the focus was shifted from the bush archetype to a more urban, inner-city setting: William Lane's \"The Working Man's Paradise\" (1892), Christina Stead's \"Seven Poor Men of Sydney\" (1934) and Ruth Park's \"The Harp in the South\" (1948) all depicted the harsh, gritty reality of working class Sydney. Patrick White's novels \"Tree of Man\" (1955) and \"Voss\" (1957) fared particularly well and in 1973 White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nA new kind of literary realism emerged in the late twentieth century, helmed by Helen Garner's \"Monkey Grip\" (1977) which revolutionised contemporary fiction in Australia, though it has since emerged that the novel was diaristic and based on Garner's own experiences. \"Monkey Grip\" concerns itself with a single-mother living in a succession of Melbourne share-houses, as she navigates her increasingly obsessive relationship with a drug addict who drifts in and out of her life. A sub-set of realism emerged in Australia's literary scene known as \"dirty realism\", typically written by \"new, young authors\" who examined \"gritty, dirty, real existences\", of lower-income young people, whose lives revolve around a nihilistic pursuit of casual sex, recreational drug use and alcohol, which are used to escape boredom. Examples of dirty-realism include Andrew McGahan's \"Praise\" (1992), Christos Tsiolkas's \"Loaded\" (1995), Justine Ettler's \"The River Ophelia\" (1995) and Brendan Cowell's \"How It Feels\" (2010), although many of these, including their predecessor \"Monkey Grip\", are now labelled with a genre coined in 1995 as \"grunge lit\".\n\nIan Watt in \"The Rise of the Novel\" (1957) saw the novel as originating in the early 18th-century and he argued that the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism': the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'. His examples are novelists Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also claims that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.\n\nLater in the 19th-century George Eliot's (1819–1880) \"\" (1871–72), described by novelists Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language, is a work of realism.\n\nWhile George Gissing (1857–1903), author of \"New Grub Street\" (1891), amongst many other works, has traditionally been viewed as a naturalist, mainly influenced by Émile Zola, Jacob Korg has suggested that George Eliot was a greater influence.\n\nOther novelists, such as Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) and Anglo-Irishman George Moore (1852–1933) consciously imitated the French realists. Bennett's most famous works are the \"Clayhanger\" trilogy (1910–18) and \"The Old Wives' Tale\" (1908). These books draw on his experience of life in the Staffordshire Potteries, an industrial area encompassing the six towns that now make up Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. George Moore, whose most famous work is \"Esther Waters\" (1894), was also influenced by the naturalism of Zola.\n\nWilliam Dean Howells (1837–1920) was the first American author to bring a realist aesthetic to the literature of the United States. His stories of middle and upper class life set in the 1880s and 1890s are highly regarded among scholars of American fiction. His most popular novel, \"The Rise of Silas Lapham\" (1885), depicts a man who, ironically, falls from materialistic fortune by his own mistakes. Other early American realists include Samuel Clemens (1835–1910), better known by his pen name of Mark Twain, author of \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1884), Stephen Crane (1871–1900), and Horatio Alger, Jr. (1832–1899).\n\nTwain's style, based on vigorous, realistic, colloquial American speech, gave American writers a new appreciation of their national voice. Twain was the first major author to come from the interior of the country, and he captured its distinctive, humorous slang and iconoclasm. For Twain and other American writers of the late 19th century, realism was not merely a literary technique: It was a way of speaking truth and exploding worn-out conventions. Crane was primarily a journalist who also wrote fiction, essays, poetry, and plays. Crane saw life at its rawest, in slums and on battlefields. His haunting Civil War novel, \"The Red Badge of Courage\", was published to great acclaim in 1895, but he barely had time to bask in the attention before he died, at 28, having neglected his health. He has enjoyed continued success ever since—as a champion of the common man, a realist, and a symbolist. Crane's \"\" (1893), is one of the best, if not the earliest, naturalistic American novel. It is the harrowing story of a poor, sensitive young girl whose uneducated, alcoholic parents utterly fail her. In love, and eager to escape her violent home life, she allows herself to be seduced into living with a young man, who soon deserts her. When her self-righteous mother rejects her, Maggie becomes a prostitute to survive, but soon commits suicide out of despair. Crane's earthy subject matter and his objective, scientific style, devoid of moralizing, earmark Maggie as a naturalist work. Horatio Alger Jr. was a prolific 19th-century American author whose principal output was formulaic rags-to-riches juvenile novels that followed the adventures of bootblacks, newsboys, peddlers, buskers, and other impoverished children in their rise from humble backgrounds to lives of respectable middle-class security and comfort. His novels, of which \"Ragged Dick\" is a typical example, were hugely popular in their day.\n\nOther later American realists are: John Steinbeck, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, Upton Sinclair, Jack London, Edith Wharton and Henry James.\n\nHonoré de Balzac (1799–1850) is the most prominent representative of 19th-century realism in fiction through the inclusion of specific detail and recurring characters. His \"La Comédie humaine\", a vast collection of nearly 100 novels, was the most ambitious scheme ever devised by a writer of fiction—nothing less than a complete contemporary history of his countrymen. Realism is also an important aspect of the works of Alexandre Dumas, fils (1824–1895).\n\nMany of the novels in this period, including Balzac's, were published in newspapers in serial form, and the immensely popular realist \"roman feuilleton\" tended to specialize in portraying the hidden side of urban life (crime, police spies, criminal slang), as in the novels of Eugène Sue. Similar tendencies appeared in the theatrical melodramas of the period and, in an even more lurid and gruesome light, in the Grand Guignol at the end of the century.\n\nGustave Flaubert's (1821–1880) acclaimed novels \"Madame Bovary\" (1857), which reveals the tragic consequences of romanticism on the wife of a provincial doctor, and \"Sentimental Education\" (1869) represent perhaps the highest stages in the development of French realism. Flaubert also wrote other works in an entirely different style and his romanticism is apparent in the fantastic \"The Temptation of Saint Anthony\" (final version published 1874) and the baroque and exotic scenes of ancient Carthage in \"Salammbô\" (1862).\n\nIn German literature, 19th-century realism developed under the name of \"Poetic Realism\" or \"Bourgeois Realism,\" and major figures include Theodor Fontane, Gustav Freytag, Gottfried Keller, Wilhelm Raabe, Adalbert Stifter, and Theodor Storm.\n\nLater realist writers included Leo Tolstoy, Benito Pérez Galdós, Guy de Maupassant, Anton Chekhov, José Maria de Eça de Queiroz, Machado de Assis, Bolesław Prus and, in a sense, Émile Zola, whose naturalism is often regarded as an offshoot of realism.\n\nTheatrical realism was a general movement in 19th-century theatre from the time period of 1870–1960 that developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of a broader artistic movement, it shared many stylistic choices with naturalism, including a focus on everyday (middle-class) drama, ordinary speech, and dull settings. Realism and naturalism diverge chiefly on the degree of choice that characters have: while naturalism believes in the overall strength of external forces over internal decisions, realism asserts the power of the individual to choose (see \"A Doll's House\").\n\nRussia's first professional playwright, Aleksey Pisemsky, and Leo Tolstoy (\"The Power of Darkness\" (1886)), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia which culminated with the establishment of the Moscow Art Theatre by Constantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. Their ground-breaking productions of the plays of Anton Chekhov in turn influenced Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of actor training that is particularly suited to psychological realism.\n\n19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, \"is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s\" with the \"middle-period\" work of the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been \"enormously influential.\"\n\nIn opera, \"verismo\" refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the naturalism of Émile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes.\n\nIn France in addition to melodramas, popular and bourgeois theater in the mid-century turned to realism in the \"well-made\" bourgeois farces of Eugène Marin Labiche and the moral dramas of Émile Augier.\n\n\n"}

Introna (born 1961) is \"Professor of Organisation, Technology and Ethics\" at the Lancaster University Management School. He is a scholar within the Social Study of Information Systems field. His research is focused on the phenomenon of technology. Within the area of technology studies he has made significant contributions to our understanding of the ethical and political implications of technology for society.\n\nEarly on in his career Introna was concerned with the way managers incorporated information in support of managerial practices (such as planning, decision-making, etc.). In this work he provided an account of the manager as an always already involved and entangled actor (which is always to a greater or lesser extent already compromised and configured) in contrast to the traditional normative model of the manager as a rational objective free agent that can choose to act or not act in particular ways. Later on his work shifted to a more critical appraisal of technology itself. He, together with co-workers, published a number of critical evaluations of information technology including search engines web search engines, ATMs, facial recognition systems facial recognition systems , etc. His recent work focuses on the ethical and political aspects of technology as well as making contribution to a field that has become known as sociomateriality sociomateriality.\n\nIn his book \"Management, Information and Power\", Introna argued that most management education is normatively based (i.e. telling managers how they \"ought \"to act), yet managers' organisational reality is mostly based on the ongoing play of power and politics, as has been shown by Henry Mintzberg (See also his recent book \"Managing\"). Thus, instead of using information to inform rationality (as the traditional normative models assume) information is rather most often deployed as a resource in organisational politics. This fact, Introna argues, requires an understanding of the relationship between information and power (as suggested in the work of Michel Foucault) rather than information and rationality, as traditionally assumed in the mainstream management literature.\n\nDrawing on phenomenology, especially the work of Martin Heidegger and Don Ihde, Introna together with Fernando Ilharco developed a phenomenological analysis of information technology—in particular a detailed account of the phenomenology of the screen. They argue that in the phenomenon screen, seeing is not merely being aware of a surface. The very watching of the screen, as a screen, implies that the screen has already soaked up our attention. In screening, screens already attract and hold our attention. They continue to hold our attention as they present what is supposedly relevant—this is exactly why they have the power to attract and hold our attention. This ongoing relevance has as its necessary condition an implicit agreement, not of content, but of a way of living and a way of doing—or rather a certain agreement about the possibilities of truth. As such they argue that screens are ontological entities.\n\nIntrona (with a variety of co-workers) has developed a variety of detailed empirical studies of the ethics and politics of technology—within the tradition of Science and technology studies. For example, with Helen Nissenbaum he published a paper on the politics of web search engines. This research showed that the indexing and ranking algorithms of Google are producing a particular version of the internet. One which systematically exclude (in some cases by design and in some, accidentally) certain sites and certain types of sites in favour of others, systematically giving prominence to some at the expense of others. Introna also published similar political and ethical studies on Facial recognition systems, Automatic teller machines, and plagiarism detection Systems, amongst others.\n\nMore recently Introna has suggested that if we are cyborgs, as argued by Donna Haraway and others, then our ethical relationships with the inanimate material world needs to be reconsidered in a fundamental way. According to him this can only be achieved if we humans abandon a human centric ethical framework and opt for an ethical framework in which all beings are considered worthy of ethical consideration.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25381785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25381785", "title": "Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza", "text": "Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza\n\nSpinoza's philosophy encompasses nearly every area of philosophical discourse, including metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. It earned Spinoza an enduring reputation as one of the most important and original thinkers of the seventeenth century.\n\nSamuel Shirley, who translated Spinoza's complete works into English, summed up the significance of Spinoza's philosophy as follows:\n\nSpinoza's philosophy is largely contained in two books: the \"Theologico-Political Treatise\", and the \"Ethics\". The former was published during his lifetime, but the latter, which contains the entirety of his philosophical system in its most rigorous form, was not published until after his death in 1677. The rest of the writings we have from Spinoza are either earlier, or incomplete, works expressing thoughts that were crystallized in the two aforementioned books (\"e.g.\", the \"Short Treatise\" and the \"Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect\"), or else they are not directly concerned with Spinoza's own philosophy (\"e.g.\", \"The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy\" and \"The Hebrew Grammar\"). He also left behind many letters that help to illuminate his ideas and provide some insight into what may have been motivating his views.\n\nSpinoza's philosophy of religion is largely contained in the \"Theologico-Political Treatise\". In that work he argues for the view that we should interpret scripture solely on its own terms by carefully studying it, not with any concepts or doctrines that cannot themselves be derived from the text. If we do this, he thought, it would turn out that many things we believe or are told by religious authorities about God and the universe could be shown to be false (\"e.g.\", miracles).\nSpinoza's view is exemplified in the following sentence from the Preface to the \"Theological Political Treatise\":\nIn Spinoza’s Ethics, he wrote a section titled “Treating of God and What Pertains to Him,” in which he discusses God’s existence and what God is. He starts off by saying: “whether there is a God, this, we say, can be proved”. His proof for God follows a similar structure as Descartes’ ontological argument. Descartes attempts to prove God’s existence by arguing that there “must be some one thing that is supremely good, through which all good things have their goodness”. Spinoza’s argument differs in that he does not move straight from the conceivability of the greatest being to the existence of God, but rather uses a deductive argument from the idea of God. Spinoza says that man’s ideas do not come from himself, but from some sort of external cause. Thus the things whose characteristics a man knows must have come from some prior source. So, if man has the idea of God, then God must exist before this thought, because man cannot create an idea of his own imagination. \n\n After stating his proof for God’s existence, Spinoza addresses who “God” is. Spinoza believed that God is “the sum of the natural and physical laws of the universe and certainly not an individual entity or creator”. Spinoza attempts to prove that God is just the substance of the universe by first stating that substances do not share attributes or essences, and then demonstrating that God is a “substance” with an infinite number of attributes, thus the attributes possessed by any other substances must also be possessed by God. Therefore, God is just the sum of all the substances of the universe. God is the only substance in the universe, and everything is a part of God. “Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God”.\n\nSpinoza's political philosophy is deeply influenced by both the turbulent time period in which he lived, and by the fact that he happened to live in a comparatively liberal place in Europe, which allowed him freedoms he wished to preserve and defend, as he says in the Preface to the Theological Political Treatise:\nSpinoza's political philosophy is scattered in three books, the \"Theologico-political Treatise\", the \"Ethics\" and the \"Political Treatise\". A first look at its main principles could bring the uninformed reader to believe that it is the same as Hobbes's. Yet both theories differ in their conclusions. Spinoza's political philosophy is also a philosophy of the \"conatus\", the individual tendency to exist, which cannot be brought to extinction even in the most powerful Leviathan, even in the worst of authoritarian regimes. Every individual, in Spinoza's opinion, has a natural right. This right includes everything that he desires and he is able to obtain. As a result, my own natural right is the equivalent of my individual strength or power. Hence, in Spinoza's political philosophy subjective rights (e.g. human rights) do not exist by nature, they are an institution of society, they only exist in the civil state. Moreover, according to Spinoza the notions of right and wrong have no meaning before society, since in the natural state there are no common norms, only individual desires (desires which can bring some people to dominate other weaker people).\n\nHow can civil society exist if people are only dominated by their own impulse to live? Through many ways. First, through the action of affections, the same ones that are described in the Ethics. Those affections, my feelings, will bring me to cluster, to gather with people similar to myself: this similarity reinforces the feeling or representation of my own existence. In a similar fashion, human needs will also play a role: society, through distribution and specialisation of each task, can provide more goods than I can generate myself and with less effort. This is why the sciences and the arts can only develop in societies, where there is time to attend to things other than one's own survival. This fear, the need to constantly look after danger and threats and to live in constant tension, is the third cause or root phenomenon of society. Society brings me protection and security. We see hence that Spinoza, while incorporating in his work Hobbesian arguments (the argument of fear), develops a distinct analysis that will bring him to different conclusions: the need of a free society.\n\nHere individuals never entirely renounce their individual right of nature. If in the Theologico-Political Treatise Spinoza refers to the notion of a pact that would be at the root of civil society, this notion disappears in the Political Treatise. People are not brought to form a society by their free will, but rather by their affections, or domination (a great number of individuals gathered through the authority of an unusually strong or charismatic man could also be a way to explain the birth of civil society). They are not passive subjects under the power of an absolute sovereign, but rather citizens that bring their own strength to the State. The power of the state exists in Spinoza's opinion only through the gathering of individual powers, powers which the society incorporates and can even develop if its political institutions are well designed. \"Well designed\" means that they must induce political leaders to act according to the rules, by their own will. In Spinoza's political philosophy, state is not opposed to the society but it is the apparatus that gives a certain form or existence to the society, to a gathering of human beings. It is not transcendent to it, as it is in Hobbes's philosophy.\n\nThese affirmations have some political implications. Here, individual rights exist only because we, as individuals, benefit from the power of our entire group. Members' rights are guaranteed by the strength of their political group (=State or imperium). Individual or subjective rights do not exist outside of a state, out of an organised society. But that doesn't mean that the government should have absolute power over us. To understand that well, we have to remember that according to Spinoza the government or society (there is no difference between them) are nothing else and do not exist without the individual conatuses of the individuals that are gathered in social entities. Individuals hold a part of their natural right in the civil state. They cannot restrain themselves from judging about the state of things as they wish, and any action that would go against this tendency can induce social unrest. It follows that the state must restrain itself from any action that could jeopardise its own integrity, as condemning determinate opinions can. In a broader perspective, a state that relies on fearsome and inhuman ways to preserve its power cannot survive for long, since those ways impede the development of its own strength, and reinforce the tendency of the \"multitudo\", the masses, to unrest or to disobedience: obedience is necessary to preserve social order and peace.\n\nThus, we can distinguish Hobbes and Spinoza through the way they see the normal operation of the state. For Hobbes, the object of the state is to preserve peace through security and fear if needed. According to Spinoza, that kind of peace would not be a true peace but only the absence of unrest. True peace implies a state of things where individuals can accomplish and realise their potentialities, where there is a minimum peace of mind. This is why Spinoza favors states that are organised so that citizens can participate in the elaboration of laws, as a way to improve their quality, and in the operation of the state.\n\nThe vocabulary of Spinoza shows a modification of the way philosophers see politics compared to the Antiquity. In Plato's and Aristotle's works good politics imply good government (defined as the way decisions are taken in a certain political community), in the sense that the different types of government can be ranked according to their virtues (aristocracy is better than democracy, which is better than oligarchy and tyranny according to Plato, and so on). Spinoza goes beyond this way of seeing things. There is not a better government in this sense: the better government is the government that the people of a certain country have been accustomed to, and there is no good in changing it: such a change alters the balance of power already in place and can bring unrest, conflict between opposed or entrenched interests. According to him, one should rather aim to design better institutions: for type of regime or government (Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy) Spinoza implements the outlines of what should be the good institutions for this regime. For example, in Monarchy there should be an official Council of the king, whose members are chosen formally, and whose opinions form a set of possible decisions for the king. This is a way of avoiding the issue of the king's secret counselors or ministers, who have a lot of influence on the king and often are the true decision takers. This system makes public and transparent through a formal process a matter of fact, the existence of a circle of advisers around the king.\n\nFor further reference, see Spinoza's Political Philosophy.\n\nSpinoza argues for a distinct conception of the human mind in Part Two of \"The Ethics\". He says the following:\n\nHe then argues that it follows that \"the human Mind is a part of the infinite intellect of God.\"(E2P11c) Further, Spinoza says: \"Whatever happens in the object of the idea constituting the human Mind must be perceived by the human Mind\"(E2P12) From this we get a clear rejection of Descartes' mind/body dualism: \"The object of the idea constituting the human Mind is the Body, or a certain mode of Extension which actually exists, and nothing else.\"(E2P13)\n\nOne thing which seems, on the surface, to distinguish Spinoza's view of the emotions from both Descartes' and Hume's pictures of them is that he takes the emotions to be cognitive in some important respect. Jonathan Bennett claims that \"Spinoza mainly saw emotions as caused by cognitions. [However] he did not say this clearly enough and sometimes lost sight of it entirely.\"\nSpinoza provides several demonstrations which purport to show truths about how human emotions work. The picture presented is, according to Bennett, \"unflattering, coloured as it is by universal egoism\"\nSpinoza's treatment of the emotions in Part Three of \"The Ethics\", \"On the Origin and Nature of the Affects\", utilizes a broad set of terminology, clearly intended to cover the whole of human experience. He tells us in the Preface:\nWhether there is any meaningful kind of freedom which humans may genuinely have is, in Spinoza's picture, at least contentious. He certainly claims that there is a kind of freedom, namely, that which is arrived at through adequate knowledge of God, or, what is the same: the universe. But in the last two propositions of Part Two of \"The Ethics\", P48 and P49, he explicitly rejects the traditional notion of free will. In E2P48, he claims:\n\nSo from this we get a strong sense of Spinoza's metaphysical naturalism, that is, that the natural and human orders are contiguous. With that being the case, human freedom of a kind which would extricate us from the order of physical causes is impossible. However, Spinoza argues, we still ought to strive to understand the world around us, and in doing so, gain a greater degree of \"power\", which will allow us to be more active than passive, and there is a sense in which this is a kind of freedom.\nFor more, see: Stanford.edu\n\nSpinoza's metaphysics consists of one thing, substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in \"The Ethics\" Spinoza argues that there is only one substance, which is absolutely infinite, self-caused, and eternal. He calls this substance \"God\", or \"Nature\". In fact, he takes these two terms to be synonymous (in the Latin the phrase he uses is \"Deus sive Natura\"). For Spinoza the whole of the natural universe is made of one substance, God, or, what's the same, Nature, and its modifications (modes).\nSpinoza defines \"substance\" as follows:\n\nThis means, essentially, that substance is just whatever can be thought of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of it as a kind of thing, \"e.g.\", \"x\" is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).\n\nSpinoza defines \"attribute\" as follows:\n\nFrom this it can be seen that attributes are related to substance in some way. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) attributes are really the way(s) substance is, or b) attributes are simply ways to understand substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is.\nSpinoza thinks that there are an \"infinite\" number of attributes, but there are two attributes for which Spinoza thinks we can have knowledge. Namely, \"thought\" and \"extension\".\n\nThe attribute of thought is how substance can be understood to give rise to thoughts, or thinking things. When we understand a particular thing in the universe through the attribute of thought, we are understanding the mode as an \"idea\" of something (either another idea, or an object).\n\nThe attribute of extension is how substance can be understood to be physically extended in space. Particular things which have breadth and depth (that is, occupy space) are what is meant by \"extended\". It follows from this that if substance and God are identical, on Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, God has extension as one of His attributes.\n\nModes are particular modifications of substance, \"i.e.\", particular things in the world. Spinoza gives the following definition:\nThe argument for there only being one substance in the universe occurs in the first fourteen propositions of \"The Ethics\". The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism:\n\nSpinoza takes this proposition to follow directly from everything he says prior to it. Spinoza's monism is contrasted with Descartes' dualism and Leibniz's pluralism. It allows Spinoza to avoid the problem of interaction between mind and body, which troubled Descartes in his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\".\n\nThe issue of causality and modality (possibility and necessity) in Spinoza's philosophy is contentious. Spinoza's philosophy is, in one sense, thoroughly deterministic (or necessitarian). This can be seen directly from Axiom 3 of \"The Ethics\":\n\nYet Spinoza seems to make room for a kind of freedom, especially in the fifth and final section of \"The Ethics\", \"On the Power of the Intellect, or on Human Freedom\":\n\nSo Spinoza certainly has a use for the word 'freedom', but he equates \"Freedom of Mind\" with \"blessedness\", a notion which is not traditionally associated with freedom of the will at all.\n\nThough the PSR is most commonly associated with Gottfried Leibniz, it is arguably found in its strongest form in Spinoza's philosophy.\nWithin the context of Spinoza's philosophical system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What this means is that for Spinoza, questions regarding the \"reason\" why a given phenomenon is the way it is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.\n\nSpinoza's philosophy contains as a key proposition the notion that mental and physical (thought and extension) phenomena occur in parallel, but without causal interaction between them. He expresses this proposition as follows:\n\nHis proof of this proposition is that:\n\nThe reason Spinoza thinks the parallelism follows from this axiom is that since the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, there is only one substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.\n\nSpinoza's epistemology is deeply rationalist. That is, unlike the empiricists who rejected knowledge of things as they are in themselves (in favour of knowledge merely of what appears to the senses), to think we can have a priori knowledge, knowledge of a world external from our sense perceptions, and, further, that this is tantamount to knowledge of God. The majority of Spinoza's epistemological claims come in Part Two of \"The Ethics\".\n\nSpinoza's notions of truth and falsity have to do with the relation between ideas and their objects. He thinks that:\n\nFrom this it is clear that the notions of adequate and inadequate ideas are important for understanding how Spinoza's view works. This may be explained in the following way. Spinoza argues that \"All ideas, insofar as they are related to God, are true.\"(E2P32) Since by \"God\", he means the one substance which exists necessarily and absolutely infinitely, it follows that an idea as it is with no reference to knowledge a particular person has, is necessarily true, since it just is a particular instance of God. (E2P32)\n\nOn the other hand, Spinoza argues: \"All ideas are in God; and, insofar as they are related to God, are true, and adequate. And so there are no inadequate or confused ideas except insofar as they are related to the singular Mind of someone.\"(E2P36d). That is, even though ideas considered objectively as elements of the universe are always adequate (meaning their relation to their object is total), when a particular individual has an idea of something, such an idea is necessarily incomplete, and therefore, inadequate. This is the source of falsehood.\n\nSpinoza discusses the three kinds of knowledge in E2P40s2.\n\nSpinoza thinks there are two ways we can have the first kind of knowledge:\nHe calls these two ways \"knowledge of the first kind, opinion or imagination.\"\n\nSpinoza argues that the second kind of knowledge arises:\n\nHe goes on to explain what this means in the propositions which immediately follow.\n\nThis can be referred to as \"Intuition\", but it means something rather technical for Spinoza. The third kind of knowledge is a particularly important part of Spinoza's philosophy because it is what he thinks allows us to have adequate knowledge, and therefore know things absolutely truly. As he says: \n\nSpinoza's ethical views are deeply tied to his metaphysical system. This is evident from the following claim:\n\nIt is also apparent from this that he is a kind of subjectivist about moral values. That is, he does not take good and evil to be real properties/facts in the objects we attribute them to, but rather, they are simply thoughts we have about the comparative value of one thing to another for a particular person.\n\nSpinoza gives the following definitions of \"Good\", and \"Evil\":\nFrom this it is clear that Spinoza's view of moral value is in some sense instrumental. That is, the goodness or badness of a particular object or action is measured not by some essential property. The emphasis on \"essential knowledge\" is important, given Spinoza's view of what epistemic certainty amounts to, i.e., adequate knowledge of God (a notion which is briefly elaborated on in this article).\n\nSpinoza's notion of blessedness figures centrally in his ethical philosophy.\nBlessedness (or salvation or freedom), Spinoza thinks,\n\nAnd this means, as Jonathan Bennett explains, that \"Spinoza wants \"blessedness\" to stand for the most elevated and desirable state one could possibly be in.\" Here, understanding what is meant by 'most elevated and desirable state' requires understanding Spinoza's notion of \"conatus\" (read: \"striving\", but not necessarily with any teleological baggage) and that \"perfection\" refers not to (moral) value, but to completeness. Given that individuals are identified as mere modifications of the infinite Substance, it follows that no individual can ever be \"fully\" complete, i.e., perfect, or blessed. Absolute perfection, is, as noted above, reserved solely for Substance. Nevertheless, mere modes can attain a lesser form of blessedness, namely, that of pure understanding of oneself as one really is, i.e., as a definite modification of Substance in a certain set of relationships with everything else in the universe. That this is what Spinoza has in mind can be seen at the end of the \"Ethics\", in E5P24 and E5P25, wherein Spinoza makes two final key moves, unifying the metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical propositions he has developed over the course of the work. In E5P24, he links the understanding of particular things to the understanding of God, or Substance; in E5P25, the \"conatus\" of the mind is linked to the third kind of knowledge (\"Intuition\"). From here, it is a short step to the connection of Blessedness with the \"amor dei intellectualis\" (\"intellectual love of God\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "583691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=583691", "title": "Ramakrishna Mission", "text": "Ramakrishna Mission\n\nRamakrishna Mission (RKM) is a Hindu religious and spiritual organisation which forms the core of a worldwide spiritual movement known as the \"Ramakrishna Movement\" or the \"Vedanta\" \n\n\"Movement\". The mission is named after and inspired by the Indian saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and founded by Ramakrishna's chief disciple Swami Vivekananda on 1 May 1897. The organization chiefly propagates to the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta–Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals–jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga. \n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organization carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Ramakrishna Mission has centers around the world and publishes many important Hindu texts. It is affiliated with the monastic organisation Ramakrishna Math, with whom it shares members.\n\nThe Math and the Mission are the two key organisations that direct the work of the socio-religious Ramakrishna movement influenced by 19th-century saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and founded by his chief disciple Vivekananda.\nAlso referred to as the Ramakrishna Order, the Math is the movement's monastic organisation. Founded by Ramakrishna in 1886, the Math primarily focuses on spiritual training and the propagation of the movement's teachings.\n\nThe Mission, founded by Vivekananda in 1897, is a humanitarian organisation which carries out medical, relief and educational programs. Both the organisations have headquarters at the Belur Math. The Mission acquired a legal status when it was registered in 1909 under Act XXI of 1860. Its management is vested in a Governing Body. Though the Mission with its branches is a distinct legal entity, it is closely related to the Math. The elected trustees of the Math also serve as Mission's Governing Body. Vedanta Societies comprise the American arm of the Movement and work more in purely spiritual field rather than social welfare.\n\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa (1836–1886), regarded as a 19th-century saint, was the inspirator of the Ramakrishna Order of monks and is regarded as the spiritual founder of the Ramakrishna Movement. Ramakrishna was a priest in the Dakshineswar Kali Temple and attracted several monastic and householder disciples. Narendranath Dutta, who later became Vivekananda was one of the chief monastic disciples. According to Vrajaprana, shortly before his death in 1886 Ramakrishna gave the ochre cloths to his young disciples, who were planning to become renunciates. Ramakrishna entrusted the care of these young boys to Vivekananda. After Ramakrishna's death, the young disciples of Ramakrishna gathered and practised spiritual disciplines. They took informal monastic vows on a night which to their pleasant surprise turned out to be the Christmas Eve in 1886.\n\nAfter the death of Ramakrishna in 1886, the monastic disciples formed the first \"Math\" (monastery) at Baranagore. Later Vivekananda became a wandering monk and in 1893 he was a delegate at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. His speech there, beginning with \"Sisters and brothers of America\" became famous and brought him widespread recognition. Vivekananda went on lecture tours and held private discourses on Hinduism and spirituality. He also founded the first Vedanta Society in the United States at New York. He returned to India in 1897 and founded the Ramakrishna Mission on 1 May 1897. Though he was a Hindu monk and was hailed as the first Hindu missionary in modern times, he exhorted his followers to be true to their faith but respect all religions of the world as his guru Ramakrishna had taught that all religions are pathways to God. One such example is his exhortion that one can be born in a church but he or she should not die in a church meaning that one should realise the spiritual truths for themselves and not stop at blindly believing in doctrines taught to them. The same year, famine relief was started at Sargachi by Swami Akhandananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. Swami Brahmananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna was appointed as the first president of the Order. After the death of Vivekananda in 1902, Sarada Devi, the spiritual counterpart of Ramakrishna, played an important role as the advisory head of a nascent monastic organisation. Gayatri Spivak writes that Sarada Devi \"performed her role with tact and wisdom, always remaining in the background.\"\n\nThe Ramakrishna Math is administered by a democratically elected Board of Trustees. From amongst themselves, the Trustees elect President, Vice-Presidents, general secretary, Assistant Secretaries and Treasurer. For the confirmation of the election of the President, Vice-Presidents and the general secretary, the opinion of monks of twenty years standing is sought and taken.\n\nThe Ramakrishna Mission is administered by a Governing Body, which is composed of the democratically elected Trustees of Ramakrishna Math. The headquarters of Ramakrishna Math at Belur (popularly known as Belur Math) serves also as the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission.\nA branch centre of Ramakrishna Math is managed by a team of monks posted by the Trustees led by a head monk with the title Adhyaksha. A branch centre of Ramakrishna Mission is governed by a Managing Committee consisting of monks and lay persons appointed by the Governing Body of Ramakrishna Mission whose Secretary, almost always a monk, functions as the executive head.\n\nAll the monks of the Ramakrishna Order form the democratic base of the administration. They form the counterpart to the Organization of what is Parliament to the Nation. A representative meeting of all monks is held every three years, at Belur Math, during October–November. This meeting has come to be known as 'Monks' Conference'. The Conference is for the duration of three days. A few months prior to the conference all the monks are notified about the dates and are asked to suggest subjects for discussion and to send Resolutions to be taken up for discussion. The Agenda is finalised based on the suggestions received. On the first day of the Conference, The general secretary on behalf of all elected Trustees, places the report of all the activities that had taken place in the Organisation, during the years that had gone by since they met last. The accounts are then placed before the Conference by the monk in-charge of accounts. The Conference passes the accounts and discusses the Report of activities. The Minutes of the earlier Conference too is passed. The monks also condole the deaths that had occurred in their ranks in the years between successive Conferences. The proposals of monks are voted upon if necessary.\n\nThus The Monks' Conference plays a very important Constitutional role of placing its seal of approval on the decisions taken by the Trustees elected by them and giving policy guidance for further works of the Organisation.\n\nThe first such formal Conference was held in 1935. The latest and the 25th such Conference was held on the 5, 6 and 7 November 2015.\n\nThe scope of the Administration follows the detailed rules made by Swami Vivekananda when he was the General President of Ramakrishna Mission. These rules were formed when the monastic brothers in 1898 wished that there should be specific rules for the work of the Ramakrishna Mission (as the Ramakrishna Movement is commonly known). They were dictated by Swami Vivekananda to Swami Suddhananda, between 1898 and 1899, and has been accepted as the consensus of the opinion of all the monks of the Ramakrishna Mission then, consisting of all the disciples of Sri Ramakrishna and their disciples. Later for clear and formal legal confirmation of these rules, a Trust Deed was registered by Swami Vivekananda and many of the other disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, during 1899 – 1901.\n\nThe aims and ideals of the Mission are purely spiritual and humanitarian and has no connection with politics. Vivekananda proclaimed \"Renunciation and service\" as the twofold national ideals of modern India and the work of the mission strives to practice and preach these . The service activities are based on the message of \"Jiva is Shiva\" from Ramakrishna and Vivekananda's message of \"Daridra Narayana\" to indicate that service to poor is service to God. The Principles of Upanishads and Yoga in Bhagavad Gita reinterpreted in the light of Ramakrishna's Life and Teachings is the main source of inspiration for the Mission. The service activities are rendered looking upon all as veritable manifestation of the Divine. The Motto of the organisation is \"Atmano Mokshartham Jagad-hitaya Cha\". Translated from Sanskrit आत्मनॊ मोक्षार्थम् जगद्धिताय च it means \"For one's own salvation, and for the good of the world.\"\n\nAfter the death of Ramakrishna in 1886 his young disciples organised themselves into a new monastic order. The original monastery at Baranagar known as Baranagar Math was subsequently moved to the nearby Alambazar area in 1892, then to Nilambar Mukherjee's Garden House, south of the present Belur Math in 1898 before finally being shifted in January 1899 to a newly acquired plot of land at Belur in Howrah district by Vivekananda. This monastery, known as the Belur Math, serves as the Mother House for all the monks of the Order who live in the various branch centres of the Math and/or the Mission in different parts of India and the world.\n\nAll members of the Order undergo training and ordination (\"Sannyasa\") at Belur Math. A candidate for monastic life is treated as a pre-probationer during the first year of his stay at any centre, and as a probationer during the next four years. At the end of this period he is ordained into celibacy (\"Brahmacharya\") and is given certain vows (\"Pratijna\"), the most important of which are chastity, renunciation and service. After a further period of four years, if found fit, he is ordained into (\"Sannyasa\") and given the ochre (\"gerua\") clothes to wear.\n\nSwami Vivekananda forbade his organisation from taking part in any political movement or activity, on the basis of the idea that holy men are apolitical.\n\nHowever, presently, almost 95% of the monks possess voter ID cards. For the sake of identification and particularly for travelling, almost 95 per cent of the monks are forced to seek a voter ID card. But they use it only for identification purpose and not for voting. As individuals, the monks may have political opinions, but these are not meant to be discussed in public.\n\nThe Mission, had, however, supported the movement of Indian independence, with a section of the monks keeping close relations with freedom fighters of various camps. A number of political revolutionaries later joined the Ramakrishna Order.\n\nDesigned and explained by Swami Vivekananda in his own words:\n\nThe principal workers of the mission are the monks. The mission's activities cover the following areas,\nThe mission has its own hospitals, charitable dispensaries, maternity clinics, tuberculosis clinics, and mobile dispensaries. It also maintains training centres for nurses. Orphanages and homes for the elderly are included in the mission's field of activities, along with rural and tribal welfare work.\n\nThe mission has established many renowned educational institutions in India, having its own university, colleges, vocational training centres, high schools and primary schools, teacher-training institutes, as well as schools for the visually handicapped. It has also been involved in disaster relief operations during famine, epidemic, fire, flood, earthquake, cyclone and communal disturbances.\n\nThe mission played an important role in the installation of photovoltaic (PV) lighting systems in the Sundarbans region of West Bengal. Due to the geographical features of the Sunderbans, it is very difficult to extend the grid network to supply power to its population. The PV lighting was used to provide electricity to the people who were traditionally depending on kerosene and diesel.\n\nThe mission is a non-sectarian organisation and ignores caste distinctions.\n\nRamakrishna \"ashrama's\" religious activities include \"satsang\" and \"arati\". \"Satsang\" includes communal prayers, songs, rituals, discourses, reading and meditation. Arati involves the ceremonial waving of lights before the images of a deity of holy person and is performed twice in a day.\nRamakrishna \"ashramas\" observes major Hindu festivals, including Maha Shivarathri, Rama Navami, Krishna Ashtami and Durga Puja. They also give special place to the birthdays of Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda and other monastic disciples of Ramakrishna. 1 January is celebrated as Kalpataru Day.\n\nThe math and the mission are known for their religious tolerance and respect for other religions. Among the earliest rules laid down by Swami Vivekananda for them was, \"Due respect and reverence should be paid to all religions, all preachers, and to the deities worshiped in all religions.\" Acceptance and toleration of all religions is the one of ideals of Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Along with the major Hindu festivals, Christmas Eve and Buddha's Birthday are also devoutly observed.\nCyril Veliath of Sophia University writes that the Ramakrishna Mission monks are a relatively orthodox set of monks who are \"extremely well respected both in India and abroad\", and that they \"cannot be classified as just another sect or cult, such as the groups led by the gurus\". Veliath writes that \"of the Hindu groups I have worked with I have found the Ramakrishna Mission to be the most tolerant and amenable to dialogue, and I believe that we Christians couldn't do better, than to cooperate wholeheartedly in their efforts towards inter-religious harmony. Bob Robinson writes, \"Unlike more militant Hindu organisations, the mission has consistently advocated and itself displayed a tolerant, friendly attitude towards minority religious traditions and a sympathetic acquaintance with at least parts of the scriptures of those faiths.\"\n\nThe Ramakrishna Mission has received numerous accolades throughout its lifetime:\nIn a speech made in 1993, Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO, stated:\n\nAs of 2018, the Math and Mission have 201 centres all over the world: 152 in India, 15 in Bangladesh, 14 in United States, 2 in Russia, and one each in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Fiji, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, UK, and Zambia. Besides, there are few sub-centres attached to some of these centres.\nThe Math and Mission run 748 educational institutions (including 12 colleges, 22 higher secondary schools, 41 secondary schools, 135 schools of other grades, 4 polytechnics, 48 vocational training centres, 118 hostels, 7 orphanages, etc) with a total student population of more than 200,000.\nBesides these branch centres, there are about one thousand unaffiliated centres (popularly called ‘private centres’) all over the world started by the devotees and followers of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda.\n\nThe centres of the Ramakrishna Order outside India fall into two broad categories. In countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Fiji and Mauritius, the nature of service activities is very much similar to India. In other parts of the world, especially in Europe, Canada, United States of America, Japan, and Australia, the work is mostly confined to the preaching of Vedanta, publication of books and journals and personal guidance in spiritual matters. Many of the centres outside India are called as the 'Vedanta Society' or 'Vedanta Centre'.\n\nThe Universal Prayer Hall of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Agartala, was inaugurated on 7 February 2012 by the Vice-President of the Belur Math, Smaranananda ji Maharaj. This formed a part of the celebrations of the 150th birthday of Vivekananda. The project and celebration is the outcome of laborious efforts of Purnatmanandaji Maharaj, Secretary of the Agartala branch of the Belur Math.\n\nThe following is the list of presidents (spiritual heads) of the Monastic Order:\n\nFrom 1901 the term 'General President' was dropped and the term 'President' was adopted.\n\n\nIn 1980, in an act that caused \"considerable debate\" within the order, the mission petitioned the courts to have their organisation and movement declared a non-Hindu minority religion for the purpose of Article 30 of the Indian constitution. They argued that the Ramakrishna's \"Neo-Vedanta\" is a truer version of the ideals of Vedanta, and that this makes the followers of Ramakrishna eligible for the legal status of \"minority\". The immediate cause for the appeal for minority status was because there was a danger that the local Marxist government would take control of its educational institutions unless it could invoke the extra protection that Article 30 of the Indian constitution accords to minority religions. The mission did this as a matter of political necessity: there was a danger that the local government would take control of its charitable schools unless it could invoke the extra protection the Indian constitution accords to minority religions. This episode highlights the legal and constitutional discriminations due to Article 30 of the Constitution. The constitutional bedrock of these discriminations is Article 30, which accords to the minorities the right to set up and administer their own schools and colleges, preserving their communal identity (through the course contents and by selectively recruiting teachers and students), all while receiving state subsidies. This same right is not guaranteed to Hindus. While the Calcutta High Court accepted Ramakrishna Mission's pleas, the Supreme Court of India ruled against the Mission in 1995, citing evidence that it had all the characteristics of a Hindu organization. The Mission found it advisable to let the matter rest. Today it remains as a Hindu organisation. The wisdom of the attempt by the Mission's leadership to characterize the Mission as non-Hindu was widely questioned within the membership of the organization itself, and the leadership today embraces the Mission's status as both a Hindu organization and as an organization that emphasizes the harmony of all faiths. Most members – and even monks – of the Ramakrishna Mission consider themselves Hindus, and the Mission's founding figures, such as Swami Vivekananda never disavowed Hinduism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25915", "title": "Raëlism", "text": "Raëlism\n\nRaëlism (also known as Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.\nThe Raëlian Church has a quasi-clerical structure of seven levels. Joining the movement requires an official apostasy from other religions. Raëlian ethics include striving for world peace, sharing, democracy and nonviolence.\n\nRaël founded Clonaid (originally Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation) in 1997, but then handed it over to a Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000. In 2002 the company said that an American woman underwent a standard cloning procedure that led to the birth of a daughter, Eve (b. 26 December 2002). Although few believe the claim, it nonetheless attracted national authorities and the mainstream media to look further into the Raëlians' cult status.\n\nThe Raëlians frequently use the swastika as a symbol of peace, which halted Raëlian requests for territory in Israel, and later Lebanon, for establishing an embassy for extraterrestrials. The religion also uses the swastika embedded on the Star of David. Between 1991 and 2007, this symbol was often replaced by a variant star and swirl symbol in an attempt to improve public relations, particularly with Israel.\n\nThe beginnings of Raëlism are rooted in the experiences of a French former automobile journalist and race car driver Claude Vorilhon. In his books \"The Book Which Tells the Truth\" (1974) and \"Extraterrestrials Took Me to their Planet\" (1975), Vorilhon had alien encounters with beings who gave him knowledge of the origins of all major religions.\n\nThe movement traces its beginnings to a conference in Paris, France of two thousand people in 1974. From there, the MADECH organization was born. The name MADECH is a double acronym in the French language; it stands both for \"Movement for the Welcoming of the Elohim, Creators of Humanity\" \"(Mouvement pour l‘accueil des Elohim, créateurs de l'humanité)\" and for \"Moses Preceded Elijah and the Christ\" \"(Moise a devancé Élie et le Christ)\". By 1976, Claude Vorilhon (called Raël) transformed MADECH into the International Raelian Movement.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1992 Raël and his movement became increasingly global. In 1980 Claude Raël's fifth Raëlian book \"Sensual Meditation\" was published and formal publication of the Raëlian Messages in the Japanese language began as part of the Raëlian mission to Japan. Two years later, Africa became another target area in the mission to spread the Raëlian messages.\n\nOn 26 December 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a biotechnology company called Clonaid, announced the birth of baby Eve, supposedly the first-ever human clone. The announcement ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, criticism, and claims of a hoax. Spokespeople for the movement, including Claude Vorilhon, have suggested that this is one of the first steps in achieving a more important agenda. They say that through cloning they can combine an accelerated growth process with some form of mind transfer, and in such, may achieve eternal life.\n\nThe structure of the Raëlian Church is hierarchical, with seven levels ascending from level 0 to level 6. The top four levels consist of \"Guides\". The level 6 guide, known as the \"Guide of Guides\", has the final say on who becomes a level 5 \"Bishop Guide\" or a level 4 \"Priest Guide\". Bishops and priests promote lower-level members one level at a time during annual seminars. Each bishop or priest can propose a new guide as long as the candidate is from a level below their own. Guides can assist \"Regional Guides\"—level 3 and above—in their assigning of non-guide members to levels 3 (\"Assistant Priests\"), 2 (\"Organizers\") and 1 (\"Assistant Organizers\").\n\nMembers of the Raëlian structure begin as level 0 \"trainees\" during annual seminars. The Raelian structure said in 2007 to have about 2,300 members, 170 \"Raëlian guides\", and 41 bishops. Claude Vorilhon has held the highest position for three seven-year terms.\n\nWomen make up only a third of the membership in the Raëlian Church, though two anecdotes in the Raëlian Contact newsletter report female majorities joining the movement's Asian Mongolian chapter. Women such as Brigitte Boisselier, the Chief Executive Officer of Clonaid, play a powerful role in the Raëlian Church. There are two major groups of women in the Raëlian Church.\n\nThe \"Order of Angels\", founded in the 1990s, consists of over a hundred Raëlian women who call for femininity and refinement for all of humanity. The initiation rites include declaring an oath or making a contract in which one agrees to become defender of the Raëlian ideology and its founder Raël. The Order of Angels has its own hierarchy of \"rose angels\" and \"white angels\" which, as of 2003, are six and 160 women, respectively. After the Clonaid human cloning announcement made the headlines, the \"Daily Telegraph\" wrote that members of the order not only provided sexual pleasure for Raël, but also helped donate eggs for efforts towards human cloning. A few days later, \"Time\" magazine wrote that French chemist Brigitte Boisselier was an Order of Angels member. Around this time, cult specialist Mike Kropveld called the Order of Angels \"one of the most transparent movements\" he had witnessed, though he was alarmed by the women's promise to defend Raël's life with their own bodies.\n\nRaël has instructed some women members to play a pro-sex feminist role in the Raëlian Church. \"Rael's Girls\" is another group of women in the movement which are against the suppression of feminine acts of pleasure, including sexual intercourse with men or women. Rael's Girls solely consists of women who work in the sex industry. The women of Rael's Girls say there is no reason to repent for performing striptease or being a prostitute. This organization was set up \"to support the choice of the women who are working in the sex industry\". Rael's Girls and its founder Raël were featured in a pictorial in the October 2004 issue of \"Playboy\".\n\nThe major initiation rite in the Raëlian Church is the \"baptism\" or \"transmission of the cellular plan\" and is performed by upper-level members in the Raëlian clergy known as guides. In 1979, Raël introduced the \"Act of Apostasy\" as an obligation for those preparing for their Raëlian baptism.\n\nThe Raëlian baptism is known as transmission of the cellular plan where \"cellular\" refers to the organic cells of the body and the \"plan\" refers to the genetic makeup of the individual. This Raëlian baptism involves a guide member laying water onto the forehead of the new member. The practice began on \"the first Sunday in April\" of 1976 when Raël baptised 40 Raëlians. Raëlians believe that their genetic information is recorded by a remote computer and would become recognized during their final hour when they will be judged by the extraterrestrial Elohim.\n\nBaptisms can only be performed on four special days in the year. The dates mark anniversaries in the Raëlian calendar.\n\nThe dates are 6 August, which marks the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, 13 December, marking the day that Raël in 1973 says he had his first personal encounter with one of the extraterrestrial Elohim, 7 October in which the Elohim, Raël says, took him up in a spacecraft in 1975 and the following day had meals with Jesus, Buddha, and other past religious figures and the first Sunday in April, which Raëlians believe is the date when dark-skinned extraterrestrials created Adam and Eve.\n\nSensual Meditation is the set of exercises made public by Claude Vorilhon in his book \"La méditation sensuelle\". It is practiced by members of International Raelian Movement (IRM). The first of these exercises is usually taught in Raëlian Seminars.\n\nThroughout the history of Raëlism, members of the Raëlian Church have toured public settings advocating masturbation, condoms and birth control. Raëlians hope that genetically modified food and nanotechnology will allow humankind to eliminate the obligation to work, in a world that embraces science and technology.\n\nRaëlians have founded Clonaid, a company that envisions that someday human beings can be scientifically recreated though a process of human cloning, and Clitoraid, an organization whose mission is to oppose female genital mutilation.\n\nRaëlian structure members have set up exhibitions about their beliefs of extraterrestrial intelligent designers sending crop circles, UFOs, and spaceships for their arrival at an embassy. While there have been smaller meetings of Raëlians and non-Raëlians, annual \"Raëlian seminars\" have been typically larger.\n\nRaëlian structure members who run the seminars have organized group exercises involving meditation with the senses. James R. Lewis, an authority on fringe religious movements, spoke of Raëlians who practiced a Raëlian exercise called Sensual Meditation and discovered \"playing fields\" where \"radical self-reconstruction,\" \"new forms of authority,\" and \"new modes of self-relating\" were encouraged.\n\nMusic has been a feature of large gatherings, where at night, Raëlians have had multiethnic cabaret performances. Seminarists have used colored bracelets to indicate whether they wanted to be alone, be in a couple, or simply meet people.\n\nOn a yearly basis, Raëlian members organize seminars that are often attractive to the sexually adventurous. News \"KNBC\" called the annual Raëlian seminars \"a cross between a nudist camp and new-age retreat.\" A Spanish television agency reported Raëlian men and women in cross-dressing plays. Activities such as observations of one's own genitals and masturbation with them disturbed Brigitte McCann, a \"Calgary Sun\" reporter who entered one of the Raëlian seminars. Susan J. Palmer said a French journalist went to a Raëlian Seminar in 1991 and taped couples having sexual intercourse in tents. These tapes gained widespread negative publicity—with news stories that described these practices as perverted and a form of brainwashing. The tents were actually put up for the privacy of attendees who were sharing dormitories, and the person was ejected by the Raëlians for misrepresentation of their so-called research for the sake of sensationalism. So-called infiltration is encouraged by the Raëlians to clear up myths perpetrated by the media and rogue researchers.\n\nRaëlians routinely advocate sex-positive feminism and genetically modified food. They also have protested against wars and the Catholic Church.\n\nPro-GMO: On 6 August 2003, the first day of Raëlian year 58 AH, a tech article on the \"USA Today\" newspaper mentions an \"unlikely ally\" of the Monsanto Company, the Raëlian Movement of Brazil. The movement gave vocal support in response to the company's support for genetically modified organisms particularly in their country. Brazilian farmers have been using Monsanto's genetically engineered soy plant as well as the Roundup herbicide to which it was artificially adapted. The Raëlians spoke against the Brazilian government's ban on GMOs.\n\nAnti-war: In 2006, About 30 Raëlians, some topless, took part in an anti-war demonstration in Seoul, Korea. In 2003, Raëlians in white alien costumes bore signs bearing the message \"NO WAR ... ET wants Peace, too!\" to protest the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.\n\nAnti-Catholic: In 1992 Catholic schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada objected to a proposed condom vending machine as contrary to their mission. In response, Raëlian guides, in an event dubbed \"Operation Condom\", gave the Catholic students ten thousand condoms. The Commissioner of Catholic schools for Montreal said they could do nothing to stop them.\n\nIn July 2001, Raëlians distributed leaflets on the streets of Italy and Switzerland protesting the existence of over a hundred child molesters among Roman Catholic clergy in France. They recommended that parents should not send their children to Catholic confession. The Episcopal vicar of Geneva sued the Raëlian Church for libel but did not win. The judge did not accept the charges for the reason that the Raëlians were not attacking the whole of the Catholic Church. In October 2002, Raëlians in a Canadian anti-clerical parade handed out Christian crosses to high school students. The students were invited to burn the crosses in a park not far from Montreal's Mount Royal and to sign letters of apostasy from the Roman Catholic Church. The Quebec Association of Bishops called this \"incitement to hatred\", and several school boards attempted to prevent their students from meeting Raëlians.\n\nRaëlians do not believe in a god (or other deity), but in extraterrestrials. Former clergy of mainstream religions have joined the Raëlian Church, especially in Quebec. The structure of the movement had promoted some of them to the level of Priest or Bishop due to \"extensive Bible training and teaching skills\".\n\nTwo ex-Roman Catholic priests, Victor Legendre and Charles-Yvan Giroux converted to Raëlianism. A former bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) joined the Raelian Movement so he could be openly gay. The Raëlian, Mark Woodgate, stated that 8% of Raëlians worldwide are former Latter-day Saints. Religiously mixed couples are common, especially with spouses who are Christians or Buddhists.\n\nSusan J. Palmer, a sociologist from Canada, has studied the movement since 1987 and says the movement intentionally stirs a moderate level of controversy to maintain membership. For example, Rael and the group attempt to tie their views with topical matters, ranging from Tiger Woods' promiscuity to strained relations in the Middle East, in regular online postings and press releases. This view is shared by Mike Kropveld—the executive director of an anti-cult organization with the name Info-Cult—who says the controversy leads to criticism by both religious and non-religious people.\n\nRaëlian organizers made deliberate attempts to \"shock, titillate, and capture the media's imagination\". The book \"Yes to Human Cloning\" (2001) attracted media attention after its release, including segments on \"20/20\" and \"60 Minutes\". Biophysicist Gregory Stock described the Raëlian Clonaid project as \"sufficiently quirky to command instant media attention.\" It has been estimated that the group received free publicity worth US$500 million as a result of the Clonaid announcement. Mark Hunt, a lawyer and politician who wished to clone his dead son with the help of the Clonaid services, was overwhelmed by the volume of media attention and in an interview said that Clonaid's chief executive had become a \"press hog\".\n\nTheologian of new religious movements George D. Chryssides described the Raëlian Church as being in an \"early developmental stage\" and that their beliefs distance it from a \"dominant intellectual climate\". Raëlism says that all life on Earth, humans included, was created scientifically by Elohim, members of an extraterrestrial race who appeared similar to small humans and so were often depicted as angels, cherubs, or gods. Raëlians, who are not monotheists, believe the correct historical meaning of the word Elohim is the plural sense, \"those who came from the sky\". Belief in extraterrestrial Elohim play a central part in Clonaid's offer of cloning services for homosexual and infertile couples who want a child cloned from a partner's DNA.\n\nChryssides states that Raëlism is discernible from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar who had long contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny the existence of the ethereal soul and a supernatural god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.\n\nRaëlians believe that throughout the ages, members of the Elohim civilization sent different prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was to guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, all of whom were created as a result of a sexual union between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced DNA synthesis and genetic engineering. The Elohim later reduced the frequent visits so that humans were largely left to progress on their own, until the time of the Apocalypse/Revelation when they would send their final messenger and disclose themselves at an extraterrestrial embassy, establishing political and economic ties.\n\nRaëlians believe that sex is a normal, natural and healthy part of life and encourage people to be true to their natural sexuality. They promote healing from damaging messages from strict puritanical belief systems and social stigmas that stifle one's natural sexuality. Acceptance of masturbation, homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, naturism and any legal, safe and consensual adult activity is promoted as part of a healthy and long life, and this is used to attract young converts to the religion. Raelians believe that sexuality is a gift of pleasure to mankind from the Elohim. The Raëlian book \"Let's Welcome our Fathers From Space\" says that new advanced extraterrestrial civilizations will ultimately practice a final religion or \"religion of the infinite\" that involves ubiquitous practice of Sensual Meditation.\n\nAccording to Giancarlo Genta and Jason Colavito, writers who have influenced Raëlian beliefs include Zechariah Sitchin and Erich von Däniken.\n\nRaëlians are encouraged to do as they feel right, whether that matches the rules of the culture in which they live or not. According to Susan J. Palmer, a majority of loosely affiliated Raëlian Movement members have often strayed from following rules concerning \"diet, drugs, and sexual activity\" as described in the Raëlian books. Sometimes, they will not attend monthly meetings or pay a tithe in proportion to their income. Only the more committed members who do follow such rules can remain in the movement's structure.\n\nAccording to Michel Beluet, the former director of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure exerted on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's enthusiasm to voluntarily tithe. Palmer cited Raël, who said that more than 60% of the Raëlian Movement's members do not tithe. Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that only one-third of respondents tithed.\n\nAs opposed to the scientific definition of reproductive cloning which is simply the creation of a genetically identical living thing, Raëlians seek to both genetically clone individuals, rapidly accelerate growth of the clone to adulthood through a process like guided self-assembly of rapidly expanded cells or even nanotechnology and then transfer the mind and personality of the donor into the clone. Raëlians believe humanity can attain eternal life through the science of cloning.\n\nClaude Vorilhon told lawmakers that banning the development of human cloning was comparable to outlawing medical advances such \"antibiotics, blood transfusions, and vaccines.\"\n\nRaël founded Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation in 1997, to research human cloning. The company name was later changed to Clonaid and handed over to Raëlian bishop Brigitte Boisselier in 2000. In 2002, Boisselier, as chief executive of Clonaid, said that a human baby was conceived through cloning technology. Around this time, Clonaid's subsidiary BioFusion Tech said it possessed a cell fusion device that assisted the cloning of human embryos. The Vatican said that experimenters expressed \"brutal mentality\" for attempting to clone human beings. Pope John Paul II criticized the experiment which he believes threatens the dignity of human life. In response, the leader of the Raëlian Church dismissed the Pope's ethical concerns, calling them an \"accumulation of religious prejudices.\"\n\nIn response to Raël's association with Clonaid, South Korean immigration authorities at the airport denied him entry into their country in 2003. This decision led to the quick cancellation of the planned Raëlian seminar which seven hundred registered for. Raëlians of South Korea were instructed by Raël to protest near the Ministry of Health and Welfare that ordered him to leave. Officials detained Raël for nine hours at Incheon International Airport before he and his wife Sophie de Niverville left for Tokyo from where they took another plane on their way back to Canada. Raël responded by saying that Korean officials treated him like a \"North Korean\" and that he would wait for an apology before coming back to Korea.\n\nThe Raelian movement defends the rights and freedoms of gays and lesbians, recognises gay marriage and ordains gay clergy. Some Raelian leaders have performed licensed same-sex marriages.\n\nAccording to the book \"Maitreya\" by Claude Vorilhon, love involves experiencing different varieties and possibilities that allow one to break habits in order to make life more pleasant and interesting and that it is the only thing which can stop war and injustice that persists in today's world. Raëlians believe in the right to form new religions or new political parties as long as they do not promote violence. As individualists, Raëlians believe that the one who gives the order to harm others is less at fault than the one who executes it.\n\nRaëlians say they encourage adult homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual relationships and that society should recognize them legally. Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians' views about Sensual Meditation with a fear that Raëlians are a threat to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. They express the view that such liberalized sex education teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.\n\nSexual predators and guides who force missionary ideas against members are excommunicated by the Raëlian Church for a minimum of seven years—the amount of time Raëlians believe it takes for all of a person's biological cells to be regenerated. In 2006 Raëlians in Los Angeles, California condemned acts of pedophilia, particularly those allegedly associated with Catholic priests, saying that celibate priests \"are denied the right to have sex\". Authorities of the Swiss canton of Valais said that Raëlians support a doctrine of \"complete sexual liberty\", and they denied an application by Raël to live in their area. The website \"Raelianews.org\" said that sexual freedom between consenting adults in no way implies pedophilia.\n\nRaëlian cosmology as proposed in 1973 by Raël states that the observable universe has no creator and is infinite in time and finite in size and surrounded by infinite space.\n\nIn Raëlian cosmology, our observable universe is an \"atom\" of a much larger level of matter (and possibly organism) and subatomic particles in our bodies also possess universes like our own, but on a much smaller scale. This pattern, atom within universe within atom, is believed to be infinitely repetitive, from the infinitely small, to the infinitely large. The Raëlian Messages by Raël state that humanoid extraterrestrials, who were originally called under the name \"Elohim\" (singular: \"Eloha\"), verified this cosmology scientifically.\n\nBecause of the difference of mass, the activity of life inside in a living thing's atoms would undergo many millennia before enough time passes for that living thing to take a single step. Raëlians believe the universe is infinite in time and space and lacks a center. Because of this, one could not imagine where an ethereal soul would go.\n\nThe Raëlian cosmology is meditated upon during the fourth activity in the rite of Sensual Meditation.\n\nIn his book \"The Message Given to me by Extraterrestrials\" (now republished as \"Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers\" 2006 ), Claude Vorilhon says that on 13 December 1973, he found a spacecraft shaped like a flattened bell that landed inside Puy de Lassolas, a volcano near the capital city of Auvergne. A 25,000-year-old human-like extraterrestrial inside the spacecraft named \"Yahweh\" said that Elohim was the name that primitive people of Earth called members of his extraterrestrial race—who were seen as \"those who came from the sky\". Yahweh explained that Earth was originally void of life, with thick clouds and shallow seas, but the Elohim came, broke apart the clouds, exposed the seas to sunlight, built a continent, and synthesized a global ecosystem. Solar astronomy, terraformation, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering allowed Elohim to adapt life to Earth's thermal and chemical makeup.\n\nYahweh gave materialistic explanations of the following:\n\nAccording to Vorilhon, Elohim contacted about forty people to act as their prophets on Earth, including Moses, Elijah, Ezekiel, Buddha,\nJohn the Baptist, Jesus,\nMuhammad, and Joseph Smith. The religions thought to be from Elohimic origins include Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Mormonism.\n\nFrom the Raëlian point of view, religious texts indicate that the Elohim would return at the age of Apocalypse or Revelation (unveiling of the truth). Humans from another world would appear to drop down from the sky and meet in the embassy they have asked Raël to build for them and share their advanced scientific knowledge with humanity. Thus, one of the stated main goals of the Raëlian movement is to inform as many people as possible about this extraterrestrial race.\n\nRaëlians believe that humanity would be able to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would have a better chance of both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.\n\nRaëlians do not believe that an ethereal soul exists free of physical confinement. Raëlians believe that advanced supercomputers of the Elohim are right now recording the memories and DNA of human beings. When Elohim release this information for the coming resurrection, people would be brought back from the dead and the judgments upon them would be realized based on actions in their past life. People excluded from physical re-creation would include those who achieved nothing positive but were not evil. Vorilhon expressed an interest in cloning Adolf Hitler for war trials and retroactive punishment. Raël also mentioned cloning as the solution to terrorism by suicide attacks, as the perpetrators would not be able to escape punishment by killing themselves if the Elohim recreated them after their attacks.\n\nRaëlians believe that life on Earth—as well as many religions of the world—was the work of extraterrestrials. They believe these were scientists and that ancient people saw them as \"gods\" and gave the name \"Elohim\". Raëlians believe that the Embassy for Extraterrestrials or \"Third Temple\" is to support an official contact with Extraterrestrial Elohim and their messengers of the main religions at the \"New Jerusalem\".\n\nThe Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials is the vision of the International Raëlian Movement to establish an embassy, at a base cost of $20 million, with a landing pad that would serve as spaceport for extraterrestrial spaceships. Its location is intended to be in neutral territory, preferably Jerusalem, and would be surrounded by acres of campground capable of supporting about 144,000 people or more than twice the estimated Raëlian membership as of 2005.\n\nOn 16 April 1987, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" estimated the funding for the \"cosmic kibbutz\" at $1 million. In 1997–1998, the funding had risen to $7 million. By 2001, $9 million had been saved for the embassy, and in October 2001, the funding had reached $20 million.\n\nThe International Raëlian Movement envisions having an entrance with an aseptic chamber leading to a conference room for twenty-one people as well as a dining room of the same capacity. In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy. The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be in the center of a large park and protected from trespassing by a wall—a maximum of two stories—to surround the entire complex's circumference. Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area. The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance. The landing pad for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4\" on its terrace. The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only. The seven rooms directly underneath the landing pad would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick metal door. Finally, the International Raëlian Movement wants to avoid military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy. Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems are part of this vision. A nearby replica of the Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials open to the public is expected to show visitors what it is like inside the real one.\n\nOn 13 December 1997, the leader of the International Raëlian Movement had decided to extend the possibility of building the embassy outside of Jerusalem and also allow that a significant portion of the embassy property be covered with water. The area of the proposed embassy property is still envisioned at a minimum of 3.47 square kilometers, with a radius of at least 1.05 kilometers.\n\nIn his book \"Geniocracy\", Raël outlined his plan for a peaceful worldwide political union that, while democratic, would require members of the electorate to meet a minimum standard of intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Raëlians are 50% above average for a candidate and 10% above average for a voter. The world government would also have a global currency, a common language, and a transformation of militaries of the world into civil police.\n\nRaelians deride the current state-system as inadequate for dealing with contemporary global issues that are typical of Globalisation, such as Environmentalism, Social Justice, Human Rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, Geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Humanitarianism.\n\nRaël recommends a world government with 12 regions. Inhabitants would vote for which region they want to be part of. After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle of democracy is applied. While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power.\n\nOne current difficulty in the ideas of Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Rael in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, a series of tests that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.\n\nThe lack of scientific rigour necessary for inclusion of Geniocracy as properly testable political ideology can be noted in number of modern and historical dictatorships as well as oligarchies. Because of the controversies surrounding Geniocracy, Raël presents the idea as a classic utopia or provocative ideal and not necessarily a model that humanity will follow.\n\nIn Raël's book, \"Extraterrestrials took me to their planet\", Raël says that an extraterrestrial gave him the idea of \"Economic Humanitarianism\". Under the establishment of \"Economic Humanitarianism\", people would not have ownership of businesses or exploitable goods created by others. Instead, people would rent each of them for a period of 49 years. The founders would be able to receive the rents for up to 49 years or when they die, whichever is later. Any rents not inherited by relatives after 49 years would go to the State. By balancing inheritances, children would be born with enough financial means to forsake menial tasks for endeavors that may benefit the whole of humanity. Family houses could be inherited from generation to generation, free of rent.\n\nIn his much later book, \"Maitreya\", Raël says the road to a world without money is capitalism and globalisation, as opposed to communism. Capitalism would allow those who contribute much to society to also contribute to its scientific and technological development. Under capitalism, society would produce as much money as it can. The money would become important in the short run as nanotechnology quickly lowers the cost of goods while putting many people out of work.\n\nRaelians believe in reclaiming the swastika by restoring its historical meaning as a symbol of peace and good luck. The swastika has been used for millennia in the East as a religious symbol of peace and harmony.\n\nIn 1991, a Montreal anti-cult organization called Info-Cult made statements against the Raëlian Church with an article on \"Le Devoir\", branding Raëlians as promoters of fascism and racism, due to the church's use of the swastika as part of their logo and the Raëlian description of an extraterrestrial global government in which those less than ten percent above average intelligence are excluded from the electorate. Outside Info-Cult's office, Raëlians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, a dozen people protested against the use of the swastika in the Raëlian logo in Miami's Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the swastika and other Raelian practices has led to criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, an Orthodox Jewish organization.\n\nIn February 1991, the Raëlian Church modified their symbol. The official reason given was a request from the Elohim to change the symbol in order to help in negotiations with Israel for the building of the Extraterrestrial Embassy to greet the anticipated Elohim space vessels, although the country continued to deny their request. In 2005, the Israeli Raëlian Guide Kobi Drori stated that the Lebanese government was discussing proposals by the Raëlian movement to build their interplanetary embassy in Lebanon. However, one condition was that the Raëlians not display their logo on top of the building because it mixes a swastika and a Star of David. According to Drori, the Raëlians involved declined this offer, as they wished to keep the symbol as it was. From 1991 to 2007, the official Raëlian symbol in Europe and America did not have the original swastika, but Raël, founder and leader of the Raëlian Movement decided to make the original symbol, the Star of David intertwined with a swastika, the only official symbol of the Raelian Movement worldwide.\n\nIn 1995, a parliamentary commission issued a report through the National Assembly of France that categorized the Raelian Movement (\"Mouvement Raëlien\") as a \"secte\" (French word for \"cult\"), but did not give reasons for this classification. In 1997, a parliamentary inquiry commission issued a report through the Belgian Chamber of Representatives that categorized the Belgian Raelian Movement (\"Mouvement Raëlien Belge\") as a sect. Glenn McGee, professor at the University of New Haven, stated that part of the sect is a cult while the other part is a commercial website that collects large sums of money from those interested in human cloning. The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the United States Department of State and sociologist Susan J. Palmer have classified the International Raëlian Movement as a religion.\n\nIn 2005, two \"Wired News\" reporters were welcomed into a Raëlian seminar and had permission to videotape it. They believe the footage they took makes it clear that the Raelian Movement is a cult which should disband. A Raëlian guide said in a \"Wired\" interview that he was not ashamed of what is shown and that he has no concerns about this incident.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23797095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23797095", "title": "Religious and philosophical views of Albert Einstein", "text": "Religious and philosophical views of Albert Einstein\n\nAlbert Einstein's religious views have been widely studied and often misunderstood. Einstein stated that he believed in the pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza. He did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. He clarified however that, \"I am not an atheist\", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a \"religious nonbeliever.\" Einstein also stated he did not believe in life after death, adding \"one life is enough for me.\" He was closely involved in his lifetime with several humanist groups.\n\nEinstein used many labels to describe his religious views, including \"agnostic\", \"religious nonbeliever\" and a \"pantheistic\" believer in \"Spinoza's God\". Einstein believed the problem of God was the \"most difficult in the world\"—a question that could not be answered \"simply with yes or no.\" He conceded that, \"the problem involved is too vast for our limited minds.\"\n\nEinstein was raised by secular Jewish parents, and attended a local Catholic public elementary school in Munich. In his \"Autobiographical Notes\", Einstein wrote that he had gradually lost his faith early in childhood:\n\n. . . I came—though the child of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents—to a deep religiousness, which, however, reached an abrupt end at the age of twelve. Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression. Mistrust of every kind of authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude toward the convictions that were alive in any specific social environment—an attitude that has never again left me, even though, later on, it has been tempered by a better insight into the causal connections.\n\nIt is quite clear to me that the religious paradise of youth, which was thus lost, was a first attempt to free myself from the chains of the 'merely personal,' from an existence dominated by wishes, hopes, and primitive feelings. Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this world beckoned as a liberation, and I soon noticed that many a man whom I had learned to esteem and to admire had found inner freedom and security in its pursuit. The mental grasp of this extra-personal world within the frame of our capabilities presented itself to my mind, half consciously, half unconsciously, as a supreme goal. Similarly motivated men of the present and of the past, as well as the insights they had achieved, were the friends who could not be lost. The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and alluring as the road to the religious paradise; but it has shown itself reliable, and I have never regretted having chosen it.\n\nEinstein expressed his skepticism regarding the existence of an anthropomorphic God, such as the God of Abrahamic religions, often describing this view as \"naïve\" and \"childlike\". In a 1947 letter he stated, \"It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously.\" In a letter to Beatrice Frohlich on 17 December 1952, Einstein stated, \"The idea of a personal God is quite alien to me and seems even naïve.\"\n\nPrompted by his colleague L. E. J. Brouwer Einstein read the philosopher Eric Gutkind's book \"Choose Life\", a discussion of the relationship between Jewish revelation and the modern world. On January 3, 1954 Einstein sent the following reply to Gutkind, \"The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends…. For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions.\"\n\nOn 22 March 1954 Einstein received a letter from Joseph Dispentiere, an Italian immigrant who had worked as an experimental machinist in New Jersey. Dispentiere had declared himself an atheist and was disappointed by a news report which had cast Einstein as conventionally religious. Einstein replied on 24 March 1954:\n\nIn his book \"Ideas and Opinions\" Einstein stated, \"In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests.\" In December 1922 Einstein said the following on the idea of a saviour, \"Denominational traditions I can only consider historically and psychologically; they have no other significance for me.\n\nEinstein had explored the idea that humans could not understand the nature of God. In an interview published in George Sylvester Viereck's book \"Glimpses of the Great\" (1930), Einstein responded to a question about whether or not he defined himself as a pantheist. He explained:\nYour question is the most difficult in the world. It is not a question I can answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.\n\nEinstein stated, \"My views are near those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly. I believe that we have to content ourselves with our imperfect knowledge and understanding and treat values and moral obligations as a purely human problem—the most important of all human problems.\"\n\nOn 24 April 1929, Einstein cabled Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein in German: \"I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.\" He expanded on this in answers he gave to the Japanese magazine \"Kaizō\" in 1923:\n\nScientific research can reduce superstition by encouraging people to think and view things in terms of cause and effect. Certain it is that a conviction, akin to religious feeling, of the rationality and intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher order. [...] This firm belief, a belief bound up with a deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God. In common parlance this may be described as \"pantheistic\" (Spinoza).\n\nEinstein called himself an agnostic rather than an atheist, stating: \"I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal god is a childlike one. You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being.\" In an interview published by the German poet George Sylvester Viereck, Einstein stated, \"I am not an Atheist.\" According to Prince Hubertus, Einstein said, \"In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views.\"\n\nIn 1945 Guy Raner, Jr. wrote a letter to Einstein, asking him if it was true that a Jesuit priest had caused Einstein to convert from atheism. Einstein replied, \"I have never talked to a Jesuit priest in my life and I am astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me. From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist. ... It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with things outside the human sphere—childish analogies. We have to admire in humility the beautiful harmony of the structure of this world—as far as we can grasp it, and that is all.\"\n\nIn a 1950 letter to M. Berkowitz, Einstein stated that \"My position concerning God is that of an agnostic. I am convinced that a vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral principles for the betterment and ennoblement of life does not need the idea of a law-giver, especially a law-giver who works on the basis of reward and punishment.\"\n\nAccording to biographer Walter Isaacson, Einstein was more inclined to denigrate atheists than religious people. Einstein said in correspondence, \"[T]he fanatical atheists...are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who—in their grudge against the traditional 'opium of the people'—cannot hear the music of the spheres.\" Although he did not believe in a personal God, he indicated that he would never seek to combat such belief because \"such a belief seems to me preferable to the lack of any transcendental outlook.\"\n\nOn 17 July 1953 a woman who was a licensed Baptist pastor sent Einstein a letter asking if he had felt assured about attaining everlasting life with the Creator. Einstein replied, \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it.\" This sentiment was also expressed in Einstein's book \"The World as I See It\", \"I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves. An individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my comprehension, nor do I wish it otherwise; such notions are for the fears or absurd egoism of feeble souls. Enough for me the mystery of the eternity of life, and the inkling of the marvellous structure of reality, together with the single-hearted endeavour to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the reason that manifests itself in nature.\"\n\nEinstein was averse to the Abrahamic conception of Heaven and Hell, particularly as it pertained to a system of everlasting reward and punishment. In a 1915 letter to the Swiss physicist Edgar Meyer Einstein wrote, \"I see only with deep regret that God punishes so many of His children for their numerous stupidities, for which only He Himself can be held responsible; in my opinion, only His nonexistence could excuse Him.\" He also stated, \"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own —- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.\"\n\nPart of Einstein's tension with the Abrahamic afterlife was his belief in determinism and his rejection of free will. Einstein stated, \"The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events —- that is, if he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously. He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it goes through.\"\n\nIn 1930 Einstein published a widely discussed essay in \"The New York Times Magazine\" about his beliefs. With the title \"Religion and Science,\" Einstein distinguished three human impulses which develop religious belief: fear, social or moral concerns, and a cosmic religious feeling. A primitive understanding of causality causes fear, and the fearful invent supernatural beings analogous to themselves. The desire for love and support create a social and moral need for a supreme being; both these styles have an anthropomorphic concept of God. The third style, which Einstein deemed most mature, originates in a deep sense of awe and mystery. He said, the individual feels \"the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves in nature ... and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole.\" Einstein saw science as an antagonist of the first two styles of religious belief, but as a partner in the third. He maintained, \"even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other\" there are \"strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies\" as aspirations for truth derive from the religious sphere. He continued:\n\nA person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value. It seems to me that what is important is the force of this superpersonal content ... regardless of whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a Divine Being, for otherwise it would not be possible to count Buddha and Spinoza as religious personalities. Accordingly a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance of those super-personal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation ... In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be...\n\nAn understanding of causality was fundamental to Einstein's ethical beliefs. In Einstein's view, \"the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science,\" for religion can always take refuge in areas that science can not yet explain. It was Einstein's belief that in the \"struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope\" and cultivate the \"Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.\"\n\nCatholic Cardinal William Henry O'Connell spoke about Einstein's perceived lack of belief, \"The outcome of this doubt and befogged speculation about time and space is a cloak beneath which hides the ghastly apparition of atheism.\" A Bronx Rabbi criticized both the Cardinal and Einstein for opining on matters outside their expertise: \"Einstein would have done better had he not proclaimed his nonbelief in a God who is concerned with fates and actions of individuals. Both have handed down dicta outside their jurisdiction.\" The Catholic priest and broadcaster Fulton Sheen—whose intellect Einstein admired, even calling him \"one of the most intelligent people in today's world\"—described Einstein's \"New York Times Magazine\" article \"the sheerest kind of stupidity and nonsense\".\n\nIn his 1934 book \"The World as I See It\", Einstein expanded on his religiosity, \"A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms — it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man.\"\n\nIn 1936 Einstein received a letter from a young girl in the sixth grade. She had asked him, with the encouragement of her teacher, if scientists pray. Einstein replied in the most elementary way he could:\nEinstein characterized himself as \"devoutly religious\" in the following sense, \"The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mystical. It is the power of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms—this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the rank of devoutly religious men.\"\n\nIn December 1952, he commented on what inspires his religiosity, \"My feeling is religious insofar as I am imbued with the insufficiency of the human mind to understand more deeply the harmony of the universe which we try to formulate as 'laws of nature.'\" In a letter to Maurice Solovine Einstein spoke about his reasons for using the word \"religious\" to describe his spiritual feelings, \"I can understand your aversion to the use of the term 'religion' to describe an emotional and psychological attitude which shows itself most clearly in Spinoza. (But) I have not found a better expression than 'religious' for the trust in the rational nature of reality that is, at least to a certain extent, accessible to human reason.\"\n\nEinstein frequently referred to his belief system as \"cosmic religion\" and authored an eponymous article on the subject in 1954, which later became his book \"Ideas and Opinions\" in 1955. The belief system recognized a \"miraculous order which manifests itself in all of nature as well as in the world of ideas,\" devoid of a personal God who rewards and punishes individuals based on their behavior. It rejected a conflict between science and religion, and held that cosmic religion was necessary for science. For Einstein, \"science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\" He told William Hermanns in an interview that \"God is a mystery. But a comprehensible mystery. I have nothing but awe when I observe the laws of nature. There are not laws without a lawgiver, but how does this lawgiver look? Certainly not like a man magnified.\" He added with a smile \"some centuries ago I would have been burned or hanged. Nonetheless, I would have been in good company.\" Einstein devised a theology for the cosmic religion, wherein the rational discovery of the secrets of nature is a religious act. His religion and his philosophy were integral parts of the same package as his scientific discoveries.\n\nIn a letter to Eric Gutkind dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote in German, \"For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them.\"\n\nIn an interview published by \"Time\" magazine with George Sylvester Viereck, Einstein spoke of his feelings about Christianity. Born in Germany, Viereck supported National Socialism but he was not anti-semitic. And like Einstein he was a pacifist. At the time of the interview Einstein was informed that Viereck was not Jewish, but stated that Viereck had \"the psychic adaptability of the Jew,\" making it possible for Einstein to talk to him \"without barrier.\" Viereck began by asking Einstein if he considered himself a German or a Jew, to which Einstein responded, \"It's possible to be both.\" Viereck moved along in the interview to ask Einstein if Jews should try to assimilate, to which Einstein replied \"We Jews have been too eager to sacrifice our idiosyncrasies in order to conform.\" Einstein was then asked to what extent he was influenced by Christianity. \"As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.\" Einstein was then asked if he accepted the historical existence of Jesus, to which he replied, \"Unquestionably! No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.\"\n\nIn a conversation with the Dutch poet Willem Frederik Hermans Einstein stressed that, \"I seriously doubt that Jesus himself said that he was God, for he was too much a Jew to violate that great commandment: Hear O Israel, the Eternal is our God and He is one!' and not two or three.\" Einstein lamented, \"Sometimes I think it would have been better if Jesus had never lived. No name was so abused for the sake of power!\" In his 1934 book \"The World as I See It\" he expressed his belief that \"if one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity.\" Later in a 1943 interview Einstein added, \"It is quite possible that we can do greater things than Jesus, for what is written in the Bible about him is poetically embellished.\"\n\nEinstein interpreted the concept of a Kingdom of God as referring to the best people. \"I have always believed that Jesus meant by the Kingdom of God the small group scattered all through time of intellectually and ethically valuable people.\"\n\nIn the last year of his life he said \"If I were not a Jew I would be a Quaker.\"\n\nThe only Jewish school in Munich had been closed in 1872 for want of students, and in the absence of an alternative Einstein attended a Catholic elementary school. He also received Jewish religious education at home, but he did not see a division between the two faiths, as he perceived the \"sameness of all religions\". Einstein was equally impressed by the stories of the Hebrew Bible and the Passion of Jesus. According to biographer Walter Isaacson, Einstein immensely enjoyed the Catholic religion courses which he received at the school. The teachers at his school were liberal and generally made no distinction between student's religions, although some harbored an innate but mild antisemitism. Einstein later recalled an incident involving a teacher who particularly liked him, \"One day that teacher brought a long nail to the lesson and told the students that with such nails Christ had been nailed to the Cross by the Jews\" and that \"Among the children at the elementary school anti-Semitism was prevalent...Physical attacks and insults on the way home from school were frequent, but for the most part not too vicious.\" Einstein noted, \"That was at a Catholic school; how much worse the antisemitism must be in other Prussian schools, one can only imagine.\" He would later in life recall that \"The religion of the fathers, as I encountered it in Munich during religious instruction and in the synagogue, repelled rather than attracted me.\"\n\nEinstein met several times and collaborated with the Belgian priest scientist Georges Lemaître, of the Catholic University of Leuven. Fr Lemaitre is known as the first proponent of the big bang theory of the origins of the cosmos and pioneer in applying Einstein's theory of general relativity to cosmology. Einstein proposed Lemaitre for the 1934 Francqui Prize, which he received from the Belgian King.\n\nIn 1940 \"Time\" magazine quoted Einstein lauding the Catholic Church for its role in opposing the Nazis: \nOnly the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly.\n\nThe quotation has since been repeatedly cited by defenders of Pope Pius XII. An investigation of the quotation by mathematician William C. Waterhouse and Barbara Wolff of the Einstein Archives in Jerusalem found that the statement was mentioned in an unpublished letter from 1947. In the letter to Count Montgelas, Einstein explained that the original comment was a casual one made to a journalist regarding the support of \"a few churchmen\" for individual rights and intellectual freedom during the early rule of Hitler and that, according to Einstein, the comment had been drastically exaggerated.\n\nOn 11 November 1950 the Rev. Cornelius Greenway of Brooklyn wrote a letter to Einstein which had also quoted his alleged remarks about the Church. Einstein responded, \"I am, however, a little embarrassed. The wording of the statement you have quoted is not my own. Shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany I had an oral conversation with a newspaper man about these matters. Since then my remarks have been elaborated and exaggerated nearly beyond recognition. I cannot in good conscience write down the statement you sent me as my own. The matter is all the more embarrassing to me because I, like yourself, I am predominantly critical concerning the activities, and especially the political activities, through history of the official clergy. Thus, my former statement, even if reduced to my actual words (which I do not remember in detail) gives a wrong impression of my general attitude.\"\n\nIn 2008 the Antiques Roadshow television program aired a manuscript expert, Catherine Williamson, authenticating a 1943 letter from Einstein in which he confirms that he \"made a statement which corresponds approximately\" to \"Time\" magazine's quotation of him. However, Einstein continued, \"I made this statement during the first years of the Nazi regime—much earlier than 1940—and my expressions were a little more moderate.\"\n\nEinstein's conversations with William Hermanns were recorded over a 34-year correspondence. In the conversations Einstein makes various statements about the Christian Churches in general and the Catholic Church in particular: \"When you learn the history of the Catholic Church, you wouldn't trust the Center Party. Hasn't Hitler promised to smash the Bolsheviks in Russia? The Church will bless its Catholic soldiers to march alongside the Nazis\" (March 1930). \"I predict that the Vatican will support Hitler if he comes to power. The Church since Constantine has always favoured the authoritarian State, as long as the State allows the Church to baptize and instruct the masses\" (March 1930). \"So often in history the Jews have been the instigators of justice and reform whether in Spain, Germany or Russia. But no sooner have they done their job than their 'friends', often blessed by the Church, spit in their faces\" (August 1943).\n\n\"But what makes me shudder is that the Catholic Church is silent. One doesn't need to be a prophet to say, 'The Catholic Church will pay for this silence...I do not say that the unspeakable crimes of the Church for 2,000 years had always the blessing of the Vatican, but it vaccinated its believers with the idea: We have the true God, and the Jews have crucified Him.' The Church sowed hate instead of love, though the ten commandments state: Thou shalt not kill\" (August 1943). \"With a few exceptions, the Roman Catholic Church has stressed the value of dogma and ritual, conveying the idea theirs is the only way to reach heaven. I don't need to go to Church to hear if I'm good or bad; my heart tells me this\" (August 1943). \"I don't like to implant in youth the Church's doctrine of a personal God, because that Church has behaved so inhumanly in the past 2,000 years... Consider the hate the Church manifested against the Jews and then against the Muslims, the Crusades with their crimes, the burning stakes of the inquisition, the tacit consent of Hitler's actions while the Jews and the Poles dug their own graves and were slaughtered. And Hitler is said to have been an altar boy!\" (August 1943).\n\n\"Yes\" Einstein replied vehemently, \"It is indeed human, as proved by Cardinal Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII), who was behind the Concordat with Hitler. Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time?\" (August 1943). \"The Church has always sold itself to those in power, and agreed to any bargain in return for immunity.\" (August 1943) \"If I were allowed to give advice to the Churches,\" Einstein continued, \"I would tell them to begin with a conversion among themselves, and to stop playing power politics. Consider what mass misery they have produced in Spain, South America and Russia.\" (September 1948).\n\nIn response to a Catholic convert who asked \"Didn't you state that the Church was the only opponent of Communism?\" Einstein replied, \"I don't have to emphasise that the Church [\"sic\"] at last became a strong opponent of National Socialism, as well.\" Einstein's secretary Helen Dukas added, \"Dr. Einstein didn't mean only the Catholic church, but all churches.\" When the convert mentioned that family members had been gassed by the Nazis, Einstein replied that \"he also felt guilty—adding that the whole Church, beginning with the Vatican, should feel guilt.\" (September 1948)\n\nWhen asked for more precise responses, Einstein replied: \"About God, I cannot accept any concept based on the authority of the Church. [...] As long as I can remember, I have resented mass indoctrination. I do not believe in the fear of life, in the fear of death, in blind faith. I cannot prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him, I would be a liar. I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil. My God created laws that take care of that. His universe is not ruled by wishful thinking but by immutable laws.\" William Miller of \"Life Magazine\" who was present at this meeting described Einstein as looking like a \"living saint\" and speaking with \"angelic indifference.\"\n\nEinstein believed that when trying to understand nature one should engage in both philosophical enquiry and enquiry through the natural sciences.\n\nFrom a young age he had an interest in philosophy. Einstein said about himself: \"As a young man I preferred books whose content concerned a whole world view and, in particular, philosophical ones. Schopenhauer, David Hume, Mach, to some extent Kant, Plato, Aristotle.\"\n\nEinstein believed that epistemology and science \"are dependent upon each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is—insofar as it is thinkable at all—primitive and muddled.\"\n\nLike Spinoza, Einstein was a strict determinist who believed that human behavior was completely determined by causal laws. For that reason, he refused the chance aspect of quantum theory, famously telling Niels Bohr: \"God does not play dice with the universe.\" In letters sent to physicist Max Born, Einstein revealed his devout belief in causal relationships:\n\nYou believe in a God who plays dice, and I in complete law and order in a world which objectively exists, and which I in a wildly speculative way, am trying to capture. I firmly \"believe\", but I hope that someone will discover a more realistic way, or rather a more tangible basis than it has been my lot to find. Even the great initial success of the quantum theory does not make me believe in the fundamental dice game, although I am well aware that some of our younger colleagues interpret this as a consequence of senility.\n\nEinstein's emphasis on 'belief' and how it connected with determinism was illustrated in a letter of condolence responding to news of the death of Michele Besso, one of his lifelong friends. Einstein wrote to the family: \"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\"\n\nEinstein had admitted to a fascination with philosopher Spinoza's deterministic version of pantheism. American philosopher Charles Hartshorne, in seeking to distinguish deterministic views with his own belief of free will panentheism, coined the distinct typology \"Classical pantheism\" to distinguish the views of those who hold similar positions to Spinoza's deterministic version of pantheism.\n\nHe was also an incompatibilist, in 1932 he said the following:\nI do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills,' accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper.\n\nEinstein was a secular humanist and a supporter of the Ethical Culture movement. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York. For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the \"New York Society for Ethical Culture\", he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\" He was an honorary associate of the British humanist organization the Rationalist Press Association and its journal was among the items present on his desk at his death.\n\nWith regard to punishment by God, Einstein stated, \"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.\" \"A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes. Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death. It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees.\"\n\nOn the importance of ethics he wrote, \"The most important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions. Our inner balance and even our very existence depend on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to life. To make this a living force and bring it to clear consciousness is perhaps the foremost task of education. The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action.\" \"I do not believe that a man should be restrained in his daily actions by being afraid of punishment after death or that he should do things only because in this way he will be rewarded after he dies. This does not make sense. The proper guidance during the life of a man should be the weight that he puts upon ethics and the amount of consideration that he has for others.\" \"I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance—but for us, not for God.\"\n\nIn a conversation with Ugo Onufri in 1955, with regards to nature's purpose he said, \"I have never imputed to Nature a purpose or goal, or anything that could be understood as anthropomorphic.\" In a 1947 letter he stated, \"I feel also not able to imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere.\"\n\nEinstein believed naïve realism was \"relatively simple\" to disprove. He agreed with Bertrand Russell that humans observe the effects objects have on them (greeness, coldness, hardness etc) and not the actual objects themselves.\n\nEinstein declared that he was no positivist, and maintained that we use with a certain right concepts to which there is no access from the materials of sensory experience.\n\nEinstein considered that Kant’s \"denial of the objectivity of space can (...) hardly be taken seriously\". He also believed that \"if Kant had known what is known to us today of the natural order, I am certain that he would have fundamentally revised his philosophical conclusions. Kant built his structure upon the foundations of the world outlook of Kepler and Newton. Now that the foundation has been undermined, the structure no longer stands.\"\n\nEinstein was an admirer of the philosophy of David Hume; in 1944 he said \"If one reads Hume’s books, one is amazed that many and sometimes even highly esteemed philosophers after him have been able to write so much obscure stuff and even find grateful readers for it. Hume has permanently influenced the development of the best philosophers who came after him.\"\n\nAlbeit some sources maintain that Einstein read the three Critiques at the age of 16 and studied Kant as a teenager, Philip Stamp points out that this is contradicted by some of his own claims. For example, in 1949, Einstein said that he \"did not grow up in the Kantian tradition, but came to understand the truly valuable which is to be found in his doctrine, alongside of errors which today are quite obvious, only quite late.\"\n\nIn one of Einstein's letters in 1918 to Max Born, Einstein said that he was starting to discover this \"truly valuable\" in Kant: \"I am reading Kant’s ”Prolegomena” here, among other things, and I am beginning to comprehend the enormous suggestive power that emanated from the fellow, and still does. Once you concede to him merely the existence of synthetic \"a priori\" judgements, you are trapped. Anyway it is nice to read him, even if it is not as good as his predecessor Hume’s work. Hume also had a far sounder instinct.\"\n\nEinstein explained the significance of Kant's philosophy as follows:\n\nSchopenhauer's views on the independence of spatially separated systems influenced Einstein, who called him a genius. In their view it was a necessary assumption that the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with the two states having their own real physical state, independent of the state of the other.\n\nIn Einstein's Berlin study three figures hung on the wall: Faraday, Maxwell and Schopenhauer. Einstein described, concerning the personal importance of Schopenhauer for him, Schopenhauer's words as \"a continual consolation in the face of life’s hardships, my own and others’, and an unfailing wellspring of tolerance.\" Although Schopenhauer's works are known for their pessimism, Konrad Wachsmann remembered, \"He often sat with one of the well-worn Schopenhauer volumes, and as he sat there, he seemed so pleased, as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work.\"\n\nEinstein liked Ernst Mach's scientific work, though not his philosophical work. He said \"Mach was as good a scholar of mechanics as he was a deplorable philosopher\".\n\n\n"}

Examples include the cyclopropenyl cation, the simplest aromatic system and the first aromatic compound prepared with other than six electrons in a ring. His seminal contributions concerning the mechanism of the vitamin B catalyzed benzoin condensation and the rate enhancement gained by performing organic transformations on water, among many others, sparked new avenues of chemical research. He also co-discovered the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) which is FDA-approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nBreslow earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, where his doctoral advisor was R. B. Woodward. Among Breslow's former Ph.D. students is Robert Grubbs, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005, and Doug La Follette, Secretary of State of Wisconsin.\n\nBreslow received many honors and awards, including the National Medal of Science in 1991, the Welch Award, the Arthur C. Cope Award (1987), the NAS Award in Chemical Sciences, the American Chemical Society's ACS Award in Pure Chemistry (1966), the Othmer Gold Medal (2006), the Priestley Medal, and the 2014 American Institute of Chemists (AIC) Gold Medal. In recognition of his classroom skills, Columbia awarded him both its Mark Van Doren Award and its Great Teacher Award. He served as president of the ACS in 1996 and chaired the chemistry division of the National Academy of Sciences from 1974 to 1977. In 1997 he was named one of the top 75 contributors to the chemical enterprise of the past 75 years by Chemical & Engineering News. He was the Myron L. Bender distinguished lecturer at Northwestern University in 1999. The Ronald Breslow Award for Achievement in Biomimetic Chemistry, awarded annually by the ACS, is named in his honor.\n\nHe was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the European Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He is also a foreign member of the Royal Society and an honorary member of many other scientific bodies around the world.\n\nIn 2012, his paper \"Evidence for the Likely Origin of Homochirality in Amino Acids, Sugars, and Nucleosides on Prebiotic Earth\" was retracted from the Journal of the American Chemical Society due to copyright concerns, leading to a debate on self-plagiarism and the distinction between a personal review and a paper.\n\nFirst prepared by mixing 3-chlorocyclopropene with antimony pentachloride, aluminum trichloride, or silver fluoroborate. Carbon-13 NMR shows singlets with a coupling constant of 265 ± 1 Hz. The authors suggest that this coupling constant is suggestive that the C–H bond is 53% s character. The overall bonding framework then consists of sp orbitals to all hydrogens, two sp orbitals for each sigma bond, and one p orbital for the π framework.\n\nIt had been suggested that carbanion-sulfone double bonds will not show aromatic character-primarily as a result of the nodes present in d-orbitals. Straight chain analogs were chosen based on the comparable acidity, combined with previous studies indicating that steric effects are largely negligible. The straight chain analogs are shown below. \n\nCompound II was treated with dimethoxyethane/D2O/triethylamine and was found to be completely deuterated upon recovery. The deuterated compound was then treated with butyllithium in ether, with dimethoxyethane and 2N HCl regenerating the starting material. The cyclic analog (III, shown below) was deuterated in the same manner, and addition of deuterated I, followed by quenching to regenerate the protonated form, was analyzed by NMR. There was one proton peak, and it was shown to equilibrate equally between compounds II and III, indicating that compounds had similar acidity. From this result, the researchers concluded that compound III was not aromatic, because stabilizing effect of aromaticity on the anion should increase the acidity of the parent compound. \n\nThe ester analogs were prepared (IV and V) and were found to be acidic enough for titration. The compounds were titraed under nitrogen with 0.2N NaOH with a Beckman Model GS meter with an E-2 electrode. Compound IV was found to have a pKa of 8.9 +/- 0.1, while compound V had a pKa of 11.1 +/- 0.2.\n\nThe essential building blocks of life (amino acids and key sugars-ribose and deoxyribose) can exist in one of two forms-L or D. However life has evolved such that the vast majority of amino acids are L and the sugars are D. If the amino acids and sugars present in life were racemic (consisting of both L and D), then proteins, DNA, and RNA would not adopt a well defined conformation, resulting in a loss of function. The question of how this preference first occurred has puzzled scientists for years-and while several theories have been proposed; there is still no clear answer. There is growing evidence that the chiral preference came from outer space as scientists discovered α-methyl amino acids inside the Murchison meteorite that have a slight enantiomeric excess (ee) for the L conformation. \nThese α-methyl amino acids are believed to be from outer space as a result of their high abundance of 13C and deuterium. Furthermore, α-methyl amino acids are generally not present in terrestrial chemistry. A common critique is that these amino acids would not be able to tolerate the high temperatures upon entering earth’s atmosphere as the meteorite crashed into the planet. However, the amino acids have been found inside the meteorite, with the meteorite acting as an insulator. Unlike regular amino acids, α-methyl amino acids are not capable of racemizing by enolization on an evolutionary time scale, shown below. \n\nHowever, there is considerable debate as to how the L conformation of α-methyl amino acids was selected for. The most widely accepted theory is that right circularly polarized light in outer space (somewhat) selectively destroyed the D conformation. In theory, synchrotrons produce light of opposite handedness (right and left) above and below the circulation plane. This has been demonstrated in experiments on earth. The theory continues then that neutron stars could act as synchrotrons-with right polarized light pointing in our direction of the universe, and left polarized light pointing in the opposite direction. However, other astronomers claim that the polarization only occurs in the infrared region, which only has sufficient energy to cause molecular vibrations and stretches-far from being capable of destroying molecules. \nA second problem encountered with the L α-methyl amino acids is how to generate enantiomerically pure regular amino acids from the slight excess. The issue is illustrated in the below figure. \nNote that the above product can be protonated from either face with equal probability. The final acid is generated by hydrolysis of the imine. \n\nIt’s worth noting that the alpha keto acid is believed to be formed from a Strecker-like reaction, shown below. \nFrom figure 5, we see that the L alpha-methyl amino acids do not directly act as a chiral directing group to generate the normal L amino acid. Researchers hoped that a second molecule of the alpha-methy amino acid could act as a directing group, however they found that the D enantiomer was slightly favored when only L alpha-methyl amino acids were present. The figure below shows how the D enantiomer is favored. \n\nWhen researchers added copper to the reaction, the resulting product was the L enantiomer. Meteors have been found to contain both copper and zinc-justifying the researchers use of the metal. However, when zinc was used in the same reaction, the L enantiomer was not preferentially formed. Based on computational calculations, the copper forms a square planar complex (shown below) and sterics facilitate protonation to generate the L amino acid. \n\nWhen a slight enantiomeric excess is present, the solubility’s of the pure and racemic crystal can be manipulated to generate large ee’s of the pure enantiomer. If we define certain solubility’s as such:\nKL= [L] represents the solubility of the pure enantiomer\nKDL= [D][L] represents the solubility product of the racemic mixture such that\n[D]= KDL/[L]\nWe can then define the ratio of [L]/[D] = [L]2/KDL\nWhen both enantiomers are present, a racemic crystal structure is formed-however it is lower in energy, has a higher melting point, and is less soluble than the enantiomerically pure crystal structure. As a result, when a slight excess of one enantiomer is present, the ee can be amplified by evaporating solvent-causing the racemate to precipitate. Researchers have been able to start with an ee of 1% L, and ultimately end up with 95:5 solution of L: D. The results discussed above (particularly the synchrotron argument) led Breslow to propose that the D amino acids and L sugars could generate life in other parts of the universe.\n\n"}

He was the son of Prince Nikolai Petrovitch Trubetskoy, co-founder of the Moscow Conservatory, and Sophia Alekseievna Lopouchina. His mother was a big influence on his religious thought. He and his brother, Evgenii Nikolaevitch Troubetzkoy (1863-1920), continued Vladimir Solovyov's work on developing a modern Christian philosophy of the world. He was a Professor of Philosophy at Moscow University.\n\nHe was also a founding members \"Beseda\". \n\nAs a teenager S. N. Trubetskoy was an adherent of the British Positivists, Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill. Later he became disappointed with both and turned to Schopenhauer. Study of his philosophy led Trubetskoy to a conclusion that Schopenhauer's pessimism was the result of denial of God. Trubetskoy himself described this dilemma the following way: \"Either God exists or life is not worth living\". He became an Orthodox Christian, and also an adherent of the Slavophiles: his beliefs at that time were influenced by the writings of Aleksey Khomyakov.\n\nIn 1885 Trubetskoy graduated from Moscow University; but he continued to work there until his death, lecturing in philosophy.\n\nIn 1886, he became acquainted with the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov, who held largely the same views about religion as Trubetskoy and became his close friend.\n\nIn 1890 Trubetskoy became Professor of Philosophy in Moscow University. Later he played a significant role in the Russian liberal movement; he was a founding member of \"Beseda\".\n\nSergey Trubetskoy was one of several philosophers who complained that there in practice was no real autocracy, as all the entanglement of government agencies made it unsure where the power truly lay; in 1900 he wrote: 'There is an autocracy of policemen and land captains, of governors department heads, and ministers, but a unitary Tsarist autocracy, in the proper sense of the word, does not and cannot exist'.\n\nIn 1904 the Professor of Philosophy at Moscow University wrote of the conflict with Japan, contending that Russia was defending the entire European civilisation from 'the yellow danger, the new hordes of Mongols armed with modern technology', being one of many Russian academics seeing the conflict as a 'crusade', a war between civilisation and barbarism; it led an 'educated liberal' to see the conflict as one against the hordes of Asia.\n\nHe was Professor of Philosophy at Moscow University by 1904. In 1905 he was elected rector of Moscow University; but he died just a month later, of brain haemorrhage.\n\nNikolai Trubetskoy, the linguist, was his son.\n\nS. N. Trubetskoy's brother, Evgenii Nikolaevitch (1863-1920), was also a philosopher and a Professor at Moscow University, who largely shared S. N. Trubetskoy's beliefs. Evgenii Trubetskoy died of typhus in the Crimea while he was trying to emigrate.\n\nWorking in the same field as Solovyov, Trubetskoy sought to establish a philosophic foundation for an Orthodox Christian worldview, which would be equally rooted in faith and reason. In 1890 he defended his Master's thesis, \"Metaphysics in Ancient Greece\", in which he argued that the Holy Scripture and Christian theology largely stemmed directly from the idealistic philosophy of ancient Greece.\n\nThe religious beliefs of Trubetskoy are sometimes identified as Christocentrism, wherein the Church serves as a continuation of the Incarnation of Christ to convey divine precepts to society. These views are set forth in Trubetskoy's work, \"The Teaching on Logos\". Trubetskoy believed that the personality of Jesus Christ, which united the human and divine wills, is crucial for understanding of all aspects and dimensions of Christianity. He viewed Christian teaching not solely as a set of ethical norms but as a system of truth which can be perceived and understood exclusively through special revelation (see fideism). His viewpoint differed both from the official doctrine of the Orthodox Church and from the beliefs of liberal intellectuals, who reduced the Christian faith to an egalitarian ethic.\n\n"}
{"id": "268524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268524", "title": "Ship of Theseus", "text": "Ship of Theseus\n\nIn the metaphysics of identity, the ship of Theseus — or Theseus's paradox — is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether a ship—standing for an object in general—that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.\n\nFirst, suppose that the famous ship sailed by the hero Theseus in a great battle has been kept in a harbour as a museum piece. As the years go by some of the wooden parts begin to rot and are replaced by new ones. After a century or so, all of the parts have been replaced. Is the \"restored\" ship still the same object as the original?\n\nSecond, suppose that each of the removed pieces were stored in a warehouse, and after the century, technology develops to cure their rotting and enable them to be put back together to make a ship. Is this \"reconstructed\" ship the original ship? And if so, is the restored ship in the harbour still the original ship too?\n\nThis theory states that two ships, while identical in all other ways, are not identical if they exist at two different times. Each ship-at-time is a unique \"event\". So even without replacement of parts, the ships in the harbour are different at each time. This theory is extreme in its denial of the everyday concept of identity, which is relied on by most people in everyday use.\n\nThe concept of identity might then be replaced with some other metaphysical device to fill its role. For example, we might consider \"Ship Of Theseusness\" to be a property or class which is applied to all the events in the harbour as well as to the reconstructed ship-events.\n\nThis solution was first introduced by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus who attempted to solve the paradox by introducing the idea of a river where water replenishes it. Arius Didymus quoted him as saying \"upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow\". Plutarch disputed Heraclitus' claim about stepping twice into the same river, citing that it cannot be done because \"it scatters and again comes together, and approaches and recedes\".\n\nAccording to the philosophical system of Aristotle and his followers, four causes or reasons describe a thing; these causes can be analyzed to get to a solution to the paradox. The formal cause or 'form' (perhaps best parsed as the cause of an object's form or of its having that form) is the design of a thing, while the material cause is the matter of which the thing is made. Another of Aristotle's causes is the 'end' or final cause, which is the intended purpose of a thing. The ship of Theseus would have the same ends, those being, mythically, transporting Theseus, and politically, convincing the Athenians that Theseus was once a living person, though its material cause would change with time. The efficient cause is how and by whom a thing is made, for example, how artisans fabricate and assemble something; in the case of the ship of Theseus, the workers who built the ship in the first place could have used the same tools and techniques to replace the planks in the ship.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the \"what-it-is\" of a thing is its formal cause, so the ship of Theseus is the 'same' ship, because the formal cause, or design, does not change, even though the matter used to construct it may vary with time. In the same manner, for Heraclitus's paradox, a river has the same formal cause, although the material cause (the particular water in it) changes with time, and likewise for the person who steps in the river.\n\nThis argument's validity and soundness as applied to the paradox depend on the accuracy not only of Aristotle's expressed premise that an object's formal cause is not only the primary or even sole determiner of its defining characteristic(s) or essence (\"what-it-is\") but also of the unstated, stronger premise that an object's formal cause is the sole determiner of its \"identity\" or \"\"which\"-it-is\" (\"i.e.\", whether the previous and the later ships or rivers are the \"same\" ship or river). This latter premise is subject to attack by indirect proof using arguments such as \"Suppose two ships are built using the same design and exist at the same time until one sinks the other in battle. Clearly the two ships are not the same ship even before, let alone after, one sinks the other, and yet the two have the same formal cause; therefore, formal cause cannot by itself suffice to determine an object's identity\" or \" [...] therefore, two objects' or object-instances' having the same formal cause does not by itself suffice to make them the same object or prove that they are the same object.\"\n\nIn this theory, both the reconstructed and restored ships claim identity with the original, as they can both trace their histories back to it. As such they are both identical with the original. As identity is a transitive relation, the two ships are therefore also identical with each other, and are a single ship existing in two locations at the same time.\n\nIn this theory, the reconstructed and restored ships are considered to be separate objects, both are identical to the original, but they are not identical to each other. This requires us to drop the transitivity of identity, ie. deny that \"A = B\" and \"B = C\" entails \"A = C\".\n\nA basic principle of logical atomism is that facts in the world exist independently of one another. Only if we deny this principle then we can claim the following: the restored ship claims continuity of parts with the original over time and so, in the absence of other arguments, claims identity with the original. However when the reconstructed ship is completed and announced to the world, it presents a better claim on continuity, which changes the status of the restored ship making it lose its identity with the original. As a theory of observer-independent reality, this is hard to conceive; it involves both action at a distance and a violation of logical atomism. However it is more acceptable to Kantian style metaphysicists who view their subject as a theory of psychology rather than reality, as it described what biological humans are likely to believe in practice. (For example, if these were real ships on display to the public for a fee, it seems likely that the public would pay to see the reconstructed rather than restored ship.)\n\nOne common argument found in the philosophical literature is that in the case of Heraclitus' river one is tripped up by two different definitions of \"the same\", in other words the vagueness of the term. In one sense, things can be \"qualitatively identical\", by sharing some properties. In another sense, they might be \"numerically identical\" by being \"one\". As an example, consider two different marbles that look identical. They would be qualitatively, but not numerically, identical; a marble can be numerically identical only to itself.\n\nAs the parts of the ship are replaced, the identity of the ship gradually changes, as the name \"Theseus' Ship\" is a truthful description only when the historical memory of Theseus' use of the ship - his physical contact with, and control of, its matter - is accurate. For example, the museum curator, prior to any restoration, may say with perfect truthfulness that the bed in the captain's cabin is the same bed in which Theseus himself once slept; but once the bed has been replaced, this is no longer true, and the claim would then be an imposture, because a different description would be more accurate, i.e.; \"a replica of Theseus' bed.\" The new bed would be as foreign to Theseus as a completely new ship. This is true of every other piece of the original boat. As the parts are replaced, the new boat becomes exactly that: a new boat. Hobbes' proposed restored boat built from the original parts will be the original ship, as its parts are the actual pieces of matter that participated in Theseus' journeys.\n\nTed Sider and others have proposed that considering objects to extend across time as four-dimensional causal series of three-dimensional \"time-slices\" could solve the ship of Theseus problem because, in taking such an approach, all four-dimensional objects remain numerically identical to themselves while allowing individual time-slices to differ from each other. The aforementioned river, therefore, comprises different three-dimensional time-slices of itself while remaining numerically identical to itself across time; one can never step into the same river-time-slice twice, but one can step into the same (four-dimensional) river twice.\n\nA 2010 psychology study reported that 20 members of the public considered the restored ship to be the original while 24 considered the reconstructed to be the original.\n\nThe paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known, including the grandfather's axe, which has had both head and handle replaced, and the similar idea \"Trigger's Broom\".\n\nThis particular version of the paradox was first introduced in Greek legend as reported by the historian, biographer, and essayist Plutarch:\n\nPlutarch thus questions whether the ship would remain the same if it were entirely replaced, piece by piece. Centuries later, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes introduced a further puzzle, wondering what would happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a second ship. Hobbes asked which ship, if either, would be the original Ship of Theseus.\n\nThe paradox appears in several more applied fields of philosophy. \n\nIn philosophy of mind, the ship is replaced by a person whose identity over time is called into question.\n\nIn both philosophy of law and practical law, the paradox appears when the ownership of an object or of the rights to its name are disagreed in court. For example, groups of people such as companies, sports teams, and musical bands may all change their parts and see their old members re-form into rivals, leading to legal actions between the old and new entities. Also, texts and computer programs may be edited gradually but so heavily that none of the original remains, posing the legal question of whether the owners of the original have any claim on the result.\n\nIn ontological engineering such as the design of practical databases and AI systems, the paradox appears regularly when data objects change over time.\n\nThere are many more examples of the paradox found in real-life and in fiction.\n\n"}

Thus, in 2016, he created the human values test \"Deepro\" (for ″Deep Profiling″), presenting his new axiology directly in the form of a mobile app.\n\nHis philosophical tarot, \"Le Jeu du Phénix\" (″The Phoenix Game″), is also adapted for mobile app.\n\nIn 2017, with his team of French and Vietnamese developers, he launches the IMLAC project (″Intelligent Matricial Language About Concepts″), the construction of a philosophical artificial intelligence, based on his system of formalization of human behaviors, on the Lovotic of Hooman Samani, on works by Lotfi Zadeh and on swarm intelligence.\n\n"}

One of the two star pupils of Xuanzang, his works and devotion to the translation projects was revered throughout China and Korea, even reaching Chinese rulers like Emperors Taizong and Gaozong of Tang and Empress Wu of Zhou.
