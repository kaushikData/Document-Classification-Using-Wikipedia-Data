He was \"the leading patron of German theatre\" in his lifetime, and is credited with introducing Shakespeare to a German language audience, and with promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of Ludvig Holberg, the \"Sturm und Drang\" playwrights, and German opera. Already in his lifetime, he was described as \"one of German art's most meritorious men.\"\n\nThe son of a Basel Reformed priest, Seyler moved to London and then to Hamburg as a young adult, and established himself as a merchant banker in the 1750s. During the Seven Years' War and its immediate aftermath his bank Seyler & Tillemann engaged in an ever-increasing and complex speculation with financial instruments and went spectacularly bankrupt with enormous debts in the wake of the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763. A flamboyant \"bon vivant\" who was regarded with suspicion in Hamburg, Seyler symbolized a new and more aggressive form of capitalism.\n\nSeyler's admiration for the tragic actress Sophie Hensel (Seyler), who later became his second wife, led him to devote himself entirely to theatre from 1767 onwards. He used his remaining funds to become the main shareholder, benefactor and effective leader of the idealistic Hamburg National Theatre, employing Lessing as the world's first dramaturg. In 1769, he founded the travelling Seyler Theatre Company, which became one of the most famous theatre companies of Europe during the period 1769–79 and regarded as \"the best theatre company in Germany at that time.\" He initially held the Hanoverian privilege as theatre director and his company later stayed for three years at the court of Duchess Anna Amalia in Weimar and for a year at the ducal court in Gotha. From 1779 to 1781 he was the founding artistic director of the Mannheim National Theatre. He commissioned works such as \"Sturm und Drang\" by Klinger (which gave its name to the era), \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" by Benda and \"Alceste\" by Schweitzer, considered \"the first serious German opera.\" Seyler mostly focused on the artistic, economic and administrative management of his theatrical company; his own lack of a background as an actor, and his former profession as a banker, made him stand out among the theatre principals of his era.\n\nAbel Seyler was born in 1730 in Liestal outside Basel in Switzerland. He was the son of the Reformed clergyman, Dr.theol. Abel Seyler (Seiler) (the elder) (1684–1767), who was parish priest of Frenkendorf-Munzach in Liestal from 1714 to 1763, and Anna Katharina Burckhardt (1694–1773). He grew up in a learned and pious Reformed family and was descended on both his parents' sides from some of the most prominent patrician families of Basel. His mother belonged to the noted Burckhardt family. He was a paternal grandson of the theologian Friedrich Seyler and Elisabeth Socin, a member of an Italian-origined noble family, and he was named for his great-grandfather, the Basel judge and envoy to the French court Abel Socin (1632–1695). On his mother's side he was also descended from the Merian and Faesch families. He was also a matrilineal descendant of Justina Froben, daughter of the humanist Johann Froben. He had a sister, Elisabeth Seiler (1715–1798), married to parish priest Daniel Merian. He was distantly related to Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Napoleon's uncle; they were both descended from the Basel silk merchant, politician and diplomat Johann Rudolf Faesch (died 1659), who was Burgomaster of Basel and led the city's pro-French faction.\n\nAs a young man, Seyler left Basel first for London and then for Hamburg, where he was active as a merchant banker until 1766. With his business partners Johann Martin Tillemann and Edwin Müller, he founded the related companies Seyler & Tillemann and Müller & Seyler, which engaged in an ever-increasing and complex speculation with financial instruments during the Seven Years' War in the 1750s and early 1760s. Seyler & Tillemann had close ties to the bank of the brothers De Neufville in Amsterdam, and has been considered one of the most speculative and immoral banks of the era. In 1761 Seyler & Tillemann, acting as agents for their close business associate Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann, leased the mint factory in Rethwisch from the impoverished Frederick Charles, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön, a member of a cadet branch of the Danish royal family, to produce debased coins in the final years of the Seven Years' War. Seyler & Tillemann went bankrupt in the wake of the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763 with 3–4 million Mark Banco in debts, an enormous sum.\n\nMary Lindemann notes, citing the memoirs of John Parish:\n\nCivil litigation relating to the bankruptcy was initiated in 1763, and the case reached the Imperial Cameral Tribunal two years later. Much criticism was directed at Seyler and Tillemann's business ethics and extravagant lifestyle. Lindemann argues:\n\nSeyler was described as \"a handsome \"bon vivant\".\" Despite suffering \"a sensational bankruptcy for an enormous sum [...] neither of them [Seyler and Tillemann] had lost his good humour or his taste for light living.\" Although they were wealthy bankers, Seyler and Tillemann were \"in no way representatives of the Hamburg bourgeoisie, but were rather seen with suspicion for different reasons\" by the local Hamburg elite. Seyler and his friends were self-made men, immigrants to Hamburg and showed little regard for the values and conventions of the conservative Hamburg bourgeoisie; they symbolized a new form of capitalism.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy of his bank, Seyler devoted himself to theatre and became the main shareholder, benefactor and effective leader of the Hamburg National Theatre, an idealistic attempt to establish a national theatre based on the ideas of Ludvig Holberg. The theatre was owned by \"a consortium of twelve businessmen of the city, with a triumvirate of Seyler, Bubbers and Johann Martin Tillemann, Seyler's business partner. But in practice, it was a one man affair, as Seyler dominated all.\" It leased the Comödienhaus building and was largely a successor institution of Konrad Ernst Ackermann's theatre company. The National Theatre employed Gotthold Ephraim Lessing as the world's first dramaturg, and attracted eminent actors such as Konrad Ekhof and Friedrich Ludwig Schröder; Germany's most famous actress of the late 18th century Friederike Sophie Hensel (Seyler), who later became Seyler's second wife, was the theatre's lead actress. She was regarded as \"a very fine actress, as Lessing admitted, but she was a troublesome and tempestuous character,\" always at the centre of intrigue.\n\nKarl Mantzius noted:\n\nNominally the theatre was led by Johann Friedrich Löwen, but he had little influence, as Seyler took all managerial decisions while Ekhof in practice assumed the artistic leadership. The new Seyler regime suited Ekhof well, and he became a lifelong friend and collaborator of Seyler.\n\nThe Hamburg National Theatre was immortalized by Lessing's influential book \"Hamburg Dramaturgy\", a collection of essays that reflected on the Hamburg National Theatre's efforts, and which defined the field of dramaturgy and gave it its name. The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic was conceived by Löwen, and Seyler, \"the power behind the throne,\" at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success. The theatre had to close after two years after Seyler had spent the rest of his fortune on it.\n\nIn 1769 Seyler founded the National Theatre's effective successor, the Seyler Theatre Company, together with Konrad Ekhof, Sophie Hensel and some other actors. The Seyler Company became one of the most famous theatre companies of Europe during the period 1769–79 and was regarded as \"the best theatre company in Germany at that time.\" While the National Theatre had avoided musical theatre, Seyler appointed Anton Schweitzer as music director, charged with adding opera to the spoken repertory, and the Seyler Company came to play a major role both in the development of a German opera tradition and in the promotion and popularisation of the \"Sturm und Drang\" dramas.\n\nFor most of its existence, the Seyler Company comprised around 60 members, and included an orchestra, a ballet, house dramatists and set designers. Over the next ten years the company travelled extensively, and stayed for longer periods at several courts of Europe. Theatre companies of the era, especially travelling ones, thought of themselves as extended \"families.\"\n\nGeorge III of Hanover and the United Kingdom contracted Seyler in 1769 with performing at Hanover and other cities of the Electorate of Hanover, appointing him as \"Director of the Royal and Electoral German Court Actors,\" a privilege he held until relinquishing it in 1772. During the Hanover years the company performed in Hanover itself and in Lüneburg, Celle, Osnabrück, Hildesheim und Wetzlar. Initially the new company struggled and Seyler failed to replicate the old success of the Hamburg National Theatre. The lack of public interest in Hanover led to financial problems and when Ekhof in May 1770 also became seriously ill and unable to perform for some time, the situation worsened dramatically. Seyler's brother-in-law, the court pharmacist J.G.R. Andreae from Hanover, who also raised Seyler's children from his first marriage, saved the Seyler Company by the assumption of all debts before the impending ruin; Andreae however demanded that Ekhof replaced his brother-in-law as head of the company.\n\nIn 1771 the Seyler Company was invited to the ducal court in Weimar by Duchess Anna Amalia, the composer and noted patron of the arts, and Seyler again became the company's principal. They were warmly welcomed by Anna Amalia and her court, and were generously paid; the company performed three times a week for select guests at the Weimar ducal court. In 1771 Anna Amalia was a 32-year old widow who reigned as regent on behalf of her young son. The Seyler Company's arrival in Weimar coincided with the infancy of the cultural era known as the Weimar Classicism, when the Duchess invited many of the most eminent men in Germany to her court in Weimar, including Herder, Goethe and Schiller.\n\nAdam Shoaff notes,\n\nAfter the palace fire in Weimar in May 1774, Anna Amalia was forced to dismiss the Seyler Company, and they left with a quarter year's wages and a letter of recommendation to Duke Ernest II in Gotha. Seyler thus missed Goethe's arrival at the Weimar court a year later. The Seyler Company remained for one year at the ducal court in Gotha, where Seyler and other of the troupe's members also involved themselves in the broader cultural and social life, and in freemasonry. In Gotha Seyler met the Bohemian composer Georg Anton Benda and commissioned him to write several successful operas, including \"Ariadne auf Naxos\", \"Medea\" and \"Pygmalion\". At its debut in 1775, \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" received enthusiastic reviews in Germany and afterwards, in the whole of Europe, with music critics calling attention to its originality, sweetness, and ingenious execution. It is widely considered Benda's best work, and inspired Mozart.\nIn 1775 Seyler received the Electoral Saxon privilege as theatre director and performed in Leipzig and Dresden, and in 1776 he opened a newly built summer theatre in Dresden. In 1776 Seyler also employed Goethe's close friend Friedrich Maximilian Klinger as a playwright and secretary, and he remained with the company for two years. Klinger had followed Goethe to Weimar earlier in the same year, and at the time he joined the Seyler Company he had just broken with Goethe under unclear circumstances. He brought with him the manuscript of his recently finished play \"Sturm und Drang\", which was first performed by the Seyler Company on 1 April 1777 in Leipzig; the play gave its name to the artistic movement \"Sturm und Drang\".\n\nIn 1777 Seyler relinguished the Electoral Saxon privilege and his company took to the road again. Over the next two years the Seyler Company was primarily based in Frankfurt and Mainz and travelled extensively to Cologne, Hanau, Mannheim, Heidelberg and Bonn.\n\nWhen Charles Theodore, the Prince-Elector of the Electoral Palatinate, additionally became the Duke of Bavaria in 1777, he moved his court from the Palatine capital of Mannheim to Munich and brought the theatre company of Theobald Marchand with him. In 1778 he instructed the courtier Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg—the brother of Prince-Elector and Grand Duke Karl Theodor von Dalberg—to establish a new theatre in Mannheim. At first Dalberg contracted Abel Seyler's theatre company with performing in Mannheim on an occasional basis from 1778 to 1779. In the autumn of 1779 Seyler moved permanently to Mannheim with the remaining members of his theatre company. Several actors who had been affiliated with the Gotha Court Theatre under Konrad Ekhof's direction in the past few years—essentially an offshoot of the Seyler Theatre Company—also joined him; Ekhof himself had died the previous year. The Mannheim National Theatre opened in October 1779 with Seyler as its first artistic director and Dalberg as its general administrator. Some of the actors who worked under Seyler's direction at Mannheim were August Wilhelm Iffland, Johann David Beil and Heinrich Beck.\n\nAt Mannheim Seyler directed several Shakespeare productions, and left a lasting legacy. His \"repertoire in the early Mannheim years still shows the influence of his Hamburg period as well as the legacy of the Weimar/Gotha years.\" In cooperation with Dalberg he developed the theatre's characteristic style, based on a belief in the need to achieve a balance between a more natural style of playing and a certain nobility and idealisation.\n\nHe was forced to leave his position as director of the Mannheim theatre in 1781, \"after his wife's jealousy had provoked an unfortunate incident;\" the usually level-headed Seyler had become embroiled in a quarrel with his wife's \"scheming\" student Elisabeth Toscani over her unauthorised presence during theatre rehearsals and disrespectful remarks, and Dalberg retired Seyler with a pension to \"restore the peace.\"\n\nThe first performance of Friedrich Schiller's \"The Robbers\"—itself inspired by the play \"Julius of Tarent\" by Seyler's son-in-law Johann Anton Leisewitz—took place at the Mannheim National Theatre the year after Seyler left as director.\n\nFrom 1781 to 1783 Seyler was artistic director of the Schleswig Court Theatre, which also performed in Flensburg, Husum and Kiel. In 1783 he established his own troupe based in Altona near Hamburg. From 1783 to 1784 he was again in charge of the Comödienhaus in Hamburg; he continued to live in Hamburg until 1787 and was at times a prompter at the theatre, where his wife performed. From 1787 to 1792 he was again artistic director of the Schleswig Court Theatre.\n\nHis wife Sophie Seyler died in 1789. Earlier in that year she had published the opera \"Huon and Amanda\" (or \"Oberon\"), based on a poem by their friend and collaborator Christoph Martin Wieland. A lightly adapted version of Seyler's opera set to music by Paul Wranitzky became the first opera performed by Emanuel Schikaneder's troupe at their new theatre, and established a tradition within Schikaneder's company of fairy-tale operas that was to culminate two years later in Mozart's and Schikaneder's opera \"The Magic Flute\"; Sophie Seyler's \"Oberon\" is regarded as one of the primary influences on the plot and characters of \"The Magic Flute\".\n\nIn 1792 Abel Seyler retired with a pension from Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, the royal governor of the twin duchies of Schleswig-Holstein. From 1798 he lived as a guest on the estate of the actor, his long-time friend and fellow prominent freemason Friedrich Ludwig Schröder in Rellingen in the Duchy of Holstein, where he died on 25 April 1800 at the age of 69. He is interred in Rellingen.\n\nSeyler is widely regarded as one of the great theatre principals of 18th century Europe and has been described as \"the leading patron of German theatre\" in his lifetime. He is credited with introducing Shakespeare to a German language audience, and with promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of Ludvig Holberg, the \"Sturm und Drang\" playwrights, and the development of a German opera tradition. Already in his lifetime, he was described as \"one of German art's most meritorious men.\" He was lauded by contemporaries such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Christoph Martin Wieland, who described him as a \"man of perception and insight.\" After his death his daughter Sophie Leisewitz, the wife of the poet Johann Anton Leisewitz, wrote: \"It was my happy fortune, out of childish duty, to worship the man whom thousands can only admire.\"\n\nSeyler mostly focused on the artistic, economic and administrative management of his theatrical company; his own lack of a background as an actor, and his former profession as a merchant banker, made him stand out among the theatre principals of his era, in a profession that was just starting to gain respectability. John Warrack noted that:\n\nHis theatrical legacy eventually overshadowed the dubious reputation he had earned as a banker in his younger years.\n\nLike many of his collaborators, Seyler was a freemason. He joined freemasonry in London in 1753, became a member of the Absalom lodge in Hamburg in May 1755, and was involved with freemasonry until his death.\n\nAbel Seyler and Konrad Ekhof, along with other members of the Seyler Company, founded the first masonic lodge in Gotha. The founding took place on 25 June 1774 in the Gasthof Zum Mohren, on the occasion of the Nativity of St John the Baptist, and Ekhof became the first Worshipful Master and Seyler the First Warden. The lodge was originally named \"Cosmopolit\", but was renamed \"Zum Rautenkranz\" in honour of the ducal family shortly after. Its members included several members of the Seyler Company, such as Seyler, Ekhof and the composer Georg Anton Benda; the reigning Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and the Duke's brother, Prince August of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg joined shortly after its establishment, as did many members of the nobility and local elite of Gotha. The lodge became a centre of the spiritual and cultural life of Gotha, and a stronghold of enlightenment and philanthropy. Many members of Seyler's lodge, notably the Duke and his brother, also became members of the Illuminati, and the Duke later offered that society's founder Adam Weishaupt asylum in Gotha.\n\nAbel Seyler was married in his first marriage from 1754 to Sophie Elisabeth Andreae (1730–1764), the daughter of the wealthy Hanoverian court pharmacist Leopold Andreae (1686–1730) and Katharina Elisabeth Rosenhagen (died 1752). Her parents were already deceased and her only close relative was her older brother and only sibling, the court pharmacist J.G.R. Andreae, who became a noted Enlightenment natural scientist. The wedding took place in Hanover and Abel and Sophie Elisabeth had two sons and a daughter: Abel Seyler (the Younger), who became court pharmacist in Celle and who was a member of the Illuminati; L.E. Seyler, a prominent Hamburg banker and politician; and Sophie Seyler, who married the \"Sturm und Drang\" poet Johann Anton Leisewitz, the author of \"Julius of Tarent\".\n\nAfter the death of his first wife in 1764, their children were raised in Hanover by their maternal uncle. By several accounts J.G.R. Andreae was a highly erudite, generous and kind man who became a loving father figure to his sister's children; he had no children of his own. The children since had limited or no contact with their father, and all lived more conventional lives than him. They inherited the Andreae pharmacy from their uncle on his death in 1793.\n\nIn 1772 Abel Seyler married the actress Friederike Sophie Seyler (formerly married Hensel). They had no children.\n\nThe principal founder of biochemistry and molecular biology, Felix Hoppe-Seyler, was an adopted son of his grandson. Seyler was a godfather of Jacob Herzfeld (born 1763), known as the first Jewish stage actor in Germany, when the latter converted to Christianity in 1796.\n\n"}
{"id": "31459363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31459363", "title": "Affective disposition theory", "text": "Affective disposition theory\n\nAffective disposition theory (ADT), in its simplest form, states that media and entertainment users make moral judgments about characters in a narrative which in turn affects their enjoyment of the narrative. This theory was first posited by Zillmann and Cantor (1972), and many offshoots have followed in various areas of entertainment (Raney, 2006a). Entertainment users make constant judgments of a character's actions, and these judgments enable the user to determine which character they believe is the \"good guy\" or the \"villain\". However, in an article written in 2004, Raney examined the fundamental ADT assumption that viewers of drama always form their dispositions toward characters through moral judgment of motives and conduct. Raney argued that viewers/consumers of entertainment media could form positive dispositions toward characters before any moral scrutinizing occurs. He proposed that viewers sometimes develop story schemas that provide them \"with the cognitive pegs upon which to hang their initial interpretations and expectations of characters\" (Raney, 2004a, p. 354). The basic idea of the affective disposition theory is used as a way to explain how emotions become part of the entertainment experience.\n\nDisposition theory has multiple applications in many areas of entertainment. Its most basic premise is that entertainment users attach an emotion to various characters within a narrative, but this has been expanded to comedy, drama, tragedy, violence, and sport (Raney, 2006a). Although some theorist argue that the similar theories used to explore different forms of entertainment media encompass the same general processes, some evidence exists that disposition formation may differ across content. Sapolsky's research (1980) found that viewer race rather than the previously mentioned \"morality\" was an accurate predictor in team favorability in an all-White versus all-Black basketball game. With regard to antihero narratives, researchers such as Sapolsky have suggested that the actual formation process of dispositions may differ from the traditional affective disposition theory formula. The traditional Disposition Theory is closely related to misattribution theory of humor. Disposition Theory takes the position that entertainment users are just an audience, they are not active. By employing this perspective, the audience does not experience real emotion towards the events in the narrative, but rather experience suspense instead. Traditional Disposition Theory is most often applied in the context of humor, but is also applicable to drama and sports.\n\nRaney (2006a) offered six principles that are shared amongst all applications of disposition theory:\n\nAs stated earlier, disposition theories can be applied in many contexts, but most share similar characteristics, as identified by Raney (2006). In summation, these six principles are strongly centered around the ideas of enjoyment of entertainment and emotional responses. These theories can be used to formulate narratives and create drama and emotional arousal during a story. Using these six principles, one can surmise that creating a strong and opposing disposition for the characters in the story will lead to greater enjoyment for the viewer. By making a villain's actions terribly amoral, and the hero's actions extremely moral, one can create emotional arousal in a viewer.\n\nZillmann (1996) offered a model of disposition formation. The model begins with a character's behavior and ends with approval of the story. There are seven main steps in disposition formation:\n\n\nThis model further illuminates the disposition process. As stated earlier, if a story incites a strong disposition toward any character, viewer enjoyment is likely to be higher due to the emotional arousal created by the narrative. Through this model, one can pinpoint where and how a disposition is created. This model also displays the steps the viewer goes through to create a disposition.\n\nThe creator of any narrative can use Disposition Theory to heighten emotional arousal, and therefore enjoyment, in any narrative. By applying the steps of the disposition model a writer can heighten the experience of a narrative. Creating a strong disposition towards the characters will lead the viewer to hope for a positive outcome for the hero and a negative outcome for the villain, all the while fearing a negative outcome for the hero and fearing a positive outcome for the villain. By delaying this outcome, the writer can create suspense in the viewer. By creating suspense, the writer can heighten emotional arousal and, therefore, heighten enjoyment of the narrative. In summation, by creating a strong disposition towards characters, a writer can heighten the audience's enjoyment of the narrative.\n\nThe concepts of the traditional affective disposition theory have been applied to sports media consumption by considering the fact that enjoyment could be conceived as the emotional response to consuming media surrounding players or teams. The exploration of enjoyment of sport spectatorship is very complex and must take into account fan socialization and disposition formation. Research on fan socialization investigates how people are originally socialized as sports fans, and also examines the reasons why people form allegiances towards specific teams. Raney (2006b) states that these allegiances and types of socializations are at the core of the entertainment motivation for viewing sports media.\n\nThe specific version of the disposition theory that is used in sport media viewing (Disposition Theory of Sport Spectatorship) applies the basic ideas of the disposition theory to sports content. The basic premise that is used to cross over into the world of sport is that enjoyment of entertainment is primarily a reflection of both the consumers' feelings toward the players or teams and the outcomes (Zillmann, 1985, 1991, 2000; Zillmann & Cantor, 1977; Raney, 2004a, 2004b; Raney, 2006b; Peterson & Raney, 2008). Raney (2006b) also found that the expectation of experiencing enjoyment is the greatest reason that sports media viewers report for why they consume sports media.\n\nAccording to academic researchers and theorist (Bryant & Raney, 2000; Zillman, Bryant & Sapolsky, 1989; Zillman & Paulus, 1993), the Disposition Theory of Sports Spectatorship states that a viewer’s affiliation or allegiance to a particular team or player must be discussed along a continuum. This continuum ranges from extremely positive through indifference to extremely negative. Raney (2006b) posits that the enjoyment of viewing a sporting event comes as a by-product of a combination of the outcome of the game, and the viewers strength and valence of dispositions held toward the competitors. Exposure to the competitors over time allows individuals to develop these dispositions of varying valence and degree toward teams and athletes. In more simplistic terms, the enjoyment of the spectator or viewer has been found to increase the more the winning team is favored by the spectator/viewer and the more the losing team is disliked by the spectator/viewer. Henceforth, the maximum enjoyment of the spectator comes when the intensely liked team or player defeats the intensely disliked team or player.\n\nAdditionally, research indicates that sports fanship in general is important to enjoyment of sports media. Specifically, Gantz & Wenner (1991, 1995) found that the selective exposure to media and motivations for viewing sports media literatures indicate that fanship in relation to the particular sport also impacts perceptions about the contest. Therefore, the argument can be made that this level of dispositional affiliation toward the sport might also impact perceived suspense and enjoyment.\n\nRaney and Depalma (2006) also noted that the nature of the sport being view, either scripted or unscripted, cause viewers to approach the sporting event with differing expectations of enjoyment. The uncertainty of outcomes for contests that are unscripted when combined with multiple other factors such as rivalry strength and importance of the game to the overall ranking of the team affect the suspense and enjoyment of viewing.\n\n"}

{"id": "684801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=684801", "title": "Andy Clark", "text": "Andy Clark\n\nAndrew Clark, (born 1957) is a professor of philosophy and Chair in Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Before this, he was director of the Cognitive Science Program at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and previously taught at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri and the University of Sussex in England. Clark is one of the founding members of the CONTACT collaborative research project whose aim is to investigate the role environment plays in shaping the nature of conscious experience. Clark's papers and books deal with the philosophy of mind and he is considered a leading scientist in mind extension. He has also written extensively on connectionism, robotics and the role and nature of mental representation.\n\nClark's work explores a number of disparate but interrelated themes. Many of these themes run against established wisdom in cognitive processing and representation. According to traditional computational accounts, the function of the mind is understood as the process of creating, storing and updating internal representations of the world, on the basis of which other processes and actions may take place. Representations are updated to correspond with an environment in accordance with the function, goal-state, or desire of the system in question at any given time. Thus, for example, learning a new route through a maze-like building would be mirrored in a change in the representation of that building. Action, on this view, is the outcome of a process which determines the best way to achieve the goal-state or desire, based on current representations. Such a determinative process may be the purview of a Cartesian \"central executive\" or a distributed process like homuncular decomposition.\n\nIn contrast to traditional models of cognition, which often posit the one-way flow of sensory information from the periphery towards more remote areas of the brain, Clark has suggested a two-way \"cascade of cortical processing\" underlying perception, action, and learning. The concept of predictive processing lies at the heart of this view, wherein top-down predictions attempt to correctly guess or \"explain away\" bottom-up sensory information in an iterative, hierarchical manner. Discrepancies between the expected signal and actual signal, in essence the \"prediction error,\" travel upward to help refine the accuracy of future predictions. Interactions between forward flow of error (conveyed by \"error units\") and backward flow of prediction are dynamic, with attention playing a key role in weighting the relative influence of either at each level of the cascade (dopamine is mentioned as \"one possible mechanism for encoding precision\" with regard to error units). Action (or action-oriented predictive processing) also plays an important role in Clark's account as another means by which the brain can reduce prediction error by directly influencing the environment. To this, he adds that \"personal, affective, and hedonic\" factors would be implicated along with the minimization of prediction error, creating a more nuanced model for the relationship between action and perception.\n\nAccording to Clark, the computational model, which forms the philosophical foundation of artificial intelligence, engenders several intractable problems. One of the more salient is an information bottleneck: if, in order to determine appropriate actions, it is the job of the mind to construct detailed inner representations of the external world, then, as the world is constantly changing, the demands on the mental system will almost certainly preclude any action taking place. For Clark, we need relatively little information about the world before we may act effectively upon it. We tend to be susceptible to \"grand illusion\", where our impressions of a richly detailed world obscures a reality of minimal environmental information and quick action. We needn't try to reconstruct the detail of this world, as it is able to serve as its own best model from which to extract information \"just in time\".\n\nClark's writings also focus on the concept of transhumanism, most prevalent in his work, \"Natural-Born Cyborgs\" which explores the progressing incorporation of human biology and technological implants. Through a series of contemporary technological studies and an evaluation of the cyborg figure in pop-culture, Clark maps out a perception of the cyborg as a reality. This is not necessarily to show what humanity is to become from biologically implanted technology, but rather to explore where humanity is now with said technology. In his own words, humans are \"creatures whose minds are special precisely because they are tailor-made for multiple mergers and coalitions.\" He elaborates this as he describes his body as an \"electronic virgin\" untouched by technology, but gradually over time technology will become intertwined with his biology. Whether that incorporation will be as mundane as the use of eyeglasses or something more advanced such as a new auditory prosthesis, he believes the merger of technology and biology is inevitable and present.\n\nClark is perhaps most well known for his defence of the extended mind hypothesis. \nAccording to Clark, the dynamic loops through which mind and world interact are not merely instrumental; the cycle of activity that runs from brain through body and world and back again is what constitutes cognition. The mind, on this account, is not restricted to the biological organism but extends into that organism's environment. An example is carrying out a mathematical task. One person may complete the task solely in their head, while another completes the task with the assistance of paper and pencil. By Clark's parity principle, there is no reason to count these means as different so long as the results are the same. The process of cognition in the second case involves paper and pencil, so the conception of mind appropriate to the person involved must include these items.\n\nClark concedes that, in practice, the criterion of \"equal efficiency\" required by the parity principle is seldom met. He nonetheless proposes that the boundary of \"skin and skull\" is arbitrary and cognitively meaningless. If, in the example above, the paper and pencil used by the second person becomes a virtual paper-and-pencil visible on a monitor and controlled by a silicon chip implanted in the head, the similarity between the two situations becomes clearer.\n\nClark foresees the development of cognitive prosthetics, or \"electronic brain enhancements\" (\"EBEs\"), as only the next logical step in the human mind's natural integration with technology. Clark's research interests also include wetwiring and other human-electronic integration experiments, as well as technological advances in immediate human communication and their utilization in society.\n\nTo further illustrate extended cognition, Clark uses two anecdotal examples: Inga and Otto, the latter being a patient of Alzheimer's disease. Both desire to visit a museum and must remember the address. For Inga, this is a matter of simple memory recall and accessing her belief in where she remembers the given location of the museum. Due to his condition, Otto relies on the use of written records in a notebook in order to recall his memory, as the disease makes it difficult for him to have a finite belief on the museum's location without it. This notebook in a way becomes his livelihood, functioning as a memory bank to accommodate his condition. As Clark puts it, \"his notebook plays the role usually played by a biological memory\" effectively becoming a part of his extended mind. The goal of describing the thought processes of Inga and Otto is to show multiple variations of extended cognition and how it functions differently among individuals depending on their mental biology. Clark claims the key aspect that unites the cognitive process of the two individuals is that each has the initial belief on where the museum is located. Although the way the verification of belief differs in practice between the two, they are still able to come up with a solution on the museum's location despite one using a source of external storage. In a later work, Clark addresses any potential criticism on the process of Otto's system of belief by stating that Otto's impulse to consult his notebook is a similar process to that of Inga consulting her recalled memory. Clark also elaborates on the importance of environment when using extended cognition. He believes that the way one formalizes \"beliefs\" is, \"constituted partly by features of the environment\" if they are playing the desired role of \"driving cognitive processes.” This summarizes his belief that the mind, in fact, can extend to the surrounding environment.\n\nAlthough the comparisons between Otto and Inga may seem distant when judging the power of extended cognition, Clark attempts to gap a more similar comparison between the two by claiming that if Otto were to lose his notebook it would be the same as Inga losing a thought from her consciousness. He also suggests the concept of Otto's notebook being an extension of himself, having it take on a more material role suggesting that it may be equal to the way one treats a physical appendage to their body. The notebook in a way becomes a \"fragile biological limb or organ\" one that Otto may feel to protect from harm's way.\n\nSupporters of extended cognition have used Clark's comparison between Inga and Otto as a champion analogy to support the theory of the internal mind extending into the environment. In an article on the argument of extended cognition, Erik Myin makes note of this group, \"a close causal coupling between persons and environments,\" such as Otto and his notebook, \"can license the conclusion that the mind spreads into the environment.\" His also writes that some followers use Clark's argument of, \"external elements\" playing a role that could be seen as, \"cognitive if played by something internal to a person.\" A good reference to this would be how Otto's notebook is used for cognitive verification.\n\n\"The Extended Mind\" has been met with criticism from scholars challenging extended cognition. The claim is that Clark's theories lack a differentiation of biological memory and external storage of thought. This is mainly addressed to the cognitive comparison between Otto and Inga, and how their thought processes are viewed as equal an engagement of extended thought given Otto's condition. When he uses his notepad, it is necessary reliance, as these records will help him to remember his thoughts. However, there is an argument questioning if this follows Clark's description of extended cognition as it requires a running cycle of cognitive connectivity that returns to the body.\n\nIn a critique of Clark's \"Supersizing the Mind\", Lawrence Shapiro and Shannon Spaulding, of The University of Wisconsin-Madison, touch upon this criticism from scholars who challenge extended cognition. They describe the argument against Clark being that \"...cognitive routines involving biological memory and those involving external stores of information are importantly different.\" Essentially they are claiming that the way someone stores memory externally is separate from their biological cognition. For example, if Inga were to use a notepad, it would function as an extension of her compression as her thought process would follow Clark's description of dynamic loops that return to the mind in a cycle. However, when Otto uses the notepad has a way to retain his memory, whatever thoughts he records will not follow back and will become disconnected from his biological mind. In this respect, parts of Otto's mind would essentially \"exist outside his brain,\" meaning that the comparison between Inga and Otto may not be reliant as they appear to function differently in Clark's own theory.\n\nThis criticism of Otto and Inga is addressed by Clark himself in \"Supersizing the Mind\":“[the] claim was not that the processes in Otto and Inga are identical, or even similar, in terms of their detailed implementation. It is simply that, with respect to the role that the long-term encodings play in guiding current response, both modes of storage can be seen as supporting dispositional beliefs. It is the way the information is poised to guide reasoning … and behavior that counts. (p. 96)” He argues that extended cognition was never meant to be a universal \"fine-grained similarity\" between all minds. He believes that such a \"fine-grained similarity\" is not necessary when analyzing extended consciousness, suggesting it differs depending on an individual's behavior and their given environment.\n\nClark lives in Edinburgh, Scotland with his partner, Alexa Morcom, a cognitive neuroscientist. He has a tattoo of a comic book styled, undersea theme.\n\nBooks by Andy Clark:\n\nClark is also on the editorial boards of the following journals:\n\n"}

Therefore, it is wrong to a priori superimpose overarching ideas of what is good for philosophical reasons. For example, it is wrong to blanketly assume that only happiness matters, as in utilitarianism. This is not to say though that some utilitarian-like argument can’t be valid when it comes to what is right in some particular case.\n\nConsider the continuum hypothesis, stating that there is no set with size strictly between the size of the natural numbers and the size of the real numbers. One idea is that the set universe ought to be rich, with many sets, which leads to the continuum hypothesis being false. This richness argument, the antiphilosopher might argue, is purely philosophical, and groundless, and therefore should be dismissed; maintaining that the continuum hypothesis should be settled by mathematical arguments. In particular it could be the case that the question isn't mathematically meaningful or useful, that the hypothesis is neither true, nor false. It is then wrong to stipulate, a priori and for philosophical reasons, that the continuum hypothesis is true or false.\n\n\n"}

He travelled to Tibet more than five times. On his third trip from India to Tibet he met Machig Labdrön. Dampa Sangye appears in many of the lineages of Chöd and so in Tibet he is known as the Father of Chod, however perhaps his best known teaching is \"the Pacification\" (). This teaching became an element of the Mahamudra Chöd lineages founded by Machig Labdrön.\n\nHis Tibetan name translates into Sanskrit as \"Buddha Paramapitā\" \"Buddha Excellent Father\". He often was identified by the descriptive name \"Nakpopa\", \"Black One\".\n\nSome texts report that Padmasambhava was reborn as Dampa Sangye during the life of Machig Labdrön.\n\nAnother text says:\n\n\"Drum khar Nagpopa\": Khampa yogi who meditated in dark retreat for 18 years was -according to Keith Dowman- considered to have been the twelfth of Dudjom/Jiktrel Yeshe Dorje's seventeen previous incarnations.\n\nAccording to Dilgo Khyentse (1910–1991), considered an emanation of Dampa Sangye, the story goes that the great pandit Śāntarakṣita, who was instrumental in transplanting Buddhism from India to Tibet, promised that one of his students would come one day to complete his work. Kamalaśīla (Tib., Padampa Sangye) fulfilled this prophecy. Khyentse Rinpoche in a 1987 gathering of students at Shechen Monastery, his seat in Nepal, offered a commentary on the Hundred Verses of Padampa Sangye.\n\nIn the esoteric oral tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, a version of Dampa Sangye's life-story has him traveling to China and teaching there for 12 years, where he was known as Bodhidharma the founder of Zen. Dampa Sangye is associated with the Tingri area of Tibet, where he lived for many years.\n\nBardok Chusang Rinpoche is recognized as the incarnation Dampa Sangye. He is a married yogi, living in Kathmandu.\n\nThere is a morality tale, allegory and teaching story inherent within the transmission of Chöd to Tibet that has been culturally remembered as a Cham dance. In this sacred dance, Moheyan is generally depicted as of ample girth goaded by children. Chöd is a product of both the Indian and Chinese transmissions of Buddhism into the Himalaya. For a discussion of the Dunhuang fulcrum of the entwined relationship of Chinese and Indian Buddhism refer van Schaik and Dalton (2004).\n\nFor simplicity, the Indian tantric transmission may be characterized as \"gradualist\", () and the Chan Buddhism transmission may be characterized as \"direct\", (). It needs to be emphasized that this neat dichotomy in characterization of these two approaches to the Dharma is only valid for the historical context of the great debate between Kamalaśīla and Moheyan arranged by Trisong Detsen and even then it is still open to dialectic. This debate has been named the \"Council of Samye\" by Giuseppe Tucci and also as the \"Bsam yas Debate\" or \"Council of Lhasa\" in English. According to the general Tibetan tradition, the two years of the debate transpired at Samye (Tibetan \"Bsam yas\"), a significant distance from Lhasa.\n\nAccording to the lore of the orthodox, prevailing Tibetan cultural tradition, Kamalaśīla, a \"mahapandita\" and scholar educated at Nalanda, advocated the \"gradual\" process to enlightenment; whereas Moheyan, as a trance and meditation master advocated the \"direct\" awakening of original mind through the \"nirodha\" of discursive thought, the cessation of the mind of ideation. The historicity of this debate has been drawn into question by Gomez (1983) and Ruegg (1992) though this does not lessen its importance in defining the religious and cultural traditions of Tibet. Kamalaśīla was very handsome and a great orator and historically \"won\" the debate: Though there are conflicting primary sources and secondary accounts.\n\nOne hagiography asserts that directly after this debate with Moheyan, as Kamalaśīla was making his way down from the Himalaya to the Indian lowlands, he was incited to enact \"phowa\" through compassionate duress, transferring his mindstream to animate a corpse polluted with contagion; and thereby, safely moving the hazard it presented. As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, mahāsidda Dampa Sangye came across the vacant \"kuten\" or \"physical basis\" of Kamalaśīla. Dampa Sangye was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he perceived as a newly dead fresh corpse, Dampa Sangye transferred his mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body and left with his new beautiful body. When Kamalaśīla returned to where he had left his body he only found the dark ugly body of Dampa Sangye, which he had no choice but to inhabit. Kamalaśīla's mindstream in Dampa Sangye's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted Chöd.\n\nPadampa Sangye's last testament to the people of Tingri is known by various names in English 'The Tingri Hundred' or the 'Hundred Verses'. The roman-letter transcription (Wylie) of the Tibetan, along with an English translation, is available on the Internet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "910746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=910746", "title": "De Interpretatione", "text": "De Interpretatione\n\nDe Interpretatione or On Interpretation (Greek: Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας, \"Peri Hermeneias\") is the second text from Aristotle's Organon and is among the earliest surviving philosophical works in the Western tradition to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit, and formal way. The work is usually known by its Latin title.\n\nThe work begins by analyzing simple \"categoric\" propositions, and draws a series of basic conclusions on the routine issues of classifying and defining basic linguistic forms, such as \"simple terms\" and \"propositions\", nouns and verbs, negation, the \"quantity\" of simple propositions (primitive roots of the quantifiers in modern symbolic logic), investigations on the \"excluded middle\" (what to Aristotle is not applicable to future tense propositions—the problem of future contingents), and on \"modal propositions\".\n\nThe first five chapters deal with the terms that form propositions. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the relationship between affirmative, negative, universal and particular propositions. These relationships are the basis of the well-known Square of opposition. The distinction between universal and particular propositions is the basis of modern quantification theory. The last three chapters deal with modalities. Chapter 9 is famous for the discussion of the sea-battle. (If it is true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow, then it is true \"today\" that there will be a sea-battle. Thus a sea-battle is apparently unavoidable, and thus necessary. Another \"interpretation\" would be: that we cannot know that which has not yet come to pass. In other words: if there is a sea battle tomorrow then it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle. So, only if we can know whether or not there will be a sea battle tomorrow then can we know if there will be a sea battle).\n\n\"Chapter 1\". Aristotle defines words as symbols of 'affections of the soul' or mental experiences. Spoken and written symbols differ between languages, but the mental experiences are the same for all (so that the English word 'cat' and the French word 'chat' are different symbols, but the mental experience they stand for—the concept of a cat—is the same for English speakers and French speakers). Nouns and verbs on their own do not involve truth or falsity.\n\n\"Chapter 2\". A noun signifies the subject by convention, but without reference to time.\n\n\"Chapter 3\". A verb carries with it the notion of time. 'He was healthy' and 'he will be healthy' are tenses of a verb. An untensed verb indicates the present, the tenses of a verb indicate times outside the present.\n\n\"Chapter 4\". The sentence is an expression whose parts have meaning. The word 'cat' signifies something, but is not a sentence. Only when words are added to it do we have affirmation and negation.\n\n\"Chapter 5\". Every simple proposition contains a verb. A simple proposition indicates a single fact, and the conjunction of its parts gives a unity. A complex proposition is several propositions compounded together.\n\n\"Chapter 6\". An affirmation is an assertion of something, a denial an assertion denying something of something. (For example, 'a man is an animal' asserts 'animal' of 'man'. 'A stone is not an animal' denies 'animal' of stone').\n\n\"Chapter 7\". Terms. Some terms are universal. A universal term is capable of being asserted of several subjects (for example 'moon'—even though the Earth has one moon, it may have had more, and the noun 'moon' could have been said of them in exactly the same sense). Other terms are individual. An individual or singular term ('Plato') is not predicated (in the same) sense of more than one individual.\n\nA universal affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every man is mortal' and a universal negative proposition having the same subject and predicate, such as, 'No man is mortal,' are called \"contrary\". A universal affirmative proposition (\"Every man is mortal\") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way (\"Some men are not mortal\") are called \"contradictories\". Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true. For example, both 'Every man is honest' and 'No man is honest' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some men are not honest' and 'Some men are honest,' are both true.\n\n\"Chapter 8\". An affirmation is single, if it expresses a single fact. For example, 'every man is mortal'. However, if a word has two meanings, for example if the word 'garment' meant 'man and horse', then 'the garment is white' would not be a single affirmation, for it would mean 'the man and horse are white', which is equivalent to the two simple propositions 'a man is white and a horse is white'.\n\n\"Chapter 9\". Of contradictory propositions about the past and present, one must be true, the other false. But when the subject is individual, and the proposition is future, this is not the case. For if so, nothing takes place by chance. For either the future proposition such as, 'A sea battle will take place,' corresponds with future reality, or its negation does, in which case the sea battle will take place with necessity, or not take place with necessity. But in reality, such an event might just as easily not happen as happen; the meaning of the word 'by chance' with regard to future events is that reality is so constituted that it may issue in either of two opposite possibilities. This is known as the problem of future contingents.\n\n\"Chapter 10\". Aristotle enumerates the affirmations and denials that can be assigned when 'indefinite' terms such as 'unjust' are included. He makes a distinction that was to become important later, between the use of the verb 'is' as a mere copula or 'third element', as in the sentence 'a man is wise', and as a predicate signifying existence, as in 'a man is [i.e. exists]'.\n\n\"Chapter 11\". Some propositions appear to be simple, but are really composite. In a single proposition, the nouns referring to the subjects combine to form a unity. Thus, 'two-footed domesticated animal' applies to a 'man', and the three predicates combine to form a unity. But in the term 'a white walking man' the three predicates do not combine to form a unity of this sort.\n\n\"Chapter 12\". This chapter considers the mutual relation of modal propositions: affirmations and denials which assert or deny possibility or contingency, impossibility or necessity.\n\"Chapter 13\". The relation between such propositions. Logical consequences follow from this arrangement. For example, from the proposition 'it is possible' it follows that it is contingent, that it is not impossible, or from the proposition 'it cannot be the case' there follows 'it is necessarily not the case'.\n\n\"Chapter 14\". Is there an affirmative proposition corresponding to every denial? For example, is the proposition 'every man is unjust' an affirmation (since it seems to affirm being unjust of every man) or is it merely a negative (since it denies justice)?\n\nThe logical square, also called square of opposition or square of Apuleius has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: Every man is white, the universal affirmative and its negation Not every man is white (or Some men are not white), the particular negative on the one hand, Some men are white, the particular affirmative and its negation No man is white, the universal negative on the other. Robert Blanché published with Vrin his book \"Structures intellectuelles\" in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or square of opposition representing four values should be replaced by the logical hexagon which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language. The study of the four propositions constituting the square is found in Chapter 7 and its appendix Chapter 8. Most important also is the immediately following Chapter 9 dealing with the problem of future contingents. This chapter and the subsequent ones are at the origin of modal logic.\n\nAristotle's original Greek text, Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας (\"Peri Hermeneias\") was translated into the Latin \"De Interpretatione\" by Marius Victorinus, at Rome, in the 4th century.\n\nAnother translation was completed by Boethius in the 6th century, c. 510/512.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10082240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10082240", "title": "Douglas Kellner", "text": "Douglas Kellner\n\nDouglas Kellner (born 1943) is an academic who works at the intersection of \"third generation\" critical theory in the tradition of the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, or Frankfurt School and in cultural studies in the tradition of the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, also known as the \"Birmingham School\". He has argued that these two conflicting philosophies are in fact compatible. He is currently the George Kneller Chair in the Philosophy of Education in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nKellner was an early theorist of the field of critical media literacy and has been a leading theorist of media culture generally. In his recent work, he has increasingly argued that media culture has become dominated by the forms of spectacle and mega-spectacle. He also has contributed important studies of alter-globalization processes, and has always been concerned with counter-hegemonic movements and alternative cultural expressions in the name of a more radically democratic society. More recently, he is known for his work exploring the politically oppositional potentials of new media and attempted to delineate what they term \"multiple technoliteracies\" as a movement away from the present attempt to standardize a corporatist form of computer literacy.\n\nHe has collaborated with a number of other authors, including K. Daniel Cho, Tyson E. Lewis, Clayton Pierce, and Rhonda Hammer. With Steven Best, Kellner collaborated on an award-winning trilogy of books examining postmodern turns in philosophy, the arts, and science and technology. He served as the literary executor of the documentary film maker Emile de Antonio and is now overseeing the publication of six volumes of the collected papers of the critical theorist Herbert Marcuse.\nDuring the 1960s, Kellner was a philosophy student at Columbia University in New York and partook in student protests against the Vietnam War. During this time he came to believe in the political nature of knowledge as well as the relationship between history and the production of ideas. A historical understanding of philosophy's relationship to one's lived experiences became increasingly clear to Kellner through his research into German critical theory at the University of Tübingen in Germany. While studying there, he read the works of Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Karl Korsch, Herbert Marcuse, and Ernst Bloch, all of whom were instrumental in a new form of Marxist criticism concerned primarily with questions of culture and subjectivity rather than with analysing production.\n\nKellner then went from Germany to France, where he attended lectures and read books of Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Baudrillard, Jean-François Lyotard, and others who would be associated with postmodern theory. Hence, Kellner's philosophical explorations did not end with the Frankfurt School. With his co-author Steven Best, Kellner has gone on to write a series of books critically interrogating what has come to be known as postmodern theory. Although adopting many insights from postmodernists such as Michel Foucault, as well as many feminist and critical race theorists, Kellner retains the centrality of critical theory as a macro-theoretical lens capable of building conceptual bridges between various political movements and capable of critically evaluating and mediating competing philosophical perspectives.\nThroughout his philosophical adventures, Kellner has drawn from the Frankfurt School a concern for the industrialization and commercialization of culture under capitalist relations of production. This situation has become most acute in the United States with its highly commercial media culture. Combining insights and methodological tools from the Frankfurt School and from British cultural studies, Kellner has written on media culture as a complex political, philosophical, and economic phenomenon. In his view, media emerges as a \"contested terrain\" in which political struggles are played out in narrative and visual forms. Thus films, television, internet, etc. articulate dominant, conservative, reactionary social values but also offer progressive resistance against these values. As an example of Kellner's method of media analysis, he has read the image of the pop sensation Madonna as a complex representation of women that challenges gender, sexual, and fashion stereotypes while at the same time reasserting those very codes by offering a \"new\" notion of the self that is reliant upon hyper-consumerism. Kellner's work in the area of media culture has been influential for educators concerned with fostering \"critical media literacy\" capable of decoding the complexities of the visual culture that surrounds us.\n\nAnother equally important line of inquiry defining Kellner's work is his interest in \"techno-capitalism\" or capitalism defined by ever sophisticated advances in technology. Thus Kellner has been at the forefront of theorizing new technologies and their social, political, and economic impacts. His interest in technologies began in the mid-seventies while a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Here Kellner studied the political economy of television producing the renowned and original works \"Television and the Crisis of Democracy\" and \"The Persian Gulf Television War\" as well as launching his own very successful alternative culture public-access television cable TV show entitled \"Alternative Views\". As with his theories of media images, Kellner offers a dialectical approach to new technologies, highlighting their progressive and democratic potentials while also critiquing the undeniable reality of corporate interests that drive the technologies market. Again this work has become increasingly important for educators concerned with the role of technology in the classroom. Indeed, Kellner has focused studies in education on explicating media literacy and the multiple literacies needed to critically engage culture in the contemporary era. On this basis, he has called for a democratic reconstruction of education for the new digitized, mediated, global and multicultural era.\n\nIn January 2006, Kellner was caught up in the Bruin Alumni Association's controversial \"Dirty Thirty\" project which listed UCLA's most politically extreme professors. The list was compiled by a former UCLA graduate student, Andrew Jones, who had previously been fired by his mentor David Horowitz for pressuring \"students to file false reports about leftists\" and for stealing Horowitz's mailing list of potential contributors to fund research for attacks on leftwing professors.\n\nThe Association offered students up to $100 for tapes of lectures that show how \"radicals\" on the faculty are \"actively proselytizing their extreme views in the classroom.\" Kellner, named number three; Peter McLaren, also in the School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA, topped the list at number one.\n\nKellner responded in print with the view that the \"attack exemplified rightwing interventions within the cultural wars that have raged on campuses since the 1960s.\"\n\nKellner's writing style has been the subject of criticism in the scholarly field, as many of his books are fiercely political. A \"Publishers Weekly\" review of \"Grand Theft 2000: Media Spectacle and a Stolen Election\" was positive, though it concluded that the book's end result is \"somewhat formless and unfocused.\" Although the review praised some aspects, notably Kellner's highlighting of some conservative ideological inconsistencies, it lamented that Kellner's \"sporadic, underdeveloped discussion of Republicans projecting their own sins onto Democrats is particularly frustrating.\"\n\nKellner received the 2008 American Educational Studies Association (AESA) Critics’ Choice Award for his book \"Guys and Guns Amok: Domestic Terrorism and School Shootings from the Oklahoma City Bombing to the Virginia Tech Massacre\". The book argues that school shootings and other acts of mass violence embody a crisis of out-of-control gun culture and male rage, heightened by a glorification of hypermasculinity and violence in the media.\n\n\n\n"}

This was the first major text on Cubism, predating \"Les Peintres Cubistes\" by Guillaume Apollinaire (1913). The book is illustrated with black and white photographs of works by Paul Cézanne (1), Gleizes (5), Metzinger (5), Fernand Léger (5), Juan Gris (1), Francis Picabia (2), Marcel Duchamp (2), Pablo Picasso (1), Georges Braque (1), André Derain (1), and Marie Laurencin (2).\n\nThe highly influential treatise was published by , Collection \"Tous les Arts\", Paris, 1912. Prior to publication the book was announced in the \"Revue d'Europe et d'Amérique\", March 1912; for the occasion of the Salon de Indépendants during the spring of 1912 in the \"Gazette des beaux-arts\"; and in \"Paris-Journal\", October 26, 1912. It is thought to have appeared in November or early December 1912. It was subsequently published in English and Russian in 1913. A Russian translation by Mikhail Matiushin appeared in the issue of \"Soiuz molodezhi\" in March 1913.\n\nA new edition was published in 1947 with an \"avant-propos\" by Gleizes and an epilogue by Metzinger. The artists took the occasion to reflect upon the evolution of this avant-garde artistic movement thirty three years after the appearance of the first publication of \"Du \"Cubism\"\".\n\nThe collaboration between Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger that would lead to the publication of \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" began during the aftermath of the 1910 Salon d'Automne. At this massive Parisian exhibition, renowned for displaying the latest and most radical artistic tendencies, several artists including Gleizes, and in particular Metzinger, stood out from the rest. The utilization of a non-conventional form of geometry had permeated the works of these artists who \"a priori\" had little or no contact between one another.\n\nIn a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne the poet (1885-1961) announced the appearance of a new school of French painters who—in contrast with Les Fauves and Neo-Impressionists—concentrated their attention on form rather than on color. A group formed following the exhibition that would include Gleizes, Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, and Robert Delaunay (a friend and associate of Metzinger since 1906). They convened regularly at the studio of le Fauconnier where he worked on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled \"L'Abondance\". \"In this painting\" writes Brooke, \"the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements\". But it was Metzinger, a \"Montmartrois\" in close contact with Le Bateau-Lavoir and its habitués—including Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Maurice Princet, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque—who introduced to Gleizes and the others of the group, with his \"Nu à la cheminée (Nu)\", 1910, an extreme species of 'analytic' Cubism (a term that would emerge years later to describe the 1910-1911 works of Picasso and Braque).\n\nA few months later, during the spring of 1911 at the Salon des Indépendants, the term \"Cubisme\" (derived by critics' attempts to derogatorily ridicule the \"geometrical follies\" that gave a \"cubic\" appearance to their work) would officially be introduced to the public in relation to these artists exhibiting in the 'Salle 41', which included Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Léger, and Delaunay (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from public exhibitions at the time resulting from a contract with the Kahnweiler gallery).\n\nA seminal text written by Metzinger titled \"Note sur la peinture\", published during the fall of 1910, closely coinciding with Salon d'Automne, cites Picasso, Braque, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier as painters who were realising a 'total emancipation' ['affranchissement fondementale'] of painting.\n\nThe idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points later treated in \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" was a central idea of Metzinger's \"Note sur la Peinture\". Indeed, prior to Cubism painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. Metzinger enunciated for the first time in \"Note sur la peinture\" the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. In that article, Metzinger notes that Braque and Picasso \"discarded traditional perspective and granted themselves the liberty of moving around objects.\" This is the concept of \"mobile perspective\" that would tend towards the representation of the \"total image\"; a series of ideas that still today define the fundamental characteristics of Cubist art.\n\nSetting the stage for \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", Metzinger's \"Note sur la peinture\" not only highlighted the works of Picasso and Braque, on the one hand, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay on the other. It was also a tactical selection that highlighted the fact that only Metzinger himself was positioned to write about all four. Metzinger, uniquely, had been closely acquainted with the Montmartre group (gallery cubists) and the burgeoning Salon Cubists simultaneously.\n\nThe Salon de la Section d'Or was an exhibition organized by the Salon Cubists with the goal of bringing together all the most radical trends in painting and sculpture to date. Scheduled to take place at the Galerie La Boétie in Paris, October 1912, directly after the Salon d'Automne. Gleizes and Metzinger, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, published \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", a major defense of Cubism, resulting in the first theoretical essay on the new movement; predating \"Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques (The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations)\" by Guillaume Apollinaire (1913) and \"Der Weg zum Kubismus\" by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1920).\n\nBefore World War I the image of Cubism in France and abroad was founded on an extremely broad definition. \"A more heterogeneous view of Cubism is certainly encouraged by the earliest promotional writings by its practitioners and associates\", writes art historian Christopher Green:\n\nThe Salon d’Automne of 1912 led to a debate on Cubism in the Chambre des Députés: since the exhibition was held in the State’s Grand Palais, the State was seen as subsidizing Cubism. It was against this background of public anger and revolt that Gleizes and Metzinger wrote \"Du \"Cubisme\"\". It was not solely an initiative to explain the new art, but an attempt to persuade the masses that their intentions were genuine.\n\nThe 'Salle 41' Cubists, through Gleizes, were closely associated with the Abbaye de Créteil; a group of writers and artists that included Alexandre Mercereau, Jules Romains, , , Pierre Jean Jouve, Georges Duhamel, , Charles Vildrac and . Many were interested in notion of 'duration' proposed by the philosopher Henri Bergson, according to which life is experienced subjectively as a continual movement in the direction of time, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. Other Cubists showed affinities with this concept, and to Bergson’s insistence on the 'elasticity' of our consciousness in both time and space.\n\nThe Neo-Symbolist writers Jacques Nayral and associated with the Unanimist movement in poetry. In his capacity as Figuière's editorial assistant Nayral had selected for publishing \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" and \"Les Peintres Cubistes\" as part of a projected series on the arts. These writers and other Symbolists valued expression and subjective experience over an objective view of the physical world, embracing an antipositivist or antirationalist perspective.\n\nIn \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related the concept of 'multiple perspective' to the Bergsonian sense of time. The faceted treatment of physical objects and space blurred the distinctions (by means of 'passage') between subject and abstraction, between representation and non-objectivity. Effects of non-Euclidean geometry were used to convey a psychophysical sense of fluidity of consciousness. These preoccupations are in tune with Jules Romains’ theory of Unanimism, which stresses the importance of collective feelings in the breaking down of barriers between people.\n\nOne major innovation made by Gleizes and Metzinger was the inclusion of the concept of simultaneity into not just the theoretical framework of Cubism, but into the physical paintings themselves. It was in part a concept born out of a conviction based on their understanding of Henri Poincaré and Bergson that the separation or distinction between space and time should be comprehensively challenged. New philosophical and scientific ideas were emerging based on non-Euclidean geometry, Riemannian geometry and the relativity of knowledge, contradicting notions of absolute truth. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism.\n\nPoincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that 'understood' them and that no theory could be considered 'true'. \"The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality\", Poincaré wrote in his 1902 \"Science and Hypothesis\".\n\nMetzinger and Gleizes wrote with reference to non-Euclidean geometry in \"Du \"Cubisme\"\". It was argued that Cubism itself was not based on any geometrical theory, but that non-Euclidean geometry corresponded better than classical, or Euclidean geometry, to what the Cubists were doing. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension with 3-space.\n\nThe reconstruction of the \"total image\" was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) are just as important as the whole. Yet, the \"total image\", greater than the sum of the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind of the beholder. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.\n\nThe concept of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously (multiple or mobile perspective) \"to seize it from several successive appearances, which fused into a single image, reconstitute in time\" developed by Metzinger (in his 1911 article \"Cubisme et tradition\") and touched upon in \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", was not derived from Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, though it was certainly influenced in a similar way, through the work of Jules Henri Poincaré (particularly Science and Hypothesis). Poincaré's writings, unlike Einstein's, were well known leading up to 1912. Poincaré's widely read book, \"La Science et l'Hypothèse\", was published in 1902 (by Flammarion).\n\nGleizes and Metzinger render homage to Cézanne in their 1912 Cubist manifesto \"Du \"Cubisme\"\":\n\nFor Metzinger and Gleizes, Cubism was nothing less than an extension of a tradition in painting:\n\nThe artist endeavours to enclose the unmeasurable sum of the affinities perceived between the visible manifestation and the tendency of his mind, write Metzinger and Gleizes:\n\nLet the picture imitate nothing; let it nakedly present its \"raison d'être\". We should indeed be ungrateful were we to deplore the absence of all those things flowers, or landscape, or faces whose mere reflection it might have been. Nevertheless, let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; not yet, at all events. An art cannot be raised to the level of a pure effusion at the first step.<br><br>\n\nThis is understood by the cubist painters, who indefatigably study pictorial form and the space which it engenders.<br><br>\n\nThis space we have negligently confounded with pure visual space or with Euclidian space. Euclid, in one of his postulates, speaks of the indeformability of figures in movement, so we need not\ninsist upon this point.<br><br>\n\nIf we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.<br><br>\n\nAs for visual space, we know that it results from the agreement of the sensations of convergence and \"accommodation\" in the eye.\n\nThe convergence of classical perspective to evoke depth is treated in \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" as an illusion. \"Moreover, we know that even the most serious infractions of the rules of perspective by no means detract from the spatiality of a painting. The Chinese painters evoke space, although they exhibit a strong partiality for \"divergence\".\"\n\nTo establish pictorial space, we must have recourse to tactile and motor sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality, contracting or dilating, that transforms the plane of the picture. Since in reaction this plane reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces.<br><br>\n\nThe forms which are situated within this space spring from a dynamism which we profess to command. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensibility. There are only \"nuances\"; form appears endowed with properties identical with those of colour. It can be tempered or augmented by contact with another form; it can be destroyed or emphasized; it is multiplied or it disappears. An ellipse may change its circumference because it is inscribed in a polygon. A form which is more emphatic than the surrounding forms may govern the whole picture, may imprint its own effigy upon everything. Those picture-makers who minutely imitate one or two leaves in order that all the leaves of a tree may seem to be painted, show in a clumsy fashion that they suspect this truth. An illusion, perhaps, but we must take it into account. The eye quickly interests the mind in its errors. These analogies and contrasts are capable of all good and all evil; the masters felt this when they tried to compose with pyramids, crosses, circles, semicircles, etc.\n\nThe Cubists, according to the 1912 manifesto written by Gleizes and Mtezinger, revealed a new manner of regarding light:\n\nAccording to them, to illuminate is to reveal; to colour is to specify the mode of revelation. They call luminous that which strikes the imagination, and dark that which the imagination has to penetrate.<br><br>\n\nWe do not mechanically connect the sensation of white with the idea of light, any more than we connect the sensation of black with the idea of darkness. We admit that a black jewel, even if of a dead black, may be more luminous than the white or pink satin of its case. Loving light, we refuse to measure it, and we avoid the geometrical ideas of the focus and the ray, which imply the repetition-contrary to the principle of variety which guides us-of bright planes and sombre intervals in a given direction. Loving colour, we refuse to limit it, and subdued or dazzling, fresh or muddy, we accept all the possibilities contained between the two extreme points of the spectrum, between the cold and the warm tone.<br><br>\n\nHere are a thousand tints which issue from the prism, and hasten to range themselves in the lucid region forbidden to those who are blinded by the immediate...\n\nThere are two methods of regarding the division of the canvas, in addition to the inequality of parts being granted as a prime condition. Both methods are based on the relationship between color and form:\n\nAccording to the first, all the parts are connected by a rhythmic convention which is determined by one of them. This—its position on the canvas matters little—gives the painting a centre from which the gradations of colour proceed, or towards which they tend, according as the maximum or minimum of intensity resides there.<br><br>\n\nAccording to the second method, in order that the spectator, himself free to establish unity, may apprehend all the elements in the order assigned to them by creative intuition, the properties of each portion must be left independent, and the plastic continuum must be broken into a thousand surprises of light and shade. [...]<br><br>\n\nEvery inflection of form is accompanied by a modification of colour, and every modification of colour gives birth to a form.\n\nGleizes and Metzinger continue:\n\nThere is nothing real outside ourselves; there is nothing real except the coincidence of a sensation and an individual mental direction. Far be it from us to throw any doubts upon the existence of the objects which strike our senses; but, rationally speaking, we can only have certitude with regard to the images which they produce in the mind.<br><br>\n\nIt therefore amazes us when well-meaning critics try to explain the remarkable difference between the forms attributed to nature and those of modern painting by a desire to represent things not as they appear, but as they are. As they are! How are they, what are they? According to them, the object possesses an absolute form, an essential form, and we should suppress chiaroscuro and traditional perspective in order to present it. What simplicity! An object has not one absolute form; it has many. It has as many as there are planes in the region of perception. What these writers say is marvelously applicable to geometrical form. Geometry is a science; painting is an art. The geometer measures; the painter savours. The absolute of the one is necessarily the relative of the other; if logic takes fright at this idea, so much the worse! Will logic ever prevent a wine from being different in the retort of the chemist and in the glass of the drinker?<br><br>\n\nWe are frankly amused to think that many a novice may perhaps pay for his too literal comprehension of the remarks of one cubist, and his faith in the existence of an Absolute Truth, by painfully juxtaposing the six faces of a cube or the two ears of a model seen in profile.<br><br>\n\nDoes it ensue from this that we should follow the example of the impressionists and rely upon the senses alone? By no means. We seek the essential, but we seek it in our personality and not in a sort of eternity, laboriously divided by mathematicians and philosophers. <br><br>\n\nMoreover, as we have said, the only difference between the impressionists and ourselves is a difference of intensity, and we do not wish it to be otherwise.<br><br>\n\nThere are as many images of an object as there are eyes which look at it; there are as many essential images of it as there are minds which comprehend it.<br><br>\n\nBut we cannot enjoy in isolation; we wish to dazzle others with that which we daily snatch from the world of sense, and in return we wish others to show us their trophies. From a reciprocity of concessions arise those mixed images, which we hasten to confront with artistic creations in order to compute what they contain of the objective; that is of the purely conventional.\n\nReviewing the English edition, \"Cubism\", T. Fisher Unwin, 1913, a critic in \"The Burlington magazine for Connoisseurs\" writes:\nFor the authors of this book \"painting is not—or is no longer—the art of imitating an object by means of lines and colours, but the art of giving our instinct a plastic consciousness\". Many will follow them so far who will be unable or unwilling to follow them further on the road to cubism. Yet even to the unwilling their book will prove suggestive. Their theory of painting is founded upon a philosophic idealism. It is impossible to paint things \"as they are\", because it is impossible to know how and what they \"really\" are. Decoration must go by the board; decorative work is the antithesis of the picture, which \"bears its pretext, the reason for its existence, within it\". The authors are not afraid of the conclusions which they find resulting from their premisses. The ultimate aim of painting is to touch the crowd; but it is no business of the painter to explain himself to the crowd. On the contrary, it is the business of the crowd to follow the painter in his transubstantiation of the object, \"so that the most accustomed eye has some difficulty in discovering it\". Yet the authors disapprove of \"fantastic occultism\" no less than of the negative truth conveyed by the conventional symbols of the academic painters. Indeed, the object of the whole book is to condemn systems of all kinds, and to defend cubism as the liberator from systems, the means of expression of the one truth, which is the truth in the artist's mind. The short but able and suggestive essay is followed by twenty-five half-tone illustrations, from Cézanne to Picabia.\n\n"}

{"id": "9286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9286", "title": "Ethical non-naturalism", "text": "Ethical non-naturalism\n\nEthical non-naturalism is the meta-ethical view which claims that:\n\nThis makes ethical non-naturalism a non-definist form of moral realism, which is in turn a form of cognitivism. Ethical non-naturalism stands in opposition to ethical naturalism, which claims that moral terms and properties are reducible to non-moral terms and properties, as well as to all forms of moral anti-realism, including ethical subjectivism (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), error theory (which denies that any moral propositions are true), and non-cognitivism (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all).\n\nAccording to G. E. Moore, \"Goodness is a simple, undefinable, non-natural property.\" To call goodness \"non-natural\" does not mean that it is supernatural or divine. It does mean, however, that goodness cannot be reduced to natural properties such as needs, wants or pleasures. Moore also stated that a reduction of ethical properties to a divine command would be the same as stating their naturalness. This would be an example of what he referred to as \"the naturalistic fallacy.\"\n\nMoore claimed that goodness is \"indefinable\", i.e., it cannot be defined in any other terms. This is the central claim of non-naturalism. Thus, the meaning of sentences containing the word \"good\" cannot be explained entirely in terms of sentences not containing the word \"good.\" One cannot substitute words referring to pleasure, needs or anything else in place of \"good.\"\n\nSome properties, such as hardness, roundness and dampness, are clearly natural properties. We encounter them in the real world and can perceive them. On the other hand, other properties, such as being good and being right, are not so obvious. A great novel is considered to be a good thing; goodness may be said to be a property of that novel. Paying one's debts and telling the truth are generally held to be right things to do; rightness may be said to be a property of certain human actions.\n\nHowever, these two types of property are quite different. Those natural properties, such as hardness and roundness, can be perceived and encountered in the real world. On the other hand, it is not immediately clear how to physically see, touch or measure the goodness of a novel or the rightness of an action.\n\nMoore did not consider goodness and rightness to be natural properties, i.e., they cannot be defined in terms of any natural properties. How, then, can we know that anything is good and how can we distinguish good from bad? \n\nMoral epistemology, the part of epistemology (and/or ethics) that studies how we know moral facts and how moral beliefs are justified, has proposed an answer. British epistemologists, following Moore, suggested that humans have a special faculty, a faculty of moral intuition, which tells us what is good and bad, right and wrong. \n\nEthical intuitionists assert that, if we see a good person or a right action, and our faculty of moral intuition is sufficiently developed and unimpaired, we simply intuit that the person is good or that the action is right. Moral intuition is supposed to be a mental process different from other, more familiar faculties like sense-perception, and that moral judgments are its outputs. When someone judges something to be good, or some action to be right, then the person is using the faculty of moral intuition. The faculty is attuned to those non-natural properties. Perhaps the best ordinary notion that approximates moral intuition would be the idea of a conscience.\n\nMoore also introduced what is called the open-question argument, a position he later rejected. \n\nSuppose a definition of \"good\" is \"pleasure-causing.\" In other words, if something is good, it causes pleasure; if it causes pleasure, then it is, by definition, good. Moore asserted, however, that we could always ask, \"But are pleasure-causing things good?\" This would always be an open question. There is no foregone conclusion that, indeed, pleasure-causing things are good. \nIn his initial argument, Moore concluded that any similar definition of goodness could be criticized in the same way.\n\n"}
{"id": "3763257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3763257", "title": "Five Ways (Aquinas)", "text": "Five Ways (Aquinas)\n\nThe Quinque viæ (Latin \"Five Ways\") (sometimes called \"five proofs\") are five logical arguments regarding the existence of God summarized by the 13th-century Catholic philosopher and theologian St. Thomas Aquinas in his book \"Summa Theologica\". They are:\n\n\nAquinas expands the first of these – God as the \"unmoved mover\" – in his \"Summa Contra Gentiles\". \n\nAquinas did not think the finite human mind could know what God is directly, therefore God's existence is not self-evident to us.\n\nSo instead the proposition \"God exists\" must be \"demonstrated\" from God's effects, which are more known to us.\n\nBy the end of each argument, Aquinas' concept of God has only minimal content which he fleshes out through the rest of the \"Summa theologiciae\". For example, the general question of whether \"God\" has a body or is composed of matter is answered in question three, immediately following the Five Ways.\n\nHowever, Aquinas did not hold that what could be demonstrated philosophically (i.e. as general revelation) would necessarily provide any of the vital details revealed in Christ and through the Church (i.e. as special revelation), quite the reverse. For example, while he would allow that \"in all creatures there is found the trace of the Trinity\" yet \"a trace shows that someone has passed by but not who it is.\"\n\nAll five ways are generally considered to be cosmological arguments.\n\nAquinas omitted various arguments he believed to be insufficient or unsuited, such as the ontological argument made by St. Anselm of Canterbury.\n\nA summary version of the Five Ways is given in the \"Summa theologiciae\" The \"Summa\" uses the form of scholastic disputation (i.e. a literary form based on a lecturing method: a question is raised, then the most serious objections are summarized, then a correct answer is provided in that context, then the objections are answered), and the Five Ways follow Medieval Theories of Demonstration.\n\nA subsequent, more detailed, treatment of the Five Ways can be found in the \"Summa contra gentiles\". Aquinas further elaborated each of the Five Ways in more detail in passing in multiple books.\nThe first two Ways relate to causation. When Aquinas argues that a causal chain cannot be infinitely long, he does not have in mind a chain where each element is a prior event that causes the next event; in other words, he is not arguing for a first event in a sequence. Rather, his argument is that a chain of \"concurrent\" or \"simultaneous\" effects must be rooted ultimately in a cause capable of generating these effects, and hence for a cause that is first in the hierarchical sense, not the temporal sense. \n\nAquinas follows the distinction found in Aristotle's \"Physics\" 8.5, and developed by Simplicius, Maimonides, and Avicenna that a causal chain may be either accidental (Socrates' father caused Socrates, Socrates' grandfather caused Socrates' father, but Socrates' grandfather only accidentally caused Socrates) or essential (a stick is moving a stone, because a hand is simultaneously moving the stick, and thus transitively the hand is moving the stone.) \nHis thinking here relies on what would later be labelled \"essentially ordered causal series\" by John Duns Scotus. (In Duns Scotus, it is a causal series in which the immediately observable elements are not capable of generating the effect in question, and a cause capable of doing so is inferred at the far end of the chain. \"Ordinatio\" I.2.43) \n\nThis is also why Aquinas rejected that reason can prove the universe must have had a beginning in time; for all he knows and can demonstrate the universe could have been 'created from eternity' by the eternal God. He accepts the biblical \ndoctrine of creation as a truth of faith, not reason.\n\nFor a discussion of a causal chain argument that is based on a created beginning, see Kalam cosmological argument.\n\nIn the world, we can see that at least some things are changing. Whatever is changing is being changed by something else. If that by which it is changing is itself changed, then it too is being changed by something else. But this chain cannot be infinitely long, so there must be something that causes change without itself changing. This everyone understands to be God.\n\nAquinas uses the term \"motion\" in his argument, but by this he understands any kind of \"change\", more specifically a transit from potentiality to actuality. Since a potential does not yet exist, it cannot cause itself to exist and can therefore only be brought into existence by something already existing. \n\nIn the world, we can see that things are caused. But it is not possible for something to be the cause of itself because this would entail that it exists prior to itself, which is a contradiction. If that by which it is caused is \"itself\" caused, then it too must have a cause. But this cannot be an infinitely long chain, so, there must be a cause which is not itself caused by anything further. This everyone understands to be God.\n\nAs in the First Way, the causes Aquinas has in mind are not sequential events, but rather simultaneously existing dependency relationships: Aristotle's efficient cause. For example, plant growth depends on sunlight, which depends on gravity, which depends on mass. Aquinas is not arguing for a cause that is first in a sequence, but rather first in a hierarchy: a principal cause, rather than a derivative cause.\n\nIn the world we see things that are possible to be and possible not to be. In other words, perishable things. But if everything were contingent and thus capable of going out of existence, then, given infinite time, this possibility would be realized and nothing would exist now. But things clearly do exist now. Therefore, there must be something that is imperishable: a necessary being. This everyone understands to be God.\n\nThe argument begins with the observation that things around us come into and go out of existence: animals die, buildings are destroyed, etc. But if \"everything\" were like this, then, at some time nothing would exist. Some interpreters read Aquinas to mean that assuming an infinite past, all possibilities would be realized and everything would go out of existence. Since this is clearly not the case, then there must be at least one thing that does not have the possibility of going out of existence. However, this explanation seems to involve the fallacy of composition (quantifier shift). Moreover, it does not seem to be in keeping with Aquinas' principle that, among natural things, the destruction of one thing is always the generation of another. Alternatively, one could read Aquinas to be arguing as follows: if there is eternal change, so that things are eternally being generated and corrupted, and since an eternal effect requires an eternal cause (just as a necessary conclusion requires necessary premises), then there must exist an eternal agent which can account for the eternity of generation and corruption. To hold the alternative, namely that an infinite series of contingent causes would be able to explain eternal generation and corruption would posit a circular argument: Why is there eternal generation and corruption? Because there is an eternal series of causes which are being generated and corrupted. And why is there an infinite series of causes which are being generated and corrupted? Because there is eternal generation and corruption. Since such an explanation is not acceptable, there must be (at least one) eternal and necessary being.\n\nWe see things in the world that vary in degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, etc. For example, sick animals and healthy animals, and well-drawn circles as well as poorly drawn ones. But judging something as being \"more\" or \"less\" implies some standard against which it is being judged. Therefore, there is something which is goodness itself, and this everyone understands to be God.\n\nThe argument is rooted in Aristotle and Plato but its developed form is found in Anselm's Monologion. Although the argument has Platonic influences, Aquinas was not a Platonist and did not believe in the Theory of Forms. Rather, he is arguing that things that only have partial or flawed existence indicate that they are not their own sources of existence, and so must rely on something else as the source of their existence. The argument makes use of the theory of transcendentals: properties of existence. For example, \"true\" presents an aspect of existence, as any existent thing will be \"true\" insofar as it is true that it exists. Or \"one,\" insofar as any existent thing will be (at least) \"one thing.\"\n\nWe see various non-intelligent objects in the world behaving in regular ways. This cannot be due to chance since then they would not behave with predictable results. So their behavior must be set. But it cannot be set by themselves since they are non-intelligent and have no notion of how to set behavior. Therefore, their behavior must be set by something else, and by implication something that must be intelligent. This everyone understands to be God.\n\nThis is also known as the Teleological Argument. However, it is not a \"Cosmic Watchmaker\" argument from design (see below). Instead, as the 1920 Dominican translation puts it, \"The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world\".\n\nThe Fifth Way uses Aristotle's final cause. Aristotle argued that a complete explanation of an object will involve knowledge of how it came to be (efficient cause), what material it consists of (material cause), how that material is structured (formal cause), and the specific behaviors associated with the type of thing it is (final cause). The concept of final causes involves the concept of dispositions or \"ends\": a specific goal or aim towards which something strives. For example, acorns regularly develop into oak trees but never into sea lions. The oak tree is the \"end\" towards which the acorn \"points,\" its disposition, even if it fails to achieve maturity. The aims and goals of intelligent beings is easily explained by the fact that they consciously set those goals for themselves. The implication is that if something has a goal or end towards which it strives, it is either because it is intelligent or because something intelligent is guiding it.\n\nIt must be emphasized that this argument is distinct from the design argument associated with William Paley and the Intelligent Design movement. The latter implicitly argue that objects in the world \"do not\" have inherent dispositions or ends, but, like Paley's watch, will not naturally have a purpose unless forced to do some outside agency. The latter also focus on complexity and interworking parts as the effect needing explanation, whereas the Fifth Way takes as its starting point \"any\" regularity. (E.g., that an eye has a complicated function therefore a design therefore a designer) but an argument from final cause (e.g., that the pattern that things exist with a purpose itself allows us to recursively arrive at God as the ultimate source of purpose without being constrained by any external purpose).\n\nMany scholars and commenters caution in treating the Five Ways as if they were modern logical proofs. This is not to say that examining them in that light is not academically interesting.\n\nReasons include:\n\nCriticism of the cosmological argument, and hence the first three Ways, emerged in the 18th century by the philosophers David Hume and Immanuel Kant.\n\nKant argued that our minds give structure to the raw materials of reality and that the world is therefore divided into the phenomenal world (the world we experience and know), and the noumenal world (the world as it is \"in itself,\" which we can never know). Since the cosmological arguments reason from what we experience, and hence the phenomenal world, to an inferred cause, and hence the noumenal world, since the noumenal world lies beyond our knowledge we can never know what's there. Kant also argued that the concept of a necessary being is incoherent, and that the cosmological argument presupposes its coherence, and hence the arguments fail.\n\nHume argued that since we can conceive of causes and effects as separate, there is no necessary connection between them and therefore we cannot necessarily reason from an observed effect to an inferred cause. Hume also argued that explaining the causes of individual elements explains everything, and therefore there is no need for a cause of the whole of reality.\n\nThe 20th-century philosopher of religion Richard Swinburne argued in his book, \"Simplicity as Evidence of Truth\", that these arguments are only strong when collected together, and that individually each of them is weak.\n\nThe 20th-century Catholic priest and philosopher Frederick Copleston devoted much of his work to a modern explication and expansion of Aquinas' arguments.\n\nMore recently the prominent Thomistic philosopher Edward Feser has argued in his book \"Aquinas: A Beginner’s Guide\" that Dawkins, Hume, Kant, and most modern philosophers do not have a correct understanding of Aquinas at all; that the arguments are often difficult to translate into modern terms.\n\nBiologist Richard Dawkins book \"The God Delusion\" argues against the Five Ways.\n\nIn \"Why there almost certainly is a God: Doubting Dawkins\", philosopher Keith Ward claims that Richard Dawkins mis-stated the five ways, and thus responds with a straw man. For example, for the fifth Way, Dawkins places it in the same position for his criticism as the Watchmaker analogy- when in fact, according to Ward, they are vastly different arguments. Ward defended the utility of the five ways (for instance, on the fourth argument he states that all possible smells must pre-exist in the mind of God, but that God, being by his nature non-physical, does not himself stink) whilst pointing out that they only constitute a proof of God if one first begins with a proposition that the universe can be rationally understood. Nevertheless, he argues that they are useful in allowing us to understand what God will be like given this initial presupposition.\n\nEastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart says that Dawkins \"devoted several pages of \"The God Delusion\" to a discussion of the 'Five Ways' of Thomas Aquinas but never thought to avail himself of the services of some scholar of ancient and medieval thought who might have explained them to him ... As a result, he not only mistook the Five Ways for Thomas's comprehensive statement on why we should believe in God, which they most definitely are not, but ended up completely misrepresenting the logic of every single one of them, and at the most basic levels.\" Hart said of Dawkins treatment of Aquinas' arguments that:\n\n"}

He was educated at the universities of Kiel, Leipzig, Berlin. He became more and more attracted to the study of Plato and Aristotle, and his 1826 doctoral dissertation (\"Platonis de ideis et numeris doctrina ex Aristotele illustrata\"; \"On Plato's Doctrine of Ideas and Numbers as Illustrated by Aristotle\") was an attempt to reach through Aristotle's criticisms a more accurate knowledge of the Platonic philosophy.\n\nHe declined the offer of a classical chair at Kiel, and accepted a post as tutor to the son of an intimate friend of Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein, the Prussian minister of education. He held this position for seven years (1826–1833), occupying his leisure time with the preparation of a critical edition of Aristotle's \"De anima\" (1833; 2nd ed. by Christian Belger, 1877). In 1833 Altenstein appointed Trendelenburg extraordinary professor in Berlin, and four years later he was advanced to an ordinary professorship.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, he proved himself markedly successful as a teacher, during the greater part of which time he had to examine in philosophy and pedagogics all candidates for the scholastic profession in Prussia. His teaching method was highly regarded by Søren Kierkegaard who called him \"one of the most sober philosophical philologists I know.\" He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1861.\n\nTrendelenburg's philosophizing is conditioned throughout by his loving study of Plato and Aristotle, whom he regards not as opponents but as building jointly on the broad basis of idealism. His own standpoint may be called a modern version of Aristotelianism. While denying the possibility of an absolute method and an absolute philosophy, as contended for by Hegel and others, Trendelenburg was emphatically an idealist in the ancient or Platonic sense; his whole work was devoted to the demonstration of the ideal in the real. But he maintained that the procedure of philosophy must be analytic, rising from the particular facts to the universal in which we find them explained. We divine the system of the whole from the part we know, but the process of reconstruction must remain approximative. Our position forbids the possibility of a final system. Instead, therefore, of constantly beginning afresh in speculation, it should be our duty to attach ourselves to what may be considered the permanent results of historic developments.\n\nThe classical expression of these results Trendelenburg finds mainly in the Platonico-Aristotelian system. The philosophical question is stated thus: How are thought and being united in knowledge? How does thought get at being? And how does being enter into thought? Proceeding on the principle that like can only be known by like, Trendelenburg next reaches a doctrine peculiar to himself (though based upon Aristotle) that plays a central part in his speculations. Motion is the fundamental fact common to being and thought; the \"actual motion\" of the external world has its counterpart in the \"constructive motion\" involved in every instance of perception or thought. From motion he proceeds to deduce time, space and the categories of mechanics and natural science. These, being thus derived, are at once subjective and objective in their scope. It is true that matter can never be completely resolved into motion, but the irreducible remainder may be treated, like Aristotle, as an abstraction we asymptotically approach but never reach.\n\nThe facts of existence, however, are not adequately explained by the mechanical categories. The ultimate interpretation of the universe can only be found in the higher category of End or final cause. Here Trendelenburg finds the dividing line, between philosophical systems. On the one side stand those that acknowledge none but efficient causes, which make force prior to thought, and explain the universe, as it were, \"a tergo\" (\"from the back\"). This may be called, typically, Democritism. On the other side stands the organic or teleological view of the world, which interprets the parts through the idea of the whole, and sees in the efficient causes only the vehicle of ideal ends. This may be called in a wide sense Platonism. Systems like Spinozism, which seem to form a third class, neither sacrificing force to thought nor thought to force, yet by their denial of final causes inevitably fall back into the Democritic or essentially materialistic standpoint, leaving us with the great antagonism of the mechanical and the organic systems of philosophy. The latter view, which receives its first support in the facts of life, or organic nature as such, finds its culmination and ultimate verification in the ethical world, which essentially consists in the realization of ends.\n\nTrendelenburg's \"Naturrecht\" [the right of nature] may, therefore, be taken as in a manner the completion of his system, his working out of the ideal as present in the real. The ethical end is taken to be the idea of humanity, not in the abstract as formulated by Immanuel Kant, but in the context of the state and of history. Law is treated throughout as the vehicle of ethical requirements. In Trendelenburg's treatment of the state, as the ethical organism in which the individual (the potential man) may be said first to emerge into actuality, we may trace his nurture on the best ideas of Hellenic antiquity.\n\nIn 1865 he became involved in an acrimonious controversy on the interpretation of Kant's doctrine of space with Kuno Fischer, whom he attacked in \"Kuno Fischer und sein Kant\" (1869), which drew forth the reply \"Anti-Trendelenburg\" (1870). The controversy became known in the history of philosophy as the Fischer–Trendelenburg debate.\n\nTrendelenburg's position on the debate (the position that \"Kant may establish that space and time are \"a priori\" and intuitive conditions for experience in the \"Transcendental Aesthetic,\" but this in no way entails that space and time have nothing to do with the objects outside of possible experience\") has been variously dubbed as \"Neglected Alternative,\" \"Trendelenburg's gap\" [\"die trendelenburgische Lücke\"], \"Pistorius's gap [\"die pistorische Lücke\"]\" (named after ), or \"third possibility\" [\"die dritte Möglichkeit\"].\n\nHis son, Friedrich Trendelenburg, was a prominent surgeon; several medical techniques and matters are named for him.\n\nTrendelenburg was also the author of the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "219447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219447", "title": "German idealism", "text": "German idealism\n\nGerman idealism (also known as post-Kantian idealism, post-Kantian philosophy, or simply post-Kantianism) was a philosophical movement that emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It began as a reaction to Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason.\" German idealism was closely linked with both Romanticism and the revolutionary politics of the Enlightenment.\n\nThe most notable thinkers in the movement were Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and the proponents of Jena Romanticism (Friedrich Hölderlin, Novalis, and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel). Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Gottlob Ernst Schulze, Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Salomon Maimon and Friedrich Schleiermacher also made major contributions.\n\nThe word \"idealism\" has multiple meanings. The philosophical meaning of idealism is that the properties we discover in objects depend on the way that those objects appear to us, as perceiving subjects. These properties only belong to the perceived appearance of the objects, and not something they possess \"in themselves\". The notion of a \"thing in itself\" should be understood here as an option of a set of functions for an operating mind, such that we consider something that appears without respect to the \"specific manner\" in which it appears. The term \"idea-ism\" is closer to this intended meaning than the common notion of idealism. The question of what properties a thing might have \"independently of the mind\" is thus unknowable and a moot point, within the idealist tradition.\n\nKant's work purported to bridge the two dominant philosophical schools in the 18th century: 1) rationalism, which held that knowledge could be attained by reason alone \"a priori\" (prior to experience), and 2) empiricism, which held that knowledge could be arrived at only through the senses \"a posteriori\" (after experience), as expressed by philosopher David Hume, whom Kant sought to rebut. Kant's solution was to propose that while we can know, via sensory experience, particular facts about the world (which he termed phenomena), we cannot know the \"form\" they must take prior to any experience (which he called noumena). That is, we cannot know \"what\" objects we will encounter, but we can know \"how\" we will encounter them. Kant called his mode of philosophising \"critical philosophy\", in that it was supposedly less concerned with setting out positive doctrine than with critiquing the limits to the theories we \"can\" set out. The conclusion he presented, as above, he called \"transcendental idealism\". This distinguished it from classical idealism and subjective idealism such as George Berkeley's, which held that external objects have actual being or real existence only when they are perceived by an observer. Kant said that there are things-in-themselves, noumena, that is, things that exist other than being merely sensations and ideas in our minds. Kant held in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" that the world of appearances (phenomena) is empirically real and transcendentally ideal. The mind plays a central role in influencing the way that the world is experienced: we perceive phenomena through time, space and the categories of the understanding. It is this notion that was taken to heart by Kant's philosophical successors.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer considered himself to be a transcendental idealist. In his major work \"The World as Will and Representation\" he discusses his indebtedness to Kant, and the work includes Schopenhauer's extensive analysis of the \"Critique\". The Young Hegelians, a number of philosophers who developed Hegel's work in various directions, were in some cases idealists. On the other hand, Karl Marx, who was numbered among them, had professed himself to be a materialist, in opposition to idealism. Another member of the Young Hegelians, Ludwig Feuerbach, advocated for materialism, and his thought was influential in the development of historical materialism, where he is often recognized as a bridge between Hegel and Marx.\n\nKant's transcendental idealism consisted of taking a point of view outside and above oneself (transcendentally) and understanding that the mind directly knows only phenomena or ideas. Whatever exists other than mental phenomena, or ideas that appear to the mind, is a thing-in-itself and cannot be directly and immediately known.\n\nKant had criticized pure reason. He wanted to restrict reasoning, judging, and speaking only to objects of possible experience. The main German Idealists, who had been theology students, reacted against Kant’s stringent limits. \"It was Kant’s criticism of all attempts to prove the existence of God which led to the romantic reaction of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel.\"\n\nIn 1787, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi addressed, in his book \"On Faith, or Idealism and Realism\", Kant's concept of \"thing-in-itself\". Jacobi agreed that the objective thing-in-itself cannot be directly known. However, he stated, it must be taken on belief. A subject must believe that there is a real object in the external world that is related to the representation or mental idea that is directly known. This belief is a result of revelation or immediately known, but logically unproved, truth. The real existence of a thing-in-itself is revealed or disclosed to the observing subject. In this way, the subject directly knows the ideal, subjective representations that appear in the mind, and strongly believes in the real, objective thing-in-itself that exists outside the mind. By presenting the external world as an object of belief, Jacobi legitimized belief. \"…[B]y reducing the external world to a matter of faith, he wanted merely to open a little door for faith in general...\"\n\nKarl Leonhard Reinhold published two volumes of \"Letters Concerning the Kantian Philosophy\" in 1790 and 1792. They provided a clear explication of Kant's thoughts, which were previously inaccessible due to Kant's use of complex or technical language.\n\nReinhold also tried to prove Kant's assertion that humans and other animals can know only images that appear in their minds, never \"things-in-themselves\" (things that are not mere appearances in a mind). In order to establish his proof, Reinhold stated an axiom that could not possibly be doubted. From this axiom, all knowledge of consciousness could be deduced. His axiom was: \"Representation is distinguished in consciousness by the subject from the subject and object, and is referred to both.\"\n\nHe thereby started, not from definitions, but, from a principle that referred to mental images or representations in a conscious mind. In this way, he analyzed knowledge into (1) the knowing subject, or observer, (2) the known object, and (3) the image or representation in the subject's mind. In order to understand transcendental idealism, it is necessary to reflect deeply enough to distinguish experience as consisting of these three components: subject, subject's representation of object, and object.\n\nKant noted that a mental idea or representation must be a representation of something, and deduced that it is of something external to the mind. He gave the name of \"Ding an sich\", or thing-in-itself to that which is represented. However, Gottlob Ernst Schulze wrote, anonymously, that the law of cause and effect only applies to the phenomena within the mind, not between those phenomena and any things-in-themselves outside the mind. That is, a thing-in-itself cannot be the cause of an idea or image of a thing in the mind. In this way, he discredited Kant's philosophy by using Kant's own reasoning to disprove the existence of a thing-in-itself.\n\nAfter Schulze had seriously criticized the notion of a thing-in-itself, Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) produced a philosophy similar to Kant's, but without a thing-in-itself. Fichte asserted that our representations, ideas, or mental images are merely the productions of our ego, or knowing subject. For him, there is no external thing-in-itself that produces the ideas. On the contrary, the knowing subject, or ego, is the cause of the external thing, object, or non-ego.\n\nFichte's style was a challenging exaggeration of Kant's already difficult writing. Also, Fichte claimed that his truths were apparent to intellectual, non-perceptual, intuition. That is, the truth can be immediately seen by the use of reason.\n\nSchopenhauer, a student of Fichte's, wrote of him:\n\nSchelling attempted to rescue theism from Kant’s refutation of the proofs for God’s existence. \"Now the philosophy of Schelling from the first admitted the possibility of a knowledge of God, although it likewise started from the philosophy of Kant, which denies such knowledge.\" \n\nWith regard to the experience of objects, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) claimed that the Fichte's \"I\" needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. So the ideas or mental images in the mind are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind. According to Schelling's \"absolute identity\" or \"indifferentism\", there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real.\n\nIn 1851, Arthur Schopenhauer criticized Schelling's absolute identity of the subjective and the objective, or of the ideal and the real. \"...[E]verything that rare minds like Locke and Kant had separated after an incredible amount of reflection and judgment, was to be again poured into the pap of that absolute identity. For the teaching of those two thinkers [Locke and Kant] may be very appropriately described as the doctrine of the \"absolute diversity of the ideal and the real, or of the subjective and the objective\".\"\n\nFriedrich Schleiermacher was a theologian who asserted that the ideal and the real are united in God. He understood the ideal as the subjective mental activities of thought, intellect, and reason. The real was, for him, the objective area of nature and physical being. Schleiermacher declared that the unity of the ideal and the real is manifested in God. The two divisions do not have a productive or causal effect on each other. Rather, they are both equally existent in the absolute transcendental entity which is God.\n\nSalomon Maimon influenced German idealism by criticizing Kant's dichotomies, claiming that Kant did not explain how opposites such as sensibility and understanding could relate to each other.\nMaimon claimed that the dualism between these faculties was analogous to the old Cartesian dualism between the mind and body, and that all the problems of the older dualism should hold \"mutatis mutandis\" for the new one. Such was the heterogeneity between understanding and sensibility, Maimon further argued, that there could be no criterion to determine how the concepts of the understanding apply to the intuitions of sensibility. By thus pointing out these problematic dualisms, Maimon and the neo-Humean critics left a foothold open for skepticism within the framework of Kant’s own philosophy. For now the question arose how two such heterogeneous realms as the intellectual and the sensible could be known to correspond with one another. The problem was no longer how we know that our representations correspond with things in themselves but how we know that \"a priori\" concepts apply to \"a posteriori\" intuitions.\n\nSchelling and Hegel, however, tried to solve this problem by claiming that opposites are absolutely identical. Maimon's concept of an infinite mind as the basis of all opposites was similar to the German idealistic attempt to rescue theism by positing an Absolute Mind or Spirit.\n\nMaimon’s metaphysical concept of \"infinite mind\" was similar to Fichte’s \"Ich\" and Hegel’s \"Geist.\" Maimon ignored the results of Kant’s criticism and returned to pre-Kantian transcendent speculation. \nWhat characterizes Fichte’s, Schelling’s, and Hegel’s speculative idealism in contrast to Kant's critical idealism is the recurrence of metaphysical ideas from the rationalist tradition. What Kant forbade as a violation of the limits of human knowledge, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel saw as a necessity of the critical philosophy itself. Now Maimon was the crucial figure behind this transformation. By reviving metaphysical ideas from within the problematic of the critical philosophy, he gave them a new legitimacy and opened up the possibility for a critical resurrection of metaphysics.\n\nMaimon is said to have Influenced Hegel’s writing on Spinoza. \"[T]here seems to be a striking similarity between Maimon’s discussion of Spinoza in the \"Lebensgeschichte\" (Maimon's autobiography) and Hegel’s discussion of Spinoza in the \"Lectures in the History of Philosophy\".\"\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) was a German philosopher born in Stuttgart, Württemberg, in present-day southwest Germany. Hegel responded to Kant's philosophy by suggesting that the unsolvable contradictions given by Kant in his Antinomies of Pure Reason applied not only to the four areas Kant gave (world as infinite vs. finite, material as composite vs. atomic, etc.) but in all objects and conceptions, notions and ideas. To know this he suggested makes a \"vital part in a philosophical theory.\" Given that abstract thought is thus limited, he went on to consider how historical formations give rise to different philosophies and ways of thinking. For Hegel, thought fails when it is only given as an abstraction and is not united with considerations of historical reality. In his major work \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" he went on to trace the formation of self-consciousness through history and the importance of other people in the awakening of self-consciousness (see master-slave dialectic). Thus Hegel introduces two important ideas to metaphysics and philosophy: the integral importance of history and of the Other person. His work is theological in that it replaces the traditional concept of God with that of an Absolute Spirit. Spinoza, who changed the anthropomorphic concept of God into that of an abstract, vague, underlying Substance, was praised by Hegel whose concept of Absolute fulfilled a similar function. Hegel claimed that \"You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all\". Reality results from God’s thinking, according to Hegel. Objects that appear to a spectator originate in God’s mind.\n\nNeo-Kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, or more specifically by Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy in his work \"The World as Will and Representation\" (1818), as well as by other post-Kantian philosophers such as Jakob Friedrich Fries and Johann Friedrich Herbart. It has some more specific reference in later German philosophy.\n\nHegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century; by its end, according to Bertrand Russell, \"the leading academic philosophers, both in America and Britain, were largely Hegelian\". His influence has continued in contemporary philosophy but mainly in Continental philosophy.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer contended that Spinoza had a great influence on post-Kantian German idealists. Schopenhauer wrote: \"In consequence of Kant's criticism of all speculative theology, almost all the philosophizers in Germany cast themselves back on to Spinoza, so that the whole series of unsuccessful attempts known by the name of post-Kantian philosophy is simply Spinozism tastelessly got up, veiled in all kinds of unintelligible language, and otherwise twisted and distorted.\"\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer, Kant's original philosophy, with its refutation of all speculative theology, had been transformed by the German Idealists. Through the use of his technical terms, such as \"transcendental,\" \"transcendent,\" \"reason,\" \"intelligibility,\" and \"thing-in-itself\" they attempted to speak of what exists beyond experience and, in this way, to revive the notions of God, free will, and immortality of soul. Kant had effectively relegated these ineffable notions to faith and belief.\n\nIn England, during the nineteenth century, philosopher Thomas Hill Green embraced German Idealism in order to salvage Christian monotheism as a basis for morality. His philosophy attempted to account for an eternal consciousness or mind that was similar to Berkeley's concept of God and Hegel's Absolute. John Rodman, in the introduction to his book on Thomas Hill Green's political theory, wrote: \"Green is best seen as an exponent of German idealism as an answer to the dilemma posed by the discrediting of Christianity….\"\n\n\"German idealism was initially introduced to the broader community of American \"literati\" through a Vermont intellectual, James Marsh. Studying theology with Moses Stuart at Andover Seminary in the early 1820s, Marsh sought a Christian theology that would 'keep alive the heart in the head.' \" Some American theologians and churchmen found value in German Idealism's theological concept of the infinite Absolute Ideal or \"Geist\" [Spirit]. It provided a religious alternative to the traditional Christian concept of the Deity. \"…[P]ost–Kantian idealism can certainly be viewed as a religious school of thought….\" The Absolute Ideal \"Weltgeist\" [World Spirit] was invoked by American ministers as they \"turned to German idealism in the hope of finding comfort against English positivism and empiricism.\" German idealism was a substitute for religion after the Civil War when \"Americans were drawn to German idealism because of a 'loss of faith in traditional cosmic explanations.' \" \"By the early 1870s, the infiltration of German idealism was so pronounced that Walt Whitman declared in his personal notes that 'Only Hegel is fit for America — is large enough and free enough.' \"\n\nAccording to José Ortega y Gasset, with Post-Kantian German Idealism, \"…never before has a lack of truthfulness played such a large and important role in philosophy.\" \"They did whatever they felt like doing with concepts. As if by magic they changed anything into any other thing.\" According to Ortega y Gasset, \"…the basic force behind their work was not strictly and exclusively the desire for truth….\" Ortega y Gasset quoted Schopenhauer's \"Parerga and Paralipomena\", Volume II, in which Schopenhauer wrote that Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel forgot \"the fact that one can feel an authentic and bitter seriousness\" for philosophy. Schopenhauer, in Ortega y Gasset's quote, hoped that philosophers like those three men could learn \"true and fruitful seriousness, such that the problem of existence would capture the thinker and bestir his innermost being.\"\n\nGeorge Santayana had strongly-held opinions regarding this attempt to overcome the effects of Kant's transcendental idealism.\n\nIn the first sentence of his \"The Refutation of Idealism\", G. E. Moore wrote: \"Modern Idealism, if it asserts any general conclusion about the universe at all, asserts that it is spiritual,\" by which he means \"that the whole universe possesses all the qualities the possession of which is held to make us so superior to things which seem to be inanimate.\" He does not directly confront this conclusion, and instead focuses on what he considers the distinctively Idealist premise that \"esse is percipere\" or that to be is to be perceived. He analyzes this idea and considers it to conflate ideas or be contradictory.\n\nSlavoj Žižek sees German Idealism as the pinnacle of modern philosophy, and as a tradition that contemporary philosophy must recapture: \"[T]here is a unique philosophical moment in which philosophy appears 'as such' and which serves as a key—as the only key—to reading the entire preceding and following tradition as philosophy... This moment is the moment of German Idealism...\"\n\nHannah Arendt stated that Immanuel Kant distinguished between \"Vernunft\" (\"reason\") and \"Verstand\" (\"intellect\"): these two categories are equivalents of \"the urgent need of\" reason, and the \"mere quest and desire for knowledge\". Differentiating between reason and intellect, or the need to reason and the quest for knowledge, as Kant has done, according to Arendt \"coincides with a distinction between two altogether different mental activities, thinking and knowing, and two altogether different concerns, meaning, in the first category, and cognition, in the second\". These ideas were also developed by Kantian philosopher, Wilhelm Windelband, in his discussion of the approaches to knowledge named \"nomothetic\" and \"idiographic\".\n\nKant's insight to start differentiating between approaches to knowledge that attempt to understand meaning (derived from reason), on the one hand, and to derive laws (on which knowledge is based), on the other, started to make room for \"speculative thought\" (which in this case, is not seen as a negative aspect, but rather an indication that knowledge and the effort to derive laws to explain objective phenomena has been separated from \"thinking\"). This new-found room for \"speculative thought\" (reason, or thinking) touched-off the rise of German idealism. However, the new-found \"speculative thought\", reason or thinking of German idealism \"again became a field for a new brand of specialists committed to the notion that philosophy's 'subject proper' is 'the actual knowledge of what truly is'. Liberated by Kant from the old school of dogmatism and its sterile exercises, they erected not only new systems but a new 'science' - the original title of the greatest of their works, Hegel's \"Phenomenology of the mind\", was \"Science of the experience of consciousness\" - eagerly blurring Kant's distinction between reason's concern with the unknowable and the intellect's concern with cognition. Pursuing the Cartesian ideal of certainty as though Kant had never existed, they believed in all earnest that the results of their speculations possessed the same kind of validity as the results of cognitive processes\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Joachim\n\nHarold Henry Joachim (; 28 May 1868 – 30 July 1938) was a British idealist philosopher. A disciple of Francis Herbert Bradley, whose posthumous papers he edited, Joachim is now identified with the later days of the British idealist movement. He is generally credited with the definitive formulation of the coherence theory of truth, in his book \"The Nature of Truth\" (1906). He was also a scholar of Aristotle and Spinoza.\n\nHarold Henry Joachim was born in London, the son of a wool merchant who had come to England as a boy from Hungary. He was educated at Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was a pupil of R. L. Nettleship. He was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Merton College in 1890, and in 1892 became a philosophy lecturer at the University of St Andrews. Returning to Oxford in 1894, he was lecturer at Balliol until becoming a Fellow and Tutor at Merton in 1897. In 1907 he married his first cousin, a daughter of the violinist Joseph Joachim. He became Wykeham Professor of Logic of the University of Oxford from 1919, succeeding the realist John Cook Wilson, and occupied the chair until his death. Whilst at Oxford he taught the American poet T.S. Eliot. Joachim was a nephew of the great 19th Century violinist Joseph Joachim, and was himself a talented amateur violinist.\n\nThe coherence theory is nowadays viewed as part of a class of theories called \"robust\" or \"inflationary\" accounts of truth. In this class, it is a rival to the correspondence and the pragmatist theories. Both Bertrand Russell, arguing for the former, and William James, arguing for the latter, cited Joachim's text as a paradigm of what they thought was wrong about the coherence theory.\n\n\nHe was probably involved, if uncredited, in the editing of Bradley's collected works, including the \"Collected Essays\" with Bradley's sister Marian de Glehn, and \"Ethical Studies\".\n\n"}

It is opposed to the assertion that consciousness results exclusively from properties of specific types of matter, e.g. brain tissue.\n\nThe term is relatively uncommon even in philosophical discussion, and is often erroneously equated with panpsychism despite notable differences between the two views that are evident in the etymologies of the two words: \"panpsychism\" derives from the Greek \"pan\", \"all\", and \"psyche\", \"soul\" or \"mind\" (the terms \"consciousness\" and \"experience\" being preferred in philosophy), and implies the sentience of all things; hylopathism derives from \"hylo-\", which is translated either as \"matter\" or \"wood\" depending on its context, and whose English equivalent is hyle, and \"pathos\", \"emotion\" or \"suffering\" (and, by extension, experience). Hylopathism is thus not necessarily a belief in the universality of sentience, but rather in the derivation of sentience from matter.\n\n"}

Prinz is a Distinguished Professor of philosophy and Director of the Committee for Interdisciplinary Science Studies at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. \n\nPrinz works primarily in the philosophy of psychology and ethics and has authored several books and over 100 articles, addressing such topics as emotion, moral psychology, aesthetics and consciousness. Much of his work in these areas has been a defense of empiricism against psychological nativism, and he situates his work as in the naturalistic tradition of philosophy associated with David Hume. Prinz is also an advocate of experimental philosophy.\n\nPrinz took his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago under the direction of Murat Aydede, a philosopher of cognitive science now at the University of British Columbia. He taught previously at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at Washington University, St. Louis, with visiting positions at University College London, California Institute of Technology, and University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nJesse Prinz has offered a \"natural kinds\" theory of emotions. According to him, an emotional experience is a bodily change that indicates situations in our environment that should concern us. When we encounter a stimulus that affects our well-being we experience a set of bodily changes that represent things like dangers, losses, and offenses. These bodily changes are appropriate to the situation and are learned over time through association to specific instances we have encountered in the past. They are felt, but oftentimes these feelings are not in the foreground of phenomenal consciousness. When we do pay attention to the feeling it then becomes an actual emotion.\n\nThe set of possible feelings are limited by our biology and correspond roughly to our traditional emotional categories. The traditional emotions (anger, fear, etc.) have functional roles and are always related to objects and situations in the environment. They are always directed toward something (i.e. intentional), and these emotions have a particular bodily configuration that defines them. According to Prinz, there are six basic emotions, which are characterized by unique body patterns. The ‘big six’ emotions are actually subdivided into a biologically basic primitive stock of feelings that each culture classifies in different ways. For example, fear could be subdivided into worry (future dangers) and panic (present dangers), both of which spring the experiencing organism into action as an appropriate response to environmental stimulus. Likewise, happiness subdivides into sensory pleasure, satisfaction, and joy which each have specific bodily responses. Complex emotions such as despair, romantic love, and jealousy are recent (on an evolutionary timescale) additions to the breadth of possible affects that are also associations between our primitive stock of feelings and particular kinds of situations. Other homeostatic emotions such as hunger and fatigue are different in that they are states of the organism rather than relationships between it and its environment.\n\nAccording to this theory, when we encounter certain stimuli we experience a learned bodily change in response. These bodily-change stimuli, or elicitors, belong to what Prinz calls a mental file that is connected to one of our primitive stock of emotions through learning. These “elicitation files” can then trigger the relevant response previously associated with it. Throughout our lives new files can be created and new triggering conditions can be added to existing files. Similar files can become so closely related that triggers for one can also cause the other. However, these elicitation files should not be confused with the emotions themselves, but rather they are culturally calibrated triggers for our emotions. According to Prinz, affects are exhausted by the somatic feelings that are experienced. Emotions are only the feelings and not the causes or effects of those feelings. Each feeling is associated with a range of conditions and represents a response to the current situation being experienced.\n\nPrinz also defends sentimentalism in ethics, and ethical relativism.\n\n\n\n"}

As the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor, Moreno is one of fourteen Penn Integrates Knowledge professors. He is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress and served on the Obama-Biden Transition Project in 2008 as the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services Agency Review for Bioethics.\n\nMoreno is a senior advisor for the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, and served on the senior staff of the Clinton Administration’s National Bioethics Advisory Commission and the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments. He is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and is the U.S. member of the UNESCO International Bioethics Committee.\n\nJonathan D. Moreno was born and grew up in New York’s Hudson Valley. His father, Jacob Levy Moreno, was a psychiatrist and the pioneer of psychodrama and sociometry, the precursor of social network theory. His father and mother, psychotherapist Zerka T. Moreno, worked closely together. Both of his parents emigrated to the United States from Europe before World War II. Moreno and his older sister, Regina Moreno, spent much of their childhood in Beacon, New York on the grounds of their parents’ sanitarium and psychodrama training center.\n\nMoreno attended Hofstra University where he earned a B.A. in philosophy and psychology with highest honors in 1973. From 1973 to 1975 he was a graduate student in the philosophy doctoral program in the CUNY Graduate Center and completed his Ph.D. in philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis in 1977. Moreno’s doctoral dissertation traced the development of a distinctly American semiotic tradition from Charles Sanders Peirce to Nelson Goodman. His dissertation director was Richard S. Rudner, the longtime editor of the \"Journal of the Philosophy of Science\".\n\nFollowing graduation, Moreno held full-time academic appointments in philosophy at Swarthmore College, the University of Texas at Austin, and George Washington University. During 1984-85 he was an associate at the Hastings Center, the first bioethics think tank. From 1985-1987 he was philosopher-in-residence at the Children’s National Medical Center in Washington, DC.\n\nHe was the director of the Program in Medical Humanities and a Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at the SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn from 1989 until 1998, when he joined University of Virginia faculty as the Emily Davie and Joseph S. Kornfeld Professor of Biomedical Ethics and director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics.\n\nIn 2007, Moreno joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania as part of President Amy Gutmann’s Penn Integrates Knowledge (PIK) Initiative, where he is the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor and a Professor of Medical Ethics and Health Policy and of the History and Sociology of Science. He also holds a courtesy appointment in Penn’s Department of Philosophy, is a member of the Center for Neuroscience and Society, and is the interim chair of the program in Science, Technology, and Society.\n\nAs an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, Moreno has served on and chaired a number of committees on bioethics, embryonic stem cell research, national defense research, and neuroscience.

He is also a member of several editorial boards.\n\nIn Moreno's latest work, \"Impromptu Man\" he explores the impact of his father, J.L Moreno's work in psychodrama, group therapy, and humanistic psychology on psychiatric treatment, societal organization, and, most remarkably, on social networks. This work is not only a biography of a largely unsung psychiatrist, but also an expansive overview of his influence on improvisational theater, group therapy, social reform, and networks within military, industry, schools and jails. J.L. Moreno discovered the underlying theory of Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, social network, in 1932 when he drew his first sociogram, which mapped interactions between individuals and showed that, despite degrees of separation, individuals influenced others in their network.\n\nDaniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist, author of \"Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ\", and two time Pulitzer Prize nominee, stated, \"\"Impromptu Man\" captures the remarkable impact of a singular genius, J.L. Moreno, whose creations—the best-known being psychodrama—have shaped our culture in myriad ways, many unrecognized. The record will be set straight for all time by this can’t-put-down biography, a tribute by Jonathan D. Moreno to his father’s masterly legacy.”\n\nIn \"The Body Politic\", Moreno elucidates the cultural, political and societal underpinnings of biotechnology by tracing its history from early America to the present culture wars of the “new biology.” The book considers the intersection of society and biotechnology in areas such as embryonic stem cell research, reproductive cloning, and synthetic biology, and demonstrates how biology and society have shaped each other into modern-day biopolitics. Kirkus Reviews named \"The Body Politic\" as a \"Best Book of 2011.\"\n\n\"Progress in Bioethics\" is a compilation of essays that explore the politicization of modern-day bioethics. Experts consider the fundamental values of progressivism and conservatism in bioethics, and situate bioethical issues within the nuances of politics and culture in the United States.\n\nThe first book of its kind, \"Mind Wars\" covers the ethical dilemmas and bizarre history of cutting-edge technology and neuroscience developed for military applications. As the author discusses the innovative Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the role of the intelligence community and countless university science departments in preparing the military and intelligence services for the twenty-first century, he also charts the future of national security.\n\nFully updated and revised, this edition features new material on deep brain stimulation, neuro hormones, and enhanced interrogation. With in-depth discussions of Psychological Warfare “psyops” mind control experiments, drugs that erase both fear and the need to sleep, microchip brain implants and advanced prosthetics, supersoldiers and robot armies, Mind Wars may read like science fiction or the latest conspiracy thriller, but its subjects are very real and changing the course of modern warfare.\n\n\"In the Wake of Terror\" presents essays on the complex moral questions that accompany societal concerns about terrorism and biological warfare. The essays, written by experts from the fields of medicine, health care policy, law, political science, history, philosophy, and theology, consider issues of civil liberties, medical experiments, and preparedness for future terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Undue Risk\" is the first comprehensive study of the history and ethics of human experiments for national security purposes, from World War II to the First Gulf War and its aftermath. Topics covered include the Nazi doctors' trial, the Japanese medical experiments, the human radiation experiments, and biological warfare and chemical weapons testing.\n\nIn \"Deciding Together\", Moreno discusses the process of moral consensus and its place in societal value systems from social, philosophical, and historical perspectives. In this work, he also constructs his concept of bioethical naturalism, a naturalistic meta-philosophy that explains moral consensus through psychology and the consensus process .\n\n\n\n"}

Marie Belloc Lowndes, in the second volume of her autobiography \"Where Love and Friendship Dwelt\" (1943), made claims regarding his paternity. He was reportedly ashamed of and did not talk about it. Lowndes did not say who his mother was.\n\nIn his early years he worked for the Ministry of Finance (1825–1828), and was an active journalist. From 1826 to 1830 he opposed the policies of Charles X of France in \"Le Globe\". At the revolution of 1830 he signed the protestation of the journalists on 28 July 1830.\n\nAfter 1830, he contributed to different newspapers, \"Le Constitutionnel\", \"Le National\" and \"Le Courrier français\" until 1833, when he gave up politics in order to devote himself to the history of ancient philosophy, undertaking a translation of Aristotle, which occupied him the greater part of his life. The reputation he gained from this work won him the chair of ancient philosophy at the Collège de France (1838) and a seat at the Academy of Moral and Political Science (1839).\n\nAfter the revolution of 1848 he was elected as a republican deputy from the \"département\" of Seine-et-Oise. He was named by the Minister of Public Instruction, Carnot, head of the commission preparing the draft for the education reforms. However, after Carnot's resignation and replacement by Alfred de Falloux, the commission was dissolved. Nevertheless, Barthélémy-Saint-Hilaire deposed to the National Assembly the report and the propositions written by the Commission, which were ignored. After the May 1849 legislative election, won by the conservative Parti de l'Ordre, he was however re-elected and named again as a member of the parliamentary commission on education. During three years, he thus played an important role during the debates leading to the adoption of the Falloux Laws in 1850-1851, which greatly increased the clergy's influence on education, to the dismay of Republicans such as Saint-Hilaire.\n\nHe was obliged to withdraw after the December 1851 \"coup d'état\" of Louis Napoleon. In 1855 he went as member of the international commission to Egypt to report on the possibility of the proposed Suez canal, and by the articles which he wrote he contributed largely to making the project popular in France.\n\nElected deputy again in 1869, he joined the opposition to the Second Empire, and in 1871, as a member of the \"Centre gauche\" parliamentary group, bent all his efforts to the election of Thiers as President of the Republic, acting afterwards as his secretary. Appointed senator for life in 1875, he took his place among the moderate republicans (aka Opportunist Republicans), and from 23 September 1880 to 14 November 1881 was minister of foreign affairs in the cabinet of Jules Ferry. The most important event of his administration was the annexation of Tunis under the form of a French protectorate, which he actively promoted.\n\nIn 1882 the village of St. Hilaire, Minnesota, in the United States, was named in his honor.\n\nHe died in Paris in 1895. His principal works, besides the translation of Aristotle and a number of studies connected with the same subject, are \"Des Védas\" (1854), \"Du Bouddhisme\" (1856) and \"Mahomet et le Coran\" (1865).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The sayings of the companions of Muhammad contained little philosophical discussion. In the eighth century, extensive contact with philosophical cultures of the West led to a drive to translate philosophical works of these cultures (especially the texts of Aristotle) into Arabic.\n\nThe ninth-century Neo-Platonist Al-Kindi is considered the founder of Arab philosophy. The tenth century philosopher al-Farabi contributed significantly to the introduction of Greek and Roman philosophical works into Muslim philosophical discourse and established many of the themes that would occupy Islamic philosophy for the next centuries; in his broad-ranging work, his work on logic stands out particularly. In the eleventh century, Avicenna, one of the greatest creative philosophers ever, developed his school of philosophy with strong Aristotelian and Neoplatonist roots. In the twelfth century, the philosophy of illumination was systematized by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi. Towards the end of the century philosophy underwent a decline in much of the Muslim world, in part due to al-Ghazali's argument that philosophy was incompatible with religion. In Andalusia, Averroes, defended philosophy against this charge; his extensive works include noteworthy commentaries on Aristotle. Although philosophy in its traditional Aristotelian form fell out of favor in much of the Arab world, forms of mystical philosophy following on from writers such as Ibn Arabi and Ibn Sabin, persisted.\n\nAfter Averroes, a vivid philosophical activity persisted in the eastern Muslim world – especially Persia through works of Shiite philosophers such as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Mir Damad, and Mulla Sadra. Tabatabai suggests that the \"element that was instrumental in the appearance of philosophical and metaphysical thought in Shi’ism and through Shi’ism in other Islamic circles was the treasury of knowledge left behind by the Imams.\" Ali's Nahj al-Balagha is also considered as a primary source of the doctrines professed by Shiite thinkers such as Mir Damad, Mulla Sadra, their pupils and their pupils' pupils: Ahmad al-Alawi, Mohsen Fayz Kashani, Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji, Qazi Sa’id Qumi, etc.\n\n\n"}

During the time of his PhD study he also painted, wrote poems, played piano, and worked on engineering ethics at the University of Bath (UK) and at the Belgian nuclear research centre SCK-CEN.\n\nIn 2003 he started teaching at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands and in 2007 he was Assistant Professor at the Philosophy Department of the University of Twente, also in the Netherlands. In the same year he received the Prize of the Dutch Society for Bioethics (with J. Mesman). In Twente he started working on the ethics of robotics. In 2013 he became Managing Director of the 3TU Centre for Ethics and Technology. During his time in Twente he published many articles on philosophy of technology (especially robotics) and he was regularly interviewed about the ethics of drone technology. In 2014 he was appointed full professor, before the age of 40, at the Centre of Computing and Social Responsibility, De Montfort University in Leicester, UK. In 2014 he was nominated for the World Technology Awards in the Ethics category. In December 2015 he joined the Department of Philosophy of the University of Vienna as full Professor of Philosophy of Media and Technology.\nCoeckelbergh is the President of the Society for Philosophy and Technology, a member of the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence for the European Commission, and a member of the newly established Austrian robotics council (Rat für Robotik), inaugurated by the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology. He is also a member of the editorial advisory boards of Techne, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, Journal of Posthuman Studies and Kairos. Journal of Philosophy & Science. Moreover, he is a fellow of the World Technology Network (WTN) and finalist of the World Technology Award 2017. Recently, Coeckelbergh joined the Technical Expertise Committee at the Foundation of Responsible Robotics, along with Charles Ess and Kevin Kelly.\n\nFollowing his articles on robot ethics and his book Growing Moral Relations, Coeckelbergh has been attributed a 'relational turn' in thinking about moral status. In his articles Coeckelbergh argues for a phenomenological and relational approach to the philosophy of robotics. His theory on 'Social Relationalism' in regards to Artificial Intelligence and Morality is discussed by Gunkel and Cripe in their paper entitled 'Apocalypse Not, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Machine'. He has published mainly on robot ethics and ICT in health care, but also on many other topics. He also wrote a book on vulnerability and technology (Human Being @ Risk) in which he proposes an 'anthropology of vulnerability' and engages with discussions about human enhancement and transhumanism. His first books are about freedom, autonomy, and the role of imagination in moral reasoning. Later books discuss the problem of disengagement and distancing in the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and society's relation to the environment: in Environmental Skill he argues against modern and romantic ways of relating to the environment and in Money Machines he discusses new financial ICTs. In New Romantic Cyborgs he investigates the relation between technology and romanticism and reflects on what he calls \"the end of the machine\". He also wrote opinion articles in The Guardian and in Wired.\n\n\nWork by Coeckelbergh has been responded to by many academics, such as Wendell Wallach of Yale University, USA who regarding the book 'Money Machines' comments: “Mark Coeckelbergh is recognized internationally for illuminating the manner in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) create new forms of “distancing” and in particular “moral distancing”. This important book extends that analysis to underscore the hidden ways ICTs shape money and global finance, alter relationships, and undermine responsibility”. Also, Keir James Cecil Martin writes about Money Machines: \"Coeckelbergh’s view of money as a technology of relationality that shortens some geographical and temporal distances, whilst simultaneously widening moral and social gaps (…) has much to offer to anthropological debates on the nature of finance and money.\"\n\nMarks publications that have been peer-reviewed and received reviews include: Money Machines 'Environmental Skill', 'Human Being @Risk' and 'Growing Moral Relations' as well as articles and other peer-reviewed research publications. For example, David Gunkel has written in his review in Ethics and Information Technology that Growing Moral Relations is 'a real game changer' and 'a penetrating analysis of moral status'. Jac Swart has called the book 'an important contribution to animal ethics' and Frank Jankunis says in his review that it is 'an impressive contribution to the literature on moral status'.\n\nYoni Van Den Eede has called Human Being @ Risk 'one of the most comprehensive and fine-grained in the current literature' and Pieter Lemmens has written that the book <nowiki>\"is thoroughly unique and original in showing the importance and extreme usefulness of philosophical anthropology and the phenomenological tradition for thinking through the consequences of the epochal technological mutations of our time'</nowiki>. Bert-Jaap Koops calls Human Being @ Risk 'an important and original book' and on the website of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies Nikki Olson writes: 'Coeckelbergh develops an impressive case that all our technological and social measures create new sources of vulnerability … Coeckelbergh drives home an important point for our debates about the human future. … \"Human Being @ Risk\" identifies important choices that we must debate as we imagine and (to a limited extent) plan the future of humanity. It raises issues that are fundamental to ongoing thinking about how to better the human condition.'\n\nCarl Mitcham writes about Environmental Skill that it is 'an insightful argument for an environmental philosophy that draws on the resources of and at the same time extends work in philosophy of technology. The notion of skilled engagement with the world as this has emerged from pragmatism and phenomenology is here deepened and re-thought in an effort to understand and respond to the challenges of living in a techno-transformed nature.' Jochem Zwier and Andrea Gammon say in their critical but sympathetic review: 'One of the strong points of Coeckelbergh’s diagnosis is that it deepens the discussions regarding environmental concerns and the problem of motivation by laying bare the modern roots of these phenomena.' Tara Kennedy has published a review of the book in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. She writes: 'There is much for contemporary environmentalists to find compelling about Coeckelbergh's account, being not only an interesting analysis of the factors at work in motivation but also a convincing and optimistic approach to the problem.' She questions Coeckelbergh's interpretation of Heidegger but also praises 'Coeckelbergh's effectiveness in articulating a compelling account of the problem of motivation and how the development of an ethics of skilled engagement with the environment, a focus on habit and virtue, would find us better equipped to deal with the environmental crises we face. It is a welcome and interesting addition to a field in need of voices focused on bringing about meaningful, practical change.' And Louke van Wensveen writes in her review in the journal Environmental Ethics that the book reminds us of 'an overly autistic, obsessively controlling tendency in Western philosophical and everyday cultures. Such a distancing pattern and its ideological scaffolding prevent environmental action.'\n\nCoeckelbergh's recent book New Romantic Cyborgs has been described as offering 'a whole new way of looking at our use of technologies' and he has been called 'one of the most versatile, profound, and original thinkers in the contemporary philosophy of technology.' David Seng, University of Arizona, writes: 'One of the strengths of this book is that it is provides a critical process of inquiry and helpful analysis of inherited philosophical orientations regarding the relationship between technology and society.' A review by Roland Legrand for De Tijd especially compliments Mark Coeckelbergh's analysis of virtual worlds, among other aspects of the book.\n\nCoeckelbergh has appeared regularly in Dutch (and British) media talking about the ethics of drone technology. He has talked about the ethical development of drones in relation to surveillance in an article for Kennislink entitled 'The Irrepressible Drone' and about the ethics of drone fighting for Universonline. He has been interviewed on live radio for BBC radio Leicester where on 15 April 2015 he talked about drone technology and discussed robots that cook food. On 11 June 2013 he appeared on Dutch national television for the Een Vandaag programme also talking about drones and has appeared in articles for the Dutch newspaper Trouw on the subject of environmental philosophy and 'Down To Earth' magazine (Netherlands) discussing drones for environmental purposes. In 2015 he was also interviewed about drones in Stedelijk Interieur, a Dutch magazine on public space.\n\nIn August and September 2015 Coeckelbergh's book \"Money Machines\" received media attention: he was interviewed on BBC Radio Leicester, in the Leicester Mercury where he warns for a growing reliance on computer algorithms in global finance, and in the Belgian national newspaper De Standaard, which printed a large article on the book in its weekend edition of 12 September 2015. In the De Standaard interview (in Dutch), Coeckelbergh warns that we might delegate too much to technology, and that we lack control and overview. The ethical and societal influence of new technologies may be invisible but is and remains powerful. But, he argues, if technology is part of the problem, it is also part of the solution: we need to develop new, alternative technologies and technological practices, also in the financial world.\n\nCoeckelbergh has also been quoted in international mainstream media such as CNN and has a profile at the Guardian due to many comments from readers responding to his article regarding his thoughts about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. On 6 November 2012 Coeckelbergh was Interviewed by Stephen Edwards for a report appearing in the Economist newspaper Intelligence Unit (EIU) exploring the interaction between humans and technology.\n\nIn 2014 Coeckelbergh received much response on social media by other philosophers such as Evan Selinger for his Wired magazine article with posts appearing on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nCoeckelbergh's paper entitled 'Humans, Animals, and Robots: A Phenomenological Approach to Human-Robot Relations' was referenced in an online article for Dailydot.com entitled 'sex and love in the robot age' where human-robot relations were discussed. He also wrote an opinion article with Katleen Gabriels in the Dutch newspaper nrc.next which questions a call for banning sex robots and asks attention for (more) pressing societal issues, and was interviewed about his critical comments on the campaign in the Leicester Mercury.\n\nIn May 2017 he has been included in the top of tech pioneers named by the Belgian newspaper De Tijd, in the category leaders and thinkers.\n\nCoeckelbergh has given several public talks, including talks concerned with public policy that include an ethics meeting held on 18 May 2011 for UNESCO where he was a panelist and gave a presentation entitled \"Freedom, Security, Privacy Or How to Live with new Information and communication Technologies\", and on 15 December 2011 as a panelist for a public talk on the subject of eHealth and Equity in the global health communities for ePractive TV.\n\nFrom his more than 100 academic publications Coeckelbergh has been cited hundreds of times, for example his publications in Ethical Theory & Moral Practice, Science, Technology and Human Values, Ethics and Information Technology, International Journal of Social Robotics, and AI & Society. Growing Moral Relations is his most cited book.\n\n"}
{"id": "40618504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40618504", "title": "Memory erasure", "text": "Memory erasure\n\nMemory erasure is the selective artificial removal of memories or associations from the mind.\n\nThere are many reasons that research is being done on the selective removal of memories. Potential patients for this research include patients suffering from psychiatric disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder, or substance use disorder, among others.\n\nMemory erasure has been shown to be possible in some experimental conditions; some of the techniques currently being investigated are: drug-induced amnesia, selective memory suppression, destruction of neurons, interruption of memory, reconsolidation, and the disruption of specific molecular mechanisms.\n\nResearch focused on gaining a better understanding of what memories are has been going on for many years, in this way so has research in memory erasure. The basis for the recent history for memory erasure has been focused on determining how the brain actively keeps memories stored and retrieves them. There have been several instances where researchers found drugs that when applied to certain areas of the brain, usually the amygdala, have relative success in being able to erase some memories. As early as 2009 researchers were able to trace and destroy neurons involved in supporting the specific type of memory that they were trying to erase. This caused the erasure of the target memory.\n\nAside from the biotechnology approach to studying memory, research in psychiatry on how memories work has also been going on for several years. There has been some studies that show that some behavioral therapy can erase bad memories. Although there has been some evidence that psychodynamic therapy and other energy techniques can help with forgetting memories among other psychiatric issues there is no proven therapeutic approach for trying to erase bad memories.\n\nThere are several different types of possible patients that have the potential to draw great benefit from the selective memory erasure; these include people suffering from drug addiction, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD patients may include war veterans, people who witnessed horrific events, victims of violent crimes and many other possibly traumatic events. These potential patients have unwanted memories that can be absolutely devastating to their daily lives and cause them to not be able to function properly.\n\nAlong with patients suffering from these severe circumstances the idea of selective memory erasure is a very attractive idea for many. Thus making the practical use of this technology something that could be used by many people.\n\nThere are three main types of memories: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory in short is the ability to hold sensory information for a short period of time, for example looking at an object and being able to remember what it looked like moments after. Short-term memory is memory that allows a person to recall a short period of time; this can be a few seconds to a minute. Short-term memory allows people to remember what happened during that short time span without actually practicing the memory. Long-term memory has a much larger capacity than the prior two and actually stores information from both these types of memories to create a long lasting and large memory. Long-term memory is the largest target for research involving selective memory erasure.\n\nWithin long-term memory there are also different types of long-term memories. Implicit memory is one type of long-term memory that is generally described as the ability to remember how to use objects or specific movements of the body (e.g. using a hammer). Another type of long-term memory, explicit memory, refers to memories that can be consciously drawn upon by a person to remember. Explicit memory can be split into further subcategories, one being episodic memory, which is the memory of specific events and the information surrounding it, as well as semantic memory, which is the ability to remember factual information (e.g. what numbers mean).\n\nA type of memory of main concern for memory erasure are emotional memories. These memories often involve several different aspects of information in them that can come from a variety of the different categories of memories mentioned above. These emotional memories are very powerful memories and can have very strong physiological effects on a person. An example of an emotional memory can be found in patients suffering from PTSD, for these patients a traumatic event has left a lasting emotional memory that can have powerful effects on a person even without them consciously retrieving the memory.\n\nDrug-induced amnesia is the idea of selectively losing or inhibiting the creation of memories using drugs. Amnesia can be used as a treatment for patients who have experienced psychological trauma or for medical procedures where full anesthesia is not an option. Drug-induced amnesia is also a side-effect of other drugs like alcohol and rohypnol.\n\nThere are other drugs that also can cause their users to be put in an amnesic state, where they experience some type of amnesia because of their use. Examples of these drugs include Triazolam, Midazolam and Diazepam.\n\nThere is a growing amount of information that has shown that memory depends largely on the brain's synaptic plasticity, with a large part of this being dependent on its ability to maintain long-term potentiation (LTP). Studies on LTP have also started to indicate that there are several molecular mechanisms that may be at the basis of memory storage. \nThus a more recent approach to erasing memories and the associations the brain makes with objects is disrupting specific molecular mechanisms in the brain that are actively keeping memories active.\n\nRecovering methamphetamine (METH) addicts have reported that the sight of certain objects such as a lighter, gum or drug paraphernalia can cause massive cravings that can sometimes lead to a break in their mental strength and cause them to relapse. This indicates that long-term memories can be called upon by various different associations that were made with the memory without the conscious effort of the person. With an increasing belief that memories are largely supported by functional and structural plasticity deriving from F-actin polymerization in postsynaptic dendritic spines at excitatory synapses. Recent research has been done to target this F-actin polymerization by using direct actin depolymerization or a myosin II inhibitor to disrupt the polymerized F-actin associated with METH memory associations. The study indicated types of associations can be disrupted days to weeks after consolidation. Although the depolymerization techniques had no effect on food reward based associations or shock based associations the results demonstrate the idea that meth associated memories' actin cytoskeleton is constantly changing making it uniquely sensitive to depolymerization during the maintenance phase. This is some of the first evidence showing that memories made with different associations are actively maintained using different molecular substrates. These results also show that the actin cytoskeleton may be a promising target for selective disruption of unwanted long-term memories.\n\nSelective memory suppression is the idea that someone can consciously block an unwanted memory. There are many different therapeutic techniques or training that has been done to test this idea with some success. Many of these techniques focus on blocking the retrieval of a memory using different suppression techniques to slowly teach the brain to suppress the memory. Although some of these techniques have been useful for some people it has not been shown to be a clear cut solution to forgetting memories. Because these memories are not truly erased but merely suppressed the question of how permanent the solution is and what actually happens to the memories can be troubling for some.\n\nSelective memory suppression is also something that can occur without a person being consciously aware of suppressing the creation and retrieval of unwanted memories. When this occurs without the person knowing it is usually referred to as memory inhibition; the memory itself is called a repressed memory.\n\nOne of the ways scientists have attempted to erase these memories through suppression is by interrupting the reconsolidation of a memory. Memory consolidation of a memory is when a person recalls a memory, usually a fearful one, it becomes susceptible to alteration, and then gets stored again. This has led many researchers to believe that this time period is the best time for memories to be altered or erased. Studies have shown that through behavioral training results showed that they were able to erase memories by tampering with memories during the reconsolidation phase.\n\nWith evidence showing that different memories excite different neurons or system of neurons in the brain the technique of destroying select neurons in the brain to erase specific memories is also being researched. Studies have started to investigate the possibility of using distinct toxins along with biotechnology that allows the researchers to see which areas of the brain are being used during the reward learning process of making a memory to destroy target neurons. In a paper published in 2009, authors showed that neurons in the lateral amygdala that had a higher level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) were activated primarily over other neurons by fear memory expression. This indicated to them that these neurons were directly involved in the making of the memory trace for that fear memory. They then proceeded to train mice using auditory fear training to produce a fear memory. They proceeded to check which of the neurons were overexpressing CREB and then, using a inducible diphtheria-toxin strategy, they destroyed those neurons, resulting in persistent and strong memory erasure of the fear memory.\n\nDue to the lack of understanding of the brain this technique of destroying neurons may have a much larger effect on the patient than just the removal of the intended memories. Due to this complex nature of the brain treatment that would stun the neurons instead of destroying them could be another approach that could be taken.\n\nAs with most new technologies the idea of being able to erase memories comes with many ethical questions. One ethical question that arises is the idea that although there are some extremely painful memories that some people (for example PTSD patients) would like to be rid of, not all unpleasant memories are bad. The ability to soften or erase memories could have drastic effects on how society functions. The ability to remember unpleasant effects from one's past has a huge impact on the future actions they may take. Remembering and learning from past mistakes is crucial in the emotional development of a person and helps to ensure they do not repeat previous errors. The ability to erase memory could also have a massive impact on the law. When it comes to determining the outcome of a trial, the ability to modify memory could have a massive impact on the judicial system. Another ethical question that arises is to how the government will use this technology and what restrictions would need to be put in place. Some worry that if soldiers can go into battle knowing that the memories created during that time period can simply be erased they may not uphold military morale and standards.\n\nMemory erasure has also been a common topic of interest in science fiction and other fiction. Several notable comics, TV shows and movies feature mindwipes, including \"Telefon\", \"Total Recall\", \"Men in Black\", \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", \"The Bourne Identity\", and \"Dollhouse\". Novels that feature memory erasure include \"The Invincible\" by Stanisław Lem and some of the \"Harry Potter\" novels (including \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\") by J. K. Rowling, also \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry deals with this subject. Several works by Philip K. Dick are about mindwipes, including \"Paycheck\" and \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" (inspiration for \"Total Recall\").\n"}
{"id": "48647986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48647986", "title": "Men Going Their Own Way", "text": "Men Going Their Own Way\n\nMen Going Their Own Way (MGTOW ) is a mostly pseudonymous online community of men supported by websites and social media presences cautioning men against serious romantic relationships with women, especially marriage. \n\nThe community is part of what is more broadly termed the manosphere. MGTOW have \"...vowed to stay away from women, stop dating and not have children\". MGTOW focuses on men's self-ownership rather than changing the status quo through activism and protest, making MGTOW distinct from the men's rights movement. The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified MGTOW as a male supremacist group.\n\nAccording to Mack Lamoureux, the \"...MGTOW community's history is murky, but it was most likely birthed in the mid to early 2000's by two men who go by the online aliases of Solaris and Ragnar.\" While MGTOW is most associated with Reddit online forums (the UK \"Express\" calls MGTOW a \"Reddit movement\"), there are also MGTOW-themed videos on YouTube.\n\nMGTOW has been associated with political viewpoints. Politically, MGTOW has been variously associated with libertarianism, the alt-right, and philosophical anarchism. MGTOW use the word \"gynocentric\" to describe conditions that they claim favor women to the detriment of men, and are opposed to such circumstances. MGTOW believe that there is a systemic gynocentric bias against men including double standards in gender roles, bias against men in family courts, lack of concern for men falsely accused of rape and lack of consequences for their accusers.\n\nAccording to the columnist Martin Daubney, members of the MGTOW community believe that legal and romantic entanglements with women fail a cost–benefit analysis and risk–benefit analysis. Jeremy Nicholson, writing for \"Psychology Today\", similarly described MGTOW as \"guys who have been frustrated and punished to the point that they see no further incentive to relate [to dating] [...], they focus on making themselves happy\".\n\nAccording to \"Vice\" magazine's Mack Lamoureux, there are a number of levels to MGTOW, ranging from the perception that gender equality is a lie, through rejection of relationships, to economic and societal disengagement.\n\nKay Hymowitz has stated that some self-identified MGTOW express discontent because they see women as hypergamous and manipulative. The \"Business Insider\" reporter Dylan Love wrote a \"fully-realized MGTOW (there are levels to it) is someone who shuns all relationships with women, short-term, long-term, romantic, and otherwise. He eventually shuns society as a whole.\" Some MGTOW have many short-term casual relationships or engage in sex with prostitutes. Celibacy, however, is also an option. A MGTOW that chooses celibacy over sex and relationships is said to be \"going monk\" and some embrace maintaining their virginity. Some MGTOW members advocate having sex with prostitutes or using sex dolls.\n\nMGTOW use jargon such as \"red pilled\" to describe members of their movement and \"blue pilled\" to describe men outside, or opposed to their movement.\n\nMGTOW differs from the men's rights movement, in that while the men's rights movement aims at changing the status quo, such as by changing the laws, MGTOW call for focus on self-ownership and withdrawing from interactions with women.\n\nMack Lamoureux states that while \"[a]t first glance, it's easy to lump MGTOW in with typical Men's Rights Activists (MRAs) who also believe that female oppression is a myth and that it's actually males who are oppressed—but that's not the case. The two groups differ significantly ... While MRAs are out to fix the problem through action and activism, members of MGTOW hold self-preservation above all else, and because of this the majority of the community seems to have decided to bow out.\"\n\nAccording to Roselina Salemi, writing for \"La Repubblica\", the Japanese concept of herbivore men is a subset of MGTOW. Mack Lamoureux, writing in \"Vice\", sees herbivore men as a consequence of Japanese socioeconomic conditions and MGTOW as an ideological choice. In a \"DELFI\" article MGTOW are described as a protest against feminist laws in the West whereas herbivore men are a response to traditional gender roles in Japan, such as those of salarymen. Kashmira Gander writing for \"The Independent\", sees herbivore men serving as role models for MGTOW.\n\nMGTOW see feminists as \"social justice warriors\", while the LGBT rights movement and support for safe spaces are seen as obstacles to male self-ownership. MGTOW have been described as having a \"serious problem with feminism.\"\n\nMGTOW have a reciprocal disdain for the pickup artist. The MGTOW movement has been criticized by the pick-up artists (PUA) for being cult-like, antithetical to human nature, and likened to separatist feminism. Matt Forney from Return of Kings, a pick-up artist website, calls MGTOW a \"creeping cult of male loserdom\".\n\nSome writers have generally held a critical perspective of the MGTOW community. An article in \"The Economist\" about MGTOW states that the \"rebalancing of the sexes has spawned 21st-century misogyny\", with slogans like \"Save a male and stop a wedding™\" being an unregistered trademark of MGTOW.com. Leah Morrigan states that the MGTOW founder Sandman's videos \"proclai[m] his bitter, indiscriminate hate towards women\", who he claims are all \"manipulative whores and liars\" who Sandman \"slut-shames, fat-shames, and age-shames\". When women are discussed on MGTOW forums, it is often \"angrily\"; the Southern Poverty Law Center places it \"on the borders of the hateful incel community\".\n\nPick-up artists \"disparage the community\", calling their \"'philosophy'...completely wrongheaded.\" W. Bradford Wilcox, a conservative and visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, was criticized by the MGTOW activist who goes by the pseudonym \"Turd Flinging Monkey\", who was against Wilcox's video about the \"benefits of marriage for men\", which notes that \"married men work harder (about 400 more hours), smarter (they’re less likely to quit without having found another job), and more successfully (they make about $16,000 more per year) than their single peers\".\n\nResearcher Barb MacQuarrie, who described the community as \"misinformed\", said, \"They have no real ability to identify the global forces that are at work in their life, so they hang the blame on feminists\", and interact with other \"disillusioned, disenfranchised men\" using \"deplorable\" rhetoric. She says that MGTOW advocates show \"a complete lack of self-reflection\", and their decision to live \"separatist lifestyles\" away from women is \"pathetic\". MacQuarrie summed up her views with the comment, \"They're only reinforcing each other's really distorted perceptions of what's happening in the world. They are confining themselves knowingly to a life of isolation and a lot of limitations. It's sad.\"\n\n"}

He translated Averroes and was the greatest public intellectual of his days. He served as science adviser and court astrologer to Frederick II.\n\nScot was born somewhere in the border regions of Scotland or northern England. It has been claimed that he studied first at the cathedral school of Durham and then at Oxford and Paris, devoting himself to philosophy, mathematics, and astrology. It appears that he had also studied theology and become an ordained priest, as Pope Honorius III wrote to Stephen Langton on 16 January 1223/4, urging him to confer an English benefice on Scot, and nominated Scot as archbishop of Cashel in Ireland. Scot declined this appointment, but he seems to have held benefices in Italy. From Paris, Scot went to Bologna, and then after a stay at Palermo, to Toledo. There he learnt Arabic well enough to study the Arabic versions of Aristotle and the many commentaries of the Arabs upon these, as well as the original works of Avicenna and Averroes.\n\nScot was a typical example of the polyglot wandering scholar of the Middle Ages—a churchman who knew Latin, Greek, Arabic and Hebrew. When he was about 50, Frederick II attracted him to his court in the Kingdom of Sicily, and at the instigation of the emperor he superintended (along with Hermannus Alemannus) a fresh translation of Aristotle and the Arabian commentaries from Arabic into Latin. There exist translations by Scot himself of the \"Historia animalium\", of \"De anima\" and of \"De caelo\", along with the commentaries of Averroes upon them.\n\nThe second version of Fibonacci's famous book on mathematics, \"Liber Abaci\", was dedicated to Scot in 1227, and it has been suggested that Scot played a part in Fibonacci's presentation of the Fibonacci sequence. A recent study of a passage written by Michael Scot on multiple rainbows, a phenomenon only understood by modern physics and recent observations, suggests that Michael Scot may even have had contact with the Tuareg people in the Sahara desert.\n\nIn a letter of 1227, recorded by Scot in his \"Liber particularis\", Frederick put questions to him concerning the foundations of the earth, the geography and rulership of the heavens, what is beyond the last heaven, in which heaven God sits, and the precise locations of hell, purgatory and heavenly paradise. He also asks about the soul; and about volcanoes, rivers, and seas. According to the chronicler Fra Salimbene, he attempted to catch Scot out in his calculations of the distance to heaven by scaling from the height of a church tower (by having it secretly lowered). Scot replied by saying that either the moon had gotten further away or the tower had gotten shorter.\n\nScot was a pioneer in the study of physiognomy. His manuscripts dealt with astrology, alchemy and the occult sciences generally and account for his popular reputation. These works include:\n\n\nThe \"Liber physiognomiae\" (which also exists in an Italian translation) and the \"Super auctorem spherae\" expressly state that the author undertook the works at the request of the Emperor Frederick.\n\n\"Every astrologer is worthy of praise and honour,\" Scot wrote, \"since by such a doctrine as astrology he probably knows many secrets of God, and things which few know.\"\n\nHe was offered in 1223 the role of being the Archbishop of Cashel in Ireland by Pope Honorius III; then that of Canterbury in 1227 by Pope Gregory IX.\n\nThe date of Scot's death remains uncertain. The efforts of Walter Scott and others to identify him with the Sir Michael Scot of Balwearie, sent in 1290 on a special embassy to Norway, have not convinced historians, though the two may have had family connections.\n\nA legend popular in the late 13th and early 14th centuries said that Scot foresaw that a small stone would strike him in the head and kill him, so he wore an iron skullcap to avoid his death. However, he removed the cap in church, only to be struck by a stone and die.\n\nThe legendary Michael Scot used to feast his friends with dishes brought by spirits from the royal kitchens of France and Spain and other lands.\n\nHe is said to have turned to stone a coven of witches, which have become the stone circle of Long Meg and Her Daughters.\n\nScot's reputation as a magician had already become fixed in the age immediately following his own. He appears in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" in the fourth bolgia located in the Eighth Circle of Hell, reserved for sorcerers, astrologers, and false prophets who claimed they could see the future when they, in fact, could not. He is described by Dante as being \"spare in the flank\" (\"ne’ fianchi è cosi poco\"). While some argue that this is the \"sole extant description of his physical appearance\", others contend that the description is more poetic. Richard Kay argues that because \"the shades in the Dantesque afterworld create surrogate aerial bodies for themselves that are a projection of [their] soul[s]\", this description is in reference to \"some internal character trait to which [Dante] wished to draw our attention.\" Kay argues that Dante was referenceing a physiognomic description taken from Scot's own \"Liber physiognomiae\"namely, that thin and small ribs signify an individual \"who is weak, who does little labor, who is sagacious, [and] bad\" (the original Latin, found in chapter 88 of the \"Liber physiognomiae\", reads: \"Cuius costae sunt subtiles et paruae\" […] \"significat hominem debilem, pauci laboris, sagacem\" [\"et\"] \"malum\").\n\nBoccaccio represents him in the same character, and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola arraigns him severely in his work against astrology, while Gabriel Naudé finds it necessary to defend his good name in his \"Apologie pour tous les grands personages faussement soupçonnez de magie\".\n\nIn John Leyden's ballad \"Lord Soulis\", Michael Scot is credited with teaching magic to the protagonist, the evil sorcerer William II de Soules, who ends up being boiled alive.\n\nWalter Scott deploys Michael Scott (sic) in his \"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\". In Footnotes 12/13, he credits him with conquering an indefatigable demon, after it had succeeded in splitting Eildon Hill into its three distinctive cones, by challenging it to weave ropes from sea-salt. He records that in the Scottish Borders any work of great labour or antiquity is ascribed either to Auld Michael, or Sir William Wallace, or the Devil.\n\nScot is portrayed as a black magician given to practical jokes in James Hogg's novel \"The Three Perils of Man\".\n\nAllan Massie's novels \"The Evening of the World\" and \"Arthur the King\" (as well as a third projected novel) are written in the format of a romance composed by Scot on the theme of empire for the instruction of Frederick II; it implies that Scot and Frederick were lovers.\n\nScot is the title character in the historic fantasy novel \"The Lord of Middle Air\" by Michael Scott Rohan, who claims descent from the magician.\n\nJane Yolen's \"Tartan Magic\" series features Scot as a villain.\n\nIn the children's television fantasy \"Shoebox Zoo\", Michael Scot has survived to the present day, where he acts as a Gandalf-like character, serving as the mysterious, if somewhat grouchy, advisor to the protagonist, Marnie. He is played by Peter Mullan.\n\nMichael Scot's soul is summoned from its current incarnation to his mouldering body by a lodge of black magicians in \"The Adept\", by Katherine Kurtz and Deborah Turner Harris. During \"The Adept Book Two: The Lodge of the Lynx\" the personality of Scot is reintegrated with his modern incarnation (a young girl named Gillian Talbot) in order to heal the coma created by one part of the spirit being removed from the body for a protracted period.\n\nMichael Scott [sic] was the teacher of the wizard Prospero in John Bellairs' novel \"The Face in the Frost\".\n\nIn John Buchan's \"The Three Hostages\" (1924), Scott [sic] and his work \"Physiognomia\" are mentioned in reference to the arts of spiritual/mind control, a subject of great interest to Dominick Medina, the tale's antagonist.\n\nScot appears as an Archmage in the White Wolf Publishing Mage/Changeling supplement \"Isle of the Mighty\" (1996).\n\nIn the book \"Falketårnet\" (English: \"The Falcon Tower\") by Erik Fosnes Hansen, he is one of the important characters. In this book he is known as an astrologer who gives another main character, Wolfgang, a horoscope.\n\nIn the short story \"The Perils of the Double Sign\" by Robertson Davies, (which appears in a collection called \"High Spirits\",) the narrator mentions that Michael Scot is one of his favourite authors, and his knowledge of Scot's work on the occult aids him in his encounters with a genie.\n\n"}

It originated in the 1st century BCE and flourished during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. The 1911 Britannica describes Neopythagoreanism as \"a link in the chain between the old and the new\" within Hellenistic philosophy. \nAs such, it contributed to the doctrine of monotheism as it emerged during Late Antiquity (among other things influencing early Christianity). Central to Neopythagorean thought was the concept of a soul and its inherent desire for a \"unio mystica\" with the divine.\n\nThe word \"Neopythagoreanism\" is a modern (19th century) term, coined as a parallel of \"Neoplatonism\".\n\nIn the 1st century BCE Cicero's friend Nigidius Figulus made an attempt to revive Pythagorean doctrines, but the most important members of the school were Apollonius of Tyana and Moderatus of Gades in the 1st century CE. Other important Neopythagoreans include the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa (fl. 150 CE), who wrote about the mystical properties of numbers. In the 2nd century, Numenius of Apamea sought to fuse additional elements of Platonism into Neopythagoreanism, prefiguring the rise of Neoplatonism. (Iamblichus, in particular, was especially influenced by Neopythagoreanism).\n\nNeopythagoreanism was an attempt to re-introduce a mystical religious element into Hellenistic philosophy (dominated by the Stoics) in place of what had come to be regarded as an arid formalism. The founders of the school sought to invest their doctrines with the halo of tradition by ascribing them to Pythagoras and Plato. They went back to the later period of Plato's thought, the period when Plato endeavoured to combine his doctrine of Ideas with Pythagorean number theory, and identified the Good with the Monad (which would give rise to the Neoplatonic concept of \"the One\"), the source of the duality of the Infinite and the Measured with the resultant scale of realities from the One down to the objects of the material world.\n\nThey emphasized the fundamental distinction between the soul and the body. God must be worshipped spiritually by prayer and the will to be good, not in outward action. The soul must be freed from its material surrounding, the \"muddy vesture of decay,\" by an ascetic habit of life. Bodily pleasures and all sensuous impulses must be abandoned as detrimental to the spiritual purity of the soul. God is the principle of good, Matter the groundwork of Evil. In this system can be distinguished not only the asceticism of Pythagoras and the later mysticism of Plato, but also the influence of the Orphic mysteries and of Oriental philosophy. The Ideas of Plato are no longer self-subsistent entities but are the elements which constitute the content of spiritual activity. The non-material universe is regarded as the sphere of mind or spirit.\n\nThe Porta Maggiore Basilica where Neopythagoreans held their meetings in the 1st century, believed to have been constructed by the Statilus family was found near Porta Maggiore on Via Praenestina in Rome (discovered 1915).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7489105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7489105", "title": "S. N. Balagangadhara", "text": "S. N. Balagangadhara\n\nS. N. Balagangadhara (aka Balu) is a professor at the Ghent University in Belgium, and director of the India Platform and the Research Centre Vergelijkende Cutuurwetenschap (Comparative Science of Cultures).\n\nBalagangadhara was a student of National College, Bangalore and moved to Belgium in 1977 to study philosophy at Ghent University, where he obtained his doctorate under the supervision of Etienne Vermeersch. His doctoral thesis (1991) was entitled \"Comparative Science of Cultures and the Universality of Religion: An Essay on Worlds without Views and Views without the World\".\n\nBalagangadhara has been researching the nature of religion. His central area of inquiry has been the study of Western culture against the background of Indian culture. His research programme is called in Dutch \"Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap,\" which translates into \"Comparative Science of Cultures\". He has held the co-chair of the Hinduism Unit at the American Academy of Religion (AAR). He also gives lectures to the general public in Europe and India on issues such as the current (mis)understanding of Indian culture and the search for happiness.\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, S. N. Balagangadhara has developed the research programme Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap (Comparative Science of Cultures) to study cultural differences. On the one hand, he analyses western culture and intellectual thought through its representations of other cultures, with a particular focus on the western representations of India. On the other, Balagangadhara attempts to translate the knowledge embodied by the Indian traditions into the conceptual language of the twenty-first century.\n\nIn his first work, \"The Heathen in his Blindness...\" (1994), Balagangadhara focused on religion, culture, and cultural difference. He is mainly known for the controversial claim that religion is not a cultural universal. According to the author, Christianity had a profound influence on western culture. Balagangadhara argued that the analytical tools with which the West has understood other cultures like India, are therefore, intrinsically shaped by Semitic and Christian theology. The Semitic doctrine that God gave religion to humankind, Balagangadhara argued, lies at the heart of the ethnographic belief in the universality of religion:\n\nBalagangadhara proposes therefore a novel analysis of religion, the Roman 'religio', the construction of 'religions' in India, and the nature of cultural differences. His second major work, \"Reconceptualizing India Studies\", appeared in 2012 and argues that post-colonial studies and modern India studies are in need of a rejuvenation. After Said's \"Orientalism\" (1978), post-colonialism, as a discipline, has not contributed much to human knowledge. A strange form of unproductive self-reflection and impenetrable jargon has come to stand for and replace theory building and knowledge production. The book attempts to chalk out a potential direction for the social-scientific study of Indian culture. Stressing the need for an alternative understanding of Western culture, Balagangadhara argues that Hinduism, caste system, and secularism are not colonial constructs but entities within the Western cultural experience. He argues that the so-called facts about India and her traditions are a result of colonial consciousness.\n\nIn 2014, Manohar publishers brought out a condensed and shortened version of \"The Heathen in his Blindness...\" (1994), entitled \"Do all Roads Lead to Jerusalem? The Making of Indian Religions\" (2014).\n\nBalagangadhara published his first work, \"The Heathen in His Blindness\", to a mixed reception. He is widely cited by scholars in the field of religious studies. Richard E. King's \"Orientalism and Religion\" (1999) draws from Balagangadhara's analysis of the concept 'religion'. In 2003, Sharada Sugirtharajah's \"Imagining Hinduism\" used Balagangadhara's analysis of the field of religious studies in her discussion of colonial scholarship. South Asia specialist Peter van der Veer similarly refers to Balagangadhara's theory when he raises \"the broad, historical question of the ways in which Western modernity has assumed universal importance and, more specifically, how a modern Western category such as religion has come to be applied as a universal concept.\" References to Balagangadhara's theory also appear in general introductions to Hinduism, and his work has implications on the disciplines of anthropology, political philosophy, cultural theory, classical literature, and feminist theory.\n\nA recent review of his work points out that \"Balagangadhara's work establishes how little we understand Western culture. Speaking a Western language does not mean we understand what it is.\" This task of understanding the West, \"is necessary in order to clear the ground before the contribution of Indian culture can be assessed. It is made necessary because, over the last few hundred years, systems of knowledge worldwide, certainly in academic contexts, have been dominated by questions that Europe has asked of itself and about the rest of the world.\"\n\nA review in the \"American Anthropologist\" claims his arguments to be \"circuitous, quarrelsome, and often careless,\" replete with \"[n]on sequiturs, unsupported allegations, ... digressions, [and] writing errors.\" Similarly, a review in the \"Philosophy East and West\" describes the work as \"a rambling and repetitious survey of Western intellectual history.\" Philip Almond and David Loy remain sympathetic to Balagangadhara's theory but assert that the claims made about Christian influence are exaggerated. Will Sweetman holds that Balagangadhara's theory is based on a narrow understanding of both religion and Christianity. The historian South Asianist, Sanjay Subrahmanyam characterised Balagangadhara's work as \"peculiar\" and \"confused\", and summed up its overall influence to be one that \"despite its 'cult' status in some circles, in reality does not advance the discussion\".\n\nReviewing the edited collection arising from the first Rethinking Religion in India conference, Chris Fuller, Professor of Anthropology at the London School of Economics, states that \"Balagangadhara's prolix theorizing mixes politically tendentious assertions that Hinduism is a religion of India whereas Islam is not, with spurious arguments that there neither is nor was 'religion' in India, because the very concept is a Western, Christian import and therefore cannot have any valid cross-cultural meaning... to suppose that it has misled everyone along a false trail laid by Christian notions of 'religion' is nonsense.\"<ref name=\"Pacific Affairs, 85/3, 2012, 664\">Pacific Affairs, 85/3, 2012, 664.</ref>\n\nHe was the co-chair of the Hinduism Unit at the American Academy of Religion (AAR) from 2004 to 2007.\n\nOn 1 October 2013, University of Pardubice (Czech Republic) awarded him with its honorary doctorate, \"doctor honoris causa\", and the gold medal for: (a) the outstanding development of the comparative science of cultures and religions, (b) the development of the collaborations between European and Indian universities, and (c) his contribution to the development of the Studies of religions at the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy at the University of Pardubice.\n\nOn 7 July 2014, Balagangadhara announced he attained Enlightenment. He dates the event to June 2014 and suggests that 'Enlightenment' is basically human happiness.\n\nIn 2013, he collaborated on a documentary on Indian culture with the Educators' Society for the Heritage of India (ESHI) and the Hindu Students Council (HSC). In the documentary, Balagangadhara speaks about \"the two colonialisms\" that India has gone through: the British colonisation of India and what he believes to be \"the Islamic colonisation\" of India. The documentary (Colonial Consciousness and Indian Culture) was released in India on 11 January 2013. In November 2014 Balagangadhara was invited by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), to deliver the keynote lecture at the seventh Maulana Abdul Kalam Memorial Lecture in New Delhi. The lecture was highly controversial and resulted in a heated academic argument with Indian historians.\n\nHis attempts at institution building in the South Indian state of Karnataka and the associated research on the caste system in India has proved to be controversial among Kannada intellectuals. The controversy is fueled by Balagangadhara's claim that there is no 'caste system' in India.\n\nIn November 2015, at a Hyderabad English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) conference, he was intellectually dismissive of Ambedkar and called him an idiot. Balagangadhara further called the teaching faculty at EFLU appointed on the basis of reservation in India, incompetent. Activists from various organisations staged a protest in Shivamogga, Karnataka, and submitted a memorandum to the President through the Deputy Commissioner’s office. The teaching and non-teaching staff of Kuvempu University staged a separate protest on its campus at Shankaraghatta, condemning Prof. Balagangadhar for his remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20905908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20905908", "title": "Scientific controversy", "text": "Scientific controversy\n\nA scientific controversy is a substantial disagreement among scientists. A scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of data, which ideas are most supported by evidence, and which ideas are most worth pursuing. For example, the connection between race and intelligence has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century.\n\nWhen compared to controversies, scientific controversies are specific to scientific related arguments, whereas regular controversies entail a much larger range. More specifically, a scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of data, which ideas are most supported by evidence, and which ideas are most worth pursuing. A scientific controversy is an argument where they cannot agree on a method, theory, or hypothesis. It influences how we interpret the data to make a conclusion that best fits the data and/or evidence. Scientific controversies are healthy and can be helpful in getting scientists to think of the best ways to do things as well as different ways to approach topics. In addition, they can also help science move forward. Scientific controversies usually create media attention which allows for more people to become aware of the situation and topic being disagreed. This can create an increase in research on the topic. Although, if there are conflicts between scientific views and non-scientific views, this can hurt scientific research.\n\nThere are many types of controversies. The main type being fundamental and secondary scientific controversies. Fundamental scientific controversies are controversies that are based on the main idea of hypotheses or theories. Meaning the central idea of a topic and not the ideas that surround it which would be secondary scientific controversies. For example, there is skepticism in the general population if there is global warming but in contrast, the majority of the scientific community agree there is global warming. This is a fundamental scientific controversy because it is the main idea. The real issue, the secondary scientific controversy, is how fast is it occurring and how to model it which is what is being researched and debated. It is important to distinguish between these two so that the real scientific issue does not get missed.\n\nControversies between scientific and non-scientific ideas are not within the realm of science and are not true scientific controversies.\n\n"}

{"id": "36910974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36910974", "title": "Sztafeta", "text": "Sztafeta\n\nSztafeta (English: \"Relay Race\") is a 1939 compendium of literary reportage written by Melchior Wańkowicz. It was published in the year of the German-Soviet invasion of Poland. Popular demand caused it to be reprinted four times by the \"Biblioteka Polska\" before the outbreak of hostilities. The book was never published in Communist Poland because it praised the democratic achievements of the prewar Second Polish Republic.\n\nIt gives an account of one of the biggest economic projects of the newly-resurgent interwar Poland, its Central Industrial Area. The work has been described as a \"colourful reporter's panorama, telling the story of the recovery of the Second Polish Republic\". Ryszard Kapuściński wrote that \"Sztafeta\" \"was the first grand reportage of its kind in Poland's history – written about Polish production effort\". To write the book, Wańkowicz collected a great amount of background information, and he carried out dozens of interviews, starting with President Ignacy Mościcki and ending with sailors, coal miners and primary school teachers.\n\nThe book begins with an analysis of the situation of Poland in 1918, right after World War I. The country was in ruins, with two million houses destroyed; industry devastated; poverty, hunger and the threat of a cholera epidemic, all left behind by the Partitions of Poland. It goes on to describe the achievements of the Second Polish Republic, not only about the Central Industrial Area but also about the construction of Gdynia seaport, and of the political scandals such as the annexation of Zaolzie.\n\nThe book was disliked by some members of the military establishment in Poland in 1939. Wańkowicz, they claimed, too frequently criticised the poverty and backwardness of Poland after over a century of foreign occupation.\n\nWańkowicz, who was one of the first modern Polish reporters to write about the economy, had authored a series of reports about the Central Industrial Area (or the Polish Magnitogorsk, as he called the project). They were published in the Polish press in late 1937 and early 1938, and became so popular that he decided to gather four of them in one volume, \"C.O.P. Ognisko siły\", published in 1938. The book was immediately sold out, as Polish readers loved Wańkowicz's optimism, temperament, national pride and honesty. Impressed by the popularity of \"C.O.P. Ognisko siły\", Wańkowicz began writing a more extensive work on the Central Industrial Area and the development of the Polish economy as a whole.\n\n\"Sztafeta\", with 520 pages, is the result of his efforts. Mariusz Grabowski of a daily,\"Polska The Times\", wrote in February 2012 that \"Sztafeta\" reads like a national myth with every page a gem by praising Minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, and the Sanacja government.\n\n\"Sztafeta\", based on the original 1939 edition, together with a number of photographs and maps by pre-war graphic designer, Mieczysław Berman, was republished in February 2012 by the Warsaw publishing house \"Prószyński i spółka\" (whose founder Mieczysław Prószyński is a grandson of Konrad Prószyński), as volume 16 of the collected works of Wańkowicz.\n\nIn the foreword, Wańkowicz states that the title of the book refers to an historic relay race, whose objective is to make Poland a developed and industrial nation. The author also thanks people who contributed to the book, including Ministers Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, Juliusz Ulrich and Antoni Roman. Wańkowicz writes \"To show the real face of Poland and show how Polish people work, to show Poles around their own country in which they are foreigners - it means teaching us to respect ourselves (...) I have tried to undertake this task as best as I can\" (page 18).\n\nIn the preface he touches on the foreign policy of the Second Polish Republic. Wańkowicz claims that the foreign policy of a country is connected with its strength and power. \"Foreign policy is a test of finances, military forces, administration and internal order, the psychological density of and the social justice within a nation\". As Wańkowicz states, from the very beginning, the Second Polish Republic had to find its place among the victorious nations of World War I, according to the Treaty of Versailles. \"History has taught us that we will not prosper under the Treaty, and that we are condemned to handle everything ourselves (...) The Treaty and the spirit of its creators tried to create Poland as one of small Eastern European states. As a result, Gdańsk was not granted to Poland, Zaolzie was given to the Czechs, eastern borders were limited, and the Little Treaty of Versailles was imposed on Poland (...) [Since 1933], Poland has distanced itself from the Treaty of Versailles, as its failing structure does not attract us. Since then, we have been trying to maintain a policy of balance between our two neighbours (...) Even though the Locarno Treaties gave France the right for an armed intervention in case of the Remilitarization of the Rhineland, even though England, Italy, Belgium and Poland were obliged to actively support France, the French did not make any decision\". Furthermore, Wańkowicz claims that the May Coup of 1926 may have been connected with Germany's admission into the League of Nations, since Józef Piłsudski came to the conclusion that under the circumstances, he should take control of both the foreign policy and the army of Poland. (pages 19 – 23).\n\nThis chapter is in memory of the destruction of Polish lands as a result of World War I and other military conflicts, such as the Polish–Soviet War. Compared to France, where only the northeastern provinces were devastated, the Great War resulted in widespread destruction of almost the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic. In 1914 - 1921, almost two million buildings were destroyed, together with 56% of the rolling stock, 64% of railway stations, 390 larger and 2019 smaller bridges. Losses to Polish industry were estimated at 1 billion 800 million zlotys, four and half million hectares of land were left uncultivated, 4 million head of cattle were killed, 3 million people were forced to leave their homes, 130 million cubic meters of timber were taken out of Poland. According to the Polish census of 1921, thousands of people were forced to live in 75,000 cowsheds, pigsties and shacks. \"War has brought destruction to all the provinces of Poland, except for those which had belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia (...) Starving people read with disbelief in the newspapers that as part of World War I reparations, even transports of German beehives headed towards France (...) We have inherited a divided, destroyed Poland, whose lands had for almost 150 years belonged to three different countries (see Partitions of Poland). We have been given a Fatherland moulded out of our traditions, language and the love of our hearts. But economically, it was but a mix of the neglected borderlands of the three foreign nations\" (page 31).\n\nWańkowicz recalls an epidemic of typhus and cholera, which took place in the Soviet Union in 1921. At that time, Polish government created a 40 to 60 kilometer wide barrier implemented to stop the spread of disease, along the Polish - Soviet border. One of the biggest quarantine centers was at Baranowicze, where 10,000 people were treated daily, and 40,000 kilograms of clothes were washed every day. Altogether, 182 Polish doctors and nurses died at the Baranowicze quarantine center, and in 1923, a monument dedicated to them was unveiled there: \"Over the dead bodies, we headed towards the reconstruction of Poland\" (page 37).\n\nIn this chapter, Wańkowicz describes his pre-World War I adventures, when with friends he hiked across the future Central Industrial Area, which before 1914 had been divided between the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary. Those lands, the heart of Poland, had nothing in common: \"Eighty per cent of our rail traffic just serves the triangle of Upper Silesia - Warsaw - Lwów. This triangle is empty inside (...) The distance between Vistula river bridges can reach up to 70 kilometers. The population of the center of Poland, the area bounded by the Pilica, the Bug rivers and the Beskids mountain range, which amounts 5 million people, is suffocating due to unemployment and small farms. Urbanization had not taken place in those borderlands of Russia and Austria-Hungary. In the Central Industrial Area, 418,000 people are simply redundant. They may go away, but where to? (...) The Central part of Poland is just rotting. As Marshal Józef Piłsudski once said, Poland is like a bagel, in which anything good lies on the edges. And along these edges we have hostile neighbours\" (pages 41 – 47)\n\nWańkowicz reminds the reader that other nations had also decided to move their industrial centers away from borders. Soviet Union located its main factories in the Urals, and Nazi Germany in the area between the Weser and the Elbe. \"This land, forgotten by God, we shall lift up through the Central Industrial Area, and the Area itself shall be surrounded by highly developed agriculture\" (page 52).\n\nThe Polish symbolic and metaphorical Verona is the historic town of Sandomierz, which, according to the plans, was to become the capital of the Central Industrial Area, and of the projected Sandomierz Voivodeship (1939). Similar to Verona (Italy), Sandomierz was famous for its Renaissance architecture but little else. \"Nothing has changed here since I visited this town as a kid...\" (Wańkowicz). However, the town's location was excellent, as distances to other industrial towns in the region were equally close including Nisko, Opatów, Kielce, Radom, Lublin, Łańcut, Dębica and Pińczów (pp. 55–58).\n\nThe chapter describes the current and a potential future of Sandomierz, with new investments, estimated at almost 7 million zlotys. \"Meanwhile I do not see any changes in Sandomierz, and neither would Berke see them, whose forces in 1260 faced some 8,000 residents of the town; the same population as now (...) Sandomierz is such a careless town. The seat of the voivode and of the local Polish Army infantry division is in Kielce. The Provincial court, rail and forest management offices are in Radom. School district in Ostrowiec. Post office district management in Lublin, insurance office in Tarnobrzeg, tax office in Opatów, and even the rail station lies on the eastern shore of the Vistula, in a different province. It is touching to watch this careless chaos, to watch the old order of things, knowing that the future will change it all for good (...) Admirers of the Polish Verona may sleep well\" (pages 58 – 61).\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to hydropower, and different means of obtaining energy from water. Wańkowicz recollects the disastrous 1934 flood in Poland, which caused damages estimated at 75 million zlotys. One year after the disaster, construction of the Dunajec river dam and a power plant began at the village of Rożnów, near the site of a medieval castle. According to the plans from the 1930s, the government of the Second Polish Republic envisaged construction of 27 reservoirs in the Vistula Basin, and 19 reservoirs in the Dniestr Basin. Wańkowicz himself visited the Rożnów Dam construction site in the autumn of 1938, and the book contains several photos from that visit.\n\nFurther on, the chapter tells about future plans for the Vistula river. Wańkowicz predicts that the Vistula would emerge as the most important trade corridor of Poland. To make it happen, the largest river of Poland would have to be deepened and regulated. As the author writes, the three most important public works projects of Poland are: Gdynia, Central Industrial Area, and the Vistula: \"To connect the Vistula with the Central Area, by regulating the whole length of the river. To make it happen, we need 20 million [zlotys] every year for 30 years (...) Meanwhile, a lot will happen in the Central Area. The plans specify regulation of the Vistula from Oświęcim to Sandomierz (...) In the fields near Koprzywnica, hundreds of workers toil. They are the unemployed, brought here from Częstochowa. Those with wagons are the so-called \"Dutchmen\"; the inhabitants of the village of \"Zabuże\" (near Sokal). Their ancestors came to Poland to escape religious persecution. They are talented at earthwork, and are seen all over the Central Area\" (pages 68 – 94).\n\nWańkowicz begins this chapter by recollecting the Polish–Soviet War of 1919 - 1920. In late July 1920, he visited the Free City of Danzig, witnessing a British steamboat \"Triton\", filled with weapons and ammunition for the Polish Army. German-speaking longshoremen at the Port of Danzig refused to unload it, while the Czechoslovaks would not let rail transports pass through their country. At that time, as Wańkowicz wrote, Poland was \"a nation, which did not have its own seaport and its own arms industry\" (page 96). Gdynia was built after the humiliation of 1920, and in the late 1930s, Poland initiated the construction of, as Wańkowicz named it, the \"Polish Magnitogorsk\".\n\nStalowa Wola was built from scratch, 35 kilometers from Sandomierz, 6 kilometers from Rozwadów, and 11 kilometers from Nisko, in the \"perfect center\" of the Central Industrial Area. 600 hectares of land were built for the project, which took place in the village of \"Pławo\". The first pine tree was cut down on March 20, 1937: \"Now, there is a row of pavilions, with newly built rail connections. We are standing in one of these houses, whose roof covers the area of two hectares. Altogether, some nine hectares will be under roofs (...) The plant will receive three kinds of energy: electric, gas and coal\". (page 101)\n\nThe construction of \"Southern Works\", as Huta Stalowa Wola was called, gave employment to 2,500 people, additional 1,500 built the town: \"We do not have any Vickers, Armstrongs, or Schneiders. We work using Polish factories. Here, \"Zgoda, Zieleniewski, Ostrowiec\", and \"Jenike\" shook hands (...) The plant will employ 4,000, new settlement, with sewer system, laundries, baths, casinos and sports facilities is being built. The settlement will be located around the plant, so that workers should reach the factory as quickly and as easily as possible\". (pages 103 - 104)\n\nWańkowicz reminds that since the November Uprising (1831), no arms plant had been built in any part of the divided Poland: \"We had neither gold to purchase weapons, nor roads for the transport of them (...) We dreamt about a fully independent Poland, and the idea of Old-Polish Industrial Region was brought back (...) The creators of new Poland will need strong will, the willingness to complete all plans. Therefore, the idea to give the name \"Stalowa Wola\" [Steel Will] to the town which will manufacture steel, was a fortunate one\". (pages 106 - 112)\n\nThe chapter begins with the description of Rzeszów, the town which used to be called \"the Galician Jerusalem\". As part of Austria-Hungary, it was dirt poor and destitute, like the whole province of Galicia: \"Now, a convoy of shiny Buicks and Fiats enters Rzeszów, together with three buses of Polish State Railways. We are heading towards the enormous complex of the \"Polskie Zakłady Lotnicze\" [Polish Aviation Works] factory of plane engines. The factory occupies the area of 21 hectares, and will employ 2,000 (...) Next we are going to see the H. Cegielski – Poznań branch plant [now Zelmer Rzeszów], located at the other end of the town. Construction of the \"Cegielski\" factory began on April 20, 1937, in an old Austrian armoury (...) Poland needs machine tools for some 30 million zlotys a year, while national production reaches 7 million zlotys (...) Rzeszów turns into an industrialized town. Its fathers now have to think about new flats for workers, waterworks and sewages, power plant, shops, schools, hospital, bridge and green areas. When I leave Rzeszów, I see the monument of Colonel Leopold Lis-Kula\". (pages 115 - 124)\n\nThis chapter discusses the need to establish Poland's own resources of iron ore. Wańkowicz states that Nazi Germany after the Anschluss seized the Erzberg mine, with 300 million tons of iron ore, out of which several military products are made. In the ancient times, iron ore was excavated in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains, \"Now [early 1939], southern corner of Poland is full of posters, urging residents to hand any heavy stones found by them to the government, in exchange of 5 zlotys (...) A farmer named Boroń, who resides in Gogołów near Frysztak, sent a stone which was rich in iron. The government sent experts, handing Boroń additional 1,000 zlotys reward for his finding. They established the iron ore deposits here, and now are considering further examination of the area (...) And when we look at the roads crowded with people, when we look at the Jews, minding their own businesses, we realize that we are one of the most densely populated nations of Europe. That this population density is not based on industry or commerce, but on poverty. And we see this country in ten years, through the eyes of our young engineers\" (pages 132 - 151).\n\nWańkowicz begins this chapter by recalling his first sight of an automobile, which took place in Kraków, in the early 20th century. Natural rubber has been in rising demand since early days of the automobile industry, and in plantations across the world, in Brazil, the Congo or Liberia, locals were being slaughtered by Westerners searching for rubber trees. In 1938, the world used one million tons of natural rubbers, for the estimated 40 million vehicles, 80% of which were owned by Americans. Poland, with a fledgling automobile industry, also needed natural rubber, the purchase of which was difficult and expensive. The only solution was synthetic rubber (pages 154 - 156).\n\nWańkowicz recalls first Polish attempts at creating synthetic rubber, and compares them to the Germans, working at IG Farben, as well as Soviet efforts of the early 1930s. Due to the work of such persons, as minister Wojciech Świętosławski, Professor Kazimierz Kling and Wacław Szukiewicz of Warsaw's \"Chemical Research Institute\", Polish synthetic rubber made from potatoes, and called \"KER\" (an acronym for \"Kauczuk ERytrenowy\"), was produced in 1935. In August 1938, \"Chemical Works S.A.\" (currently \"Polifarb Dębica\") was opened in the village of Pustynia near Dębica. The ready product was used by another factory, which was opened in the late 1930s in the same town - \"Tire Company Stomil Dębica\" (which currently is owned by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company).\n\nIn this chapter Wańkowicz recalls his childhood, spent in the village of Nowotrzeby, located in Polish Eastern Borderlands. Since there was no electricity, light was provided by several kerosene lamps. As late as 1938, such lamps were a rarity in several regions of the Second Polish Republic.\n\nAmong pioneers of kerosene industry were such names, as Abraham Schreiner, Ignacy Łukasiewicz, and Jan Zeh. Due to their work, first kerosene lamps were lit in the municipal hospital of the city of Lwów, in 1853. It was Łukasiewicz who opened first oil well \"Małgorzata\" in Polish lands. His well was 180 meters deep, and was located at the village of Jaszczew. Next came oil refinery at the village of \"Polanka\", which now is a district of Krosno (pages 174 - 182). In 1881, a Canadian resident William H. McGarvey came to Austrian Galicia. Among other places, he worked at Borysław, which, as Wańkowicz put it, in the 1890s was \"a Polish Klondike\". McGarvey cooperated with a man named Władysław Długosz (who would in the future work for the \"National Oil Association of Poland\"), and due to their efforts, as well as many other entrepreneurs, the production of oil in Galicia, mostly in Borysław, Krosno, Słoboda Rungurska and Schodnica near Lwów, reached 2 million tons in 1909. In that year, some 10,000 people were employed in Galicia's oil industry. After the peak, oil prices went down, which resulted in a number of bankruptcies. Before World War I, Galicia produced app. 3% of world's oil (pages 182 - 192).\n\nFollowing World War I, the Polish–Ukrainian War broke out in eastern Galicia. Oil wells of the region were of particular importance, and on Sunday, May 17, 1919, the suburbs of Drohobycz were captured by a mounted company of 180 men, led by Colonel Stanisław Maczek. After a battle with the Ukrainians, the cities of Drohobycz and nearby Borysław were seized by the Poles on the next day: \"Polish lands were destroyed, powerless and fallow. And here, we had gold in our hands. In those years, we bought everything for that oil, even beans from Yugoslavia\" (page 192).\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to natural gas, and the history of its exploration in Polish lands. Wańkowicz writes that when in 1890 gas was found in Potok, (a village between Krosno and Jasło), the locals thought of it as a misfortune, and poured water on the source: \"As late as 1932, when I came to Stryj on a sunny midday, I noticed with surprise that all street lamps were turned on (...) Local people explained to me that it did not make any sense to turn off the lamps, as they were fueled by natural gas, which was free\" (page 198). First Polish pipeline was built in 1912. It was 9 kilometers long, and went from Borysław to the refinery at Drohobycz. In 1921, a natural gas well was opened at Daszawa near Stryj, and in 1928, the Polmin corporation opened a pipeline from Daszawa to Drohobycz, later reaching Lwów. Several new pipelines were opened in eastern Galicia in the mid-1930s, and in 1937, a 200-kilometer pipeline connected Roztoki with Starachowice: \"Currently, new lines to Radom, Pionki, Nisko and Skarżysko-Kamienna are being built\" (page 205).\n\nBefore World War I, Polish coal mining was divided between three countries. Upper Silesia served the German Empire, Zagłębie Dąbrowskie sold its coal to the Ukraine (part of Russian Empire), and the \"Kraków Coal Basin\" was part of Austria-Hungary. Altogether, in 1914, 40 million tons of coal were excavated in the divided Polish lands. After the war, however, Polish coal lost its markets. Production remained high, still at 40 million tons, while demand in the newly created Second Polish Republic was some 18 million tons. The only solution was to export Polish coal, but by 1925, Poland exported only .5 million tons a year: \"The coal strike in England came in 1926, at the best possible time for Poland, but we had no means to transport our coal to Scandinavia, which had been main market of British coal. Gdynia was not ready yet, the Free City of Danzig was out of question, and the Polish Coal Trunk-Line was not completed (...) So, a Polish David was facing a British Goliath\" (pages 208 - 211).\n\nTo reach the lucrative Scandinavian markets, Polish merchants travelled north, trying to convince the Scandinavians to purchase Polish coal. Furthermore, after the general strike had ended in the United Kingdom, the British wanted to return to Scandinavia with their coal. In 1931, Great Britain dropped the gold standard, which resulted in lower export prices for their products. In response, the Polish government opened a special offset fund, valued at 5 million zlotys. Both sides decided to enter negotiations, which took place simultaneously at Warsaw and London. Finally, a treaty was signed in 1934, with further changes in 1937 (pages 211 - 216).\n\nWańkowicz himself went to Giszowiec, a district of Katowice, to see with his own eyes the process of coal mining. Together with the manager of a local coal mine, engineer Michejda, he went 400 meters underground: \"I will never let my wife enter a coal mine, says one of the engineers. You never know what may happen at any moment (...) There are many dangers at a coal mine. Apart from rock burst, there is water and natural gas. Therefore, managers of the mine are in constant struggle with these elements (...) I am leaving industrial Upper Silesia, driving my car towards Cieszyn. Behind me stays a Polyphemus of the Polish lands. East of it, a new center of power is being built - the Central Industrial Area (pages 216 - 224).\n\nWańkowicz begins this chapter by recalling the destruction, caused by the senseless de-forestation in the northeastern portion of the Second Polish Republic (currently this area belongs to Belarus). By the late 1930s, due to the invention of cellulose, Polish forests ceased to be depleted. A brand new cellulose factory was opened in the town of Niedomice, 15 kilometers from Tarnów. The factory was built from July 1935 to November 1937, on an 80-hectare plot of wet meadow, purchased from the Sanguszko family: \"The Niedomice plant daily uses 50,000 cubic meters of water from the Dunajec, while the city of Warsaw uses 80,000 cubic meters of water (...) It processes spruce from the Carpathians and the Kresy, and among its products there is silk. Furthermore, thanks to the existence of the Niedomice plant, we will no longer have to import nitrocellulose, as it will be replaced by Polish-made cellulose (...) And when I look at the mighty machines, crushing the immense tree trunks into little splinters, I think of the wasteful economy of the past generations, and I am thankful that there is a provident hand, which begins to rule the Polish national household\". (pages 226 - 240)\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to nitrogen, nitrates, and their importance in as fertilizers in agriculture. Wańkowicz visits a large nitrogen plant located in Mościce (\"Zjednoczone Fabryki Związków Azotowych Mościce\"), reminding his readers that the Mościce plant is a younger \"brother\" of the Chorzów Nitrogen Works (which were opened in 1915 as \"Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke\", in then-German Konigshutte).\n\nOn June 15, 1922, following the Silesian Uprisings, units of the Polish Army entered the so-called \"Eastern Upper Silesia\", which became the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Among numerous plants and enterprises that came under Polish control, was the modern \"Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke\" plant, the brainchild of Nikodem Caro. Polish experts, headed by Ignacy Mościcki, were surprised to find all 196 German specialists abandon their posts. Furthermore, the Germans took with them all documents and specifications of the plant. All left Poland for the nearby Beuthen, awaiting the collapse of the plant under inexperienced Polish leadership. To make matters worse, those German workers that remained in Chorzów carried out acts of sabotage.\n\nIn April 1923, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, together with Adam Podoski, came to Chorzów. By then, almost all workers had been replaced, and the new, Polish-speaking crew brought the production to the pre-1921 level. Poles concentrated their efforts at manufacturing calcium cyanamide, which in the 1920s and 1930s was commonly used as a fertilizer. In 1923, 39,000 tons of calcium cyanide was produced at Chorzów; by 1929, the production grew to 166,000 tons. Still, it was not enough for the Polish agriculture, so construction of a new plant at Mościce near Tarnów was initiated by a number of specialists from Chorzów, headed by Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski (pages 240 - 254).\n\nWańkowicz begins this chapter by reminding the readers that Second Polish Republic is a very poor country, which is confirmed on each page of the Polish Statistical Yearbook. Poland, however used to be a rich country, which lost is wealth and capital due to the stupidity of the Polish nobility, which did not invest the money and did not have any plans concerning national economy, preferring to spend its funds on expensive clothes and oriental specialties. \"Let us compare what other nations did after the discovery of America. In Holland mighty plants were opened, which manufactured various goods and exported them all over the world. France invested large sums of money in infrastructure, such as Canal du Midi, army and navy (...) At the same time the nobility in Poland spent its money on never ending balls and parties (...) Aleksander Bruckner writes that day after day at the Lubomirski family residence at Dubno, 300 people partied, that rivers of gold flew at Annopol of the Jabłonowski family, Tuczyn of the Walewski family, Korzec of the Czartoryski family, Sławuta of the Sanguszko family\". (pages 267 - 270)\n\nDespite some positive changes, the economy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth continued to deteriorate in the 18th century. In 1777, Polish banks spent one million zlotys a month purchasing luxurious imported goods from Paris: \"Piotr Fergusson Tepper once said that annually, Poland imports 36,000 barrels of wine from Hungary, and that it was easier to find Polish currency in Paris than in Warsaw. This whole economy of Polish elites resulted in bankruptcies and poverty. As Jędrzej Kitowicz writes, there was such a shortage of money in Poland, that in circulation were coins manufactured during the reign of King Jan Kazimierz. And then Prussian times came, marked by the total decline of the Polish economy. The population of Warsaw dropped from 200,000 to 60,000, and foreigners compared it to Tyre and Carthage\". (page 274)\n\nThe situation began to improve after the creation of Congress Poland, due to the efforts of Stanisław Staszic, when iron plants were opened between Radom and Sandomierz, at Suchedniów and Końskie (see also Old-Polish Industrial Region). Failure of the November Uprising stopped the development of Congress Poland, but soon afterwards Piotr Steinkeller initiated a program of industrialization and modernization: \"A few years passed after the defeat of 1831. Railroads had been constructed, Russian Empire opened to the Polish goods, and for the first time in years, we managed to halt the decline. But it did not last for long. The January Uprising, which cost our nation 20,000 dead, 50,000 sent to Siberia, once again destroyed our economic future\". (page 287)\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to electricity and electrification of Poland. In 1921, after Poland regained independence, the average citizen of the nation used 7.5 watts of power, with the Polish part of Upper Silesia using 82 watts per person. Given the fact that at the same time, there were nations which used more than 2,000 watts per person, Poland's electrification was nonexistent: \"And now we are standing in a power plant at Mościce (...) Currently, the price of one kilowatt hour of energy in Warsaw is 60 groszy, but when construction of power plants and power lines is completed, the price will go down to 15 groszy. In 1940, the cheap energy will reach Warsaw, before that, cheap energy will reach Starachowice and Rzeszów\". (pages 304 - 312)\n\nWańkowicz goes on to remind the reader that overpopulation was one of major problems of the Second Polish Republic: \"Ten million people do not have enough food and do not have a permanent job. Ten million unemployed only in the countryside without those from urban communities (...) They are a dead material, which has to be fed, which has to work, which has to go beyond simple animalistic needs (...) Eighty per cent of Poland lies outside of the Central Industrial Area. These people dream about the COP, awaiting a better future\" (page 314). The author cites letters, which were sent to him from different parts of the country. An osadnik named Kostrzewski, from the village of Chocieńczyce (near Wilejka), writes: \"I am surprised by the fact that the Soviets make great propaganda about their Dneprostroi, while a book about Polish efforts is being published only now\". (page 316).\n\nIn the summer 1938 Wańkowicz visited the village of Zaleszany, near Sandomierz. On a Sunday after the service local residents left church to watch construction of a pipeline: \"Among the crowd watching the construction site, nobody knows what these pipes are for and who needs them. These are the people who worked for 80 grosz a day. They have all their constitutional rights, they elect the government, but they have no idea about the pipes\". (page 319) According to Wańkowicz, the most important category of laborers in the eyes of the locals are welders. They make up to 600 zlotys a month: \"These welders, mostly young guys, are dressed like Primadonnas. Four of them rent a house, they come from different parts of Poland: Borysław, Lwów, Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, and Warszawa. sett pavers come to the Central Industrial Area from Gdynia, earth workers from the area of the Bug river, fitters are from Upper Silesia and Warsaw, bricklayers come from Iwieniec, and qualified metal workers are from Poznań and Radom. Thus, all hands from across Poland are building her heart\".(pages 318 - 319).\n\nMelchior Wańkowicz emphasizes the fact that increasing number of laborers, coming to the Central Industrial Area, means that their children attend local schools, which are not prepared for such an influx of new pupils: \"Within a few months, 150 new children flooded a school at Ćmielów. At Denków [now a district of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski], 600 kids study in two shifts in one crowded schoolhouse (...) Within a few months, 1,000 Poles expelled from France with their children settled in Iłża County. Radom itself needs at least seven new schools (...) And what with Mielec, which is expanding quickly, but no news of any new schools? What about Rozalin, what about Kraśnik, where a brand new town is being built near the old one?\" (pages 326 - 329)\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to different kinds of communication - railroads, roads, telecommunication, and airplanes. To operate, a modern plant needs three things: electricity, natural gas and coal. In the Second Polish Republic, deposits of coal were located in southwestern corner of the country, some 250 kilometers from Central Industrial Area. It had to be brought to central Poland in a quick and cheap way. \nWańkowicz interviewed deputy Minister of Communications, Konrad Piasecki, who promised that in the six coming years, Polish government would annually spend on communication 60 million zlotys: \"40,000 meters of spruce from the area of Wilno are annually transported to the plant at Niedomice. These transports have to travel 112 extra kilometers, as there is no rail line from Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski to Szczucin (...) Iron ore has been found near Jasło. It will be delivered to \"Southern Works\" at Stalowa Wola, travelling 207 kilometers, instead of 123 kilometers, as there is no rail connection between Jasło and Dębica. These are just a few examples, as everyone knows that construction is impossible in the areas with no roads and no rail transport\".(pages 340 - 344)\n\nIn the late 1910s, the newly born Second Polish Republic had no common rail system, as it was made of rail systems of three powers that had divided Poland (Russian Empire, German Empire, Austria-Hungary). Different were tracks, signals, brakes, engines, cars, regulations, tariffs and tools. Rail transport suffered from World War One destruction, yet it not only had to support Polish Army units, but also civilian population. Everything was improvised, and in the 1920, the nation was invaded. The Soviets were close to capturing 220 engines and 7,560 cars, which were being withdrawn westwards. In six weeks, Polish rail workers managed to turn 400 kilometers of Russian gauge track into the standard gauge (from Baranowicze to Dęblin), thus saving Polish rolling stock. In the first years of the Second Polish Republic, rail transport was very difficult; it took 22 hours to travel from Warsaw to Wilno, due to a destroyed bridge near Grodno: \"Now, the prophecy of Ferdinand de Lesseps is becoming reality. The developer of the Suez Canal stated that Warsaw would emerge as major rail hub of Europe, as here three international lines meet: Paris - Berlin - Warsaw - Moscow; Gdynia - Warsaw - Lwów - Balkan Peninsula; Helsinki - Riga - Wilno - Warsaw - Katowice - southern Europe\". (pages 343 - 349)\n\nIn 1938, there were 250,000 telephones in Poland. To speed up the process of modernization of Polish telecommunication, a brand new telephone equipment factory was being built at Poniatowa, which was planned to give employment to 4,000 people. By the end of 1937, 720 kilometers of long distance cable connections had been laid, connecting Sandomierz with Kielce, Rzeszów, Rozwadów, Tarnobrzeg and Lublin. Completion of cable connection between Warsaw and Sandomierz was planned for late 1939, and in 1940, Warsaw was to receive long-distance cable connection with Lwów. (pages 353 - 358)\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to air transport. Wańkowicz writes that the \"National Meteorological Institute\" (\"Państwowy Instytut Meteorologiczny\") has 160 co-workers, scattered across Poland. They make weather reports, updated every few hours, reporting them by telegraph or telephone to the central office in Warsaw: \"Our Baltic Sea shore makes only 2.5% of our borderline. But nobody will smother us by our neck, when there are wings in our arms\". (pages 359 - 368)\nThe first Polish long-distance international flight took place in 1926, when Captain Bolesław Orliński, together with his mechanic, Leon Kubiak, flew from Warsaw to Tokyo, and back. In February 1927, Tadeusz Karpiński asked for permission to fly over the Atlantic, but did not receive it. The 1932 Challenge International de Tourisme was won by Franciszek Żwirko and Stanisław Wigura, both of whom died in a plane crash in the same year. Three weeks after their death, Tadeusz Karpiński flies 14,000 kilometers in a Lublin R-X plane from Warsaw to Palestine, through Syria, Persia, Afghanistan and Iraq. In 1934, Joe and Ben Adamowicz flew over the Atlantic.\n\nIn the 1930s, ballooning was very popular in Poland, with such personalities as pilot Franciszek Hynek and navigator Zbigniew Burzyński, both of whom twice won the Gordon Bennett Cup. Wańkowicz recalls the 1935 Cup, which took place in Warsaw. Burzyński, together with Colonel Władysław Wysocki, flew far into Soviet territory, and were attacked by the Soviet Air Force planes. Finally, they landed near the Don river, crossing 1,650 kilometers in 57 hours and 54 minutes. Apart from long-distance balloon flights, Polish pilots tried to break the high altitude world record, but the Gwiazda Polski balloon burned on October 14, 1938.\n\n\"The time is near, when we will be making our own large passenger planes. Our first prototype of such machine, the PZL.44 Wicher, apparently is better, faster and more spacious than the Douglas DC-2. Not a single month passes without news about our pilots. Now, we should think about the youth. We should make flying common among them! (...) We already have the sailplane high altitude world record of Kazimierz Antoniak (3,435 meters). We have women's sailplane long distance world record of Wanda Modlibowska (24 hours and 14 minutes), and finally, we have the 1938 Lilienthal Gliding Medal, granted to Tadeusz Góra for his May 18, 1938 flight from Bezmiechowa Górna to Soleczniki (577,8 kilometers). (...) Currently, the Airborne and Antigas Defence League has 1,7 million members, which makes 5% of Poland's population\". (pages 380 - 382)\n\nWańkowicz begins this chapter by analyzing what the notion of independence means: \"Are the Philippines or Cuba more independent than the Irish Free State, because their governments are more free?\" The author then goes on to recall the Polish–Soviet War, when in 1920 all land borders of the newly restored Poland were closed down, and the German longshoremen at Danzig did not want to help with unloading transports of ammunition for the fighting nation: \"Where was our independence, when after the Bolshevik war we wanted to sell first 100,000 tons of our cement, and foreign ship-owners, influenced by foreign cement makers, did not want to transport it, and we did not have our ships?\"\n\nThe Second Polish Republic had only 74 kilometers of Baltic Sea shoreline. In the Middle Ages, Poland ruled a much wider shoreline, with such ports, as Gdańsk, Kołobrzeg, Kamień Pomorski, Szczecin (Wańkowicz spells it \"Szczucin\"), Wolin. Wańkowicz recalls Polish efforts at keeping its sea connections, such as Pomeranian wars of Bolesław III Wrymouth, and Poland's failure, when in 1598 King Sigismund III Vasa, after receiving 300,000 zlotys from the Sejm, set on to the Kingdom of Sweden with a fleet of 60 ships, and an army of 5,000 (see: War against Sigismund).\n\n\"We failed at sea. It served us across centuries, but somebody else transported goods from Poland (...) In 1920, the English ship \"Triton\" stood on the Motława, filled with ammunition for the bleeding country. It stood there motionless, as Danzig did not allow it to be unloaded. And at the same time, Polish authorities began looking for a spot for the construction of a new port\" (pages 384–388).\n\nFinally, Gdynia was chosen, the very same spot mentioned by Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, who wrote to King Władysław IV Vasa, stating that it was a very convenient location for a sea port: \"Now, if Stefan Żeromski was still alive, we would take him here. We would show him the 12-kilometer long wharf, the giant warehouses with total area of 217,000 sq. m., the granary, the 75 cranes (...) The total tonnage of our merchant navy grew from 9,000 tons in 1927, to 100,000 tons in 1938 (...) We need Gdynia like all humans need lungs. Right now, 75% of our foreign trade goes through this city. In case of a war, we will need it more than anything else. Our merchant navy, our transport navy needs protection. It is our new task. First we needed a port. Then we needed ships. Now we need to defend them\". (pages 388–397)\nThis chapter describes Wańkowicz's visit to Gdynia, which took place in early May 1938. He witnessed the May 3rd Constitution Day parade, after which he left for Sopot, which belonged to the Free City of Danzig. After a dinner, he visits Danzig, noticing its empty port, as all sea transport was headed for Gdynia. After returning to Poland, Wańkowicz goes to Władysławowo, which was then called Wielka Wieś. A new fishing port was officially opened on May 6, 1938. Wańkowicz witnessed the ceremony, led by Bishop Stanisław Okoniewski: \"Silent waters spread in front of our eyes. They are enclosed by two piers. The western one is 763 meters long, the eastern one is 320 meters long. The port has enough space for 100 fishing vessels\". (pages 404–413) \nThis chapter begins with a reflection on the general condition of Poland in the late 1930s: \"This nation grows by half a million a year, but we do not have space for such growth. One third of us, 10 million people, live their wretched existence on small farms, with the size not larger than one and a half hectare (...) One third of the nation rots physically and morally. They cannot afford education, food, new equipment. How can we go forward with all this?\" (pages 419–421)\n\nWańkowicz mentions those Poles who travelled and succeeded abroad: Krzysztof Arciszewski (a vice-governor of Dutch Brazil), Maurycy Beniowski (ruler of a community in Madagascar), French Navy Captain Adam Mierosławski, Paweł Strzelecki (geologist and explorer), Ignacy Domeyko (geologist and educator, who spent most of his live in Chile), Bronisław Rymkiewicz (engineer, who built the Amazon river port at Manaus), Ernest Malinowski (who constructed a railway in the Peruvian Andes), Benedykt Dybowski (naturalist and physician), Mikołaj Przewalski (explorer of Central Asia), and many others. The author goes on to remind the readers that to cope with the problem of overpopulation, Poland needs colonies: \"This nation wants to live and at the same time, it suffocates itself from population explosion (...) When other European nations conquered faraway lands, Poland protected the European - Asian borderline, fighting and bleeding along the boundary of two worlds. Then we lost independence, at a time when other European nations conquered most territory (...) Now, the wave of hungry nations is rising again, against those rich nations, which control world trade and which possess overseas empires. Forty per cent of our import is made of colonial goods, without which we cannot survive. Now, we understand why colonies are so important to Poland\". (pages 422–430)\n\n\"We understand that it is a difficult task, but it also is a necessity, without which there is no development of Poland. We understand that nobody will give the colonies to us for free, that we are a poor nation, that other nations did not get their colonies for free, either. England fought many colonial wars, sending 20 million people abroad in the last 100 years. And we have people here, they are our treasure, but for now, they are our biggest misfortune. We should remember that everything depends on us, on our minds\". (pages 430–432)\n\nBetween autumn of 1937, and autumn of 1938, Wańkowicz visited the Central Industrial Area (\"COP\") five times. This chapter is dedicated to his last visit before publishing the book. It took place on November 16–19, 1938. Wańkowicz wants to silence those who criticize the very idea of the \"COP\", by pointing out some numbers:\n\nDuring his November 1938 trip, Wańkowicz visited Dębica, where construction of the Stomil Tire Factory was started in April 1938: \"Polish production now covers 70% of our demand. The import was reduced from 13 to 4 million (...) Soon, tires made of synthetic rubber will be manufactured here. The Dębica plant is like a laboratory, where white collar workers make one-third of staff\". (pages 438 - 440) Then the author went by train to Pustków Osiedle near Dębica, where the \"Lignoza\" plastic and ammunition plant was under construction: \"The spirit of explosives floats above this plant. So, its 135 buildings are scattered over the area of 600 hectares. And the settlement for the workers is located one kilometer away\". (pages 440 - 441) Another location was Nowa Dęba, which Wańkowicz calls Dąb-Majdan: \"Here, 2,360 people work. As early as autumn of 1939, first fuses will be manufactured at the 1,500 hectare plant. This giant factory is one large ammunition compound in case of war\". (pages 442 - 443). Next location is Mielec, where on September 1, 1939, construction of PZL Mielec was started: \"In the autumn of 1939, first 50,000-meter airframes will be tested here, in a special wind tunnel\". (pages 444 - 445) Last stop of the trip was Stalowa Wola: \"I walk along those giant furnaces and machines with mixed feelings. Deputy Prime Minister tells me that if both local blast furnaces were in use for 24 hours a day they would require as much as 12% of electric current, used by the whole Polish nation. It tells a lot about our country (...) Stalowa Wola has been under construction for 20 months, and 98% of buildings are ready. Whole plant will be up and running one year ahead of schedule\". (pages 445 - 452)\n\nThis whole chapter is dedicated to the events of autumn 1938, when following the Munich Agreement, Poland recovered Zaolzie from Czechoslovakia. Wańkowicz personally visited this province, meeting with its residents. \nThe author goes back to the mid-19th century, when Polish national awakening was initiated in the Habsburg-ruled Duchy of Teschen. Wańkowicz recalls people responsible for it, local Polish activists, such as Jerzy Cienciała, Paweł Stalmach, Reverend Franciszek Michejda, Reverend Józef Londzin. At that time, Czech national movement was non-existent in the Duchy, and main enemy of Polish activists were Germans, who banned education in the Polish language, and until 1895, there was not a single Polish school in the Duchy. First Czech activists came here in the 1890s: \"In 1918, after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, Poles were first to act. On October 31, they established a local Polish government. The Czechs did not object, and on November 5, an agreement was signed, with Zaolzie remaining in Polish hands (...) But soon afterwards, Poland became involved in other conflicts, and by early 1919, Czech envoy Karel Kramar, backed by Tomas Masaryk, changed course, saying that Czechs were victors in the war, while the Fourteen Points were only a theory\". (pages 460 - 463)\n\nThe Polish–Czechoslovak War began when on January 23, 1919, three trains with Czech infantry arrived at Ostrava. Polish forces were inadequate, as almost all local units of the Polish Army had been transported to Lwów on January 8 to fight in the Polish-Ukrainian War: \"The Czechs stated that their infantry was heading for Slovakia, but on the next day they attacked, with 14,000 soldiers and 28 cannons. We had 1,285 soldiers, 4 cannons and 35 cavalrymen (...) After a week of fighting, the Czechs failed to achieve their objectives, while Poles received reinforcements. General Franciszek Latinik had 4,600 soldiers, which was fewer than the Czechs, but enough to stop the enemy's advance in the Battle of Skoczów (...) On January 30, 1919, Poles lost 19 dead, 82 wounded and 15 captured by the enemy; the Czechs massacred them with bayonets\". (pages 463 - 467)\n\nWhen in mid-1920 Soviet offensive against Poland began, the government of Czechoslovakia prohibited all transports of weapons, so needed by Poland. On July 28, 1920, the Conference of Ambassadors accepted the temporary demarcation line as a border between the two nations: \"Our delegate, Ignacy Paderewski, while signing the decision of the Council, stated that Polish nation would never be convinced that it was a just decision, while Marshall Piłsudski told the Poles of Zaolzie: Wait, be patient. We will never renounce you (...) As soon as Czechs took control of this land, they closed down 17 Polish schools with 4,135 students, expelling 100 Polish teachers (...) The Czechs did not exert direct pressure. Instead, they used the slogan: We have jobs only for our people. So, a Pole, sending his kids to Polish school, a Pole involved in Polish associations, lost his job (...) So local Poles decided to organize themselves. At Łazy I saw the main office of a Polish association of food producers. It has its own rail track, large car park, bakery, slaughterhouse, mill, lemonade plant, 120 stores spread across three counties\". (pages 465 - 468)\nWańkowicz begins by recalling the Munich Agreement, in which German claims for Sudetenland were accepted, but there was no mention of either Polish or Hungarian claims to parts of Czechoslovakia. On the same day (Friday, September 30), a Polish aeroplane landed at Prague, with Polish claims. On the next day, the Czechs agreed to hand Zaolzie over to Poland. Wańkowicz writes about it with enthusiasm: \"Ours is Zaolzie! Ours is Cieszyn, ours is Karvina, rich in coal! Ours is Łazy, with its main office of Polish association! Ours is Bogumin, the rail heart of Central Europe, the junction along the German-dreamed route from Berlin to Baghdad! Ours is industrial Frysztat, ours is the metallurgical colossus at Trzyniec! Ours is Jabłonków, the agricultural capital of Polish Zaolzie! Ours is Końska, full of Polish activists! Ours is Darków, with its spa, ours is old Bystryca! The Olza has turned into our internal river!\" (page 473)\n\nThe author witnessed these events, giving a first-hand report. First he went to Skoczów, where headquarters of Independent Operational Group Silesia was located. He met General Władysław Bortnowski in his rail car, then went to a local restaurant to talk with Gustaw Morcinek. Next, he visited a camp in Hermanice, opened for Poles expelled by Czechs from Zaolzie. On Monday, October 3, 1938, Wańkowicz came to Cieszyn, to witness a parade of the Polish Army. On the same night, a banquet took place at Polonia Hotel in Czech Cieszyn. Next day, Wańkowicz went by car to Cierlicko, to see the spot where Polish aviators Stanisław Wigura and Franciszek Żwirko died in 1932. Next he visited Karwina and Orłowa, heading towards Ostrava, beyond new, extended borders of Poland: \"Trees lie down by bridges, ready to barricade roads, red signs along roads mark mined areas. At Ostrava, a large and modern city, we eat dinner at a restaurant full of German speakers. Our driver suddenly comes to us, telling that Czech secret police are following us. So we hastily leave the restaurant\". (pages 490 - 495)\nIn 1914 in Zaolzie, 24,000 children attended Polish schools, and only 2,320 pupils went to Czech schools. By 1938, these numbers changed, and the number of children in Polish schools shrank to 9,732. Before Polish Army units took control of this province, the retreating Czechs damaged schools, smashing furniture and stealing equipment. In late October 1938, Polish authorities began opening back schools in Zaolzie. On October 26, middle schools at Jabłonków, Bogumin, Orłowa, and Cieszyn were opened after special ceremonies: \"On my way back from Jabłonków, I stopped at Końska, visiting Agricultural High School (...) This school had been discriminated by the Czech authorities, who limited its funds to minimum (...) A few days after annexation of Zaolzie, National Insurance invited 60 girls from Trzyniec, Karwina and Frysztat to a resort hotel in Jaworze. So, I am taking Gustaw Morcinek with me, and we are going there. At the resort, 60 local girls are waiting. The two groups immediately hit it off. This comes as no surprise. After all they are from the same land, which had been divided only 20 years before. (pages 504 - 508)\nMelchior Wańkowicz describes here efforts of Polish administration, which took control of Zaolzie after its capture by the military: \"Right after Polish soldiers, a train with Polish rail workers entered the area. Then there were trucks of Poczta Polska, delivery vehicles with produce (...) I went to Karwina after Sunday service. The locals were afraid that their Czech pensions would not be honored by the Polish government. Now they know they were wrong\". (pages 510 - 514)\n\nZaolzie was far more urbanized and industrialized than the Second Polish Republic. In the fall 1938, Poland captured 18 coal mines, which increased Polish coal production by 20%. As Wańkowicz wrote, main problem for Warsaw was to find new markets for the coal and coke from Zaolzie. Furthermore, Zaolzie had the enormous Třinec Iron and Steel Works, Albert Hahn Steel Plant at Bogumin, Wire Mill at Pudłów, Jeckel Pipe and Screw Plant at Frysztat: \"Altogether, these plants manufacture 50% of Poland's output. Zaolzie coke plants manufacture 40% of Poland's output. All these factories are awaiting new markets. Half of all houses here has electricity, 80% of Zaolzie residents work in services and industry (...) Zaolzie is a great challenge, an obstacle that we have to overcome (...) We already did not know what to do with our coal, and now our production has increased by one-fifth\". (pages 516 - 527)\nThe final chapter of the book is an afterword, in which the author recalls some events from Polish history, wishing that the Poland of the future would be based on two foundations, freedom and strength.\n\n"}

The English edition was translated by Mark Lester with Charles Stivale, and edited by Constantin V. Boundas.\n\nAn exploration of meaning and meaninglessness, or \"commonsense\" and \"nonsense\", \"The Logic of Sense\" consists of a series of thirty-four paradoxes and an appendix that contains five previously published essays, including a brief overview of Deleuze's ontology entitled \"Plato and the Simulacrum\".\n\nThe book introduces Deleuze's philosophy of the event and of becoming and includes textual analyses of works by Lewis Carroll, Seneca, Pierre Klossowski, Michel Tournier, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Émile Zola and Sigmund Freud.\n\nThe philosopher Michel Foucault wrote that \"The Logic of Sense\" \"should be read as the boldest and most insolent of metaphysical treatises - on the simple condition that instead of denouncing metaphysics as the neglect of being, we force it to speak of extrabeing\". The philosopher Christopher Norris believes that, like \"Difference and Repetition\" (1968), \"The Logic of Sense\" comes as near as possible to offering a full-scale programmatic statement of Deleuze's post-philosophical, anti-systematic, ultra-nominalist or resolutely \"non-totalizing\" mode of thought.\n\nThe physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont write in \"Fashionable Nonsense\" (1997) that \"The Logic of Sense\" prefigures the style of works that Deleuze later wrote in collaboration with Félix Guattari, and that, like them, it contains passages in which Deleuze misuses technical scientific terms. Josuha Ramey describes \"The Logic of Sense\" as Deleuze's \"most sustained ethical reflection\". Timothy Laurie argues that Deleuze presents \"sense\" as wrapped up in a problematic, and that a problematic cannot be evaluated according to truth and error, nor is it ever exhausted through one single solution.\n\n"}
{"id": "14355875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14355875", "title": "The Realms of Being", "text": "The Realms of Being\n\nThe Realms of Being (1942) is the last major work by Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana. Along with \"Scepticism and Animal Faith\" and \"The Life of Reason\", it is his most notable work; the first two works concentrate primarily on epistemology and ethics respectively, whereas \"The Realms of Being\" is mainly a work in the field of ontology.\n\nSantayana builds on his \"Skepticism and Animal Faith\", which he described as a sort of precursor to \"a new system of philosophy\", that would be developed fully in the present work. He defines four realms of being; \"The Realm of Essence\", \"The Realm of Matter\", \"The Realm of Truth\", and \"The Realm of Spirit\".\n\nThe Realm of Essence, in Santayana's view, has a type of primacy over the other realms. To him, essence is anything that is or has a character—this includes thoughts, imaginings, derivations of logic, and material objects. Nothing can be experienced but through these essences, and they \"are the only things people ever see, and the last they notice.\" Essence is \"awareness\", it is different from knowledge or from \"faith\", which he defines later.\n\nMatter is the objective, material stuff of the universe. Staying true to his materialism, Santayana holds matter as the \"primordial existential flux\" and believes it can be, at least in some sense, known. His conception of matter is similar to Spinoza's substance; matter has no purpose, but constitutes the limitations of what can be. Humans can know matter only from a distance, symbolically:\n\nThus, while Santayana reveres and deeply respects science (and believes it useful for everyday experiences), he does not deify it in the way many other philosophers of the 20th century have, and he limits it to a fallible approximation of truth.\n\nThe Realm of Truth was thought of well after Santayana had thought of his other three realms; he envisions it as a sort of subdivision of the Realm of Essence. Truth is that part of the Realm of Essences instantiated by matter; indeed, he says: \n\nAs the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Santayana says:\n\nSantayana here departs from classical pragmatists, of whom he is often considered one, in that he believes truth has a strong element outside of experience, and must coincide with what actually is.\n\nSpirit is, as used by Santayana, very much akin to consciousness; it is, according to John Lachs, \"that part of a life constituted by its series of intuitions\". Santayana believes that the mind is more accustomed to essence than it is to fact, and, as such, consciousness may at times manifest things that are not fact. Herein is to be found the Realm of Spirit; it is Santayana's attempt to reconcile the theories of Plato and the demands of reason.\n\n"}

While noticeable Syro-Aramaic influence on the language of the Quran is taken as undisputed in this work, Luxenberg's thesis goes beyond mainstream scholarly consensus and was widely received with skepticism in reviews.\n\nThe work advances the thesis that critical sections of the Quran have been misread by generations of readers and Muslim and Western scholars, who consider Classical Arabic the language of the Quran. Luxenberg's analysis suggests that the prevalent Syro-Aramaic language up to the seventh century formed a stronger etymological basis for its meaning.\nA notable trait of early written Arabic was that it lacked vowel signs and diacritics which would later distinguish e.g. ب, ت, ن, ي, and thus was prone to mispronunciation. Arabic diacritics were added around the turn of the eighth century on orders of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, governor of Iraq (694–714)..\n\nLuxenberg claimed that the Quran \"contains much ambiguous and even inexplicable language.\" He asserts that even Muslim scholars find some passages difficult to parse and have written reams of Quranic commentary attempting to explain these passages. However, the assumption behind their endeavours has always been, according to him, that any difficult passage is true, meaningful, and pure Arabic, and that it can be deciphered with the tools of traditional Muslim scholarship. Luxenberg accuses Western academic scholars of the Qur'an of taking a timid and imitative approach, relying too heavily on the work of Muslim scholars.\n\nThe book's thesis is that the Quran was not originally written exclusively in Arabic but in a mixture with Syriac, the dominant spoken and written language in the Arabian peninsula through the eighth century.\nLuxenberg remarked that scholars must start afresh, ignore the old Islamic commentaries, and use only the latest in linguistic and historical methods. Hence, if a particular Quranic word or phrase seems \"meaningless\" in Arabic, or can be given meaning only by tortuous conjectures, it makes sense – he argues – to look to Syriac as well as Arabic.\n\nLuxenberg also argues that the Quran is based on earlier texts, namely Syriac lectionaries used in Christian churches of Syria, and that it was the work of several generations who adapted these texts into the Quran we know today.\n\n\n\"Plausibility\", \"judging\" and \"making sense\" of single word involves looking at occurrences of the same word in more obvious Koranic passages, and looking at Aramaic apocryphal and liturgical texts, which were carried over almost verbatim into the Koran.\n\nAccording to Luxenberg, the word \"qur'an\" (\"reading, lectionary\") is a rendition of the Aramaic word \"qeryan-a\", a book of liturgical readings, i.e. the term for a Syriac lectionary, with hymns and Biblical extracts, created for use in Christian services. \nLuxenburg cites the suggestion by Theodor Nöldeke \"that the term \"Qorān\" is not an inner-Arabic development out of the synonymous infinitive, but a borrowing from that Syriac word with a simultaneous assimilation of the type \"fuʿlān\".\"\n\nThe word houri, universally interpreted by scholars as \"white-eyed virgins\" (who will serve the faithful in Paradise; Qur'an 44:54, 52:20, 55:72, 56:22) means, according to Luxenberg, \"white grapes or raisins\". He says that many Christian descriptions of Paradise describe it as abounding in pure white grapes. This sparked much ridicule and insult from the Western press who allege that \"suicide bombers would be expecting beautiful women and getting grapes.\"\n\nThe passage in surat al-Ahzab that has usually been translated as \"seal of the prophets\" means, according to Luxenberg, \"witness\". By this reading, Muhammad is not the last of the prophets, but a witness to those prophets who came before him.\n\nThe Quranic passage in surat an-Nur, 31 is traditionally translated as saying that women \"should draw their veils over their bosoms\" (Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation, \"\"). It has been interpreted as a command for women to cover themselves, and is used in support of hijab. In Luxenberg's Syro-Aramaic reading, the verse instead commands women to \"snap their belts around their waists.\" Luxenberg argues that this is a much more plausible reading than the Arabic one. The belt was a sign of chastity in the Christian world. Also, Jesus puts on an apron before he washes the disciples' feet at the last supper.\n\nLuxenberg's book has been reviewed by\nBlois (2003),\nNeuwirth (2003)\nand following the English translation by King (2009)\n\nThe most detailed scholarly review is by Daniel King, a Syriacist at the University of Cardiff, who endorses some of Luxenberg's emendations and readings and cites other scholars who have done the same, but concludes: \n\nThe conclusion of King's article summarizes the most prominent reviews of Luxenberg's work that have been published by other scholars.\n\nThe Quran is \"the translation of a Syriac text,\" is how Angelika Neuwirth describes Luxenberg's thesis – \"The general thesis underlying his entire book thus is that the Quran is a corpus of translations and paraphrases of original Syriac texts recited in church services as elements of a lectionary.\" She considers it as \"an extremely pretentious hypothesis which is unfortunately relying on rather modest foundations.\" Neuwirth points out that Luxenberg doesn't consider the previous work in Quran studies, but \"limits himself to a very mechanistic, positivist linguistic method without caring for theoretical considerations developed in modern linguistics.\"\n\nBlois (2003) is particularly scathing, describing the book as \"not a work of scholarship but of dilettantism\" and concluding that Luxenburg's \"grasp of Syriac is limited to knowledge of dictionaries and in his Arabic he makes mistakes that are typical for the Arabs of the Middle East.\"\n\nSaleh (2011) describes Luxenberg's method as \"so idiosyncratic, so inconsistent, that it is simply impossible to keep his line of argument straight.\" He adds that according to Luxenberg, for the last two hundred years, Western scholars \"have totally misread the Qur'ān\" and that, ad hominem, no one can understand the Qur'an as \"Only he can fret out for us the Syrian skeleton of this text.\" Summing up his assessment of Luxenberg's method, he states:\nSaleh further attests that Luxenberg does not follow his own proposed rules.\n\nRichard Kroes in a review on Livius.org describes him as \"unaware of much of the other literature on the subject\" and that \"quite a few of his theories are doubtful and motivated too much by a Christian apologetic agenda.\"\n\nPatricia Crone, professor of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, in a 2008 article at opendemocracy.net refers to Luxenberg's work as \"open to so many scholarly objections\" and \"notably amateurism\".\n\n\n"}

It was published under the title The Meditative Mind in 1988.\n\nGoleman begins with an outline of the \"Visuddhimagga\" of Theravadan Buddhism.\n\nGoleman continues with a survey of eleven types of meditation including Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, Sufism, Transcendental Meditation, Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga, Indian Tantra and Kundalini Yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Zen, the teachings of Gurdjieff as expressed by P. D. Ouspensky, and the teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti.\n\nGoleman then draws some parallels between various methods, saying that they all share the goal of changing the practitioner's state of consciousness. Each method may have a different word for the \"awakened state\": sahaj samadhi, Devekut, purity of heart, baqa, jivamukti, cosmic consciousness, turiyatita, siddha, bodhisattva, mujodo no taigeu, objective consciousness, choiceless awareness, arahantship. All of them result in \"one, single point\" of concentration. All except Krishnamurti propose an explicit doctrine that the student is expected to assimilate.\n\nNext the author reviews Theravadan Buddhism's Abhidhamma which describes, in 53 categories (and in other schools of Buddhism up to 175 categories), how wholesome states of mind replace and cancel out unwholesome ones. Which traits are wholesome was distilled empirically from a survey of a large number of early Buddhists who were asked whether each trait facilitated or detracted from their meditation efforts. Goleman writes, \"Each of the unhealthy factors is opposed by a healthy factor.\"\n\nThis becomes a basis for contrast between Eastern and Western psychology. According to Goleman, Westerners study psychopathology, and the English language lacks the words needed to indicate nuances in consciousness.\n\nGoleman searches through modern Western psychology and finds Sigmund Freud failed to ever read and study Eastern texts, and that behaviorist John B. Watson bemoaned what he saw as the substitution of consciousness for soul. Goleman writes, \"For the most part, Western psychologists have been reactive against Eastern psychologies\". More in tune are parts of Gordon Allport, Erik Erikson, Ernest Becker, and Franz Alexander.\n\nGoleman finds parallels with Eastern psychologies in Plotinus and in Christian psychology in the writings of Anthony the Great, St. John of the Cross and Meister Eckhart. He finds a sympathetic ear in William James, Carl Jung, Abraham Maslow, Andras Angyal, Medard Boss, Martin Buber, Erich Fromm, and in Alan Watts, Anthony Sutich, Charles Tart and in contemporary works by Ken Wilber, Jack Engler, Daniel P. Brown, and Mark Epstein.\n\nGoleman quickly covers contemporary research on meditation and also research on relaxation. He ends with a discussion of \"how to meditate\".\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" wrote about the 1977 book:\nApple iTunes says the 1988 book is \"a comprehensive and easily accessed overview\".\n"}

This was also the beginning of Taoism in Vietnam and Buddhism in Vietnam. Confucianism was reinforced in government by the Confucian examination system in Vietnam, as well as the way family raised and taught children toward filial piety, through absolute obedience.\n\nMost research on Vietnamese philosophy is conducted by modern Vietnamese scholars. The traditional Vietnamese philosophy has been described by one biographer of Ho Chi Minh (Brocheux, 2007) as a \"perennial Sino-Vietnamese philosophy\" blending different strands of Confucianism with Buddhism and Taoism. Some researchers have found the empirical evidence of this \"blending\" and defined the socio-cultural phenomenon as \"cultural additivity\". Another, Catholic, writer (Vu, 1966) has analysed Vietnamese philosophy as constituted of \"tam tài\" (\"three body\" Heaven, Man, Earth) philosophy, yin-yang metaphysics, and agricultural philosophy.

He emphasized \"theosis\" as the main principle of Eastern Orthodox Christianity.\n\nVladimir Nicolaevich Lossky was born on 8 June (OS 26 May) 1903 in Göttingen, Germany. His father, Nikolai Lossky, was professor of philosophy in Saint Petersburg. Lossky was profoundly changed when he witnessed the trial which led to the execution of Metropolitan Benjamin of St Petersburg by the Soviets. Metropolitan Benjamin was later canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1919, he enrolled as a student in the faculty of Arts at Petrograd University; but in 1922 he and his father were exiled from Soviet Russia. From 1922 to 1926 he continued his studies at Prague and in 1927 graduated at the Sorbonne in Paris in medieval philosophy. He married Madeleine Shapiro on 4 June 1928.\n\nLossky settled in Paris in 1924. Peterson From 1942 until 1958 he was a member of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. He served as the first dean of the St. Dionysius Institute in Paris. He taught dogmatic theology and ecclesiastical history in this institute until 1953, and from 1953 to 1958 in the diocese of the patriarchate of Moscow, \"rue Pétel\" in Paris. He was a member of the Brotherhood Saint Photius and the ecumenical Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius. His best-known work is \"Essai sur la theologie mystique de l'Eglise d'orient\" (1944) (English translation, \"The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church\" (1957)).\n\nLossky died of a heart attack on 7 February 1958 in Paris.\n\nLossky's main theological concern was exegesis of mystical theology in Christian traditions. He argued in \"The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church\" (1944) that theologians of the Orthodox tradition maintained the mystical dimension of theology in a more integrated way than those of the Catholic and Reformed traditions after the East–West Schism because the latter misunderstood such Greek terms as ousia, hypostasis, theosis, and theoria. In illustration of his argument he cites the collection known as the Philokalia and John Climacus's Ladder of Divine Ascent, as well as works by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, Gregory of Nyssa, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory Nazianzen, and Gregory Palamas. Georges Florovsky termed Lossky's \"Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church\" a \"neopatristic synthesis\".\n\nThe genius of Eastern mystical theology lay, he contended, in its \"apophatic\" character, which he defined as the understanding that God is radically unknowable in human, thus philosophical, terms. Consequently, God's special revelation in Scripture must be preserved in all of its integrity by means of the distinction between the ineffable divine essence and the inaccessible nature of the Holy Trinity, on the one hand, and the positive revelation of the Trinitarian energies, on the other. \"When we speak of the Trinity in itself,\" said Lossky, \"we are confessing, in our poor and always defective human language, the mode of existence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one sole God who cannot but be Trinity, because He is the living God of Revelation, Who, though unknowable, has made Himself known, through the incarnation of the Son, to all who have received the Holy Spirit, Who proceeds from the Father and is sent into the world in the name of the incarnate Son.\" The Trinitarian processions in revelation thus produce the energies which human beings experience as grace and by which they are sanctified or \"deified\".\nIn his \"Mystical Theology\" he argued that the theologians of the undivided Church understood that theosis was above knowledge (gnosis).\n\nThis was further clarified in his work, \"Vision of God\" (or theoria). In both works Lossky also stresses the differences between Christian thinkers such as Pseudo-Dionysius and such thinkers as Plotinus and the Neoplatonists, asserting that Christianity and Neoplatonism, though they share common culture and concepts, have very different understandings of God and ontology.\n\nVladimir Lossky, like his close friend Georges Florovsky, was opposed to the sophiological theories of Sergei Bulgakov and Vladimir Soloviev. In the words of Nicholas Lossky, \"One characteristic of his theology that should be underscored, is that he was not, and always refused to be, a direct descendant of the famous Russian 'religious philosophy'.\" The term \"Russian religious philosophy\" had its origin in the works of the slavophile movement and its core concept of sobornost, which was later used and developed by Vladimir Soloviev.\n\nLossky also expressed in \"The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church\" that the Trinity is a doctrine with its technical terms rooted in Hebrew hermeneutics, Greek Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophy as well. The triune God being of one essence or being, which is reflective of mankind hypostatically, inside out. God and experience coming into the person from the external world and into the soul by the influence of the Holy Spirit. The freewill of man functioning as a means to choose good or evil and or choose God or reject God (i.e. blaspheme the Holy Spirit). Hypostasis meaning existence of God. Ousia as essence or being, is the aspect of God that is completely incomprehensible to mankind and human perception, since it is beyond created or is uncreated. The essence of God, being in the Father (primordial origin) and then given to the Son (begotten of the Father not made) and the Holy Spirit (which proceeds from the Father) both as the hands of God. Ousia as essence or being, defined as \"all that \"subsists\" by itself and which has not its being in another.\"\n\nThe concept of the Triune God being a single God in essence or Ousia (as uncreated). A single God who as Father or infinite origin is an existence, as Son or flesh is an existence and as Spirit is an existence. One God in one Father.\n\nThe Father of the Trinity is uncreated hyper-being (beyond being) in essence or ousia as such is the \"truly\" infinite, primordial or original, uncreated origin, the reality of which all things and beings originate from, as the Father Hypostasis. The Father hypostasis in using the term God is used primarily as the name for God. As the term \"God\" is interchangeable with the term \"Father\". As Jesus Christ is the Son of God, Son of the Father and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father.\n\nThe Son of God or Jesus Christ expressing the logos or perfection as the highest ideal, in the material world and God in the flesh. Christ as well, representing mankind, which he inherited from the Theotokos. Christ manifest as \"generated\" and or begotten (not made) in essence uncreated, by and from God the Father as another reality, Hypostasis of God.\n\nThe Holy Spirit himself being light, life, animation and the source of the uncreated light photomos, enlightenment and/or illumination, who proceeds or is manifest by \"procession\" from God the Father as another Hypostasis of God. The Holy Spirit and the Christ being the hands of God the Father, reaching in from the infinite into the finite (see Irenaeus).\n\nAll things that are not God are created beings or are created in their essence. Mankind possesses free will in his finite nature, mankind exists in an indeterminate world. Things as such in their subsistence, are dependent upon something other than themselves. As such divine beings (such as Angels) are created beings the origin of their being is \"ex nihilo\". All things that are not God, are created in essence or being. God as hyper-being, and or in essence uncreated can be, by way of his existences, the infinite while generating himself as a man and also be the spirit, that by procession (from him God, Father), animates life.\n\nAll three hypostasis sharing a common essence or ousia or being, which is referred to as God. The ousia of God being completely unknowable or incomprehensible to mankind since it is uncreated where as nothingness as well as mankind are created (see Nikolai Berdyaev). The energies of God the Father having the same hyper-being in that they are without cause and or uncreated (see Gregory Palamas). God's energies as uncreated and indestructible. God the Father (the Father as the monarchos) in his being is not self generated, nor generated from any other, hence the incomprehensibility of God. The Trinity having existences (hypostasis) that are comprehensible, but a being that is not created and beyond all things (including nothingness) therefore God's hyper-being (ousia) is incomprehensible. Lossky points out that God's existences can be spoken of but not his being. If one then speaks of God's essence or being as anything outside of incomprehensible, one speaks in direct contradiction to the theoria of Christianity and as such are not true theologians and are instead speaking of God through speculations, rather than experience.\n\nFor Lossky, Christian mysticism and dogmatic theology were one and the same. According to Lossky mysticism \"is\" Orthodox dogma \"par excellence\". The Christian life of prayer and worship is the foundation for dogmatic theology, and the dogma of the church help Christians in their struggle for sanctification and deification. Without dogma future generations lose the specific orthodoxy (right mind) and orthopraxis (right practice) of the Eastern Orthodox path to salvation (see soteriology).\n\n\n"}
