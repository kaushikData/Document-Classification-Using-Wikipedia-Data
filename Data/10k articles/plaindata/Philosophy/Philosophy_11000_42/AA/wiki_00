He was captured by the Peruvian government in 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment for terrorism and treason.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s Guzmán was a professor of philosophy active in left-wing politics and strongly influenced by Marxism and Maoism. He developed an ideology of armed struggle stressing the empowerment of the indigenous people. He went underground in the mid 1970s to become the sometimes idolized and mythical leader of the Shining Path movement, which began what it called \"the armed struggle\" on 17 May 1980. \n\nWhile the activity of the insurgency increased shortly after Guzmán's capture, it has declined in the years following. The movement has been criticized for its violence against peasants, trade union organizers, and elected officials, which were deemed by the group to be collaborating with the Peruvian state. Shining Path is on the U.S. Department of State's \"Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations\" list. The European Union and Peru likewise describe Shining Path as a terrorist group and it prohibits its citizens from providing funds or other forms of financial support to the group.\n\nGuzmán was born in the village of Tambo near Mollendo, a port town in the province of Islay, in the region of Arequipa, about south of Lima. He was the illegitimate son of a well-off merchant, the winner of the national lottery who had six children by three different women. Guzmán's mother, Berenice Reynoso, died when he was only five years old. \n\nFrom 1939 to 1946 Guzmán lived with his mother's family. After 1947 he lived with his father and his father's wife in the city of Arequipa, where he studied at Colegio De La Salle, a private Catholic secondary school. At the age of 19 he became a student at the Social Studies department of San Agustín National University, in Arequipa. His classmates at the university later described him as shy, disciplined, obsessive, and ascetic. Increasingly attracted by Marxism, his political thinking was influenced by the book \"Seven Essays on the Interpretation of the Peruvian Reality\" of José Carlos Mariátegui, the founder of the Communist Party of Peru.\nAt Arequipa, Guzmán completed bachelor's degrees in philosophy and law. His dissertations were entitled \"The Kantian Theory of Space\" and \"The Bourgeois Democratic State\". In 1962, Guzmán was recruited as a professor of philosophy by the rector of San Cristóbal of Huamanga University in Ayacucho, a city in the central Peruvian Andes. The rector was Dr. Efraín Morote Best, an anthropologist who some believe later became the true intellectual leader of the \"Shining Path movement.\" Encouraged by Morote, Guzmán studied Quechua, the language spoken by Peru's indigenous population, and became increasingly active in left-wing political circles. He attracted several like-minded young academics committed to bringing about revolution in Peru. Guzmán was arrested twice during the 1970s because of his participation in violent riots in the city of Arequipa against the government of presidents Velasco Alvarado and Belaunde Terry. He visited the People's Republic of China with his wife Augusta La Torre for the first time in 1965. After serving as the head of personnel for San Cristóbal of Huamanga University, Guzmán left the institution in the mid-1970s and went underground.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Peruvian Communist Party had splintered over ideological and personal disputes. Guzmán, who had taken a pro-Chinese rather than pro-Soviet line, emerged as the leader of the faction which came to be known as the \"Shining Path\" (Mariátegui wrote once: \"Marxism–Leninism is the shining path of the future\"). Guzmán adopted the \"nom de guerre\" Presidente or Comrade Gonzalo and began advocating a peasant-led revolution on the Maoist model. His followers declared Guzmán, who cultivated anonymity, to be the \"Fourth Sword of Communism\" (after Marx, Lenin, and Mao). In his political declarations, Guzmán praised Mao's development of Lenin's thesis regarding \"the role of imperialism\" in propping up the \"bourgeois capitalist system\". He claimed that imperialism ultimately \"creates disruption and is unsuccessful, and it will end up in ruins in the next 50 to 100 years\". Guzmán applied this criticism not only to U.S. imperialism, but also Soviet imperialism, to what he termed as \"social-imperialism\".\n\nIn February 1964 he married Augusta la Torre, who was instrumental in founding Sendero Illuminoso, who died under unclear circumstances in 1988. It has been rumored that she was murdered by Elena Iparraguirre, Guzmán's lover, with his complicity. Both have refused to talk about La Torre's fate since their imprisonment. In the fall of 2006, while in prison, Guzmán proposed to Iparraguirre, one of his long-time lieutenants who is also serving a life sentence in a separate prison. After fighting for the permission to marry with a hunger strike, the couple wed in late August 2010.\n\nAbout his religion, Guzmán has always been an atheist. He agreed with Karl Marx about religion as the \"opium of the people\", and viewed it as a \"social phenomena product of the exploitation and that will extinguish while exploitation finishes to be swept and a new society arise\". However, he pleaded respect for religious diversity and claimed religion would not be an obstacle for the armed struggle. \n\nThe Shining Path movement was at first largely confined to academic circles in Peruvian universities. In the late 1970s, however, the movement developed into a guerrilla group centered around Ayacucho. In May 1980, the group launched its war against the government of Peru by burning the ballot boxes in Chuschi, a village near Ayacucho, in an effort to disrupt the first democratic elections in the country since 1964. Shining Path eventually grew to control vast rural territories in central and southern Peru and achieved a presence even in the outskirts of Lima, where it staged numerous attacks. The purpose of Shining Path's campaign was to demoralize and undermine the government of Peru in order to create a situation conducive to a violent coup which would put its leaders in power. The Shining Path targeted not only the army and police, but also government employees at all levels, other leftist militants such as members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), workers who did not participate in the strikes organized by the group, peasants who cooperated with the government in any way (including by voting in democratic elections), and ordinary middle-class inhabitants of Peru's main cities. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission later estimated that the resulting conflict led to the deaths of some seventy thousand people, approximately half of them at the hands of the Shining Path and a third at the hands of the state.\n\nInitially Guzmán attempted to win over the support of citizens by punishing people they viewed as corrupt government officials and other unpopular leaders. However, Shining Path's increasingly brutal methods together with strictly imposed curfews, the prohibition of alcohol and an overall sense of insecurity and fear led to an increased popular reaction against the communist party. Eventually Guzmán's plan backfired as rural militia or \"rondas\" rallied support for the military against Shining Path. The very peasants Guzmán claimed to defend had turned against the Shining Path. This resulted in a cyclical state of violence in which Maoist guerillas embarked in ruthless punitive expeditions against Peruvian civilians living in the Andean region. In 1983, 69 people (including women and children) from the highland town of Lucanamarca were tortured and murdered by the Shining Path in what became known as the Lucanamarca massacre.\n\nGuzmán's image as a dispassionate murderer became widespread after he moved against the city of Lima. After a series of bombings and selective assassinations the whole nation was shocked in 1992 when a car bomb exploded in one of Lima's busiest commercial districts on Tarata street, thus causing many casualties and enormous material losses. To this day, Guzmán denies responsibility for the Tarata bombing by claiming that it was a \"deplorable mistake.\"\n\nThe movement promoted the writings of Guzmán, called \"Gonzalo Thought\", a new \"theoretical understanding\" that built upon Marxism, Leninism, and Maoism whereby he declared Maoism to be a \"third and higher stage of Marxism,\" having defined Maoism as \"people's war.\" In 1989, Guzmán declared that the Shining Path (which he referred to as the \"Communist Party of Peru\") had progressed from waging a people's war to waging a \"war of movements.\" He further argued that this was a step towards achieving \"strategic equilibrium\" in the near future, based on Maoist theories of waging people's war. Guzmán claimed that such an equilibrium would manifest itself by ungovernability under the \"old order.\" When that moment arrived, Guzmán believed that Shining Path would be ready to move on to its \"strategic offensive\".\n\nTheodore Dalrymple an English right-wing intellectual has written that \"the worst brutality I ever saw was that committed by Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) in Peru, in the days when it seemed possible that it might come to power. If it had, I think its massacres would have dwarfed those of the Khmer Rouge. As a doctor, I am accustomed to unpleasant sights, but nothing prepared me for what I saw in Ayacucho, where Sendero first developed under the sway of a professor of philosophy, Abimael Guzmán.\"\n\nIn 1992, during the first administration of President Alberto Fujimori, the National Directorate Against Terrorism (DIRCOTE) began casing several residences in Lima because agents suspected that terrorists were using them as safehouses. One of those residences, in the upper-class neighborhood of Surco, had been operating as a ballet studio. The DIRCOTE operatives routinely searched the garbage taken out from the house. The house was supposedly inhabited by only one person, the dance teacher Maritza Garrido Lecca, but it was soon noticed that the household produced more garbage than one person could account for. Furthermore, agents found discarded tubes of cream for the treatment of psoriasis, an ailment that Guzmán was known to have. On September 12, 1992, an elite unit of the DIRCOTE raided the Surco residence. On the second floor of the house, they found and arrested Guzmán and eight others, including Laura Zambrano and Elena Iparraguirre, Guzmán's female companion.\n\nAt the time of capture, the police seized Guzmán's computer, in which they found a very detailed register of his armed forces and the weapons each regiment, militia and support base had in each region of the country. Guzmán had recorded that, in 1990, the Shining Path had 23,430 members armed with approximately 235 revolvers, 500 rifles and 300 other items of military hardware such as grenades. The Shining Path remained active after Guzman's arrest.\n\nGuzmán was tried by a court of hooded military judges under provisions of articles 15 and 16 of Law 25475 adopted by Fujimori's government in May 1992 after April's constitutional crisis. The reason for this was to protect the judges' lives, as Shining Path was known for brutal retaliation against judges who convicted their members. After a three-day trial, Guzmán was sentenced to life imprisonment and incarcerated at the naval base on the island of San Lorenzo off the coast of Lima.\n\nSubsequently, he is said to have negotiated with a presidential advisor at the time, Vladimiro Montesinos, in order to receive some benefits in exchange for helping the Peruvian government put an end to the Shining Path's militant activities. Guzmán appeared several times on Peruvian television and on October 1, 1993, he publicly declared \"peace\" with the Peruvian government. This declaration split the Shining Path and raised questions about the organization's future. About 6,000 guerrillas within the party accepted it as a sign of defeat and surrendered. Others held that it was either a forgery or an insincere statement made under duress.\nAlthough there is little doubt that Guzmán was indeed the leader of the Shining Path, more than 5,000 individuals presented an appeal to Peru's Constitutional Court in 2003 asking that the verdicts against more than 1,800 prisoners convicted of terrorism, including Guzmán, be voided. The court agreed, declaring that the military trials had been unconstitutional and ordering new trials before civilian courts. The new trials began in 2003. Since then, more than 400 prisoners who had been found guilty by military courts have been freed.\n\nGuzmán's re-trial began on 5 November 2004. The international press was held in a sound-proof chamber and all media was banned from observing the trial after the Shining Path cadre turned their backs on the judges and delivered a revolutionary salute to the media gallery. The only words Guzmán spoke in the presence of the international press were \"Long live the Communist Party of Peru! Glory to Marxism–Leninism–Maoism! Glory to the Peruvian people! Long live the heroes of the people’s war!\" After he made this statement, the courtroom microphones were silenced and the press was unable to hear any of the proceedings that followed. When the trial resumed on 12 November, no reporters were allowed to observe the proceedings. Eventually two of the judges recused themselves and the trial ended in chaos. Guzmán's third trial began in September 2005 and was opened and closed amid a media blackout. No reporters were allowed to attend. On 13 October 2006, Guzmán was sentenced to life in prison on charges of aggravated terrorism and murder. At his sentencing, three judges read the charges in a verdict that lasted more than six hours.\n\nIn 2014, Guzmán and his wife Iparraguirre were tried again, for the 1992 Tarata bombing in Lima in which 25 people died. On 11 September 2018, he was sentenced to a second life term in prison.\n\nGuzmán is currently incarcerated in the maximum security prison of the naval base of Callao, the port of Lima. Fellow prisoners there include Víctor Polay, leader of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and, ironically, Vladimiro Montesinos, the former head of the National Intelligence Service who supervised the construction of the prison and served under the (now also imprisoned) President Alberto Fujimori.\n\nThe 1995 novel \"The Dancer Upstairs\" and the 2002 film of the same title are loosely based on Guzmán's capture when living in the house of dance teacher Maritza Garrido Lecca in Lima.\n\n"}

He is mentioned by no other ancient writer but Cicero.

{"id": "1784446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1784446", "title": "Apophasis", "text": "Apophasis\n\nApophasis (; Greek: ἀπόφασις from ἀπόφημι \"apophemi\", \"to say no\") is a rhetorical device wherein the speaker or writer brings up a subject by either denying it, or denying that it should be brought up. Accordingly, it can be seen as a rhetorical relative of irony.\n\nThe device is also called paralipsis (παράλειψις) – also spelled paraleipsis or paralepsis – or occupatio, and known also as praeteritio, preterition, or parasiopesis (παρασιώπησις).\n\nAs a rhetorical device, apophasis can serve a number of purposes.\n\nIt can be employed to raise an \"ad hominem\" or otherwise controversial attack while disclaiming responsibility for it, as in, \"I refuse to discuss the rumor that my opponent is a drunk.\" This can make it a favored tactic in politics.\n\nApophasis can be used passive-aggressively, as in, \"I forgive you for your jealousy, so I won't even mention what a betrayal it was.\"\n\nIn Cicero's \"Pro Caelio\" speech, he says to a prosecutor, \"Obliviscor iam iniurias tuas, Clodia, depono memoriam doloris mei\" (\"I now forget your wrongs, Clodia, I set aside the memory of my pain [that you caused].\")\n\nApophasis can be used to discuss a taboo subject, as in, \"We are all fully loyal to the emperor, so we wouldn't dare to claim that his new clothes are a transparent hoax.\"\n\nAs a rhetorical device, it can serve various purposes, often dependent on the relationship of the speaker to the addressee and the extent of their shared knowledge. Apophasis is rarely literal; instead, it conveys meaning through implications that may depend on this context. As an example of how meaning shifts, the English phrase \"needless to say\" invokes shared understanding, but its actual meaning depends on whether that understanding was really shared. The speaker is alleging that it is not necessary to say something because the addressee already knows it, but is it so? If it is, it may merely emphasize a pertinent fact. If the knowledge is weighted with history, it may be an indirect way of levying an accusation (\"needless to say, \"because you are responsible\"\"). If the addressee does not actually already possess the knowledge, it may be a way to condescend: the speaker suspected as much but wanted to call attention to the addressee's ignorance. Conversely, it could be a sincere and polite way to share necessary information that the addressee may or may not know \"without\" implying that the addressee is ignorant.\n\nApophasis can serve to politely avoid suggestion of ignorance on the part of an audience, as found in the narrative style of Adso of Melk in Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", where the character fills in details of early fourteenth-century history for the reader by stating it is unnecessary to speak of them. Conversely, the same introduction can be made sarcastically to condescend to an audience and imply their ignorance.\n\nAnother diplomatic use would be to raise a criticism indirectly, as in, \"It would be out of line for me to say that this action would be unwise and unaffordable, sir, as I only care about your best interests.\"\n\nWhen apophasis is taken to its extreme, the speaker provides full details, stating or drawing attention to something in the very act of pretending to pass it over: \"I will not stoop to mentioning the occasion last winter when our esteemed opponent was found asleep in an alleyway with an empty bottle of vodka still pressed to his lips.\"\n\nIn the 1984 U.S. presidential campaign debates, Ronald Reagan used a humorous apophasis to deflect scrutiny of his own fitness at age 73 by replying, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" In 1988, he applied a harsher apophasis toward George H.W. Bush's opponent Michael Dukakis, who was rumored to have received psychological treatment, \"Look, I'm not going to pick on an invalid.\"\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump frequently employs apophasis. In 2015, Trump said of fellow Republican presidential candidate and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, \"I promised I would not say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground, that she laid off tens of thousands of people and she got viciously fired. I said I will not say it, so I will not say it.\" In 2016, he tweeted of journalist Megyn Kelly, “I refuse to call [her] a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct.\" In 2017, as president, he tweeted of the leader of North Korea, \"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?'\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4769089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4769089", "title": "Baby Doe Law", "text": "Baby Doe Law\n\nThe Baby Doe Law or Baby Doe Amendment is the name of an amendment to the Child Abuse Law passed in 1984 in the United States that sets forth specific criteria and guidelines for the treatment of seriously ill and/or disabled newborns, regardless of the wishes of the parents. \n\nThe Baby Doe Law mandates that states receiving federal money for child abuse programs develop procedures to report medical neglect, which the law defines as the withholding of treatment unless a baby is irreversibly comatose or the treatment for the newborn's survival is \"virtually futile.\" Assessments of a child's quality of life are not valid reasons for withholding medical care.\n\nThe law came about as a result of several widely publicized cases involving the deaths of disabled newborns. The parents of these children withheld standard medical treatment for correctable gastrointestinal birth defects, sometimes leading to their deaths. \n\nThe primary case was a 1982 incident involving \"Baby Doe\", a Bloomington, Indiana, baby with Down syndrome whose parents declined surgery to fix esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, leading to the baby's death. The Surgeon General of the United States, at the time of this incident, Doctor C. Everett Koop, argued the boy was denied treatment (and food and water) not because the treatment was unreasonably risky but rather because he was intellectually disabled. Koop commented publicly that he disagreed with such withholding of treatment. In his decades as a pediatric surgeon, Koop had repaired hundreds of such defects, with a continually improving rate of success. By 1982, success was nearly certain if the surgery was performed. \n\nA somewhat similar situation in 1983 involving a \"Baby Jane Doe\" again brought the issue of withholding treatment for newborns with disabilities to public attention. In this case, the parents and doctors had decided not to perform surgery on a baby with a birth defect affecting the spine and brain. \n\nBaby Jane Doe was born on October 11, 1983, in New York City, with an open spinal column, (meningomyelocele), hydrocephaly and microcephaly. Surgical closure of the defect and reduction of fluid from her brain was expected to prolong her life – perhaps extending her life from age 2 without the surgery, to age 20 with it – but she was still expected to be bedridden and paralyzed, to have epilepsy and kidney damage, and to have severe brain damage. The parents, who were Roman Catholic Christians, consulted medical specialists, clergy, and social workers to decide what to do. They chose conservative management with nutrition, antibiotics, and bandages, rather than invasive surgery to close the hole in her spine.\n\nVermont attorney and right-to-life advocate Lawrence Washburn brought suit in New York to obtain guardianship and an order to have the surgery performed. After an initial win in court, in which a justice of the New York Supreme Court found that her life was in \"imminent danger\", another person was appointed as her guardian, and the surgery was ordered, Washburn lost his case on appeal. He then filed another in federal court. The parents, at this point, had accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in legal debts.\n\nAlso, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) received a complaint that Baby Jane Doe was being denied aggressive medical treatment. The HHS referred the case to New York's Child Protective Services, which on November 7 found no merit to the complaint. The HHS also obtained copies of the infant's medical records for her first week of life, which were reviewed by Koop, who stated that he did not see anything in the record that would exclude the child from surgery. HHS took the stance that Baby Jane Doe was being discriminated against due to her medical conditions and mental retardation. HHS repeatedly requested copies of the infant's medical records (past October 19) under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nIn early November, HHS brought suit against the hospital to the US District Court. The court concluded that the hospital was not in violation of section 504, and that the hospital treatment plan for the infant was based on the parents' decision to withhold surgery, not on discrimination. The court also found the parents' decision was \"reasonable\" based on the \"medical options available and genuine concern for the best interests of the child.\" The Court of Appeals ruled that the Rehabilitation Act did not give HHS any ability to interfere with the \"treatment decisions involving defective newborn infants\".\n\nDuring the protracted court battles, Baby Jane's parents consented to some surgery for their daughter. The hole in her spine closed naturally, without surgery. Baby Jane survived beyond anyone's expectations. She has some intellectually and other disabilities, such as kidney damage and the need to use a wheelchair, but she talks and interacts with people and lives in a group home. She celebrated her 30th birthday with her family in 2013. \n\nKoop's efforts to educate the United States Congress about this issue ultimately led to the Baby Doe Amendment (U.S.C.A. TITLE 42, CHAPTER 67, Sec. 5106a). On October 9, 1984, the amendment extended the laws defining child abuse to include the withholding of fluids, food, and medically indicated treatment from disabled children. The law went into effect on June 1, 1985.\n\nIn 1986, the regulations were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that the autonomy of the states had been violated and that the Rehabilitation Act did not apply to the medical care of handicapped infants.\n\nIn order to enforce the regulations laid out in the Baby Doe Law, telephone hot lines were set up around the country and the federal government encouraged anonymous reporting of alleged child abuse (specifically, the withholding of medical care to seriously ill newborns). The hotlines were discontinued, however, as they resulted in the frequent intrusion of federal investigators into hospitals, often without warrant or without finding actual abuse.\n\nThe following text is found under the eligibility requirements for federal funding in U.S.C.A.

{"id": "43980531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43980531", "title": "Book of Elchasai", "text": "Book of Elchasai\n\nThe Book of Elchasai or the Book of Elxai is a lost prophetic book, written during the reign of Trajan, that contained laws and apocalyptic prophecies pertaining to Jewish Christian and Gnostic doctrines. It is known only from fragments quoted in the early Christian writings of Hippolytus of Rome, Eusebius, Epiphanius of Salamis, and Origen. The book was used by a number of Transjordanian sects, including Ebionites, Essenes, Nazarenes, and especially by Elcesaites whom based their origins from.\n\nAccording to Hippolytus's \"Refutation of All Heresies\", the Book of Elchasai was the source of a number of Elcesaite beliefs and practices. It encourages following the Law (including circumcision), as well as ascetic practices. Sexual desire is presented as wickedness, but a sin that could be cured through baptism. The book uses numbers and measures to foretell the future and further advocates healing rituals, as well as following a schedule based on astrology. The universe is held to be governed by principles created by God, who is called \"the great and most high God\". God's son (Christ, also called \"the mighty king\") along with the Holy Spirit (who is female) are depicted as angels of enormous size. Christ is held to have lived on earth repeatedly through reincarnation, sometimes arriving through virgin births. However, Jesus is taught to have been conceived naturally. Seven witnesses are called to confirm the teachings of Elchasai. The book is also apocalyptic, expatiating on an impending crisis.\n\nThe Book of Elchasai was written around the Parthian War of 114-117 AD in Aramaic by a Mesopotamian Jew. The purpose of the book may have been to bring comfort to Jews surviving the massacre during the war. The book describes angelic beings of \"stupendous\" size and their announcement of universal destruction. These beings revealed the requirements which would allow absolution on the judgment day. Similar enormous angels are also described in 3 Enoch such as Metatron, but Elchasai is particularly describing Christ and the Holy Spirit. The book contains a prediction of a war among wicked angels. Over hundred years later, a Hellenistic version of this manuscript was used by Syrian Judeo-Christians. Epiphananius considered this book heretical.\n\nAlcibiades of Apamea was described by Hippolytus as a \"strange demon\" having possession of this book of revelations. Hippolytus refuted Alcibiades claims that the book was \"a secret writing\" and those who listened to the message of the book would receive remission of all their sins. The actual contents of the book were only revealed to converts, those who are willing to follow Alcibiades.\n\nElchasai is considered to be a historical figure. The Kitāb al-Fihrist references a manuscript, written by Muslim scholar Ibn al-Nadim in which he identifies Elchasai instituting the Babylonian baptists sect of \"Mughtasilah\" (practitioners of ablution) or \"katharioi\". This sect was based upon the revelations that he had in his twenties.

It is free for use with Windows, and previous versions are available for UNIX. It is an interactive program for image processing and computer vision.\n\nCVIPtools can read many image formats including TIFF, PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, as well as raw formats. CVIPtools supports standard image processing functions such as image compression, image restoration, logical and arithmetical operations between images, contrast manipulation, image sharpening, Frequency transform, edge detection, segmentation and geometric transformations.\nThe Computer Vision and Image Processing Algorithm Test and Analysis Tool, CVIP-ATAT, was created to facilitate the development of both human and computer vision applications. The primary function of this tool is to allow the user to explore many more algorithmic possibilities than can be considered by processing one image at a time with CVIPtools. It allows for the automatic processing of large image sets with many different algorithmic and parameter variations. We call this the \"front-end\" tool because its primary purpose is to find the best algorithm to preprocess, segment and post-process a set of images for a particular application in order to best separate the most important regions of interest within the image.\n\nIt has a GUI which allows the user to enter multi-stage algorithms for testing and analysis. At each stage the user can specify a number of different processes to test and a range for the processes' parameters. The user also specifies a set of images to process and a set of \"ideal\" output images which will be used to determine the success for each algorithm. Note that one algorithm is defined as a specific set of processes and a specific set of parameter values.\n\ntool will then automatically perform algorithms which consist of all the permutations of the values for each of the parameters for each process and all the processes for each stage. Next, the user can compare the various algorithm results to determine the best set of processes and parameters for the particular application. The tool is useful for application development where the ideal image results are available, or can be created. Additionally, it can serve as a front end development tool for image analysis to find the optimal set of processes and parameters for extracting regions of interest for further processing.\n\nThe Computer Vision and Image Processing Feature Extraction and Pattern Classification Tool, CVIP-FEPC, was created to facilitate the development of both human and computer vision applications. The primary application area is computer vision, but it can be used, for example, as an aid in the development of image compression schemes for human vision applications. This can be done by helping to determine salient image features that must be retained for a given compression scheme. Conversely, computer vision applications are essentially deployed image analysis systems for a specific application, so the feature extraction and pattern classification is an integral part of all computer vision systems.\n\nThe primary function of this tool is to explore feature extraction and pattern classification and allow the user to perform batch processing with large image sets and is thus much more efficient than processing one image at a time with CVIPtools. It allows the user to select the features and pattern classification parameters for the automatic processing of these large image sets. CVIP-FEPC enables the user to easily specify the training and test sets and run multiple experiments in an efficient manner. Its primary purpose is to find the best parameters for a particular application in order to best classify the image objects of interest.\n\nThis tool is designed to work with a set of images that have binary masks that have been created for the objects of interest – one object per image. These masks can be created manually with CVIPtools, or, many image database applications will have the masks available. In general, the user will load the images, specify the classes, select the features, select the test set, choose the pattern classification parameters and then let the program process the entire image set. An output file will be created with the results for the experiment.\n\nThe CVIP Toolbox for Matlab can perform various functions: 1) Arithmetic and logic, 2) Band, 3) Color, 4) Conversion of image files, 5) Edge/Line detection, 6) Geometry, 7) Histogram, 8) Mapping, 9) Morphological, 10) Noise, 11) Objective fidelity metrics, 12) Pattern classification: classification algorithms, 13) Pattern classification: feature extraction, 14) Pattern classification: normalization methods, 15) Segmentation, 16) Spatial filters: adaptive filters, 17) Spatial filters: mean filters, 18) Spatial filters: miscellaneous, 19) Spatial filters: order filters, 20) Transform, 21) Transform filters: standard, and 22) Transform filters: restoration. The CVIP Toolbox includes a CVIPlab skeleton program, similar to the CVIPlab for the C/C++ programmer, and a utility function for batch processing. .\n"}

In order to focus more closely on their theoretical differences (and similarities), they decided to produce a book in which all three would contribute three essays each, with the authors' respective second and third essays responding to the points of dispute raised by the earlier essays. In this way, the book is structured in three \"cycles\" of three essays each, with points of dispute and lines of argumentation developed, passed back and forward, and so on.\n\nAt one point in the exchange, Butler refers to the exercise as an unintentional \"comedy of formalisms\" (137), with each writer accusing the other two of being too abstract and formalist in relation to the declared themes of contingency, hegemony, and universality. At the heart of these themes is a desire to address the question of particularism and political emancipation. For example, while Žižek holds the notion of capitalism as a structure that enables various particular political claims, Butler and Laclau stress that all politics can be conceptualized in terms of a hegemonic struggle, which rejects the notion of any primary structure, such as capitalism or patriarchy.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He obtained his BA in philosophy in 1991, his MA in 1994, and his PhD in 2000 – for a thesis entitled \"Empathy and Rationality in Ethics\" – from the University of Toronto.\n\nHe fulfilled an Advisory Research Committee Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Queen's University (2001-2002), held a fellowship at the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics (2007–2011), and a research fellowship at the University of Vienna (2011 to present). Most of his work is related to animal rights.\n\nSztybel has developed a new theory of animal rights which he terms \"best caring\", as outlined in his paper \"The Rights of Animal Persons\". Criticizing conventional theories of rights based on intuition, traditionalism or common sense, compassion, Immanuel Kant's theory, John Rawls' theory, and Alan Gewirth's theory, Sztybel devises a new theory of rights for human and nonhuman animals. Sztybel bases his theory, in part, on the idea that sentient beings are ends-in-themselves, a theory of emotional cognition which verifies that some things really are good or bad for sentient beings. This is a non-utilitarian or \"individuals-respecting\" theory that defends the proposition that all sentient beings should be legally recognized as persons.\n\nHe is critical of utilitarianism and the traditional feminist ethics of care. He also takes issue with the traditional notion of animal welfare, which supports the use of animals if steps are taken to avoid \"unnecessary\" suffering, the parameters of which vary. Sztybel argues that we would never call the same treatment of humans, mentally disabled or otherwise, to be consistent with their welfare. He coined the term \"animal illfare\" to describe conventional animal treatment. He holds that true animal welfare would only entail wishing animals good (never anything avoidably malicious). He supports that fully realized substantial animal rights correspond to a significant respect for all sentient beings.\n\nSztybel contends that Singer's philosophy of animal liberation is not really about liberating animals in general; he accuses Singer of being a speciesist for defending the vivisection of animals on the ground that they have inferior cognitive capacities. In so doing, Singer is effectively sanctioning the harmful treatment of nonhuman animals on the basis of a species-characteristic which does not justify violent treatment.\n\nHe also provides a critique of the abolitionist views of Gary L. Francione and Joan Dunayer, who argue that animal rights supporters should not pursue a welfarist approach. A defense of suffering-reduction laws and a discussion of the logical problems of anti-welfarism are featured in Sztybel's article \"Animal Rights Law: Fundamentalism versus Pragmatism\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1893748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1893748", "title": "Dharmakirti", "text": "Dharmakirti\n\nDharmakīrti (fl. c. 6th or 7th century) was an influential Indian Buddhist philosopher who worked at Nālandā. He was one of the key scholars of epistemology (pramana) in Buddhist philosophy, and is associated with the Yogācāra and Sautrāntika schools. He was also one of the primary theorists of Buddhist atomism. His works influenced the scholars of Mīmāṃsā, Nyaya and Shaivism schools of Hindu philosophy as well as scholars of Jainism.\n\nDharmakīrti's \"Pramāṇavārttika\", his largest and most important work, was very influential in India and Tibet as a central text on pramana ('valid knowledge instruments') and was widely commented on by various Indian and Tibetan scholars. His texts remain part of studies in the monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nLittle is known for certain about the life of Dharmakirti. Tibetan hagiographies suggest he was a Brahmin born in South India and was the nephew of the Mīmāṃsā scholar Kumārila Bhaṭṭa. When he was young, Kumārila spoke abusively towards Dharmakirti as he was taking his brahminical garments. This led Dharmakirti to take the robes of the Buddhist order instead, resolving to \"vanquish all the heretics.\" As a student of Buddhism, he first studied under Isvarasena, and later moved to Nalanda where he interacted with 6th century Dharmapala. However, the accuracy of the Tibetan hagiographies is uncertain, and scholars place him in the 7th-century instead. This is because of inconsistencies in different Tibetan and Chinese texts, and because it is around the middle of 7th-century, and thereafter, that Indian texts begin discussing his ideas, such as the citation of Dharmakirti verses in the works of Adi Shankara. Dharmakīrti is placed by most scholars to have lived between 600–660 CE, but a few place him earlier.\n\nDharmakirti is credited with building upon the work of Dignāga, the pioneer of Buddhist logic, and Dharmakirti has ever since been influential in the Buddhist tradition. His theories became normative in Tibet and are studied to this day as a part of the basic monastic curriculum.\n\nDharmakirti worked at Nalanda as a lay Buddhist, not as an ordained monk, and his work reflects his belief that no one will understand the value of his work, his efforts soon forgotten. History proved his fears wrong.\n\nThe Buddhist works such as the \"Yogacarabhumi-sastra\" and the \"Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra\" composed before the 6th century, on \"hetuvidyā\" (logic, dialectics) are unsystematic, whose approach and structure are heresiological, proselytical and apologetic. Their aims were to defeat non-Buddhist opponents (Hinduism, Jainism, Ājīvikism, others), defend the ideas of Buddhism, develop a line of arguments that monks can use to convert those who doubt Buddhism and to strengthen the faith of Buddhists who begin to develop doubts. Around the middle of the 6th century, possibly to address the polemics of non-Buddhist traditions with their pramana foundations, the Buddhist scholar Dignāga shifted the emphasis from dialectics to more systematic epistemology and logic, retaining the heresiological and apologetic focus. Dharmakīrti followed in Dignāga footsteps, and is credited with systematic philosophical doctrines on Buddhist epistemology, which Vincent Eltschinger states, has \"a full-fledged positive/direct apologetic commitment\". Dharmakīrti lived during the collapse of the Gupta Empire, a time of great insecurity for Buddhist institutions. The role of Buddhist logic was seen as an intellectual defense against Hindu philosophical arguments formulated by epistemically sophisticated traditions like the Nyaya school. However, Dharmakīrti and his followers also held that the study of reasoning and its application was an important tool for soteriological ends.\n\nDharmakīrti's philosophy is based on the need to establish a theory of logical validity and certainty grounded in causality. Following Dignāga's \"Pramāṇasamuccaya\", Dharmakīrti also holds that there are only two instruments of knowledge or 'valid cognition' (\"pramāṇa\"); \"perception\" (pratyaksa) and \"inference\" (anumāṇa). Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual. In the \"Pramāṇavārttika\" Dharmakīrti defines a pramana as a \"reliable cognition\". What it means for a cognition to be reliable has been interpreted in different ways. Following commentators like Dharmottara, who define it as meaning that a cognition is able to lead to the obtaining of one's desired object, some modern scholars such as Jose I. Cabezon have interpreted Dharmakīrti as defending a form of Pragmatism. Tillemans sees him as holding to a weak form of correspondence theory, which holds that to \"confirm causal efficacy\" (\"arthakriyāsthiti\") is to have a justification that an object of cognition has the causal powers we expected. That justification comes through a certain kind of non-conceptual perception (\"pratyakṣa\") which is said to be an \"intrinsical source of knowledge\" (\"svataḥ prāmāṇya\") which is ultimately reliable. Dharmakīrti sees a cognition as being valid if it has a causal connection with the object of cognition through an intrinsically valid, un-conceptual perception of the object which does not err regarding its functionality. As Dharmakirti says: \"A pramāṇa is a reliable cognition. [As for] reliability, it consists in [this cognition’s] compliance with [the object’s capacity to] perform a function\" (\"Pramāṇavārttika\" 2.1ac).\n\nDharmakīrti also holds that there were certain extraordinary epistemic warrants, such as the words of the Buddha, who was said to be a authoritative/reliable person (\"pramāṇapuruṣa\") as well as the 'inconceivable' perception of a yogi (\"yogipratyakṣa\"). On the role of scriptural authority, Dharmakīrti has a moderate and nuanced position. For Dharmakīrti, scripture (Buddhist or otherwise) is not a genuine and independent mean of valid cognition. He held that one should not use scripture to guide one on matters which can be decided by factual and rational means and that one is not to be faulted for rejecting unreasonable parts of the scriptures of one's school. However scripture is to be relied upon when dealing with \"radically inaccessible things\", such as the laws of karma and soteriology. However according to Dharmakīrti scripture is a fallible source of knowledge and has no claim to certainty. \n\nAccording to Buddhologist Tom Tillemans, Dharmakīrti's ideas constitute a nominalist philosophy which disagrees with the Madhyamaka philosophy, by asserting that some entities are real. Dharmakīrti states that the real is only the momentarily existing particulars (\"svalakṣaṇa\"), and any universal (\"sāmānyalakṣaṇa\") is unreal and a fiction. He criticized the Nyaya theory of universals by arguing that since they have no causal efficacy, there is no rational reason to posit them. What is real must have powers (\"śakti\"), fitness (\"yogyatā\") or causal properties which is what individuates a real particular as an object of perception. Dharmakīrti writes \"whatever has causal powers (\"arthakriyāsamartha\"), that really exists (\"paramārthasat\").\" This theory of causal properties has been interpreted as a form of trope theory. \"Svalakṣaṇa\" are said to be part-less, undivided and property-less, and yet they impart a causal force which give rise to perceptual cognitions, which are direct reflections of the particulars. \n\nDharmakīrti's ultimately real (\"paramārthasat\") particulars are contrasted with conventionally real entities (\"saṃvṛtisat\") as part of his presentation of the Buddhist Two truths doctrine. The conventionally real for him are based on linguistic categories, intellectual constructs and erroneous superimpositions on the flow of reality, such as the idea that universals exist. According to Dharmakīrti, cognitive distortion of the direct perception of particulars occurs during the process of recognition (\"pratyabhijñāna\") and perceptual judgment (\"niścaya\") which arises due to latent tendencies (\"vāsanā\") in the mind left over from past impressions of similar perceptions. These latent dispositions come together into constructed representations of the previously experienced object at the moment of perception, and hence it is an imposed error on the real, a pseudo-perception (\"pratyakṣābhāsa\") which conceals (\"saṃvṛti\") reality while at the same time being practically useful for navigating it. Ignorance (\"avidyā\") for Dharmakīrti is conceptuality, pseudo-perception and superimposition overlaid on the naturally radiant (\"prabhāsvara\") nature of pure perception. By correcting these defilements of perception through mental cultivation as well as using inference to gain \"insight born of (rational) reflection\" (\"cintāmayī prajñā\") a Buddhist yogi is able to better see the true nature of reality until his perception is fully perfected. \n\nDharmakīrti, again following Dignāga, also holds that that things as they are in themselves are “ineffable” (\"avyapadeśya\"). Language is never about the things in themselves, only about conceptual fictions, hence they are nominalists. Due to this theory, the main issue for Dharmakirti becomes how to explain that it is possible for our arbitrary and conventional linguistic schemas to refer to perceptual particulars which are ineffable and non conceptual. To explain this gap between conceptual schema and perceptual content, Dharmakirti takes up Dignaga's theory of \"exclusion\" (\"apoha\"). Dignāga's view is that \"a word talks about entities only as they are qualified by the negation of other things.\" Dharmakīrti's unique take on this nominalist theory, which underlies his entire system, is to reinterpret it in terms of causal efficacy—\"arthakriyā\" (which can also be translated as 'telic function', 'functionality', and 'fulfillment of purpose').\n\nDharmakīrti developed his philosophical system to defend Buddhist doctrines, so it is no surprise that he developed a number of arguments for rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the authority of the Buddha, karma, anatta and compassion as well as attacking Brahminical views such as the authority of the Vedas. \n\nDharmakīrti also defended the Buddhist theory of momentariness (\"kṣaṇikatva\"), which held that dharmas spontaneously perish the moment they arise. Dharmakīrti came up with an argument for the theory which stated that since anything that really exists has a causal power, the fact that its causal power is in effect proves it is always changing. For Dharmakīrti, nothing could be a cause while remaining the same, and any permanent thing would be causally inert.\n\nDharmakīrti defends Dignāga's theory of consciousness being non-conceptually reflexive (\"svasamvitti\" or \"svasaṃvedana\"). This is the idea that an act of intentional consciousness is also aware of itself as aware. Consciousness is said to illuminate itself like a lamp that illuminates objects in a room as well as itself. Dharmakīrti also defends the Yogācāra theory of \"awareness-only\" (\"vijñaptimātratā\"), which held that 'external objects' of perception do not exist. According to Dharmakīrti, an object of cognition is not external or separate from the act of cognition itself. This is because the object is \"necessarily experienced simultaneously with the cognition [itself]\" (\"Pramāṇavārttika\" 3.387). The view that there is a duality (\"dvaya\") between an object (\"grāhya\") and a subjective cognition (\"grāhaka\") arises out of ignorance.\n\nDharmakīrti's \"Substantiation of Other Mindstreams\" (\"Saṃtānāntarasiddhi\") is a treatise on the nature of the mindstream and Buddhist response to the problem of other minds Dharmakirti held the mindstream to be beginning-less yet also described the mindstream as a temporal sequence, and that as there are no true beginnings, there are no true endings, hence, the \"beginningless time\" motif that is frequently used to describe the concept of mindstream.\n\nThere is disagreement among Indian and Tibetan doxographers as to how to categorise Dharmakīrti's thought. The Gelug school asserts that he expressed Yogācāra views, most non-Gelug Tibetan commentators assert that he expressed Sautrāntika views and, according to one Tibetan source, a number of renowned later Indian Madhyamikas asserted that he expressed Madhyamaka views. \n\nAmong modern scholars, some like Tillemans argue that Dharmakīrti represented the Yogācāra school, while Amar Singh argues that he was a Sautrāntika. For Christine Mullikin Keyt, Dharmakīrti represents a \"synthesis of two schools of Indian Buddhism, the Sautrantika and the Yogacara.\" Likewise, Dan Arnold argues that Dharmakīrti's alternating philosophical perspectives of Sautrāntika and Yogācāra views are ultimately compatible and are applied at different levels of his ‘sliding scale of analysis.’\n\nThere is also a tendency to see Dignāga and Dharmakīrti as founding a new type of Buddhist school or tradition, which is known in Tibetan as \"those who follow reasoning\" (\"rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba\") and sometimes is known in modern literature as \"pramāṇavāda\".\n\nDharmakīrti is credited with the following major works:\n\n\nThere are various commentaries by later thinkers on Dharmakīrti, the earliest commentators are the Indian scholars Devendrabuddhi (ca. 675 C E.) and Sakyabuddhi (ca. 700 C.E.). Other Indian commentators include Karṇakagomin, Prajñākaragupta, Manorathanandin, Ravigupta and Śaṅkaranandana.\n\nHe was extremely influential in Tibet, where Phya pa Chos kyi Seng ge (1182-1251) wrote the first summary of his works, called \"Clearing of Mental Obscuration with Respect to the\nSeven Treatises on Valid Cognition\" (\"tshad ma sde bdun yid gi mun sel\"). Sakya Pandita wrote the \"Treasure on the Science of Valid Cognition\" (\"tshad ma rigs gter\") and interpreted Dharmakirti as an anti-realist against Phya pa's realism. These two main interpretations of Dharmakīrti became the foundation for most debates in Tibetan epistemology.\n\n\n"}

The English word \"disinformation\" is a loan translation of the Russian \"dezinformatsiya\", derived from the title of a KGB black propaganda department. The book \"Disinformation\" documents that Joseph Stalin coined the term, giving it a French-sounding name to falsely claim it had a Western origin.\n\nRussian use began with a \"special disinformation office\" in 1923. Disinformation was defined in \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" (1952) as \"false information with the intention to deceive public opinion\". Operation INFEKTION was a Soviet disinformation campaign to influence opinion that the U.S. invented AIDS. The U.S. did not actively counter disinformation until 1980, when a fake document reported that the U.S. supported apartheid.\n\nThe word \"disinformation\" did not appear in English dictionaries until the late-1980s. English use increased in 1986, after revelations that the Reagan Administration engaged in disinformation against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. By 1990 it was pervasive in U.S. politics; and by 2001 referred generally to lying and propaganda.\n\nThe English word \"disinformation\", which did not appear in dictionaries until the late-1980s, is a translation of the Russian дезинформация, transliterated as \"dezinformatsiya\". Where misinformation refers to inaccuracies that stem from error, disinformation is deliberate falsehood promulgated by design. Misinformation can be used to define disinformation—when known misinformation is purposefully and intentionally disseminated. Front groups are a form of disinformation, as they fraudulently mislead as to their actual controllers. Disinformation tactics can lead to blowback, unintended negative problems due to the strategy, for example defamation lawsuits or damage to reputation. Disinformation is primarily prepared by government intelligence agencies.\n\nUsage of the term related to a Russian tactical weapon started in 1923, when the Deputy Chairman of the KGB-precursor the State Political Directorate (GPU), Józef Unszlicht, called for the foundation of \"a special disinformation office to conduct active intelligence operations\". The GPU was the first organization in the Soviet Union to utilize the term disinformation for their intelligence tactics. William Safire wrote in his 1993 book \"Quoth the Maven\" that disinformation was used by the KGB predecessor to indicate: \"manipulation of a nation's intelligence system through the injection of credible, but misleading data\". From this point on, disinformation became a tactic used in the Soviet political warfare called active measures. Active measures were a crucial part of Soviet intelligence strategy involving forgery as covert operation, subversion, and media manipulation. The 2003 encyclopedia \"Propaganda and Mass Persuasion\" states that \"disinformation\" came from \"dezinformatsia\", a term used by the Russian black propaganda unit known as Service A which referred to active measures. The term was used in 1939, related to a \"German Disinformation Service\". The 1991 edition of \"The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories\" defines \"disinformation\" as a probable translation of the Russian \"dezinformatsiya\". This dictionary notes that it was possible the English version of the word and the Russian language version developed independently in parallel to each other—out of ongoing frustration related to the spread of propaganda before World War II.\nIon Mihai Pacepa, former senior official from the Romanian secret police, said the word was coined by Joseph Stalin and used during World War II. The Stalinist government then utilized disinformation tactics in both World War II and the Cold War. Soviet intelligence used the term \"maskirovka\" (Russian military deception) to refer to a combination of tactics including disinformation, simulation, camouflage, and concealment. Pacepa and Ronald J. Rychlak authored a book titled \"Disinformation\", in which Pacepa wrote that Stalin gave the tactic a French-sounding title in order to put forth the ruse that it was actually a technique used by the Western world. Pacepa recounted reading Soviet instruction manuals while working as an intelligence officer, that characterized disinformation as a strategy utilized by the Russian government that had early origins in Russian history. Pacepa recalled that the Soviet manuals said the origins of disinformation stemmed from phony towns constructed by Grigory Potyomkin in Crimea to wow Catherine the Great during her 1783 journey to the region—subsequently referred to as Potemkin villages.\n\nIn their book \"Propaganda and Persuasion\", authors Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell characterized \"disinformation\" as a cognate from \"dezinformatsia\", and was developed from the same name given to a KGB black propaganda department. The black propaganda division was reported to have formed in 1955 and was referred to as the Dezinformatsiya agency. Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William Colby explained how the Dezinformatsiya agency operated, saying that it would place a false article in a left-leaning newspaper. The fraudulent tale would make its way to a Communist periodical, before eventually being published by a Soviet newspaper, which would say its sources were undisclosed individuals. By this process a falsehood was globally proliferated as a legitimate piece of reporting.\n\nAccording to \"Oxford Dictionaries\" the English word \"disinformation\", as translated from the Russian \"disinformatsiya\", began to see use in the 1950s. The term \"disinformation\" began to see wider use as a form of Soviet tradecraft, defined in the 1952 official \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" as \"the dissemination (in the press, radio, etc.) of false information with the intention to deceive public opinion.\" During the most-active period of the Cold War, from 1945 to 1989, the tactic was used by multiple intelligence agencies including the Soviet KGB, British Secret Intelligence Service, and the American CIA. The word \"disinformation\" saw increased usage in the 1960s and wider purveyance by the 1980s. Former Soviet bloc intelligence officer Ladislav Bittman, the first disinformation practitioner to publicly defect to the West, described the official definition as different from the practice: \"The interpretation is slightly distorted because public opinion is only one of the potential targets. Many disinformation games are designed only to manipulate the decision-making elite, and receive no publicity.\" Bittman was deputy chief of the Disinformation Department of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service, and testified before the United States Congress on his knowledge of disinformation in 1980.\n\nDisinformation may include distribution of forged documents, manuscripts, and photographs, or spreading dangerous rumours and fabricated intelligence. A major disinformation effort in 1964, Operation Neptune, was designed by the Czechoslovak secret service, the StB, to defame West European politicians as former Nazi collaborators.\n\nThe extent of Soviet disinformation covert operation campaigns, came to light through the defections of KGB officers and officers of allied Soviet bloc services from the late 1960s through the 1980s. Disorder during the fall of the Soviet Union revealed archival and other documentary information to confirm what the defectors had revealed. Stanislav Levchenko and Ilya Dzerkvilov defected from the Soviet Union and by 1990 each had written books recounting their work in the KGB on disinformation operations.\n\nIn 1961, a pamphlet was published in the United Kingdom titled: \"A Study of a Master Spy (Allen Dulles)\", which was highly critical of then-Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles. The purported authors were given as Independent Labour Party Member of Parliament Bob Edwards and reporter Kenneth Dunne—when in actual fact the author was senior disinformation officer KGB Colonel Vassily Sitnikov.\n\nAn example of successful Soviet disinformation was the publication in 1968 of \"Who's Who in the CIA\" which was quoted as authoritative in the West until the early 1990s.\n\nAccording to senior SVR officer Sergei Tretyakov, the KGB was responsible for creating the entire nuclear winter story to stop the deployment of Pershing II missiles. Tretyakov says that from 1979 the KGB wanted to prevent the United States from deploying the missiles in Western Europe and that, directed by Yuri Andropov, they distributed disinformation, based on a faked \"doomsday report\" by the Soviet Academy of Sciences about the effect of nuclear war on climate, to peace groups, the environmental movement and the journal \"AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment\".\nDuring the 1970s, the U.S. intelligence apparatus paid little attention to try to counter Soviet disinformation campaigns. This posture changed in September 1980 during the Carter Administration, when the White House was subjected to a propaganda operation by Soviet intelligence regarding international relations between the U.S. and South Africa. On 17 September 1980, White House Press Secretary Jody Powell acknowledged a falsified \"Presidential Review Memorandum on Africa\" reportedly stated the U.S. endorsed the apartheid government in South Africa and was actively committed to discrimination against African Americans. Prior to this revelation by Powell, an advance copy of the 18 September 1980 issue of San Francisco-based publication the \"Sun Reporter\" was disseminated, which carried the fake claims. \"Sun Reporter\" was published by Carlton Benjamin Goodlett, Presidential Committee member of the Soviet front group the World Peace Council. U.S. President Jimmy Carter was appalled at these lies and subsequently the Carter Administration displayed increased interest in CIA efforts to counter Soviet disinformation.\n\nIn 1982, the CIA issued a report on active measures used by Soviet intelligence. The report documented numerous instances of disinformation campaigns against the U.S., including planting a notion that the U.S. had organized the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, and forgery of documents purporting to show the U.S. would utilize nuclear bombs on its NATO allies.\n\nOperation INFEKTION was an elaborate disinformation campaign which began in 1985, to influence world opinion to believe that the United States had invented AIDS. This included the allegation that the purpose was the creation of an 'ethnic bomb' to destroy non-whites. In 1992, the head of Russian foreign intelligence, Yevgeny Primakov, admitted the existence of the Operation INFEKTION disinformation campaign.\n\nIn 1985, Aldrich Ames gave the KGB a significant amount of information on CIA agents, and the Soviet government swiftly moved to arrest these individuals. Soviet intelligence feared this rapid action would alert the CIA that Ames was a spy. In order to reduce the chances the CIA would discover Ames's duplicity, the KGB manufactured disinformation as to the reasoning behind the arrests of U.S. intelligence agents. During summer 1985, a KGB officer who was a double agent working for the CIA on a mission in Africa traveled to a dead drop in Moscow on his way home but never reported in. The CIA heard from a European KGB source that their agent was arrested. Simultaneously the FBI and CIA learned from a second KGB source of their agent's arrest. Only after Ames had been outed as a spy for the KGB did it become apparent that the KGB had known all along that both of these agents were double agents for the U.S. government, and had played them as pawns to send disinformation to the CIA in order to protect Ames.\n\nIn the post-Soviet era, disinformation evolved to become a key tactic in the military doctrine of Russia.\n\nThe European Union and NATO saw Russian disinformation in the early 21st century as such a problem that they both set up special units to analyze and debunk fabricated falsehoods. NATO founded a modest facility in Latvia to respond to disinformation and, following agreement by heads of state and governments in March 2015 the EU created the European External Action Service East Stratcom Task Force, which publishes weekly reports in its website \"EU vs Disinfo\". The website and its partners identified and debunked over 3,500 pro-Kremlin disinformation cases between September 2015 and November 2017.\n\nMethods used by Russia during this period included its Kremlin-controlled mouthpieces: news agency \"Sputnik News\" and television outlet \"Russia Today\" (RT). When explaining the 2016 annual report of the Swedish Security Service on disinformation, representative Wilhelm Unge stated: \"We mean everything from Internet trolls to propaganda and misinformation spread by media companies like RT and Sputnik.\"\n\nLater in the 21st century, as social media gained prominence, Russia began to use popular platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to spread disinformation. Facebook believes that as many as 126 million users have seen content from Russian disinformation campaigns on its platform. Twitter has said that it has found 36,000 Russian bots spreading tweets related to the 2016 American election. Elsewhere, Russia has used social media to destabilize former soviet states such as Ukraine and other western nations such as France and Spain.\n\nThe United States Intelligence Community appropriated usage of the term \"disinformation\" in the 1950s from the Russian \"dezinformatsiya\", and began to utilize similar strategies during the Cold War and in conflict with other nations. \"The New York Times\" reported in 2000 that during the CIA's effort to substitute Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for then-Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mossadegh, the CIA placed fictitious stories in the local newspaper. Reuters documented how, subsequent to the 1979 Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War, the CIA put false articles in newspapers of Islamic-majority countries, inaccurately stating that Soviet embassies had \"invasion day celebrations\". Reuters noted a former U.S. intelligence officer said they would attempt to gain the confidence of reporters and use them as secret agents, to impact a nation's politics by way of their local media.\n\nIn October 1986, the term gained increased currency in the U.S. when it was revealed that two months previously, the Reagan Administration had engaged in a disinformation campaign against then-leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi. White House representative Larry Speakes said reports of a planned attack on Libya as first broken by \"The Wall Street Journal\" on August 25, 1986 were \"authoritative\", and other newspapers including \"The Washington Post\" then wrote articles saying this was factual. United States Department of State representative Bernard Kalb resigned from his position in protest over the disinformation campaign, and said: \"Faith in the word of America is the pulse beat of our democracy.\"\n\nThe executive branch of the Reagan Administration kept watch on disinformation campaigns through three yearly publications by the Department of State: \"Active Measures: A Report on the Substance and Process of Anti-U.S. Disinformation and Propaganda Campaigns\" (1986); \"Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1986–87\" (1987); and \"Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1987–88\" (1989).\n\n\"Disinformation\" first made an appearance in dictionaries in 1985, specifically \"Webster's New College Dictionary\" and the \"American Heritage Dictionary\" in 1985. In 1986, the term \"disinformation\" was not defined in \"Webster's New World Thesaurus\" or \"New Encyclopædia Britannica\". After the Soviet term became widely known in the 1980s, native speakers of English broadened the term as \"any government communication (either overt or covert) containing intentionally false and misleading material, often combined selectively with true information, which seeks to mislead and manipulate either elites or a mass audience.\"\n\nBy 1990, use of the term \"disinformation\" had fully established itself in the English language within the lexicon of politics. By 2001, the term \"disinformation\" had come to be known as simply a more civil phrase for saying someone was spouting lies. Stanley B. Cunningham wrote in his 2002 book \"The Idea of Propaganda\" that \"disinformation\" had become pervasively utilized as a synonym for propaganda.\n\nThe authors of a 2006 book about psychopathy in the workplace, \"Snakes in Suits\" describe a five-phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power. In phase three, manipulation, the psychopath will create a scenario of \"psychopathic fiction\"—where positive information about themselves and negative disinformation about others will be created, casting others in roles as a part of a network of pawns or patrons to be utilized and groomed into accepting the psychopath's agenda.\n\nIn a contribution to the 2014 book \"Military Ethics and Emerging Technologies\", writers David Danks and Joseph H. Danks discuss the ethical implications in using disinformation as a tactic during information warfare. They note there has been a significant degree of philosophical debate over the issue as related to the ethics of war and use of the technique. The writers describe a position whereby use of disinformation is occasionally allowed, but not in all situations. Typically the ethical test to consider is whether the disinformation was performed out of a motivation of good faith and acceptable according to the rules of war. By this test, the tactic during World War II of putting fake inflatable tanks in visible locations on the Pacific Islands in order to falsely present the impression that there were larger military forces present would be considered as ethically permissible. Conversely, disguising a munitions plant as a healthcare facility in order to avoid attack would be outside the bounds of acceptable use of disinformation during war.\n\nPope Francis criticized disinformation in a 2016 interview, after being made the subject of a fake news website—during the 2016 U.S. election cycle he was falsely said to support Donald Trump. He said the worst thing the news media could do was spread disinformation, that it was a sin, comparing those who spread disinformation to individuals who engage in coprophilia.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "126588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126588", "title": "Gift economy", "text": "Gift economy\n\nA gift economy, gift culture, or gift exchange is a mode of exchange where valuables are not traded or sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards. This exchange contrasts with a barter economy or a market economy, where goods and services are primarily exchanged for value received. Social norms and custom govern gift exchange. Gifts are not given in an explicit exchange of goods or services for money or some other commodity.\n\nThe nature of gift economies forms the subject of a foundational debate in anthropology. Anthropological research into gift economies began with Bronisław Malinowski's description of the Kula ring in the Trobriand Islands during World War I. The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinowski's debate with the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss quickly established the complexity of \"gift exchange\" and introduced a series of technical terms such as reciprocity, inalienable possessions, and prestation to distinguish between the different forms of exchange.\n\nAccording to anthropologists Maurice Bloch and Jonathan Parry, it is the unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange that attracts the most attention. Gift economies are said, by some, to build communities, with the market serving as an acid on those relationships.\n\nGift exchange is distinguished from other forms of exchange by a number of principles, such as the form of property rights governing the articles exchanged; whether gifting forms a distinct \"sphere of exchange\" that can be characterized as an \"economic system\"; and the character of the social relationship that the gift exchange establishes. Gift ideology in highly commercialized societies differs from the \"prestations\" typical of non-market societies. Gift economies must also be differentiated from several closely related phenomena, such as common property regimes and the exchange of non-commodified labour.\n\nAccording to anthropologist Jonathan Parry, discussion on the nature of gifts, and of a separate sphere of gift exchange that would constitute an economic system, has been plagued by the ethnocentric use of modern, western, market society-based conception of the gift applied as if it were a cross-cultural, pan-historical universal. However, he claims that anthropologists, through analysis of a variety of cultural and historical forms of exchange, have established that no universal practice exists. His classic summation of the gift exchange debate highlighted that ideologies of the \"pure gift\" \"are most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector\" and need to be distinguished from non-market \"prestations\". According to Weiner, to speak of a \"gift economy\" in a non-market society is to ignore the distinctive features of their exchange relationships, as the early classic debate between Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss demonstrated. Gift exchange is frequently \"embedded\" in political, kin, or religious institutions, and therefore does not constitute an \"economic\" system per se.\n\nGift-giving is a form of transfer of property rights over particular objects. The nature of those property rights varies from society to society, from culture to culture, and are not universal. The nature of gift-giving is thus altered by the type of property regime in place.\n\nProperty is not a thing, but a relationship amongst people about things. According to Chris Hann, property is a social relationship that governs the conduct of people with respect to the use and disposition of things. Anthropologists analyze these relationships in terms of a variety of actors' (individual or corporate) \"bundle of rights\" over objects. An example is the current debates around intellectual property rights. Hann and Strangelove both give the example of a purchased book (an object that he owns), over which the author retains a \"copyright\". Although the book is a commodity, bought and sold, it has not been completely \"alienated\" from its creator who maintains a hold over it; the owner of the book is limited in what he can do with the book by the rights of the creator. Weiner has argued that the ability to give while retaining a right to the gift/commodity is a critical feature of the gifting cultures described by Malinowski and Mauss, and explains, for example, why some gifts such as Kula valuables return to their original owners after an incredible journey around the Trobriand islands. The gifts given in Kula exchange still remain, in some respects, the property of the giver.\n\nIn the example used above, \"copyright\" is one of those bundled rights that regulate the use and disposition of a book. Gift-giving in many societies is complicated because \"private property\" owned by an individual may be quite limited in scope (see below). Productive resources, such as land, may be held by members of a corporate group (such as a lineage), but only some members of that group may have \"use rights\". When many people hold rights over the same objects gifting has very different implications than the gifting of private property; only some of the rights in that object may be transferred, leaving that object still tied to its corporate owners. Anthropologist Annette Weiner refers to these types of objects as \"inalienable possessions\" and to the process as \"keeping while giving\".\n\nMalinowski's study of the Kula ring became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of \"The Gift\" (\"Essai sur le don\", 1925). In Parry's view, Malinowski placed the emphasis on the exchange of goods between \"individuals\", and their non-altruistic motives for giving the gift: they expected a return of equal or greater value. Malinowski stated that reciprocity is an implicit part of gifting; he contended there is no such thing as the \"free gift\" given without expectation.\n\nMauss, in contrast, emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectivities. These gifts were, he argued, a \"total prestation\". A prestation is a service provided out of a sense of obligation, like \"community service\". They were not simple, alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like the \"Crown jewels\", embodied the reputation, history and sense of identity of a \"corporate kin group\", such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked \"why anyone would give them away?\" His answer was an enigmatic concept, \"the spirit of the gift\". Parry believes that a good part of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to keep the very relationship between givers alive; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts.\n\nBoth Malinowski and Mauss agreed that in non-market societies, where there was no clear institutionalized economic exchange system, gift/prestation exchange served economic, kinship, religious and political functions that could not be clearly distinguished from each other, and which mutually influenced the nature of the practice.\n\nMauss' concept of \"total prestations\" was further developed by Annette Weiner, who revisited Malinowski's fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her critique was twofold: first, Trobriand Island society is matrilineal, and women hold a great deal of economic and political power. Their exchanges were ignored by Malinowski. Secondly, she developed Mauss' argument about reciprocity and the \"spirit of the gift\" in terms of \"inalienable possessions: the paradox of keeping while giving.\" Weiner contrasts \"moveable goods\" which can be exchanged with \"immoveable goods\" that serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts with women's landed property). She argues that the specific goods given, like Crown Jewels, are so identified with particular groups, that even when given, they are not truly alienated. Not all societies, however, have these kinds of goods, which depend upon the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups. French anthropologist Maurice Godelier pushed the analysis further in \"The Enigma of the Gift\" (1999). Albert Schrauwers has argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the Kula ring in the Trobriands, the Potlatch of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and the Toraja of South Sulawesi, Indonesia) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit with Claude Lévi-Strauss' model of \"House Societies\" (where \"House\" refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given, he argues, to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.\n\nAccording to Chris Gregory reciprocity is a dyadic exchange relationship that we characterize, imprecisely, as gift-giving. Gregory believes that one gives gifts to friends and potential enemies in order to establish a relationship, by placing them in debt. He also claimed that in order for such a relationship to persist, there must be a time lag between the gift and counter-gift; one or the other partner must always be in debt, or there is no relationship. Marshall Sahlins has stated that birthday gifts are an example of this. Sahlins notes that birthday presents are separated in time so that one partner feels the obligation to make a return gift; and to forget the return gift may be enough to end the relationship. Gregory has stated that without a relationship of debt, there is no reciprocity, and that this is what distinguishes a gift economy from a \"true gift\" given with no expectation of return (something Sahlins calls \"generalized reciprocity\": see below).\n\nMarshall Sahlins, an American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book \"Stone Age Economics\" (1972). Gift or \"generalized reciprocity\" is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. \"Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity\" occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or \"Negative reciprocity\" is the exchange of goods and services where each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occurred within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more balanced or negative the exchange became.\n\nThe \"generalized reciprocity\" time-lag in recent years, also applies as an allowance for spontaneity and creativity that enables both parties to demonstrate love in surprising ways. In a market exchange, the giving party loses an item to gain income while the receiving party loses income to gain an item, a +1 -1 transaction that leads to 0 goodwill remaining on average. In a giving relationship, the giving party loses the item, but gains the joy of doing good for someone they appreciate, while the receiving party still gains not just something, but something that is tailored to their tastes, transaction value +1(receiver) +1(giver) -1(giver) +1(personalization as sign of love for the receiver) for a total of +2 goodwill added to the relationship. This expanding goodwill deepens social capital exchanged in close communities and leaves a \"relationship bank\" for community members to tap into when they are in need of help in the future. This belief is a core part of the culture of Burning Man.\n\nWithin the virtual world, the proliferation of public domain content, Creative Common Licences, and Open Source projects have also contributed to what might be considered an economics game changer variable.\n\nJonathan Parry has argued that ideologies of the \"pure gift\" \"are most likely to arise only in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector\" and need to be distinguished from the non-market \"prestations\" discussed above. Parry also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India (Dāna), that the \"pure gift\" of alms given with no expectation of return could be \"poisonous\". That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities that they could not cleanse themselves of. \"Pure gifts\", given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift. David Graeber points out that no reciprocity is expected between unequals: if you make a gift of a dollar to a beggar, he will not give it back the next time you meet. More than likely, he will ask for more, to the detriment of his status. Many who are forced by circumstances to accept charity feel stigmatized. In the Moka exchange system of Papua New Guinea, where gift givers become political \"big men\", those who are in their debt and unable to repay with \"interest\" are referred to as \"rubbish men\".\n\nThe French writer Georges Bataille, in \"La part Maudite\", uses Mauss's argument in order to construct a theory of economy: the structure of gift is the presupposition for all possible economy. Bataille is particularly interested in the potlatch as described by Mauss, and claims that its agonistic character obliges the receiver of the gift to confirm their own subjection. Gift-giving thus embodies the Hegelian dipole of master and slave within the act.\n\nThe relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. Paul Bohannan argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three spheres of exchange, and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own different form of special purpose money. However, the market and universal money allowed goods to be traded between spheres and thus served as an acid on established social relationships. Jonathan Parry and Maurice Bloch, argued in \"Money and the Morality of Exchange\" (1989), that the \"transactional order\" through which long-term social reproduction of the family takes place has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations. It is the long-term social reproduction of the family that is sacralized by religious rituals such baptisms, weddings and funerals, and characterized by gifting.\n\nIn such situations where gift-giving and market exchange were intersecting for the first time, some anthropologists contrasted them as polar opposites. This opposition was classically expressed by Chris Gregory in his book \"Gifts and Commodities\" (1982). Gregory argued that\n\nGregory contrasts gift and commodity exchange according to five criteria:\n\nOther anthropologists, however, refused to see these different \"exchange spheres\" as such polar opposites. Marilyn Strathern, writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the contrasting setup in \"The Gender of the Gift\" (1988).\n\nRather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in restricted spheres of exchange, Arjun Appadurai and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange (i.e. how objects can be converted into gifts and then back into commodities). They refocussed attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on \"the social life of things\" instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be \"singularized\" (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift. Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. They thus show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by Nicholas Thomas, who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write on them, and redirects attention to the \"entangled objects\" and their roles as both gifts and commodities.\n\nMany societies have strong prohibitions against turning gifts into trade or capital goods. Anthropologist Wendy James writes that among the Uduk people of northeast Africa there is a strong custom that any gift that crosses subclan boundaries must be consumed rather than invested. For example, an animal given as a gift must be eaten, not bred. However, as in the example of the Trobriand armbands and necklaces, this \"perishing\" may not consist of consumption as such, but of the gift moving on. In other societies, it is a matter of giving some other gift, either directly in return or to another party. To keep the gift and not give another in exchange is reprehensible. \"In folk tales,\" Lewis Hyde remarks, \"the person who tries to hold onto a gift usually dies.\"\n\nDaniel Everett, a linguist who studied a small tribe of hunter-gatherers in Brazil, reported that, while they are aware of food preservation using drying, salting, and so forth, they reserve the use of these techniques for items for barter outside of the tribe. Within the group, when someone has a successful hunt they immediately share the abundance by inviting others to enjoy a feast. Asked about this practice, one hunter laughed and replied, \"I store meat in the belly of my brother.\"\n\nCarol Stack's \"All Our Kin\" describes both the positive and negative sides of a network of obligation and gratitude effectively constituting a gift economy. Her narrative of The Flats, a poor Chicago neighborhood, tells in passing the story of two sisters who each came into a small inheritance. One sister hoarded the inheritance and prospered materially for some time, but was alienated from the community. Her marriage ultimately broke up, and she integrated herself back into the community largely by giving gifts. The other sister fulfilled the community's expectations, but within six weeks had nothing material to show for the inheritance but a coat and a pair of shoes.\n\nMarcel Mauss was careful to distinguish \"gift economies\" (reciprocity) in market-based societies from the \"total prestations\" given in non-market societies. A prestation is a service provided out of a sense of obligation, like \"community service\". These \"prestations\" bring together domains that we would differentiate as political, religious, legal, moral and economic, such that the exchange can be seen to be embedded in non-economic social institutions. These prestations are frequently competitive, as in the potlatch, Kula exchange, and Moka exchange.\n\nThe \"Moka\" is a highly ritualized system of exchange in the Mount Hagen area, Papua New Guinea, that has become emblematic of the anthropological concepts of \"gift economy\" and of \"big man\" political system. Moka are reciprocal gifts of pigs through which social status is achieved. Moka refers specifically to the increment in the size of the gift. Social status in the \"big man\" political system is the result of giving larger gifts than one has received. These gifts are of a limited range of goods, primarily pigs and scarce pearl shells from the coast. To return the same amount as one has received in a moka is simply the repayment of a debt, strict reciprocity. Moka is the extra. To some, this represents interest on an investment. However, one is not bound to provide moka, only to repay the debt. One adds moka to the gift to increase one's prestige, and to place the receiver in debt. It is this constant renewal of the debt relationship which keeps the relationship alive; a debt fully paid off ends further interaction. Giving more than one receives establishes a reputation as a Big man, whereas the simple repayment of debt, or failure to fully repay, pushes one's reputation towards the other end of the scale, \"rubbish man\". Gift exchange thus has a political effect; granting prestige or status to one, and a sense of debt in the other. A political system can be built out of these kinds of status relationships. Sahlins characterizes the difference between status and rank by highlighting that Big man is not a role; it is a status that is shared by many. The Big man is \"not a prince \"of\" men\", but a \"prince among men\". The \"big man\" system is based upon the ability to persuade, rather than command.\n\nThe Toraja are an ethnic group indigenous to a mountainous region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Torajans are renowned for their elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, and massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as \"tongkonan\" which are owned by noble families. Membership in a tongkonan is inherited by all descendants of its founders. Any individual Toraja may thus be a member of numerous tongkonan, as long as they contribute to its ritual events. Membership in a tongkonan carries benefits, such as the right to rent some of its rice fields.\n\nToraja funeral rites are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting for several days. The funerals are like \"big men\" competitions where all the descendants of a tongkonan will compete through gifts of sacrificial cattle. Participants will have invested cattle with others over the years, and will now draw on those extended networks to make the largest gift. The winner of the competition becomes the new owner of the tongkonan and its rice lands. They display all the cattle horns from their winning sacrifice on a pole in front of the tongkonan.\n\nThe Toraja funeral differs from the \"big man\" system in that the winner of the \"gift\" exchange gains control of the Tongkonan's property. It creates a clear social hierarchy between the noble owners of the tongkonan and its land, and the commoners who are forced to rent their fields from him. Since the owners of the tongkonan gain rent, they are better able to compete in the funeral gift exchanges, and their social rank is more stable than the \"big man\" system.\n\nAnthropologist David Graeber has argued that the great world religious traditions on charity and gift giving emerged almost simultaneously during the \"Axial age\" (the period between 800 and 200 BCE), which was the same period in which coinage was invented and market economies established on a continental basis. These religious traditions on charity emerge, he argues, as a reaction against the nexus formed by coinage, slavery, military violence and the market (a \"military-coinage\" complex). The new world religions, including Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, and Islam all sought to preserve \"human economies\" where money served to cement social relationships rather than purchase things (including people).\n\nCharity and alms-giving are religiously sanctioned voluntary gifts given without expectation of return. Case studies demonstrate, however, that such gift-giving is not necessarily altruistic.\n\nTheravada Buddhism in Thailand emphasizes the importance of giving alms (merit making) without any intention of return (a pure gift), which is best accomplished according to doctrine, through gifts to monks and temples. The emphasis is on the selfless gifting which \"earns merit\" (and a future better life) for the giver rather than on the relief of the poor or the recipient on whom the gift is bestowed. Bowie's research among poorer Thai farmers shows, however, that this ideal form of gifting is limited to the rich who have the resources to endow temples, or sponsor the ordination of a monk. Monks come from these same families, hence the doctrine of pure gifting to monks has a class element to it. Poorer farmers place much less emphasis on merit making through gifts to monks and temples. They equally validate gifting to beggars. Poverty and famine is widespread amongst these poorer groups, and by validating gift-giving to beggars, they are in fact demanding that the rich see to their needs in hard times. Bowie sees this as an example of a moral economy (see below) in which the poor use gossip and reputation as a means of resisting elite exploitation and pressuring them to ease their \"this world\" suffering.\n\nDāna is a form of religious charity given in Hindu India. The gift is said to embody the sins of the giver (the \"poison of the gift\"), who it frees of evil by transmitting it to the recipient. The merit of the gift is dependent on finding a worthy recipient such as a Brahmin priest. Priests are supposed to be able to digest the sin through ritual action and transmit the gift with increment to someone of greater worth. It is imperative that this be a true gift, with no reciprocity, or the evil will return. The gift is not intended to create any relationship between donor and recipient, and there should never be a return gift. Dana thus transgresses the so-called universal \"norm of reciprocity\".\n\nThe Children of Peace (1812–1889) were a utopian Quaker sect. Today, they are primarily remembered for the Sharon Temple, a national historic site and an architectural symbol of their vision of a society based on the values of peace, equality and social justice. They built this ornate temple to raise money for the poor, and built the province of Ontario's first shelter for the homeless. They took a lead role in the organization of the province's first co-operative, the Farmers' Storehouse, and opened the province's first credit union. The group soon found that the charity they tried to distribute from their Temple fund endangered the poor. Accepting charity was a sign of indebtedness, and the debtor could be jailed without trial at the time; this was the \"poison of the gift\". They thus transformed their charity fund into a credit union that loaned small sums like today's micro-credit institutions. This is an example of singularization, as money was transformed into charity in the Temple ceremony, then shifted to an alternative exchange sphere as a loan. Interest on the loan was then singularized, and transformed back into charity.\n\nNon-commodified spheres of exchange exist in relation to the market economy. They are created through the processes of singularization as specific objects are de-commodified for a variety of reasons and enter an alternative exchange sphere. As in the case of organ donation, this may be the result of an ideological opposition to the \"traffic in humans\". In other cases, it is in opposition to the market and to its perceived greed. It may, however, be used by corporations as a means of creating a sense of endebtedness and loyalty in customers. Modern marketing techniques often aim at infusing commodity exchange with features of gift exchange, thus blurring the presumably sharp distinction between gifts and commodities.\n\nMarket economies tend to reduce everything – \"including human beings, their labor, and their reproductive capacity\" – to the status of commodities. The rapid transfer of organ transplant technology to the third world has created a trade in organs, with sick bodies travelling to the global south for transplants, and healthy organs from the global south being transported to the richer global north, \"creating a kind of 'Kula ring' of bodies and body parts.\" However, all commodities can also be singularized, or de-commodified, and transformed into gifts. In North America, it is illegal to sell organs, and citizens are enjoined to give the \"gift of life\" and donate their organs in an organ gift economy. However, this gift economy is a \"medical realm rife with potent forms of mystified commodification\". This multimillion-dollar medical industry requires clients to pay steep fees for the gifted organ, which creates clear class divisions between those who donate (frequently in the global south) and will never benefit from gifted organs, and those who can pay the fees and thereby receive the gifted organ.\n\nUnlike body organs, blood and semen have been successfully and legally commodified in the United States. Blood and semen can thus be commodified, but once consumed are \"the gift of life\". Although both can be either donated or sold, are perceived as the \"gift of life\" yet are stored in \"banks\", and can be collected only under strict government regulated procedures, recipients very clearly prefer altruistically donated semen and blood. Ironically, the blood and semen samples with the highest market value are those that have been altruistically donated. The recipients view semen as storing the potential characteristics of their unborn child in its DNA, and value altruism over greed. Similarly, gifted blood is the archetype of a pure gift relationship because the donor is only motivated by a desire to help others.\n\nEngineers, scientists and software developers have created free software projects such as the Linux kernel and the GNU operating system. They are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector, and its active role in instating the use of permissive free software and copyleft licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include file-sharing, open access, unlicensed software ... etc.\n\nMany retail organizations have \"gift\" programs meant to encourage customer loyalty to their establishments. Bird-David and Darr refer to these as hybrid \"mass-gifts\" which are neither gift nor commodity. They are called mass-gifts because they are given away in large numbers \"free with purchase\" in a mass-consumption environment. They give as an example two bars of soap in which one is given free with purchase: which is the commodity and which the gift? The mass-gift both affirms the distinct difference between gift and commodity while confusing it at the same time. As with gifting, mass-gifts are used to create a social relationship. Some customers embrace the relationship and gift whereas others reject the gift relationship and interpret the \"gift\" as a 50% off sale.\n\n\"Give-away shops\", \"freeshops\" or \"free stores\" are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to charity shops, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a book, a piece of furniture, a garment or a household item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive direct action that provides a shopping alternative to a monetary framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. The anarchist 1960s countercultural group The Diggers opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers led by Gerrard Winstanley and sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism. Although free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the freegan movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. Today the idea is kept alive by the new generations of social centres, anarchists and environmentalists who view the idea as an intriguing way to raise awareness about consumer culture and to promote the reuse of commodities.\n\nBurning Man is a week-long annual art and community event held in the Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada, in the United States. The event is described as an experiment in community, radical self-expression, and radical self-reliance. The event forbids commerce (except for ice, coffee, and tickets to the event itself) and encourages gifting. Gifting is one of the 10 guiding principles, as participants to Burning Man (both the desert festival and the year-round global community) are encouraged to rely on a gift economy. The practice of gifting at Burning Man is also documented by the 2002 documentary film \"Gifting It: A Burning Embrace of Gift Economy\", as well as by Making Contact's radio show \"How We Survive: The Currency of Giving [encore]\".\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, \"Gift-giving has long been a part of marijuana culture\" and has accompanied legalization in U.S. states in the 2010s. Voters in the District of Columbia legalized the growing of cannabis for personal recreational use by approving Initiative 71 in November 2014, but the 2015 \"Cromnibus\" Federal appropriations bills prevented the District from creating a system to allow for its commercial sale. Possession, growth, and use of the drug by adults is legal in the District, as is giving it away, but sale and barter of it is not, in effect attempting to create a gift economy. However it ended up creating a commercial market linked to selling other objects. Preceding the January, 2018 legalization of cannabis possession in Vermont without a corresponding legal framework for sales, it was expected that a similar market would emerge there. For a time, people in Portland, Oregon could only legally obtain cannabis as a gift, which was celebrated in the Burnside Burn rally. For a time, a similar situation ensued after possession was legalized in California, Maine and Massachusetts.\n\nMany anarchists, particularly anarcho-primitivists and anarcho-communists, believe that variations on a gift economy may be the key to breaking the cycle of poverty. Therefore, they often desire to refashion all of society into a gift economy. Anarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor central planning. This view traces back at least to Peter Kropotkin, who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of \"mutual aid\". In place of a market, anarcho-communists, such as those who inhabited some Spanish villages in the 1930s, support a currency-less gift economy where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as payment for their production of goods and services.\n\nAs an intellectual abstraction, mutual aid was developed and advanced by mutualism or labor insurance systems and thus trade unions, and has been also used in cooperatives and other civil society movements. Typically, mutual-aid groups will be free to join and participate in, and all activities will be voluntary. They are often structured as non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic non-profit organizations, with members controlling all resources and no external financial or professional support. They are member-led and member-organized. They are egalitarian in nature, and designed to support participatory democracy, equality of member status and power, and shared leadership and cooperative decision-making. Members' external societal status is considered irrelevant inside the group: status in the group is conferred by participation.\n\nEnglish historian E.P. Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread English food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to \"set the price\" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional \"fair price\" was more important to the community than a \"free\" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. A moral economy is thus an attempt to preserve an alternative exchange sphere from market penetration. The notion of peasants with a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for their own ends has been linked to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times. James C. Scott points out, however, that those who provide this subsistence insurance to the poor in bad years are wealthy patrons who exact a political cost for their aid; this aid is given to recruit followers. The concept of moral economy has been used to explain why peasants in a number of colonial contexts, such as the Vietnam War, have rebelled.\n\nSome may confuse common property regimes with gift exchange systems. \"Commons\" refers to the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately. The resources held in common can include everything from natural resources and common land to software. The commons contains public property and private property, over which people have certain traditional rights. When commonly held property is transformed into private property this process alternatively is termed \"enclosure\" or more commonly, \"privatization\". A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a commoner.\n\nThere are a number of important aspects that can be used to describe true commons. The first is that the commons cannot be commodified – if they are, they cease to be commons. The second aspect is that unlike private property, the commons are inclusive rather than exclusive – their nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible. The third aspect is that the assets in commons are meant to be preserved regardless of their return of capital. Just as we receive them as a shared right, so we have a duty to pass them on to future generations in at least the same condition as we received them. If we can add to their value, so much the better, but at a minimum we must not degrade them, and we certainly have no right to destroy them.\n\nFree content, or free information, is any kind of functional work, artwork, or other creative content that meets the definition of a free cultural work. A free cultural work is one which has no significant legal restriction on people's freedom:\n\nAlthough different definitions are used, free content is legally similar if not identical to open content. An analogy is the use of the rival terms free software and open source which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.\n\nFree content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because copyright law in most countries by default grants copyright holders monopolistic control over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.\n\nThough a work which is in the public domain because its copyright has expired is considered free, it can become non-free again if the copyright law changes.\n\nInformation is particularly suited to gift economies, as information is a nonrival good and can be gifted at practically no cost (zero marginal cost). In fact, there is often an advantage to using the same software or data formats as others, so even from a selfish perspective, it can be advantageous to give away one's information.\n\nMarkus Giesler in his ethnography \"Consumer Gift System\", described music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions. As Internet access spread, file sharing became extremely popular among users who could contribute and receive files on line. This form of gift economy was a model for online services such as Napster, which focused on music sharing and was later sued for copyright infringement. Nonetheless, online file sharing persists in various forms such as Bit Torrent and Direct download link. A number of communications and intellectual property experts such as Henry Jenkins and Lawrence Lessig have described file-sharing as a form of gift exchange which provides numerous benefits to artists and consumers alike. They have argued that file sharing fosters community among distributors and allows for a more equitable distribution of media.\n\nIn his essay \"Homesteading the Noosphere\", noted computer programmer Eric S. Raymond said that free and open-source software developers have created \"a 'gift culture' in which participants compete for prestige by giving time, energy, and creativity away\". Prestige gained as a result of contributions to source code fosters a social network for the developer; the open source community will recognize the developer's accomplishments and intelligence. Consequently, the developer may find more opportunities to work with other developers. However, prestige is not the only motivator for the giving of lines of code. An anthropological study of the Fedora community, as part of a master's study at the University of North Texas in 2010-11, found that common reasons given by contributors were \"learning for the joy of learning and collaborating with interesting and smart people\". Motivation for personal gain, such as career benefits, was more rarely reported. Many of those surveyed said things like, \"Mainly I contribute just to make it work for me\", and \"programmers develop software to 'scratch an itch. The International Institute of Infonomics at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands reported in 2002 that in addition to the above, large corporations, and they specifically mentioned IBM, also spend large annual sums employing developers specifically for them to contribute to open source projects. The firms' and the employees' motivations in such cases are less clear.\n\nMembers of the Linux community often speak of their community as a gift economy. The IT research firm IDC valued the Linux kernel at $18 billion USD in 2007 and projected its value at $40 billion USD in 2010. The Debian distribution of the GNU/Linux operating system offers over 37,000 free open-source software packages via their AMD64 repositories alone.\n\nCollaborative works are works created by an open community. For example, Wikipediaa free online encyclopediafeatures millions of articles developed collaboratively, and almost none of its many authors and editors receive any direct material reward.\n\nThe concept of a gift economy has played a large role in works of fiction about alternative societies, especially in works of science fiction.

{"id": "32470662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32470662", "title": "Hermann Cohen (Carmelite)", "text": "Hermann Cohen (Carmelite)\n\nHermann Cohen (also known as Augustine Mary of the Blessed Sacrament, O.C.D., , better known as Father Hermann; 10 November 1821 – 20 January 1871) was a noted German Jewish pianist, who converted to the Catholic Church. He later became a friar and priest of the Discalced Carmelite Order, who was instrumental in re-establishing his Order in both France and England. He was a popular preacher throughout Europe, and was instrumental in introducing the widespread practice of nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nThe cause for Cohen's canonization has been accepted for investigation by the Holy See.\n\nHe was born in Hamburg, one of the four children of David Abraham Cohen and Rosalie Benjamin, part of a large and prosperous Jewish banking family. Although not pious, his parents were members of the Reform Judaism movement there and taught their son Hebrew and the basics of the Jewish faith.\n\nA gifted student, at the age of 4 he began to study the piano, at which he had soon became accomplished. Praised by his teacher, who had arranged successful concerts for him at the age of 7 in Altona and Frankfurt, he became the spoiled focus of the family's attention. From his teacher, he also acquired a serious gambling habit, which was to plague him for many years. At the age of 12, his mother resolved to take him to Paris to advance his musical training, against the wishes of her husband, who was experiencing financial difficulties. Undeterred, she approached the Grand Dukes George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Francis I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in order to obtain their financial support for her son. Successful in her quest, she took her children and moved to Paris. The family arrived there in July 1834, only to learn that, as a foreigner, Hermann was denied admission to the famed Paris Conservatory.\nThis rejection led to a significant direction in Cohen's life. Rosalie Cohen was able to persuade the renowned pianist Franz Liszt to take her son on as a pupil. Despite his early reluctance, after hearing him play and taken by his good looks, Liszt accepted him as a pupil. Cohen soon became his favorite student. As Liszt himself had been nicknamed \"Putzig\" (German for \"little cute guy\") by his own teacher, Carl Czerny, he began to call Cohen \"Puzzi\", a diminutive form of the word. Liszt accepted Cohen into his social circle, introducing him to his friends, the author George Sand and the radical priest, the Abbé de Lamennais, who both also became charmed by the boy. Sand began to dote on the boy and called him \"Le Mélancolique Puzzi\". Lamennais gave the young Jewish boy an autographed copy of his work, \"Paroles d'un croyant\"—for which the priest had just been excommunicated by Pope Gregory XVI—with the inscription: \"Souvenirs offerts à mon cher petit Puzzi\".\n\nThe following June, Liszt left Paris without warning with his new lover, the Countess Marie d'Agoult, and moved to Geneva, where he began to teach at the recently founded Geneva Conservatory of Music. Devastated by the sudden loss of his mentor, Cohen persisted in begging Liszt to allow him to join him there, to which Liszt eventually relented. Cohen's arrival in the Liszt circle in Geneva soon earned him the long-held enmity of the countess. His abilities continued to grow under Liszt’s watchful eye. On 1 October 1835 Cohen played in a concert sponsored by the Princess Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso. Together with Liszt and two other pianists, he played in a four-piano \"Brilliant Potpourri\" on folk airs by Czerny. That same month Liszt entrusted the boy with 10 students of his own. At age 13, Cohen’s career appeared headed for greatness.\n\nBy then Cohen had become Liszt's constant companion, accompanying him and the countess on their holiday trips through the Swiss countryside. He was with them and Sand on a notorious trip to Chamonix. He later wrote, \"Circumstances led me into the interior of a family unsanctified by the marriage ties\". As dissolute as the circle appeared to the world, Liszt felt himself responsible for the boy's moral as well as his professional development and Cohen was touched when Liszt gave him a Bible. Cohen felt a deep religious experience in the course of one trip, when Liszt played an improvisation of the \"Dies Irae\" from Mozart's \"Requiem\" on the Grand Organ of the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Fribourg.\n\nIn 1837 Liszt and his circle returned to Paris, where the princess had arranged for a famed competition between him and his greatest rival of the period, Sigismond Thalberg. She came to know Cohen at that time and became a friend and patron. When his increasing debts threatened to drown him, she arranged for a concert, which was to prove unsuccessful, apparently due to his lack of training from the idle lifestyle of gambling and dissolution he had adopted. The shock of this failure led Cohen to return to Hamburg, where he sought help from his father. Alone and in financial straits himself, the elder Cohen had no interest in helping his son. Cohen then turned to a former patron, Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who sponsored several concerts for him to raise funds. They were successful enough to allow him to return to Paris. There he met a popular Italian singer named Mario, which whom he formed a partnership. The duo traveled to London, where Cohen improved his skills and experienced a number of successes with their concerts.\n\nAgain saddled with debts, by 1839 Cohen began to be estranged from his mentors, both Liszt and the princess, as a result of his lifestyle. The Countess d'Agoult used an affair he had with a married woman in her campaign in an attempt to discredit him in Liszt's eyes, who nonetheless kept Cohen as his companion for his concert tours around Europe until the end of 1840. His ties to Liszt were not without their own consequences. Friedrich Wieck, father of the future Clara Schumann, began to criticize publicly both Liszt and Cohen in the newspapers in Leipzig. He was furious at Liszt for supporting Robert Schumann in his own lawsuit against Wieck: \"To show cause why his twenty-year-old daughter Clara should not marry Schumann\". Liszt shrugged off the charges but Cohen did not and took Wieck to court, where he won his case.\n\nThe year 1841 saw a final rupture between Cohen and Liszt, when the teenager was accused of embezzling funds from some concerts Liszt had given in Dresden. He was unable to persuade Liszt of his innocence. He felt his life had been wrecked, later calling this experience the result of \"a plot hatched in hell\". He spent the next five years traveling around Europe with his mother and his sister Henriette, playing concerts and composing works for the piano.\n\nCohen settled in Paris in October 1846, where he shared an apartment with an artist friend. The following spring he met and fell in love with a popular circus rider, Celeste Mogadar, with whom he shared a deep love of music. The relationship soon ended, however, when he broke it off abruptly, indicating that he felt called to place his life in the hands of God.\nDisgusted with his life, he began to seek spiritual guidance, visiting churches of the city, where he would spend hours in prayer.\n\nIn May 1847, while playing the organ for a Benediction service in the former Church of St. Valerius (), he became overwhelmed by an intense experience of submission, which he again experienced at the same service the next day, at which time the thought came to him that he should become a Catholic. While he was in Ems, Germany, to give a concert, he was again overwhelmed during the services in a local church there and resolved to take this step.\n\nCohen had never known a priest besides Lamennais and was confused as to in whom he could confide. He was introduced to Marie Theodor Ratisbonne, a fellow Jewish convert, who, in turn introduced him to the Abbé Legrande. Under his instruction, Cohen was trained in the Catholic faith and was baptized, with the baptismal name of Marie-Augustin-Henri, on 28 August, the feast day of his namesake, St. Augustine. The baptism took place in the Chapel of Our Lady of Zion, in the presence of Ratisbonne, its founder, and many Jewish Catholics. At his baptism, he experienced an apparition of Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and a multitude of saints, all bathed in a brilliant light, as well as an overwhelming experience of love.\n\nCohen received Confirmation the following 3 December from the Archbishop of Paris, Denis Auguste Affre. With the support of Jean-Baptiste de Bouillé, the Archbishop of Poitiers, out of his own experience, he immediately began efforts to popularize the practice of the nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament by the general faithful.\n\nCohen soon felt called to be a priest. He first approached the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of Solesmes, who were known for their studies for the revival of Gregorian chant. They declined his application. Next he turned to Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire, O.P., who was in the process of re-establishing the Dominican Order in France, after its destruction during the French Revolution. He counseled Cohen to find an Order more monastic than the Dominicans. Cohen then explored the more austere branch of the Carmelite Order, the Discalced, (or Barefoot) Carmelites, who follow the reforms of the Spanish mystics, John of the Cross and Teresa of Ávila, who was also of Jewish ancestry. He felt called to this Order, with its claim to having originated on Mount Carmel in Palestine, under the Prophet Elijah. Being a recent convert was a barrier to his admission, however, due to Church law, which required a personal visit to Rome to obtain a dispensation.\n\nCohen gave a farewell concert which cleared his debts, required before he could be admitted to the Order, in the days before the Revolution of 1848. Instead of joining the fight in the streets, he was at his favorite devotion, spending the night in adoration before the exposed Blessed Sacrament. He entered the Discalced Carmelite novitiate at Le Broussey, in Rions, France, on 19 July of that year. He received the religious habit on 6 October 1849, being given the religious name of Augustine Mary of the Blessed Sacrament. He professed religious vows as a member of the Order on 7 October 1850. He then began to study theology. In this he faced a major challenge, as his formal education had stopped at the age of ten. Having been granted an exemption from some of the required courses, he was ordained a priest on 19 April 1851.\n\nOnce ordained, Cohen launched himself into a ministry of preaching, which was to lead him to all the capitals of Europe. He preached to thousands in Geneva, Bordeaux, Lyon, and in Paris before huge crowds in prominent churches, such as Saint-Sulpice and Sainte-Clotilde. The poet, Charles Baudelaire, wrote that he found Cohen's sermons fascinating. His fiery eloquence and the interest caused by his conversion made him a popular preacher, despite his limited studies. He became a main figure in the restoration of the Carmelites in France, taking an active role in the founding of several priories of friars in the south of France: Bagnères-de-Bigorre (1853), Lyon (1857) and a hermitage in Tarasteix, near Lourdes (1857).\n\nBy 1852, Cohen and Liszt, who was known for his generosity of spirit, had renewed their association through correspondence. Cohen invited his former mentor to visit him in France, which Liszt, by then living in Weimar, was unable to do. Several years later, Liszt's daughter with the countess reported to her father that her mother had undergone a change of heart and had come to admire Cohen. Liszt returned the offer in 1857, pleading illness for not being able to travel.\n\nIn June 1862, both Cohen and Liszt happened to be in Rome. By this time, Liszt was himself was a cleric, being in minor orders and a Franciscan tertiary. They met for the first time in years, spending three weeks together, playing music and walking in the Coloseum. By that time, his mother, Maria Anna Liszt, had ceased to view Cohen with the antisemitism she had exhibited all her life prior to that.\n\nCohen's fame as a preacher led to an invitation by Cardinal Wiseman to come to England to re-establish the Carmelite Order, after its suppression in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, for which he received a special blessing from Pope Pius IX. He arrived in London in 1862, having £7 (c. ₤550 in modern funds) to support his work. He opened the new priory with a public religious procession, the first held by English Catholics since the time of the Tudors. He gained further public attention to his ministry in 1864, when he faced a jeering crowd while administering the Last Rites to six Catholic sailors about to be hanged on the gallows of Newgate Prison. He was lauded for his bravery by \"The Times\" of London.\n\nIn 1867 Cohen retired to the hermitage he had founded in Tarasteix, France. During this period, his eyesight began to fail and he was diagnosed with glaucoma. Spurning the surgery prescribed by his doctors, he chose to make a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes. Bathing his eyes there from the miraculous spring attributed to the shrine, his sight was immediately restored. He then returned to his life of solitude in France fully cured, living there in peace for the next few years.\n\nCohen's life was uprooted, however, by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, when all German nationals were expelled from France. Even though he was exempted by the French government, and his surviving immediate family were living in France, he chose to go into exile in Geneva, Switzerland that following October. He soon heard of the large numbers of French prisoners being held in Spandau Prison, just outside Berlin at that time. Despite his failing health, he volunteered to minister to them, and moved to Berlin in November. He found a facility crammed with over 5,000 prisoners living in squalid conditions, of whom some ten percent were suffering from serious infectious diseases, including smallpox.\n\nAs the prison chaplain, Cohen worked tirelessly to alleviate the needs of the French prisoners, distributing relief supplies in addition to his spiritual services. He said daily Mass, regularly drawing 500 attendees, and heard frequent Confessions. He administered the Last Rites to two prisoners with his own hands instead of the prescribed spatula. Within two months, he began to exhibit the symptoms of smallpox himself, dying on 19 January 1871. His remains were buried in St. Hedwig's Cathedral in Berlin. After the destruction of the church during World War II his remains were transferred to the cathedral cemetery. In 2008 his remains were exhumed and transferred to the priory in Le Broussey where he had entered the Carmelite Order.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1079427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1079427", "title": "Homunculus argument", "text": "Homunculus argument\n\nThe homunculus argument is a fallacy arising most commonly in the theory of vision. One may explain (human) vision by noting that light from the outside world forms an image on the retinas in the eyes and something (or someone) in the brain looks at these images as if they are images on a movie screen (this theory of vision is sometimes termed the theory of the Cartesian theater: it is most associated, nowadays, with the psychologist David Marr). The question arises as to the nature of this internal viewer. The assumption here is that there is a \"little man\" or \"homunculus\" inside the brain \"looking at\" the movie.\n\nThe reason why this is a fallacy may be understood by asking how the homunculus \"sees\" the internal movie. The obvious answer is that there is another homunculus inside the first homunculus's \"head\" or \"brain\" looking at this \"movie\". But that raises the question of how \"this\" homunculus sees the \"outside world\". To answer that seems to require positing \"another\" homunculus inside this second homunculus's head, and so forth. In other words, a situation of infinite regress is created. The problem with the homunculus argument is that it tries to account for a phenomenon in terms of the very phenomenon that it is supposed to explain.\n\nAnother example is with cognitivist theories that argue that the human brain uses \"rules\" to carry out operations (these rules often conceptualised as being like the algorithms of a computer program). For example, in his work of the '50s, '60s and '70s Noam Chomsky argued that (in the words of one of his books) human beings use \"Rules and Representations\" (or to be more specific, rules acting on representations) in order to cognate (more recently Chomsky has abandoned this view; cf. the Minimalist Program).\n\nNow, in terms of (say) chess, the players are given 'rules' (i.e. the rules of chess) to follow. So: who \"uses\" these rules? The answer is self-evident: the players of the game (of chess) use the rules: it's not the case (obviously) that the rules \"themselves\" play chess. The rules themselves are merely inert marks on paper until a \"human being\" reads, understands and uses them. But what about the 'rules' that are, allegedly, inside our head (brain)? Who reads, understands and uses them? Again, the implicit answer is (and, some would argue, must be) a 'homunculus': a little man who reads the rules of the world and then gives orders to the body to act on them. But again we are in a situation of infinite regress, because this implies that the homunculus utilizes cognitive processes that are also rule bound, which presupposes another homunculus inside \"its\" head, and so on and so forth. Therefore, so the argument goes, theories of mind that imply or state explicitly that cognition is rule bound cannot be correct unless some way is found to 'ground' the regress.\n\nThis is important because it is often assumed in cognitive science that rules and algorithms are essentially the same: in other words, the theory that cognition is rule bound is often believed to imply that thought (cognition) is essentially the manipulation of algorithms, and \"this\" is one of the key assumptions of some varieties of artificial intelligence.\n\nHomunculus arguments are always fallacious unless some way can be found to 'ground' the regress. In psychology and philosophy of mind, 'homunculus arguments' (or the 'homunculus fallacies') are extremely useful for detecting where theories of mind fail or are incomplete.\n\nThe homunculus fallacy is closely related to Ryle's regress.\n\nThe above cited regress argument does not necessarily invalidate all forms of the homunculus argument. The regress relies on the idea that the homunculus 'inside' the brain must itself have a homunculus inside it but it is not clear that this is a necessary condition. A dualist might argue that the homunculus inside the brain is an immaterial one (such as the Cartesian soul), or a mystic might assert that the homunculus is a recharacterization of the infinite consciousness of God (or true self), and thereby does not require a homunculus (or any form, spiritual or material) to have sensory experience, since such experience is a self-aware expression of the universe requiring no end to the regress other than the present moment itself. A non-dualist may assert, similarly to the mystic, that a human life form (or any organism) is coterminous and indivisible from its environment, with this unified field of awareness (i.e., universal consciousness) mistaking itself for a homunculus (or an ego). A Neurosurgery professional may point to the cortical homunculus, a distorted representation of the human body, based on a neurological \"map\" of the areas and proportions of the brain dedicated to processing motor functions, or sensory functions, for different parts of the body. No evidence of further regress is present, indicating the presence of something akin to a soul. Thus, the regress argument is only valid if there can be no other explanation of the homunculus's cognition supplied, and the arguments of a first cause or a transcendental, formless consciousness (i.e., awareness underlying and beyond form) are rejected.\n\n"}
{"id": "6356193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6356193", "title": "I know it when I see it", "text": "I know it when I see it\n\nThe phrase \"I know it when I see it\" is a colloquial expression by which a speaker attempts to categorize an observable fact or event, although the category is subjective or lacks clearly defined parameters. The phrase was used in 1964 by United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart to describe his threshold test for obscenity in \"Jacobellis v. Ohio\". In explaining why the material at issue in the case was not obscene under the Roth test, and therefore was protected speech that could not be censored, Stewart wrote:\n\nThe expression became one of the best-known phrases in the history of the Supreme Court. Though \"I know it when I see it\" is widely cited as Stewart's test for \"obscenity\", he never used the word \"obscenity\" himself in his short concurrence. He only stated that he knows what fits the \"shorthand description\" of \"hard-core pornography\" when he sees it.\n\nStewart's \"I know it when I see it\" standard was praised as \"realistic and gallant\" and an example of candor. It has also been critiqued as being potentially fallacious, due to individualistic arbitrariness.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States' rulings concerning obscenity in the public square have been unusually inconsistent. Though First Amendment free speech protections have always been taken into account, both Constitutional interpretationalists and originalists have limited this right to account for public sensibilities. Before \"Roth v. United States\" in 1957, common law rules stemming from the 1868 English case \"Regina v. Hicklin\" have articulated that anything which \"deprave[s] and corrupt[s] those whose minds are open to such immoral influences\" was said to be obscene, and therefore banned. The Roth case gave a clearer standard for deciding what constitutes pornography, stating that obscenity is material where the \"dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest\", and that the \"average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would disapprove of, reaffirming the 1913 case \"United States v. Kennerley\". This standard allowed for many works to be called obscene, and though the Roth decision acknowledged \"all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance ... have the full protection of guaranties [sic]\", the Justices put public sensibility above the protection of individual rights.\n\n\"Jacobellis v. Ohio\" (1964) narrowed the scope of the Roth decision. Justice Potter Stewart, in his concurrence to the majority opinion, created the standard whereby all speech is protected except for \"hard-core pornography\". As for what, exactly, constitutes hard-core pornography, Stewart said \"I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.\" The film in question was Louis Malle's \"The Lovers\".\n\nThis was modified in \"Memoirs v. Massachusetts\" (1966), in which obscenity was defined as anything patently offensive, appealing to prurient interest, and of no redeeming social value. Still, however, this left the ultimate decision of what constituted obscenity up to the whim of the courts, and did not provide an easily applicable standard for review by the lower courts. This changed in 1973 with \"Miller v. California\". The Miller case established what came to be known as the Miller test, which clearly articulated that three criteria must be met for a work to be legitimately subject to state regulations. The Court recognized the inherent risk in legislating what constitutes obscenity, and necessarily limited the scope of the criteria. The criteria were:\n\n\nThe third criterion pertains to judgement made by \"reasonable persons\" of the United States as a whole, while the first two pertain to that of members of the local community. Due to the larger scope of the third test, it is a more ambiguous criterion than the first two.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "166132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166132", "title": "Immanuel Hermann Fichte", "text": "Immanuel Hermann Fichte\n\nImmanuel Hermann Fichte (; ; ennobled as Immanuel Hermann von Fichte in 1863; 18 July 1796 – 8 August 1879) was a German philosopher and son of Johann Gottlieb Fichte. In his philosophy, he was a theist and strongly opposed to the Hegelian School.\n\nFichte was born in Jena. He early devoted himself to philosophical studies, being attracted by the later views of his father, which he considered essentially theistic. He graduated from the University of Berlin in 1818. Soon after, he became a lecturer in philosophy there. He also attended the lectures of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, but felt averse to what he deemed to be his pantheistic tendencies. As a result of semi-official suggestions, based on official disapproval of his supposedly liberal views, he decided, in 1822, to leave Berlin, and accepted a professorship at the gymnasium in Saarbrücken. In 1826 he went in the same capacity to Düsseldorf. In 1836 he became an extraordinary professor of philosophy at the University of Bonn, and in 1840 full professor. Here he quickly became a successful and much admired lecturer. Dissatisfied with the reactionary tendencies of the Prussian Ministry of Education, he accepted a call to the chair of philosophy at the University of Tübingen in 1842 where he continued to give lectures on all philosophic subjects until his retirement in 1875 when he moved to Stuttgart. He died in Stuttgart on 8 August 1879.\n\nIn 1837, Fichte founded the \"Zeitschrift für Philosophie und speculative Theologie\" and edited from then on. In 1847, the name was changed to \"Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik\". Publication was suspended 1848–1852, after which Hermann Ulrici and Johann Ulrich Wirth joined him as editors. This journal served as an organ of Fichte's views, especially on the subject of the philosophy of religion, where he was in alliance with C. H. Weisse (with whom he regularly corresponded after 1829); but, whereas Weisse thought that the Hegelian structure was sound in the main, and its imperfections might be mended, Fichte held it to be defective, and spoke of it as a masterpiece of erroneous consistency or consistent error. Fichte's general views on philosophy seem to have changed considerably as he gained in years, and his influence has been impaired by certain inconsistencies and an appearance of eclecticism, which is strengthened by his predominantly historical treatment of systems, his desire to include divergent systems within his own, and his conciliatory tone.\n\nThe great aim of his speculations was to find a philosophic basis for the personality of God, and for his theory on this subject he proposed the term \"concrete theism.\" His philosophy attempts to reconcile monism (Hegel) and individualism (Herbart) by means of monadism (Leibniz). He attacks Hegelianism for its pantheism, lowering of human personality, and imperfect recognition of demands of the moral consciousness. God, he says, is to be regarded not as an absolute but as an Infinite Person, whose desire it is that he should realize himself in finite persons. These persons are objects of God's love, and he arranges the world for their good. The direct connecting link between God man is the genius, a higher spiritual individuality existing fan by the side of his lower, earthly individuality. Fichte advocates an ethical theism, and his arguments might be turned to account by the apologist of Christianity. In conception of finite personality he recurs to something like monadism of Leibniz. His insistence on moral experience connected with his insistence on personality.\n\nOne of the tests which Fichte discriminates the value of previous systems is adequateness with which they interpret moral experience. The same reason that made him depreciate Hegel made him praise Krause (panentheism) and Schleiermacher, and speak respectfully of English philosophy. It is characteristic of Fichte's most excessive receptiveness that in his latest published work, \"Der neuere Spiritualismus\" (1878), he supports his position by arguments of a somewhat occult or theosophical cast, not unlike that adopted by F. W. H. Myers.\n\nThe regeneration of Christianity, according to Fichte, would consist in its becoming the vital and organizing power in the state, instead of being occupied solely, as heretofore, with the salvation of individuals.\n\n\nHe also edited the complete works and literary correspondence of his father. Some of his works were translated by J. D. Morell under the title of \"Contributions to Mental Philosophy\" (1860).\n\n"}

The son of a priest (of Liessau), he studied (after 1783) mathematics and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, where Christian Jakob Kraus, Johann Schultz, and Immanuel Kant were his teachers. After his studies he first accepted a post as a teacher at a grammar school in Halle. With his thesis \"Dissertatio de Theoremate Tayloriano, sive de lege generali, secundum quam functionis mutantur, notatis a quibus pendent variabilibus\", which he wrote in Halle, he was qualified as a university lecturer. He then worked as a lecturer of philosophy at the University of Halle (1791–1799), before be became a professor of philosophy at the University of Rostock. He devoted himself to criticism and explanation of the doctrine of Kant, and in 1793 published the \"Erläuternder Auszug aus den kritischen Schriften des Herrn Prof. Kant, auf Anrathen desselben\" (Riga, 1793–1796), which has been widely used as a compendium of Kantian doctrine.\n\nBeck endeavoured to explain away certain of the contradictions which are found in Kant's system by saying that much of the language is used in a popular sense for the sake of intelligibility, e.g. where Kant attributes to things-in-themselves an existence under the conditions of time, space and causality, and yet holds that they furnish the material of our apprehensions. Beck maintains that the real meaning of Kant's theory is idealism; that knowledge of objects outside the domain of consciousness is impossible, and hence that nothing positive remains when we have removed the subjective element. Matter is deduced by the original synthesis. Similarly, the idea of God is a symbolic representation of the voice of conscience guiding from within. The value of Beck's exegesis has been to a great extent overlooked owing to the greater attention given to the work of J. G. Fichte. Beside the three volumes of the \"Erläuternder Auszug\", he published the \"Grundriss der kritischen Philosophie\" (1796), containing an interpretation of the Kantian \"Kritik\" in the manner of Salomon Maimon.\n\nBeck died in Rostock.\n\n"}

He was a lifelong member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and, in 1917, served as its deputy for Bessarabia in the Russian Constituent Assembly. He joined the Samara Government during the early phases of the Civil War, opposing both the Bolsheviks and the conservative elements of the White movement. Assigned to his party's Foreign Delegation, Slonim lobbied unsuccessfully for the return of Bessarabia to Russia during the Paris Peace Conference. After a short stay in Tuscany, he settled in Czechoslovakia in 1922, an editor of \"Volya Rossii\" review.\n\nSlonim, who was also an Italian-trained literary scholar, became \"Volya Rossii\"s literary theorist and columnist. From that vantage point, he gave encouraged the liberal-progressive and modernist side of the White émigré intellectuals. Slonim argued, against conservatives such as Zinaida Gippius, that the exiles needed to appreciate changes occurring in the Soviet Union and became one of the first popularizers of Soviet writers in the West. He was also one of the main backers (and an intimate friend) of poet Marina Tsvetaeva.\n\nIn 1928, convinced that Russian literature in exile was in fact dead, Slonim moved to Paris and, as an anti-fascist, opened up to Soviet patriotism. His 1930s contacts with the Union for Repatriation were particularly controversial. He escaped World War II and arrived to the United States aboard the SS \"Navemar\", spending the 1940s and '50s as a teacher at Sarah Lawrence College. He continued to publish tracts and textbooks on Russian literary topics, familiarizing the American public with the major trends of Soviet poetry and fiction. He spent his final years in Geneva, where he translated Andrei Bely's \"Silver Dove\" and worked sporadically on his memoirs.\n\nSlonim was born in the Russian Empire's port city of Odessa (now in Ukraine), although some sources have Novgorod-Severskiy, Chernihiv Governorate. His parents were upper-middle-class Russian Jewish intellectuals; Slonim's uncle was the literary critic Yuly Aykhenvald. The future critic was also a distant relative of Yevsey Lazarevich Slonim, whose daughter, Vera Yevseyevna, became the wife of novelist Vladimir Nabokov. According to Russologist Michel Aucouturier, Slonim's memoirs show him as an erudite and an adept of aestheticism, whose \"socialist sympathies\" were only cemented by the Russian Revolution. While completing his secondary studies at a classical gymnasium in Odessa, Slonim came into contact with the Socialist Revolutionaries (or \"Esers\"), and, like his older brother Vladimir before him, became their follower. Their radicalism pitied them against their father, who supported the moderate-liberal Kadet Party.\n\nSlonim, who regarded himself as a libertarian socialist rather than a Marxist, worked on establishing \"self-instruction circles\", circulating banned literature among students, artisans and workers, and traveled to Europe to meet with Osip Minor. As he recalled in the 1960s, the Eser leadership was \"appalled to discover than in Odessa and the nearby region most of the work was being done by boys and girls of 16 or 17.\" According to later sources, he was brought to the attention of the Okhrana and left Russia surreptitiously. From 1911, he studied philosophy and literature at the University of Florence, where he took his Ph.D. In 1914, he published in Italy a translation of Ivan Turgenev's poetry cicle, \"Senility\". By 1918, Slonim was also a graduate of Saint Petersburg Imperial University.\n\nUpon the start of World War I, Slonim followed the \"defensist\" line of the Eser mainstream, supporting Russia's commitment to the Allies, and served in the Imperial Army. The February Revolution caught him on the Romanian Front, but he soon returned to Petrograd, where (Aucouturier writes) \"his talents as a propagandist and an orator soon made him one of his party's celebrities\". Slonim supported the Russian Provisional Government and its \"defensist\" policies against the Left Esers, with public disputations against Vladimir Karelin and Maria Spiridonova. According to Slonim, he was one of the youths left in charge of party work: the more senior Esers were either in government or consumed by work in the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.\n\nIn his memoirs, Slonim claims to have foreseen the danger posed by the reorganized Bolsheviks, having heard their leader, Vladimir Lenin, speak. He contrasts Bolshevik unity with the Esers' indecisiveness and factionalism. He was still active after the October Revolution, which placed Russia under a Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars. Slonim became an Eser candidate for the Russian Constituent Assembly in the November 25 election, running in the southwestern province of Bessarabia. He took his seat in the Eser landslide win, and, aged 23, was the youngest parliamentarian. Days after, Bessarabia formed its own government as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, and remained undecided about its future within the Russian Republic. The elections for the Constituent Assembly were chaotic, and the results were never fully recorded.\n\nSlonim was present in the Assembly on the morning of January 19, 1918, when the Bolsheviks dissolved it by force and opened fire on the supporting crowds. For a while, he was in the Ukrainian State, helping Gregory Zilboorg put out a clandestine paper which angered both the Bolsheviks and the Ukrainian nationalists. He later fled to Samara, where the Constituent Assembly had formed its own \"Committee of Members\" government. He joined the latter, then, upon its merger into the Provisional All-Russian Government, moved to Omsk. As the Russian Civil War took hold of the countryside, Slonim followed the Czechoslovak Legion and became friends with its leaders, trailing across Siberia under an assumed name. Nevertheless, he disliked the concept of Allied intervention, and moved closer to the Left Esers. His party sent him abroad as a member of its Foreign Delegation, which originally existed to put persuade the West not to recognize Alexander Kolchak as Russia's Supreme Ruler.\n\nIn November 1918, Slonim had lost his Bessarabian constituency, as the region united with Romania. The writer became a strong critic of that merger, claiming that the Romanian identity in both Romania and Bessarabia had been recently fabricated by intellectuals, lacking popular support among the Moldavian peasants (\"see Moldovenism\"). Slonim also claimed that the union process had been triggered by the German Empire in late 1917, as an anti-Bolshevik move, and supported by Russians who had discarded \"personal and national dignity.\" Building on such arguments, Slonim depicted the Russian Empire as a functional and organic economic entity, suggesting that Bessarabia had more in common with Ukraine than with Romania.\n\nHe also argued that Bessarabia had not been renounced by Russia, not truly annexed by the Romanian Kingdom. \"Sooner of later\", he suggested, \"there must come about [Bessarabia's] reunion with the Russian State.\" Acknowledging that there was a \"united front\" between the White movement and Soviet Russia on the Bessarabian issue, he proposed to overcome the impasse by organizing a League of Nations referendum in the former Moldavian Republic. Scholar Charles Upson Clark, who sees Slonim's accounts as among \"the best [...] from the Russian standpoint\", rejects his theory about the German inspiration for the union, noting that it was in fact a traditional Romanian goal.\n\nSlonim joined a self-appointed team of politicians and landowners who claimed to speak for Bessarabia, and attended the Paris Peace Conference to lobby for the Russian cause. Among the other members of this body were Alexander N. Krupensky, Alexandr K. Schmidt, Vladimir Tsyganko, and Mihail Savenco. Slonim, seconded by Tsyganko, circulated rumors of \"unheard-of atrocities\" committed by the Romanian Army, such as the massacre of 53 people in one village of Hotin County, and the torturing of many others. Interviewed by \"L'Humanité\", the French Communist Party paper, Slonim also claimed the socialists were being repressed, and that unconditional union had been voted on \"under the menace of machine guns\". These statements were rejected outright by the Bessarabian unionists: Ion Inculeț, the former President of the Moldavian Republic, called the interview \"idiotic\", while his aide Ion Pelivan wrote to \"L'Humanité\" to restate that the union was expressing the free will of the Bessarabian people. In his notes, Pelivan referred to Slonim as a \"deserter\", an \"impostor\", and a Belarusian Jew.\n\nSlonim spent the years 1919–1922 in Tuscany, becoming a regular contributor to the leftist daily \"Il Secolo\". In an article of August 1920, he opined that only \"peace with Russia\" and \"the complete renunciation of all intervention into [her] internal affairs\" could ensure the demise of \"Bolshevist imperialism\". That year, he published at H. Bemporad & figlio an Italian-language work on the revolutionary ideologies of Béla Kun and the Spartacus League, eponymously titled \"Spartaco e Bela Kun\", and two memoirs: \"La rivoluzione russa\" (\"The Russian Revolution\"), and \"Il bolscevismo visto da un russo\" (\"Bolshevism as Seen by a Russian\"). The latter was translated into French the following year, as \"Le Bolchévisme vu par un russe\". \"La Revue Critique des Idées et des Livres\" described it as \"abundant in little facts from experience\", a fresco \"of the general misery, terror and fright that have been reigning in Russia for these past three years.\" His thoughts on communism brought him to the attention of Benito Mussolini, leader of the Fasci Italiani, who invited Slonim to write for \"Il Popolo d'Italia\". Slonim explained that he would never write for the right-wing press; in a later reply, Mussolini insisted that his budding fascist movement was not in fact reactionary.\n\nAnother work, tracing the historical background of Bolshevism and the Esers, appeared in 1921 as \"Da Pietro il Grande a Lenin: Storia del movimento rivoluzionario in Russia\" (\"From Peter the Great to Lenin: History of the Revolutionary Movement in Russia\"); a French edition came out in 1933, at Éditions Gallimard. Slonim followed up with an essay on Bolshevik Proletkult and Futurism, taken up by Henri Grégoire's monthly, \"Le Flambeau\" (October 1921). At this early stage, Slonim derided Soviet literary productions, and described the better poets (Alexander Blok and Andrei Bely) as incompatible with communist dogmas.\n\nAfter a short stay in Berlin, during which time he issued his own journal, \"Novosti Literatury\", Slonim settled in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he taught at the Russian Free University and joined the local \"Zemgor\". He was also co-opted to write for the Russian-language émigré magazine \"Volya Rossii\" (\"Russia's Will\", \"Russia's Freedom\", or \"Russia's Free Will\"). Its editorial board included Slonim (editorial secretary to 1923, later full editor), Sergey Postnikov, Evsei Stalinskii, Vasily Sukhomlin, and Vladimir I. Lebedev. The former four were all members of the Eser Foreign Delegation; Lebedev was not.\n\nOccupying a Prague building which had reputedly housed Mozart, and also gathering for conversations at \"Národní kavárna\" café, the circle members networked with European policymakers such as Aristide Briand, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, and Émile Vandervelde. Although it published noted works of literature, including Marina Tsvetaeva's \"Rat-Catcher\", \"Volya Rossii\" had a small readership. It depended largely on Czechoslovak government support, but the subsidies grew thinner by the year. Originally a daily in 1920, it became a weekly in 1922, and a monthly in 1923.\n\nFrom its relaunch in 1923, \"Volya Rossii\" was primarily noted as an exponent of the political left, and as such a rival of the more eclectic, Paris-based, \"Sovremennye Zapiski\". Its acceptance of various Bolshevik reforms made it close to the \"Mladorossi\" émigrés, but the magazine saw itself as eminently Narodnik, carrying through the ideology of Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Chernyshevsky. Beyond them, Slonim saw himself as a legatee of the Decembrists. \"Volya Rossii\" was explicitly against the Kadet émigrés in Paris, and fought with their leader, Pyotr Struve, for control over the Russian Free University. It also took a secular approach to anti-communism, decrying the émigrés' debt to Russian Orthodoxy—the church, Slonim asserted, was not a true foundation of Russian identity and culture. These positions were summarized in Slonim's sarcastic characterization of \"Sovremennye Zapiski\", a \"non-partisan voice of the liberal-democratic broad front, with some tendencies that are sometimes socialist, sometimes religious.\"\n\n\"Volya Rossii\" stated its support for \"moral socialism\", relying on \"the spontaneous activity and creativity of the masses.\" While the group rallied around Slonim's ideas about Russian organicism and post-imperial federalism, it also firmly rejected expressions of Russian nationalism, envisioning a Russia that rejected \"all differences of faith, race or religion\". Slonim himself was a noted adversary of Eurasianism and theories of Russian exceptionalism, which understood Bolshevism as compatible with nationalist ideas. He interpreted Bolshevism as a \"Jacobin\" experiment in state control; he still believed in the regime's inevitable failure, and in the reemergence of democratic Russia. However, as he reported to Alexander Kerensky, the Prague Esers feared the growth of the Czechoslovakia's Communist Party, which could turn on the émigré community.\n\nWhile contributing articles on political news and historical sketches, as well as impressions from a 1926 trip to the United States and a 1928 homage to Prague, Slonim became the main literary chronicler at \"Volya Rossii\". He believed that the importance of Russian literature was to be found in its ability to convey \"the vital problems of individual and social existence\", and hoped that this tradition would be carried on in exile: \"We know that the best among [émigré writers] made their way through suffering and struggle.\" Before 1925, Slonim focused his polemics on Zinaida Gippius, whose articles in \"Sovremennye Zapiski\" prophesied the death of Russian literature. Chiding the \"old guard\" of Russian literati, he argued instead that modern literature was thriving both in Russia and in exile. From then on, Gippius came to regard Slonim with intense hostility, particularly since he also promoted Tsvetaeva, her personal enemy.\n\nWhile their Acmeist rival Georgy Adamovich wanted to see through the emergence of a Russian psychological novel, Slonim and Ivan Bunin believed that psychological introspection and social realism could still blend into a coherent whole: \"spiritual vicissitudes had to be illustrated from the outside so that the reader could see them.\" They urged émigrés to follow modernist developments and replicate steps taken in Soviet literature. As a reviewer of Soviet works, Slonim identified echoes of the 19th-century philosophical and political epics, showing up in novels by Yevgeny Zamyatin, Boris Pasternak, Vsevolod Ivanov and Yury Olesha. He looked with political optimism to the unfolding of the New Economic Policy, which took Russia back to grassroots capitalism. Slonim searched for clues that communist writers were growing disenchanted with the Soviet state, and kept records about the \"more tiresome and woeful\" literature of agitprop.\n\nIn order to illustrate such points, \"Volya Rossii\" published fragments of works by Zamyatin, but also by Isaac Babel and Mikhail Sholokhov, alongside Guillaume Apollinaire or Karel Čapek. \"Volya Rossii\" soon patronized a generation of émigré modernists, beginning with Tsvetaeva and Aleksey Remizov, followed later by Nina Berberova, Dovid Knut, Valentin Parnakh, Vladimir Pozner, Gleb Struve, and Yuri Terapiano. However, Slonim's encouragement had a perverse effect: in Russia, authors praised by Slonim or sampled in \"Volya Rossii\" were singled out as potential enemies of the regime. In 1927, the magazine hosted fragments from Zamyatin's novel \"We\", the first publication of that work in its original Russian. In order not to expose the author's direct contacts with the émigrés, Slonim claimed that these were back-translations from Czech and English reprints. Later, Slonim's positive reviews of \"Krasnaya Nov'\" magazine were used against its editor, Aleksandr Voronsky, who was eventually purged from the Soviet Communist Party.\n\nSlonim became a backer of Tsvetaeva and her husband Sergei Efron, who had settled in Prague. Together with Salomeya Halpern, Hélène Iswolsky, D. S. Mirsky and Lebedev, he organized a Committee to Assist Marina Tsvetaeva. He became a friend, confidant, and dedicated promoter of Tsvetaeva, even though she declined interest in Eser ideology and political matters in general. They continued to disagree over politics, whenever Tsvetaeva made a public show of her loyalty for the House of Romanov. Their liaison had romantic undertones: to Tsvetaeva, he was \"the dear one\", and his departure to be with another woman inspired her to write the poem \"Attempt at Jealousy\". Thinking that she held an idealized view of him, Slonim, newly separated from his first wife, rejected her advances in 1924, but they remained friends. He was critical of her affair with K. B. Rodzevitch, whom he regarded as a \"dull, mediocre\" man.\n\nBy the late 1920s, Slonim had come to share Gippius' opinion that Russian literature in exile was doomed, its links with the Russian soil forever severed. He noted that, from 1926 on, the Foreign Delegation had only relied on Soviet publications for understanding the goings-on in Russia, and argued that Soviet literature could be followed for its documentary value. He himself published an introduction to Russian literature in the 1927 edition of \"Slovanský Přehled\". His skepticism was also showing in his political essays, where he asserted that the Eser cause had been stifled by the 1922 Show Trials. By then, the Esers' Prague group had become torn between two camps, each accusing the other of serving the Soviets. One was led by Viktor Chernov, the other (comprising the \"Volya Rossii\" group) was headed by Sukhomlin. Slonim also had a quarrel with writer Vasily Yanovsky—reportedly, because he commented on Yanovsky's poor use of Russian and his borrowings from Mikhail Artsybashev.\n\nIn 1927, Slonim purchased a printing press in Paris, where he hoped to relaunch \"Volya Rossii\". He ultimately abandoned the plan and, in 1928, simply relocated to Paris, together with Stalinskii and Sukhomlin. They reinforced a Russian colony that was just growing in importance, as French interest in Russian affairs was about to peak. \"Volya Rossii\" continued to appear in Prague until March 1932, when it closed down as a result of the Chernov scandal. In its last years, it supported the Right Opposition and the Five-Year Plan, seeing them as evidence of Soviet normalization, and a promise for Eser uprisings. Lebedev even claimed to have traveled inside the Soviet Union. Slonim remained skeptical of this \"mysticism\", while also noting that the expanding Stalinist regime had emerged from industrialization as a \"petty bourgeois\" force, its appeal increased among émigré monarchists and Eurasianists. His articles were regularly featured in other émigré publications: \"Sotsialist-Revolyutsioner\", \"Problemy\" and \"Novaya Gazeta\" in Paris; \"Russkiy Arkhiv\" of Belgrade; and the American \"Moskva\".\n\nSlonim was focusing his attention on writing counter-propaganda descriptions of Socialist Realism, which was entering the official Soviet literary and political discourse under Joseph Stalin. Readers of his work provide contrasting reviews: Aucouturier finds his 1930 study on \"Stalinism in Literature\" \"important\"; however, according to the Russian sociologist Evgeny Dobrenko, Slonim's contribution here \"overstep[s] the boundaries of scholarship.\" Although he still upheld the old Narodnik values, Slonim favored aestheticism and formalism over social determinism, and, on these grounds, criticized Pavel Milyukov's work in literary history. He also looked for tensions between the official dogma and writers who still cultivated individualism in its various forms, citing works by Pasternak, Artyom Vesyoly, Yury Libedinsky, and Leonid Leonov. He welcomed Stalin's decision to disband the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers, seeing it as a \"Charter of Liberation\" for the nonconformist authors.\n\nIn Paris, Slonim set up his own literary society, \"Kochev'ye\" (\"Camp of Nomads\"), its name probably alluding to the primitivist aesthetics of the Left Esers. It held weekly session opposite Gare Montparnasse, until 1938, when it dissolved. Like Nikolai Berdyaev and Nicholas Zernov, Slonim also attached himself to the French Catholic circles, which welcomed Russian liberals who were at once anti-communist and anti-fascist. He was also close to avant-garde painters Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova, whom he introduced to Efron and Tsvetaeva when the latter couple also settled in Paris. In 1933, he attended a symposium grouping \"Chisla\" magazine writers and members of the French Communist Party, discussing André Gide's account of life in the Soviet Union. The meeting veered into scandal when (according to Slonim's account) he took the rostrum and informed both camps that Gide was not in fact a convert to communism, and that \"instead of making loud pronouncement they had better read Gide's oeuvre.\"\n\nSlonim's work diversified, and he became a literary impresario, founding, with George Reavey, the European Literary Bureau. It had contracts with Berdyaev, Samuel Beckett, André Malraux and Jacques Maritain. He also worked on translations and on editing books for print: in 1930, Čestmír Jeřábek's \"Svět hoří\"; and in 1934, Adèle Hommaire de Hell's \"Mémoires d'une aventurière\". Together with Reavey, he put out one of the first collections of Russian prose rendered in English (1934), which is also noted for its inclusion of Socialist Realists Alexander Fadeyev and Feodor Gladkov. With Gide's help, Slonim and Reavey's anthology of Soviet literature came at Gallimard in 1935, and possibly included unsigned translations by Tsvetaeva. Slonim was by then also publishing regular literary chronicles, turning his attention to works by William Faulkner, Peter Neagoe, and D. H. Lawrence.\n\nSlonim was for years critical of émigrés who asked to be resettled in the Soviet Union, denouncing Efron's work for the NKVD-sponsored Union for Repatriation. In 1935, he finally met Zamyatin, who had escaped Russia, and they \"became very good friends\"—before Zamyatin's sudden illness and death. In 1934, Slonim had resumed his conferencing on Lenin, networking with Italian anti-fascists such as Oddino Morgari and Alberto Meschi, and being followed around by Mussolini's OVRA.\n\nSlonim and Lebedev became alarmed by the rise of Nazi Germany, and predicted that it would attack the Soviet Union with support from the right-wing exiles. With this in mind, they founded in 1936 a Russian Émigré Defensist Movement (REOD), its newspaper edited by Slonim. Slonim came to agree with the basic tenets of Soviet thinking: he believed that democracy was doomed, and that the world was becoming split into two camps, of communism and fascism. He formulated his preference into a socialist-patriotic manifesto: \"The defensist joyfully greets all tidings of the internal and external successes of Russia. When a new factory is built in the Soviet Union, when a strong army is created, when a heroic ﬂight is made, when important discoveries are made and when a talented book is written, the defensist feels a sense of pride.\"\n\nHe put out in 1935 a sympathetic book on the ill-fated expedition of \"SS\" Chelyuskin, followed in 1937 by \"Les onzes républiques soviétiques\" (\"The Eleven Soviet Republics\"), at Éditions Payot. The latter book was well-liked in the Soviet Union itself, and recommended by Intourist, but criticized by Pierre Pascal for its geographical and historical inaccuracies. In 1938, Slonim also translated Viktor Shklovsky's \"Voyage de Marco Polo\". However, he had grown more appreciative of the \"Sovremennye Zapiski\" writers, and in 1939, published generous commentary on Vladimir Nabokov's work, beginning with \"King, Queen, Knave\". That year, Slonim also completed a version of Bunin's \"Liberation of Tolstoy\", published by Gallimard but disliked by the author.\n\nWhen Lebedev abandoned the REOD and moved to America in 1936, Slonim continued his work. This was an especially controversial decision, as the REOD became exposed for its links with the Union for Repatriation and the NKVD. Slonim ultimately presented his resignation in July 1938. In June 1939, he met Tsvetaeva one final time in Paris, as she and Efron began their return trip to the Soviet Union. Slonim was still in Paris after the Nazi–Soviet Pact and before the Nazi invasion of France. Arrested for his contacts with the French communists, he was sent to a French concentration camp. By August 1941, he was in Spain, taking the SS \"Navemar\" from Seville to New York City. He completed the journey, despite the \"Navemar\"s \"criminally inadequate\" facilities, alongside friends Zosa Szajkowski and Mark Zborowski.\n\nSlonim initially lectured on Russian topics at Yale, Chicago and Penn, before becoming, in 1943, a professor of Russian and comparative literature at Sarah Lawrence College, Yonkers. While publishing various pieces in American academic journals, Slonim also contributed to the Jewish cultural review \"Yevreiski Mir\". In a 1944 article for that magazine (quoted favorably by scholar Simon Markish), he denied the existence of a separate Jewish literature in Russia, proposing that Jewish authors were merely Russian authors. His stance in this far-reaching debate about Jewish assimilation was similar to that of his uncle Aykhenvald, including their proposed reference to Jewish writers as \"writers who are Jews\". In late 1944, he lectured at the Phillips Academy East and West Association on the issue of Russia–United States relations.\n\nSlonim was viewed with caution by the American Esers. They investigated his REOD activity and concluded that he had shown callousness, and had mixed with NKVD envoys, but cleared him of allegations that he had been a spy himself. Following the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, Slonim and his colleagues, reunited in New York City, resumed the \"defensist\" line, unconditionally; Chernov took a more moderate stance. In February 1945, Slonim finally met Nabokov at a dinner party in New York. Nabokov dismissed him as a Soviet agent, and probably used him as an inspiration for the novella \"Double Talk\". Nabokov's reading is dismissed by his exegetes: Vladimir E. Alexandrov speaks of Nabokov's \"unjustified suspicions, including his snubbing of Marc Slonim\"; Brian Boyd also notes that Slonim \"was in fact firmly against Stalin and the Soviet system.\" Before 1950, Slonim was again banned in the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc: copies of \"Le Bolchévisme vu par un russe\" were confiscated on sight by the Romanian Propaganda Ministry.\n\nIn 1950, Oxford University Press released Slonim's literary panorama, \"The Epic of Russian Literature from Its Origins Through Tolstoy\". According to the \"Revue des Études Slaves\", it was an \"intelligent and alert\" work, appealing \"to the cultivated public rather than the specialists\". \"The Epic\", echoing the approach of Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé, focused on the 19th-century novels and debates, being more dismissive of earlier literature. He followed up in 1953 with a second volume, \"Modern Russian Literature\", covering the period from Anton Chekhov to the 1950s, and a biographical study, \"Tri lyubi Dostoyevskogo\" (\"Three Loves of Dostoevsky\"). He returned to Italy on a research trip, employed by La Sapienza University's Institute for Slavic Philology, and, in 1954, edited the collection \"Modern Italian Short Stories\". In 1954, at the height of McCarthyism, he appeared before the Jenner Committee, dismissing rumors of communist activities at Sarah Lawrence.\n\nAdditionally, Slonim worked with Harvey Breit on a Signet anthology of love stories, which appeared in 1955 as \"This Thing Called Love\". In 1959, he lectured at Vassar on Pasternak's philosophical outlook. A year later, he commemorated Pasternak by moderating a round table for Radio Liberty. Guests included Reavey, B. J. Chute, Herbert Gold, Ferenc Körmendi, and Santha Rama Rau. Also in 1960, he collected and edited for print selections from Mikhail Zoshchenko's satires (as \"Izbrannoe\"). In parallel, he arranged for print the diaries of Leonid Andreyev. That project was put on hold by son Vadim Andreyev, for fear that disclosing his father's opinions on Bolshevism would make the ban on his work permanent.\n\nAccording to Aucouturier, Slonim stands out as \"one of the first independent critics of the USSR's literary output [and] a pioneer of Soviet literary historiography in the Occident.\" Italian writer Italo Calvino, who visited Sarah Lawrence College in 1959, called Slonim \"the most famous expert on Russian literature in America\". Philologist Melissa Frazier sees him as an \"incredibly significant figure in the phenomenon of Russian émigré culture\". She notes: \"Slonim did a lot more in the way of plot summary—but in the polarized world of the Cold War, even plot summary was hugely important. [...] He was one of the few in the West actually reading what was being written in the Soviet Union with the recognition that there were still great writers who had stayed behind.\"\n\nSlonim retired from Sarah Lawrence in 1962, and from teaching in 1965, living the rest of his life in Switzerland, where he was animator of a Russian literary club. In 1963–1964, from his new home in Geneva, Slonim worked on an English version of Andrei Bely's \"Silver Dove\", and corresponded over literary details with Maria Olsufyeva, who had finished translating that same novel into Italian. Slonim's last standalone book was the 1964 textbook \"Soviet Russian Literature. Writers and Problems\", praised by \"Revue des Études Slaves\" for its \"sense of balance\", but criticized for its \"allusive nature\". Social historian Lawrence H. Schwartz notes its \"vitriolic\" critique of the Union of Soviet Writers.\n\nSlonim also contributed regularly to reviews and encyclopedias, answering queries posed by his younger colleagues, and supporting the Sarah Lawrence graduate program in Switzerland. Some of his final articles defended a fellow critic, Andrei Sinyavsky, who had angered the Soviet establishment with his reading of Alexander Pushkin. In late 1968, he staged a letter writing campaign in support of the Soviet writer-dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. His historical essay on \"Volya Rossii\" was published in 1972, as part of Nikolai Poltoratsky's review of Russian literature in exile. He also arranged for print Sofiya Pregel's \"Last Poems\" (1973).\n\nSlonim died in 1976 in the French resort of Beaulieu-sur-Mer. His incomplete memoirs, covering the period up to October 1917, were handed by his widow, Tatiana, to Aucouturier, who published them in \"Cahiers du Monde Russe et Soviétique\". Tatiana Slonim continued to live in Geneva. In 1986, she donated her husband's 16th-century copy of the \"Theotokos of Vladimir\" to the city's Art and History Museum.\n\n"}

He was the son of William Middleton Campbell, Governor of the Bank of England. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nCampbell became a fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1902. He was also a research assistant at the Cavendish Laboratory under the direction of J. J. Thomson. He became an honorary fellow in physics research at Leeds University in 1913, then worked from 1919 to 1944 as a member of the research staff at General Electric in London.\n\nCampbell's 1921 book, \"What Is Science?\", was written with the professed aim of encouraging the study of science in the classes of the Workers' Educational Association. This book is a short introduction to the philosophy of science aimed at a lay audience. Other than attempting to answer the question raised in the title of the book, it tries to answer some of the central questions of the philosophy of science, such as \"what is a law of nature?\" and \"what is measurement\".\n\nCampbell had a particular regard for the ideas and teaching ability of Michael Faraday.\n\nOther publications by Campbell include \"Modern Electrical Theory\" (1907 with supplementary chapters 1921-23), \"The Principles of Electricity\" (1912) and \"An Account of the Principles of Measurement and Calculation\" (1928). His most important work on the philosophy of science was his \"Foundations of Science: The Philosophy of Theory and Experiment\", first published as \"Physics: The Elements\" in 1919 with a second edition appearing posthumously in 1957. In this book Campbell developed his thesis that a critical analysis of science might not require any philosophy at all, but that an investigation of the meaning of reality and truth in science as opposed to metaphysics might be fruitful. Campbell believed that what might be considered \"truth\" in the realm of science might not be applicable at all in other fields.\n\nCampbell considered that the fundamental function of a scientific theory was to develop and explain laws, defined as uniformities discovered by hypothesis, observation and experiment and verifiable from experience. He also maintained that, to be useful, such laws should display some analogy to other known laws developed by the scientific method.\n\nCampbell died in 1949.\n\n"}
{"id": "169553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169553", "title": "Online dating service", "text": "Online dating service\n\nOnline dating (or Internet dating) is a system that enables people to find and introduce themselves to new personal connections over the Internet, usually with the goal of developing personal, romantic, or sexual relationships. An online dating service is a company that provides specific mechanisms (generally websites or applications) for online dating through the use of Internet-connected personal computers or mobile devices. Such companies offer a wide variety of unmoderated matchmaking services, most of which are profile-based.\n\nOnline dating services allow users to become \"members\" by creating a profile and uploading personal information including (but not limited to) age, gender, sexual orientation, location, and appearance. Most services also encourage members to add photos or videos to their profile. Once a profile has been created, members can view the profiles of other members of the service, using the visible profile information to decide whether or not to initiate contact. Most services offer digital messaging, while others provide additional services such as webcasts, online chat, telephone chat (VOIP), and message boards. Members can constrain their interactions to the online space, or they can arrange a date to meet in person.\n\nA great diversity of online dating services currently exists. Some have a broad membership base of diverse users looking for many different types of relationships. Other sites target highly specific demographics based on features like shared interests, location, religion, or relationship type. Online dating services also differ widely in their revenue streams. Some sites are completely free and depend on advertising for revenue. Others utilize the freemium revenue model, offering free registration and use, with optional, paid, premium services. Still others rely solely on paid membership subscriptions.\n\nOpinions and usage of online dating services also differ widely. A 2005 study of data collected by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that individuals are more likely to use an online dating service if they use the Internet for a greater number of tasks, and less likely to use such a service if they are trusting of others. It is possible that the mode of online dating resonates with some participants' conceptual orientation towards the process of finding a romantic partner. That is, online dating sites use the conceptual framework of a \"marketplace metaphor\" to help people find potential matches, with layouts and functionalities that make it easy to quickly browse and select profiles in a manner similar to how one might browse an online store. Under this metaphor, members of a given service can both \"shop\" for potential relationship partners and \"sell\" themselves in hopes of finding a successful match.\n\nAt the end of November 2004, there were 844 lifestyle and dating sites, a 38% increase since the start of the year, according to Hitwise Inc. The stigma associated with online dating dropped over the years and people view online dating more positively. The 2006 Pew Internet & American Life Project on Online Dating noted an increase in usage of online dating sites by Americans to pursue their romantic interests. About one in ten respondents reported visiting these online dating websites. In 2005–2012, about 34.95% of Americans reported meeting their spouses online. The 2016 Pew Research Center's survey reveals that the usage of online dating sites by American adults increased from 9% in 2013, to 12% in 2015. Further, during this period, the usage among 18- to 24-year-olds tripled, while that among 55- to 65-year-olds doubled.\n\nOnline daters may have more liberal social attitudes compared to the general population in the United States. According to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center, 80% of the users, and 55% of non-users, said that online dating sites are a good way to meet potential partners. In addition, respondents felt that online dating is easier, more efficient than other methods, and gives access to a larger pool of potential partners. Increased dating and marriage outside traditional social circles may be a contributing factor to coincident societal changes, including rising rates of interracial marriage. On the other hand, about 45% respondents felt that online dating is more dangerous compared to other methods. Views on online dating were similar across genders, with women expressing more concerns about safety than men.\n\nSites with specific demographics have become popular as a way to narrow the pool of potential matches. Successful niche sites pair people by race, sexual orientation or religion. In March 2008, the top 5 overall sites held 7% less market share than they did one year ago while the top sites from the top five major niche dating categories made considerable gains. Niche sites cater to people with special interests, such as sports fans, racing and automotive fans, medical or other professionals, people with political or religious preferences (e.g., Hindu, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, etc.), people with medical conditions (e.g., HIV+, obese), or those living in rural farm communities.\n\nIn 2008, a variation of the online dating model emerged in the form of introduction sites, where members have to search and contact other members, who introduce them to other members whom they deem compatible. Introduction sites differ from the traditional online dating model, and attracted a large number of users and significant investor interest.\n\nSince 2003, several free dating sites, operating on ad based-revenue rather than monthly subscriptions, have appeared and become increasingly popular. Other partially free online dating services offer only limited privileges for free members, or only for a brief period. Although some sites offer free trials and/or profiles, most memberships can cost upwards of $60 per month.\n\nIn 2008, online dating services in the United States generated $957 million in revenue.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, popular sites offer full access to messaging and profiles, but provide additional services for pay, such as prioritizing profile position, removing advertisements, and giving paying users access to a more advanced search engine. Such sites earn revenue from a mix of advertising and sale of additional options. This model also allows users to switch between free and paying status at will, with sites accepting a variety of online currencies and payment options.\n\nMost free dating websites depend on advertising revenue, using tools such as Google AdSense and affiliate marketing. Since advertising revenues are modest compared to membership fees, this model requires a large number of page views to achieve profitability. However, Sam Yagan describes dating sites as ideal advertising platforms because of the wealth of demographic data made available by users.\n\nThere are mixed opinions regarding the safety of online dating. Over 50% of research participants in a 2011 study did not view online dating as a dangerous activity, whereas 43% thought that online dating involved risk. Because online dating takes place in virtual space, it is possible for profile information to be misrepresented or falsified. While some sites conduct background checks on members, many do not, resulting in some uncertainty around members' identities. For instance, some profiles may not represent real humans but rather \"bait profiles\" placed online by site owners to attract new paying members, or \"spam profiles\" created by advertisers to market services and products.\n\nProfiles created by real humans also have the potential to be problematic. For example, online dating sites may expose more female members in particular to stalking, fraud, and sexual violence by online predators. A less malicious form of misrepresentation is that members may lie about their height, weight, age, or marital status in an attempt to market or brand themselves in a particular way. Users may also carefully manipulate profiles as a form of impression management. Online dating site members may try to balance an accurate representation with maintaining their image in a desirable way. One study found that nine out of ten participants had lied on at least one attribute, though lies were often slight; weight was the most lied about attribute, and age was the least lied about. Furthermore, knowing a large amount of superficial information about a potential partner's interests may lead to a false sense of security when meeting up with a new person. Gross misrepresentation may be less likely on matrimonials sites than on casual dating sites. Some dating services have been created specifically for those living with HIV and other STIs in an effort to eliminate the need to lie about one's health in order to find a partner.\n\nMedia coverage of crimes related to online dating may also contribute to perceptions of its risks. However, online dating may also have advantages over conventional (offline) dating in that it offers unprecedented access to potential partners for singles who otherwise would not have such access.\n\nThe emergence of dating sites that promote adultery, such as Ashley Madison, has stirred some controversy. Marriage breakups happened in about 6% of online couples, compared to 7.6% of offline ones. Mean marital satisfaction scores were 5.64 and 5.48 for the online and offline couples, respectively.\n\nOnline subscription-based services can suffer from complaints about billing practices. Some online dating service providers may have fraudulent membership fees or credit card charges. Some sites do not allow members to preview available profiles before paying a subscription fee. Furthermore, different functionalities may be offered to members who have paid or not paid for subscriptions, resulting in some confusion around who can view or contact whom.\n\nConsolidation within the online dating industry has led to different newspapers and magazines now advertising the same website database under different names. In the UK, for example, \"Time Out\" (\"London Dating\"), \"The Times\" (\"Encounters\"), and \"The Daily Telegraph\" (\"Kindred Spirits\"), all offer differently named portals to the same service—meaning that a person who subscribes through more than one publication has unwittingly paid more than once for access to the same service.\n\nOn any given dating site, the sex ratio is commonly unbalanced. A website may have two women for every man, but they may be in the 35+ range, while the men are generally under 35. Little is known about the sex ratio controlled for age. eHarmony's membership is about 57% female and 43% male, whereas the ratio at Match.com is about the reverse of that. When one gets into the specialty niche websites where the primary demographic is male, one typically gets a very unbalanced ratio of male to female or female to male.\n\nStudies have suggested that men are far more likely to send messages on dating sites than women. In addition, men tend to message the most attractive women regardless of their own attractiveness. This leads to the most attractive women on these sites receiving an overwhelming number of messages, which can in some cases result in them leaving the site.\n\nThere is some evidence that there may be differences in how women online rate male attractiveness as opposed to how men rate female attractiveness. The distribution of ratings given by men of female attractiveness appears to be the normal distribution, while ratings of men given by women is highly skewed, with 80% of men rated as below average. This shows that women are genuinely more picky than men when it comes to appearance on online dating websites.\n\nGay rights groups have complained that certain websites that restrict their dating services to heterosexual couples are discriminating against homosexuals. Homosexual customers of the popular eHarmony dating website have made many attempts to litigate discriminatory practices. eHarmony was sued in 2007 by a lesbian claiming that \"[s]uch outright discrimination is hurtful and disappointing for a business open to the public in this day and age.\" In light of discrimination by sexual orientation by dating websites, some services such as GayDar.net and Chemistry.com cater more to homosexual dating.\n\nLess than half of Internet daters are open to dating people of all races. Consistent with the social exchange and group position theories, Asians, Latinos and blacks are more open to dating whites than whites are to dating them. Of those who state a racial preference, 97% of white men exclude black women, 48% exclude Latinas, and 53% exclude Asian women. In contrast, white men are excluded by 76% of black women, 33% Latinas, and only 11% Asian women. Similarly, 92% of white women exclude black men, 77% exclude Latinos, and 93% exclude Asian men. 71% of black men, 31% of Latinos, and 36% of Asian men excluded white women.\n\nA 2011 class action lawsuit alleged Match.com failed to remove inactive profiles, did not accurately disclose the number of active members, and does not police its site for fake profiles; the inclusion of expired and spam profiles as valid served to both artificially inflate the total number of profiles and camouflage a skewed gender ratio in which active users were disproportionately single males. The suit claimed up to 60 percent were inactive profiles, fake or fraudulent users. Some of the spam profiles were alleged to be using images of porn actresses, models, or people from other dating sites. Former employees alleged Match routinely and intentionally over-represented the number of active members on the website and a huge percentage were not real members but 'filler profiles'.\n\nA 2012 class action against Successful Match ended with a November 2014 California jury award of $1.4 million in compensatory damages and $15 million in punitive damages. SuccessfulMatch operated a dating site for people with STDs, PositiveSingles, which it advertised as offering a \"fully anonymous profile\" which is \"100% confidential\". The company failed to disclose that it was placing those same profiles on a long list of affiliate site domains such as GayPozDating.com, AIDSDate.com, HerpesInMouth.com, ChristianSafeHaven.com, MeetBlackPOZ.com, HIVGayMen.com, STDHookup.com, BlackPoz.com, and PositivelyKinky.com. This falsely implied that those users were black, Christian, gay, HIV-positive or members of other groups with which the registered members did not identify. The jury found PositiveSingles guilty of fraud, malice, and oppression as the plaintiffs' race, sexual orientation, HIV status, and religion were misrepresented by exporting each dating profile to niche sites associated with each trait.\n\nIn 2013, a former employee sued adultery website Ashley Madison claiming repetitive strain injuries as creating 1000 fake profiles in one three week span \"required an enormous amount of keyboarding\" which caused the worker to develop severe pain in her wrists and forearms. AshleyMadison's parent company, Avid Life Media, countersued in 2014, alleging the worker kept confidential documents, including copies of her \"work product and training materials.\" The firm claimed the fake profiles were for \"quality assurance testing\" to test a new Brazilian version of the site for \"consistency and reliability.\"\n\nIn January 2014, an already-married Facebook user attempting to close a pop-up advertisement for Zoosk.com found that one click instead copied personal info from her Facebook profile to create an unwanted online profile seeking a mate, leading to a flood of unexpected responses from amorous single males.\n\nIn 2014, It's Just Lunch International was the target of a New York class action alleging unjust enrichment as IJL staff relied on a uniform, misleading script which informed prospective customers during initial interviews that IJL already had at least two matches in mind for those customers' first dates regardless of whether or not that was true.\n\nIn 2014, the US Federal Trade Commission fined UK-based JDI Dating (a group of 18 websites, including Cupidswand.com and FlirtCrowd.com) over US$600000, finding that \"the defendants offered a free plan that allowed users to set up a profile with personal information and photos. As soon as a new user set up a free profile, he or she began to receive messages that appeared to be from other members living nearby, expressing romantic interest or a desire to meet. However, users were unable to respond to these messages without upgrading to a paid membership ... [t]he messages were almost always from fake, computer-generated profiles — 'Virtual Cupids' — created by the defendants, with photos and information designed to closely mimic the profiles of real people.\" The FTC also found that paid memberships were being renewed without client authorisation.\n\nIn 2017 Darlene Daggett, QVC's president for U.S. commerce from 2002 to 2007, filed a lawsuit against matchmaking agency Kelleher International. The company, owned by Amber Kelleher-Andrews\nagreed to settle within hours of Daggett filing the lawsuit. Neither talked about the case, citing a non-disclosure agreement, but Daggett's lawsuit gives plenty of detail about her grievances with the California-based company. 'Due to her senior level position in a local firm, [she] felt that social dating sites did not provide her with the degree of screening and privacy she was looking for,' the lawsuit states. She opted in for the company's most expensive plan, the $150,000 CEO level, which guaranteed her matches from around the world and the personal attention of Kelleher-Andrews. \nBut Daggett says she did not get what she paid for. Instead, she suffered brief romantic entanglements with increasingly disastrous men.\n\nU.S. government regulation of dating services began with the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act (IMBRA) which took effect in March 2007 after a federal judge in Georgia upheld a challenge from the dating site European Connections. The law requires dating services meeting specific criteria—including having as their primary business to connect U.S. citizens/residents with foreign nationals—to conduct, among other procedures, sex offender checks on U.S. customers before contact details can be provided to the non-U.S. citizen. In 2008, the state of New Jersey passed a law which requires the sites to disclose whether they perform background checks.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, using a transnational matchmaking agency involving a monetary transaction is illegal. The Philippines prohibits the business of organizing or facilitating marriages between Filipinas and foreign men under the Republic Act 6955 (the Anti-Mail-Order Bride Law) of June 13, 1990; this law is routinely circumvented by basing mail-order bride websites outside the country.\n\nSingapore's Social Development Network is the governmental organization facilitating dating activities in the country. Singapore's government has actively acted as a matchmaker for singles for the past few decades, and thus only 4% of Singaporeans have ever used an online dating service, despite the country's high rate of internet penetration.\n\nIn December 2010, a New York State Law called the \"Internet Dating Safety Act\" (S5180-A) went into effect that requires online dating sites with customers in New York State to warn users not to disclose personal information to people they do not know.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2687736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2687736", "title": "Philosophical presentism", "text": "Philosophical presentism\n\nPhilosophical presentism is the view that neither the future nor the past exist. In some versions of presentism, this view is extended to timeless objects or ideas (such as numbers). According to presentism, events and entities that are wholly past or wholly future do not exist at all. Presentism contrasts with eternalism and the growing block theory of time which hold that past events, like the Battle of Waterloo, and past entities, like Alexander the Great's warhorse Bucephalus, really do exist, although not in the present. Eternalism extends to future events as well.\n\nAugustine of Hippo proposed that the present is analogous to a knife edge placed exactly between the perceived past and the imaginary future and does not include the concept of time. This should be self-evident because, if the present is extended, it must have separate parts – but these must be simultaneous if they are truly a part of the present. According to early philosophers, time cannot be simultaneously past and present and hence not extended. Contrary to Saint Augustine, some philosophers propose that conscious experience is extended in time. For instance, William James said that time is \"the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible\". Other early presentist philosophers include the Indian Buddhist tradition. Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, a leading scholar of the modern era on Buddhist philosophy, has written extensively on Buddhist presentism: \"Everything past is unreal, everything future is unreal, everything imagined, absent, mental... is unreal. Ultimately, real is only the present moment of physical efficiency [i.e., causation].\"\n\nAccording to J. M. E. McTaggart's \"The Unreality of Time\", there are two ways of referring to events: the 'A Series' (or 'tensed time': yesterday, today, tomorrow) and the 'B Series' (or 'untensed time': Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Presentism posits that the A Series is fundamental and that the B Series alone is not sufficient. Presentists maintain that temporal discourse requires the use of tenses, whereas the \"Old B-Theorists\" argued that tensed language could be reduced to tenseless facts (Dyke, 2004).\n\nArthur N. Prior has argued against un-tensed theories with the following ideas: the meaning of statements such as \"Thank goodness that's over\" is much easier to see in a tensed theory with a distinguished, present \"now\". Similar arguments can be made to support the theory of egocentric presentism (or perspectival realism), which holds that there is a distinguished, present \"self\".\n\nIn modern theory of relativity, the conceptual observer is at a geometric point in both space and time at the apex of the 'light cone' which observes the events laid out in time as well as space. Different observers may disagree on whether two events at different locations occurred simultaneously depending on whether the observers are in relative motion (see relativity of simultaneity). This theory depends upon the idea of time as an extended thing and has been confirmed by experiment, thus giving rise to a philosophical viewpoint known as four dimensionalism. Although the contents of an observation are time-extended, the conceptual observer, being a geometric point at the origin of the light cone, is not extended in time or space. This analysis contains a paradox in which the conceptual observer contains nothing, even though any real observer would need to be the extended contents of an observation to exist. This paradox is partially resolved in relativity theory by defining a 'frame of reference' to encompass the measuring instruments used by an observer. This reduces the time separation between instruments to a set of constant intervals.\n\nSome of the difficulties and paradoxes of presentism can be resolved by changing the normal view of time as a container or thing unto itself and seeing time as a measure of changing spatial relationships among objects. Thus, observers need not be extended in time to exist and to be aware, but they rather exist and the changes in internal relationships within the observer can be measured by stable countable events.\n\n\n"}

The term argues that writing and working practices in these disciplines have overused confusing jargon and complicated mathematics, in order to seem more 'rigorous' and like mathematics-based subjects like physics.\n\nThe success of physics in \"mathematicizing\" itself, particularly since Isaac Newton's \"Principia Mathematica\", is generally considered remarkable and often disproportionate compared to other areas of inquiry. \"Physics envy\" refers to the envy (perceived or real) of scholars in other disciplines for the mathematical precision of fundamental concepts obtained by physicists. It is an accusation raised against disciplines (typically against social sciences and liberal arts such as literature, philosophy, and psychology) when these academic areas try to express their fundamental concepts in terms of mathematics, which is seen as an unwarranted push for reductionism.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr discusses the issue of the inability to reduce biology to its mathematical basis in his book \"What Makes Biology Unique?\". Noam Chomsky discusses the ability and desirability of reduction to its mathematical basis in his article \"Mysteries of Nature: How Deeply Hidden.\" Chomsky contributed extensively to the development of the field of theoretical linguistics, a formal science.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "50237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50237", "title": "Robert Boyle", "text": "Robert Boyle\n\nRobert Boyle (; 25 January 1627 – 31 December 1691) was an Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, and inventor. Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. He is best known for Boyle's law, which describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system. Among his works, \"The Sceptical Chymist\" is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry. He was a devout and pious Anglican and is noted for his writings in theology.\n\nBoyle was born at Lismore Castle, in County Waterford, Ireland, the seventh son and fourteenth child of The 1st Earl of Cork ('the Great Earl of Cork') and Catherine Fenton. Lord Cork, then known simply as Richard Boyle, had arrived in Dublin from England in 1588 during the Tudor plantations of Ireland and obtained an appointment as a deputy escheator. He had amassed enormous wealth and landholdings by the time Robert was born, and had been created Earl of Cork in October 1620. Catherine Fenton, Countess of Cork, was the daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton, the former Secretary of State for Ireland, who was born in Dublin in 1539, and Alice Weston, the daughter of Robert Weston, who was born in Lismore in 1541.\n\nAs a child, Boyle was fostered to a local family, as were his elder brothers. Boyle received private tutoring in Latin, Greek, and French and when he was eight years old, following the death of his mother, he was sent to Eton College in England. His father's friend, Sir Henry Wotton, was then the provost of the college.\n\nDuring this time, his father hired a private tutor, Robert Carew, who had knowledge of Irish, to act as private tutor to his sons in Eton. However, \"only Mr. Robert sometimes desires it [Irish] and is a little entered in it\", but despite the \"many reasons\" given by Carew to turn their attentions to it, \"they practice the French and Latin but they affect not the Irish\". After spending over three years at Eton, Robert travelled abroad with a French tutor. They visited Italy in 1641 and remained in Florence during the winter of that year studying the \"paradoxes of the great star-gazer\" Galileo Galilei, who was elderly but still living in 1641.\n\nRobert returned to England from continental Europe in mid-1644 with a keen interest in scientific research. His father, Lord Cork, had died the previous year and had left him the manor of Stalbridge in Dorset as well as substantial estates in County Limerick in Ireland that he had acquired. Robert then made his residence at Stalbridge House, between 1644 and 1652, and conducted many experiments there. From that time, Robert devoted his life to scientific research and soon took a prominent place in the band of enquirers, known as the \"Invisible College\", who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the \"new philosophy\". They met frequently in London, often at Gresham College, and some of the members also had meetings at Oxford.\n\nHaving made several visits to his Irish estates beginning in 1647, Robert moved to Ireland in 1652 but became frustrated at his inability to make progress in his chemical work. In one letter, he described Ireland as \"a barbarous country where chemical spirits were so misunderstood and chemical instruments so unprocurable that it was hard to have any Hermetic thoughts in it.\"\n\nIn 1654, Boyle left Ireland for Oxford to pursue his work more successfully. An inscription can be found on the wall of University College, Oxford, the High Street at Oxford (now the location of the Shelley Memorial), marking the spot where Cross Hall stood until the early 19th century. It was here that Boyle rented rooms from the wealthy apothecary who owned the Hall.\n\nReading in 1657 of Otto von Guericke's air pump, he set himself with the assistance of Robert Hooke to devise improvements in its construction, and with the result, the \"machina Boyleana\" or \"Pneumatical Engine\", finished in 1659, he began a series of experiments on the properties of air. An account of Boyle's work with the air pump was published in 1660 under the title \"New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects\".\n\nAmong the critics of the views put forward in this book was a Jesuit, Francis Line (1595–1675), and it was while answering his objections that Boyle made his first mention of the law that the volume of a gas varies inversely to the pressure of the gas, which among English-speaking people is usually called Boyle's Law after his name. The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was Henry Power in 1661. Boyle in 1662 included a reference to a paper written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to Richard Towneley. In continental Europe the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to Edme Mariotte, although he did not publish it until 1676 and was likely aware of Boyle's work at the time.\n\nIn 1663 the Invisible College became The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, and the charter of incorporation granted by Charles II of England named Boyle a member of the council. In 1680 he was elected president of the society, but declined the honour from a scruple about oaths.\n\nHe made a \"wish list\" of 24 possible inventions which included \"the prolongation of life\", the \"art of flying\", \"perpetual light\", \"making armour light and extremely hard\", \"a ship to sail with all winds, and a ship not to be sunk\", \"practicable and certain way of finding longitudes\", \"potent drugs to alter or exalt imagination, waking, memory and other functions and appease pain, procure innocent sleep, harmless dreams, etc.\" They are extraordinary because all but a few of the 24 have come true.\n\nIt was during his time at Oxford that Boyle was a \"Chevalier\". The Chevaliers are thought to have been established by royal order a few years before Boyle's time at Oxford. The early part of Boyle's residence was marked by the actions of the victorious parliamentarian forces, consequently this period marked the most secretive period of Chevalier movements and thus little is known about Boyle's involvement beyond his membership.\n\nIn 1668 he left Oxford for London where he resided at the house of his elder sister Katherine Jones, Lady Ranelagh, in Pall Mall. He experimented in the laboratory she had in her home and attended her salon of intellectuals interested in the sciences. The siblings maintained \"a lifelong intellectual partnership, where brother and sister shared medical remedies, promoted each other’s scientific ideas, and edited each other’s manuscripts.\" His contemporaries widely acknowledged Katherine's influence on his work, but later historiographers dropped discussion of her accomplishments and relationship to her brother from the their histories.\n\nIn 1669 his health, never very strong, began to fail seriously and he gradually withdrew from his public engagements, ceasing his communications to the Royal Society, and advertising his desire to be excused from receiving guests, \"unless upon occasions very extraordinary\", on Tuesday and Friday forenoon, and Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. In the leisure thus gained he wished to \"recruit his spirits, range his papers\", and prepare some important chemical investigations which he proposed to leave \"as a kind of Hermetic legacy to the studious disciples of that art\", but of which he did not make known the nature. His health became still worse in 1691, and he died on 31 December that year, just a week after the death of his sister, Katherine, in whose home he had lived and with whom he had shared scientific pursuits for more than twenty years. Boyle died from paralysis. He was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields, his funeral sermon being preached by his friend, Bishop Gilbert Burnet. In his will, Boyle endowed a series of lectures that came to be known as the Boyle Lectures.\n\nBoyle's great merit as a scientific investigator is that he carried out the principles which Francis Bacon espoused in the \"Novum Organum\". Yet he would not avow himself a follower of Bacon, or indeed of any other teacher. On several occasions he mentions that to keep his judgment as unprepossessed as might be with any of the modern theories of philosophy, until he was \"provided of experiments\" to help him judge of them, he refrained from any study of the Atomical and the Cartesian systems, and even of the Novum Organum itself, though he admits to \"transiently consulting\" them about a few particulars. Nothing was more alien to his mental temperament than the spinning of hypotheses. He regarded the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself, and in consequence he gained a wider outlook on the aims of scientific inquiry than had been enjoyed by his predecessors for many centuries. This, however, did not mean that he paid no attention to the practical application of science nor that he despised knowledge which tended to use.\n\nRobert Boyle was an alchemist; and believing the transmutation of metals to be a possibility, he carried out experiments in the hope of achieving it; and he was instrumental in obtaining the repeal, in 1689, of the statute of Henry IV against multiplying gold and silver. With all the important work he accomplished in physics – the enunciation of Boyle's law, the discovery of the part taken by air in the propagation of sound, and investigations on the expansive force of freezing water, on specific gravities and refractive powers, on crystals, on electricity, on colour, on hydrostatics, etc. – chemistry was his peculiar and favourite study. His first book on the subject was \"The Sceptical Chymist\", published in 1661, in which he criticised the \"experiments whereby vulgar Spagyrists are wont to endeavour to evince their Salt, Sulphur and Mercury to be the true Principles of Things.\" For him chemistry was the science of the composition of substances, not merely an adjunct to the arts of the alchemist or the physician. He endorsed the view of elements as the undecomposable constituents of material bodies; and made the distinction between mixtures and compounds. He made considerable progress in the technique of detecting their ingredients, a process which he designated by the term \"analysis\". He further supposed that the elements were ultimately composed of particles of various sorts and sizes, into which, however, they were not to be resolved in any known way. He studied the chemistry of combustion and of respiration, and conducted experiments in physiology, where, however, he was hampered by the \"tenderness of his nature\" which kept him from anatomical dissections, especially vivisections, though he knew them to be \"most instructing\".\n\nIn addition to philosophy, Boyle devoted much time to theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial polemics. At the Restoration of the king in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the provostship of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused to do on the ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church.\n\nMoreover, Boyle incorporated his scientific interests into his theology, believing that natural philosophy could provide powerful evidence for the existence God. In works such as \"Disquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things\" (1688), for instance, he criticised contemporary philosophers - such as René Descartes - who denied that the study of nature could reveal much about God. Instead, Boyle argued that natural philosophers could use the design apparently on display in some parts of nature to demonstrate God's involvement with the world. He also attempted to tackle complex theological questions using methods derived from his scientific practices. In \"Some Physico-Theological Considerations about the Possibility of the Resurrection\" (1675), he used a chemical experiment known as the reduction to the pristine state as part of an attempt to demonstrate the physical possibility of the resurrection of the body. Throughout his career, Boyle tried to show that science could lend support to Christianity.\n\nAs a director of the East India Company he spent large sums in promoting the spread of Christianity in the East, contributing liberally to missionary societies and to the expenses of translating the Bible or portions of it into various languages. Boyle supported the policy that the Bible should be available in the vernacular language of the people. An Irish language version of the New Testament was published in 1602 but was rare in Boyle's adult life. In 1680–85 Boyle personally financed the printing of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, in Irish. In this respect, Boyle's attitude to the Irish language differed from the English Ascendancy class in Ireland at the time, which was generally hostile to the language and largely opposed the use of Irish (not only as a language of religious worship).\n\nBoyle also had a monogenist perspective about race origin. He was a pioneer studying races, and he believed that all human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, came from the same source: Adam and Eve. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured albinos, so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Boyle also extended the theories of Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton about colour and light via optical projection (in physics) into discourses of polygenesis, speculating that maybe these differences were due to \"seminal impressions\". Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for complexion at his time, due to the fact that now we know that skin colour is disposed by genes, which are actually contained in the semen. Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for \"European Eyes\", beauty was not measured so much in colour of skin, but in \"stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face\". Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as \"disturbing\" or \"amusing\".\n\nIn his Will, Boyle provided money for a series of lectures to defend the Christian religion against those he considered \"notorious infidels, namely atheists, deists, pagans, Jews and Muslims\", with the provision that controversies between Christians were not to be mentioned (see Boyle Lectures).\n\nAs a founder of the Royal Society, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1663. Boyle's law is named in his honour. The Royal Society of Chemistry issues a Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science, named in his honour. The Boyle Medal for Scientific Excellence in Ireland, inaugurated in 1899, is awarded jointly by the Royal Dublin Society and The Irish Times. Launched in 2012, The Robert Boyle Summer School organized by the Waterford Institute of Technology with support from Lismore Castle, is held annually to honor the heritage of Robert Boyle.\n\nThe following are some of the more important of his works:\n\nAmong his religious and philosophical writings were:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1093704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1093704", "title": "Samael Aun Weor", "text": "Samael Aun Weor\n\nSamael Aun Weor () (March 6, 1917 – December 24, 1977), born Víctor Manuel Gómez Rodríguez, was a spiritual teacher and author of over sixty books of esoteric spirituality. He taught and formed groups under the banner of 'Universal Gnosticism', or simply gnosis. Samael Aun Weor referred to his teachings as 'The Doctrine of Synthesis', which not only emphasizes the existence of the perennial philosophy, but that its highest teleological function is the accomplishment of 'Christification' and 'Final Liberation.'\n\nVictor Manuel Gómez Rodriguez was born in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Republic of Colombia, son of Manuel Gómez Quijano and Francisca Rodríguez de Gómez. He was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church but later rejected the Church of Rome. His childhood and family life are not well known, except that he had a brother, and his father remarried after a divorce. He was sent to a Roman Catholic Jesuit school but soon quit disillusioned by religion; he was twelve years old at the time. Instead he invested most of his time in the study of metaphysical and esoteric treatises. Arnold Krumm-Heller founded the \"Iglesia Gnostica\" (Gnostic Church) in Mexico in 1910 and in Brazil he founded the \"Fraternidad de Rosacruz Antiqua\" (Fraternity of the Ancient Rosicrucians), following Randolph's usage. Between the time after World War II and his death in 1949, Krumm-Heller resumed contact with his Latin America students, where he encountered and subsequently mentored Victor Rodriguez who would subsequently take the name Samael Aun Weor. Later in life, as writer, lecturer and Gnostic teacher, he would demonstrate a profound esoteric knowledge of both Eastern and Western classics.\n\nIn his autobiographical account, \"The Three Mountains\", Samael Aun Weor stated that because he was born with an awakened consciousness, he was analyzing the previous lives in which he awakened his consciousness before mastering how to walk. At the age of 17, he was asked to lecture at the local Theosophical Chapter, and a year later was admitted into the occult society Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua (F.R.A.). While a student in the F.R.A., Samael Aun Weor methodically studied the entire Rosicrucian library and it was here that he allegedly learned the secret of the \"Great Arcanum\", or white Sexual Magic – the esoteric key which purportedly underpins all of the world's great religions.\n\nFew details of his life are known between the mid-1930s and 1950. He became a spiritual vagabond of sorts, traveling with neither home nor income. At one point he lived with a tribe of indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia, learning the healing secrets which would later form the foundation of his medical treatise, \"Occult Medicine and Practical Magic\". It was also during these years that he claimed to have had his first experience of the Illuminating Void meeting his \"Inner Being\" or Atman whose name is \"Aun Weor\", meaning in Hebrew \"Light and Strength.\"\n\nHe was briefly married to Sara Dueños and they had a son named \"Imperator\". However, in 1946, he met and married the Lady-Adept \"Litelantes\" (born Arnolda Garro Mora) with whom he lived for 35 years and had four children: Osiris, Isis, Iris, Hypatia. Samael Aun Weor explains that as soon as he met her, this \"Lady-Adept\" Genie began to instruct him in the Science of Jinnestan or Jinn State also known as Djinn State or Djinnestan, which he claims involved placing the physical body in the fourth dimension. In Aztec religion this practice is known as Nahuatlism, and according to Aun Weor is related with hyperspace.\n\nIn 1948 he began teaching a small group of students. In 1950, under the name \"Aun Weor\", he managed to publish \"The Perfect Matrimony, or The Door to Enter into Initiation\" with the help of his close disciples. The book, later entitled \"The Perfect Matrimony,\" claimed to unveil the secret of sexuality as the cornerstone of the world's great religions. In it he elucidated topics such as sexual transmutation, \"white tantra\", and esoteric initiation. Writing in such a candid manner regarding sex was met with disdain by the majority of the public at the time. Seen as immoral and pornographic, Aun Weor found himself fleeing angry mobs attempting to silence him through violent means. From March 14 to 19 of 1952 Aun Weor spends five days in jail for \"committing the crime of healing the sick\". The account of his incarceration is recounted in a personal diary he later published as \"Secret Notes of a Guru\".\n\nAfter March 19, 1952, Aun Weor and some disciples build and live near the \"Summum Supremum Sanctuarium\", an \"underground temple\" in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia. On October 27, 1954, Aun Weor received what is referred to as the \"Initiation of Tiphereth\", which, according to his doctrine, is the beginning of the incarnation of the Logos or \"Glorian\" within the soul. He states that in his case the name of his Glorian has always been called \"Samael\" through the ages. From then on, he would sign his name Samael Aun Weor. Thus he states that this union of Samael (the Logos) with Aun Weor (the human soul) is the Maitreya Buddha Kalki Avatar of the New Age of Aquarius. Upon being asked exactly what such a title meant, he responded:\n\nAlthough he would declare himself as the true Kalki Avatar many times throughout his works, he also regularly rejected the worship of his personality:\n\nIn 1956, he left Colombia and went to Costa Rica and El Salvador. Later in 1956, he settled down for good in Mexico City, where he would begin his public life.\n\nBefore 1960, he had published 20 more books with topics ranging from \"Endocrinology and Criminology\" to \"Kundalini Yoga\". He founded numerous Gnostic Institutions and created Gnostic centers in Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Venezuela. A \"triangle\" relationship was established between the Universal Gnostic Movement founded by Samael Aun Weor, the South American Liberation Action (ALAS) in Argentina headed by Francisco A. Propato Ph.D. (graduate of La Sorbonne and Spanish translator of \"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\"), and the Sivananda Aryabarta Ashram directed by Swami Sivananda in India.\n\nIn spite of the victories, the development of the Gnostic Movement was not without dramatic setbacks. At the time of publishing the revised edition of \"The Perfect Matrimony\" (1961), the movement had fallen apart. He wrote that \"those who did not leave the Gnostic Movement can be counted on the fingers of one hand.\" However, by the time of his death, Samael Aun Weor had completely re-established the broad international reaches the movement previously held.\n\nInto the 1960s, he continued to write many books on topics, such as Hermetic Astrology, Flying Saucers, and the Kabbalah. However, he also wrote sociopolitical works such as the \"Platform of POSCLA\" (Partido Socialista Cristiano Latinoamericano, or Latin-American Christian Socialist Party) and \"The Social Christ\". Topics such as the \"false\" doctrines of wall street materialism, atheism, and particularly Marxism-Leninism are discussed. POSCLA's motto was given as, \"All for one and one for all,\" and its method, the conscious practice of Ahimsa.\n\nIn what was to be the last decade of his life, he penned works such as \"Parsifal Unveiled\", which details the esoteric symbolism of the Wagner opera, and \"Gnostic Anthropology\" in which he heavily criticizes the theories of Darwin, Haeckel, \"and their followers\". The books \"The Great Rebellion\", \"Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology\", and \"The Revolution of the Dialectic\" provide a ground work for the vast knowledge of esoteric psychology purported to be found rooted in every genuine religion. During this time, he was preparing the highest vehicle of his doctrine, \"The Pistis Sophia Unveiled\", in which he meditated, verse-by-verse, upon the extremely esoteric Gnostic text \"Pistis Sophia\".\n\nAlthough he never formally received any income from his works - he lived off the charity of his students - at the 1976 International Gnostic Congress Samael Aun Weor he clarified his stance on the copyright of his works by stating:\n\nBy 1972, Samael Aun Weor referenced that his death and resurrection would be occurring before 1978. In the chapter entitled \"The Resurrection\" in his work \"The Three Mountains\" (1972), he stated that the eight years of ordeals within the Trial of Job would occur between his 53rd and 61st birthdays. Furthermore, in the same work, it is stated that this ordeal occurs prior to resurrection, and the one going through it is \"deprived of everything, even of his own sons, and is afflicted by an impure sickness.\" By August 1977 he had developed stomach cancer. During this time he continued to speak to both his students and the general public, giving radio and television interviews while touring Mexico. Eventually he was forced to stop, due to debilitating stomach pain. As his condition steadily worsened he would mention to those at his bedside, \"Don't cling to my battered body, instead cling to my doctrinal body.\" Samael Aun Weor died on December 24, 1977. He was survived by his wife and children.\n\nYears before his death, he declared he would adopt the use of a duly prepared ancient Egyptian \"mummy\" as a vehicle for further work, a vehicle better prepared than his own \"physical body\". Many of his followers expected him to return publicly shortly after his death. According to his own statements he planned to remain incognito for a certain time so that “the leaven will ferment.\"\n\nThe Doctrine of Synthesis is a term Aun Weor used to describe the teachings he delivered through his books and lectures, because it purportedly elucidates and coherently syncretizes an extensive variety of teachings which study the human condition.\n\nAlthough many of the metaphysical concepts expounded by such authors as Blavatsky, Steiner, and Gurdjieff provide a conceptual foundation in Aun Weor's teachings, he considered these works and movements conceptual preparation for the real unveiling of occultism or gnosis that he taught. His primary goal was not to simply elucidate a myriad of metaphysical concepts, but rather to teach the way to achieve self-realization through the \"Direct Path of Christ\". As he states in \"The Perfect Matrimony\": \"We aspire towards only one thing, only one goal, only one objective: Christification. It is necessary for each human being to Christify himself. It is necessary to incarnate the Christ.\"\n\nAun Weor emphasizes that his doctrine is experiential, and must be put into practice for it to be of any value to the student. Throughout his works there are hundreds of techniques and exercises that supposedly are of help in the development of psychic powers, for example leaving the dense physical body at will (astral projection), in order to be taught in the schools of the \"Higher Worlds.\" The techniques are always combined with meditation and sexual transmutation, and the perfection of such powers may take more than one lifetime.\n\nIt is stated that if a student is successful in awakening consciousness, he or she will eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness are not aware of their postmortem condition, just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.\n\nReligions are viewed as idiosyncratic expressions of immutable and eternal values. Religions are said to be born and die in time, yet their spiritual values always remain eternal. When a religious form has fulfilled its mission, it begins to degenerate and dies, then a new messenger appears and delivers a doctrine appropriate for that culture. Different cultures require different doctrines for their development and this results in a vast difference of religious doctrines. Nevertheless, if one understands their core values, all religions naturally support each other. It is stated that any authentic religion possess what are called \"The Three Factors of the Revolution of the Consciousness\" which are practical aspects of daily life:\n\n1) Death: The psychological work of eliminating the ego.\n2) Birth: Giving birth to the superior potential of the soul, which is done through chastity and sexual transmutation.\n3) Sacrifice: To work to aid suffering humanity \"without desiring the fruits of action, without desiring reward; pure, sincere, disinterested sacrifice, giving one’s life in order for others to live, and without asking for anything in return.\"\n\nAmong these 3 factors, Samael Aun Weor highlights that the first one is the most important. \nA teaching that is missing any one of these components is considered incomplete or degenerate.\n\nThe basis of Aun Weor's Practical Work is of a psychological nature. He states in many of his books that the purpose of his doctrine is to affect a psychological change. The terms Gnostic, Esoteric or Revolutionary Psychology are used to describe the psychological methods taught, and are said to be synonymous with the psychological teachings of religion.\n\nA fundamental axiom presented is that an ordinary human being is not really human at all, but rather an intellectual animal (a rational animal) with consciousness asleep. According to Samael Aun Weor, a true human being is someone who has no psychological imperfection, an image of God, as in Jesus' saying, \"Become perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.\" Samael Aun Weor writes of the awakening of consciousness as being very similar to the traditional Buddhist understanding, and throughout his works he describes many analogous processes as they are spoken of in different religions.\n\nIn order to awaken the consciousness correctly, Aun Weor stated it was necessary to annihilate the ego. He taught that one’s ego is really not one but many, or a multitude of independent, contradictory desires. Likewise, each person's ego is said to actually contain many \"I’s,\" many \"egos,\" many \"aggregates.\" Each desire is an \"I\" and each \"I\" has its own specific causes and conditions that lead to its personification at a particular time. This is the mechanism behind what is commonly called \"changing one’s mind\" (metanoia) because when one \"I\" changes to another a literal exchange of personified psychological aggregates has taken place. This \"doctrine of the many\", the Plural 'I' or Pluralized Ego, is the same as that taught by G.I. Gurdjieff and his disciple P. D. Ouspensky and is one of the reasons Aun Weor was sometimes accused of plagiarism. To this he responded that Gurdjieff was not the author of this doctrine and that its origin is found in Egypt and Tibet.\n\n\nConsciousness is described as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness is the only way to acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.\n\n\nThe purpose of the psychological work is to dissolve all the psychological aggregates one has accumulated. The term \"psychological or mystical death\" is often used to describe the process one must undergo in order to reach liberation.\"Psychological aggregates\" are commonly known simply as aggregates in Buddhism, yet it is taught that other religions used a more veiled or less sophisticated method to describe them, such as: the \"Legion\" that Jesus is described as removing from a man in and Luke 8 in one of the alleged Miracles of Jesus; overcoming the tortures of the 49 Self-willed demons of Yaldabaoth written in the Pistis Sophia; the killing of the \"unbelievers\" in Islam; Moses escaping the tyranny of the Egyptians; Arjuna fighting against his own blood (the ego); the demons of Seth that attack Osiris; Jesus throwing the merchants out of the temple; the archetypal death and resurrection of the \"Solar Hero\" exemplified in the stories of Jesus and Osiris; the descent to Dante's Inferno (representing our unconscious) or Paradise Lost's Pandemonium in order to accomplish a great task, such as those performed by Hercules or Orpheus; the archetypal Dragon (ego) that must be slayed by the Knight, etc. Samael Aun Weor states that this specific paradigm is called \"The Doctrine of the Many\" and has been taught in esoteric schools and religions since the beginning of time. The anatomy of the pluralized self being the divine spark imprisoned within hundreds of psychological aggregates.\n\nIn order to achieve psychological transformation, extensive methods of meditation, self-observation, and sexual transmutation are taught and prescribed for daily exercise. The goal of psychological work is the awakening of consciousness and ultimately the state of Paramarthasatya.\n\nBasic physiology is studied, mostly endocrinology and the hormonal influence of primary and secondary sexual characteristics. It is taught that there are three fundamental nervous systems, the cerebrospinal nervous system, grand sympathetic nervous system, and the Parasympathetic nervous system. These nervous systems are referred to as the \"Three Brains\" or three centers of the intellectual animal, and are named Intellectual Center, the Emotional Center, and the Motor-Instinctual-Sexual Center. Each center is studied in relation to the types of energies or \"occult hydrogens\" that animate them, the frequency at which each center operates (sexual center being the fastest, then emotional, then intellectual), and how psychological aggregates form and act within each center: psychological aggregates that are expressed through the intellect one way and through the emotions in a different way, etc.\n\nThe three centers are directly related to the Trinity, Trimurti, or threefoldness of creation, the intellect being related to the Father (Kether, Affirmation, Positive), the emotion related to the Son (Chokmah, Denial, Negation), and the sexual center related to the Holy Spirit (Binah, Reconcile, Neutral). The primary energy of the intellectual brain (Father) is the air, which is then placed in the bloodstream which is related to the emotional brain (Son), and lastly the final condensation of blood is found in the semen or sexual hormones, which is directly related to the Holy Spirit: that which impregnates or manifests creation, Shakti, etc.\n\nSamael Aun Weor teaches that psychological aggregates form in one of these three centers; therefore, it is said that there are three fundamental defects: the demon of the mind related to the intellectual center, the demon of desire related to the emotional center, and the demon of evil will related to the motor-instinctual-sexual center. They are collectively referred to as the \"Three Traitors\", and many references to religion are found that are held to symbolize them, for example: Judas (desire), Pilate (intellect), and Caiaphas (will) who crucify Jesus; Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum who murder Hiram Abiff; Seth, whose homosexual inclinations and actions are well known, in the form of the serpent Apophis and its two monstrous helpers Sebau and Nakmurders Osiris; the three Furies who attack Orestes; the three daughters of Mara who attack Gautama Buddha and who are conquered through right Thinking (Intellectual Center), right Feeling (Emotional Center), and right Action (Motor-Instinctual-Sexual Center) (see Noble Eightfold Path).\n\nOccult or esoteric anatomy and physiology is also studied, which refers to the study of the supra-sensible bodies of minerals, plants, animals (rational and irrational), and human beings. It is said that everyone contains seven bodies, closely related to the Theosophical septenary, which Aun Weor calls physical, vital, emotional (astral), mental, causal, buddhic and atmic. Aun Weor differentiates between an intellectual animal and an authentic human being through the differences in the vehicles of emotion (astral body), mind (mental body) and will (causal body). Intellectual animals (ordinary man and woman) are said to contain the Lunar Astral Body, the Lunar Mental Body, and the Lunar Causal Body, each referred to by different names in different schools of Occultism. It is stated that these lunar bodies are the result of mechanical evolution through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms and therefore, they are of an infrahuman or animal quality. The only true difference between the rational animal and irrational animals is the intellect, which gives the former the ability to become human, or as Aun Weor states, the intellectual animal has the \"seed\" or potential of a human latently existing within its sexual organs.\n\nWhat are called authentic human beings, although physically appearing identical, have crystallized the Solar Bodies: Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body, and Solar Causal Body. Lunar bodies are vehicles that receive the energy of creation (that is, God) at the level of an animal, while the solar bodies permit the reception of a much greater voltage allowing greater levels of wisdom and superior emotion to be incarnated. Aun Weor states that the solar bodies are collectively referred to as vehicles of the \"soul\".\n\nAun Weor states that the solar bodies are formed in the same manner that physical bodies are formed: through use of the sexual function. In order to form the solar bodies, sexual transmutation is taught via the hetero sexual magic of married couples engaged in coitus without orgasm or seminal ejaculation. Sexual magic is the arousal of sexual energies through the act of coitus between husband and wife, but instead of expelling those energies through orgasm they are transmuted into higher octaves of energy. Each successive Solar Body is the result of the saturation of transmuted sexual energy at its respective octave: first, the \"Christ Astral\" is formed by transmuting the sex energy into a second octave; second, the \"Christ Mind\" is formed by saturating, condensing or crystallizing the sexual energy into a third octave, and the causal body or \"Christ Will\" is formed by transmuting the sexual energy called \"Hydrogen SI-12\", into a fourth octave. The \"birth\" of the solar bodies is what Samael Aun Weor states is the true meaning of being \"born again.\" It is taught that the solar bodies are referred to in the Bible as the three sons of Noah or the three Christians in the (alchemical) furnace of Nebuchadnezzar.\n\n\nThe topic of sexuality is approached from a very stern point of view, and it is indeed the crux of Aun Weor’s entire message. He states that there are three fundamental types of sexuality: suprasexuality, which is the sexual functioning of someone like Buddha or Jesus, who naturally transmutes all their energy perfectly; normal sexuality, which is defined as those who have no sexual conflict of any kind whatsoever and who transmute their sexual energy or use it to procreate the species; finally, the two spheres of infrasexuality, as described in the Kabbalistic texts: Nahemah's sphere of influence which includes fornication, adultery, addiction and prostitution and Lilith's sphere of influence, a category which includes homosexuality, masturbation, abortion, bestiality, sado-masochism and any other \"abuse\" of the sexual energy. In response to his supposedly harsh views towards sex (especially for a \"New Age\" teacher), he wrote:\n\nSoteriology (study of salvation) is presented in the light of every notable religion yet usually with special differences not held by orthodox interpretations. There are many degrees of salvation generally accomplished by paying one’s karma, removing the psychological imperfections and finally creating the solar bodies. The idea held by many religions that belief in God alone achieves salvation is categorically rejected.\n\nMany different levels of salvation are explained, each depending upon the willpower of the individual accomplishing it. For those who do not remove their psychological imperfection (ego) – which is the cause of karma and the suffering of humanity – after approximately 108 rebirths they will have their ego removed forcefully through mechanical devolution within the infradimensions (Hell). Here it is said that \"Mother Nature\" mechanically pays out one’s accumulated karma through a great deal of suffering over thousands of years until one is returned to the state of an innocent elemental, or Essence. This is said to be a state of being that is total happiness, yet not cognizant happiness and therefore not complete happiness. It should be noted that Hell is not taught as a place of eternal damnation, just a place to pay one’s karma, and in fact it is seen as a part of God's grace because if the ego is not removed forcefully, these souls would continue to suffer indefinitely. It is held that after Hell, the elemental is reinserted into the mechanics of evolution in order to once again attempt to gain conscious happiness: They are first inserted at the basic level of existence (minerals), and through millions of years, transmigrate through increasingly complex organisms until the state of intellectual animal is reached again.\n\nFor those who do work on themselves, depending on the degree of perfection, happiness and wisdom they wish to attain, two distinct paths emerge: the Straight Path of the Razor's Edge and the Spiral Path. The Spiral Path involves reaching a state of relative enlightenment by choosing the enjoyment of the Higher Worlds (Heaven or Nirvana), and occasionally returning to a physical body in order to pay out a little more karma and help humanity in the process. Samael Aun Weor refers to these as the Pratyeka Buddhas and Sravakas, and that the vast majority who reach this state choose the Spiral Path because it is very easy and enjoyable. The dangerous Straight Path of the Razor's Edge is the Path of the Bodhisattva who renounces the happiness of the Higher Worlds (Nirvana) in order to help humanity. In the doctrine of Samael Aun Weor, the Bodhisattva has a very specific definition, as it is not merely someone who has taken the Bodhisattva vows. It is the physical (Malkuth), vital (Yesod), astral (Hod), mental (Netzach) and causal (Tiphereth) vehicles – in other words the human soul – of a self-realized spirit, (Geburah-Chesed) who has chosen the Straight Path of the Razor's Edge in order to incarnate the Christ (Kether-Binah-Chokmah). In other words, the Bodhisattva is the \"Son\" of a self-realized God who is trying to return to the Absolute or 13th Aeon of the Pistis Sophia.\n\n\nChrist is viewed as the savior but not as traditionally understood by contemporary Christianity. Instead, Christ is an impersonal force or intelligence that emanates from the Absolute as the Trinity and is also referred to as the Cosmic Christ. Christ is said to have existed before Jesus, and is represented in different traditions with names such as Thoth, Ormuz, Ahura Mazda, Osiris, Zeus, Jupiter, Quetzalcoatl, Okidanokh, Kulkulcan, Chrestos, Baldur, and Avalokitesvara. It is held that Christ enters into and exalts any individual who is properly prepared, which denotes the complete annihilation of the ego, the exhaustion of all karma and the birth of the solar vehicles, the latter is necessary to handle the super high voltage of Christ. Samael Aun Weor writes that only those who choose the previously mentioned Straight Path of the Razor's Edge can incarnate the Christ because the Spiral Path is not a path of total sacrifice. Likewise, any true Bodhisattva has incarnated the Christ or is in process of doing so. It is said that in history Christ incarnated in Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna, Moses, Padmasambhava, John the Baptist, Milarepa, Mahavatar Babaji, Joan of Arc, Fu Xi, Ramakrishna as well as many others now forgotten by time (or made up in works of fiction) e. g. Zanoni\n\nIt is important to notice that some of these individuals represent Christ as an impersonal force, e. g. Jesus, meaning that although he was an individual Christ, he taught the doctrine of the Cosmic Christ, intentionally molding his physical life after the psychological processes that one undergoes to incarnate the Christ. As with Buddha, Jesus is seen as a Bodhisattva who came to help humanity. Jesus is viewed as the Savior of the World because he is a Paramarthasatya (an inhabitant of the Absolute) that physically incarnated specifically for the sake of poor suffering humanity. According to Samael Aun Weor, Jesus purposefully played out physically the internal or psychological struggle one must undergo in the path of Self-Realization; thus, the Gospels are a mixture of reality and kabbalistic, initiatic symbolism.\n\nHis work \"Cosmic Teachings of a Lama\" states that life on Earth did not occur through abiogenesis, but instead through pansperma. To Samael Aun Weor, the theories of abiogenesis are similar to those of spontaneous generation, and that Pasteur had already implicitly refuted the former when the latter was empirically disproved. Furthermore, while evolution is a verified fact of nature, speciation through Darwinian evolution has never been witnessed and is \"an absurd theory without basis or foundation.\" Instead, the sum of zoological variation is determined by the seeds of life traveling throughout space (protected by electromagnetic \"whirlwinds\") which determine the evolution and devolution of life on any planet. Life, according to Samael Aun Weor, is eternal, however its expression is divided into evolutive and devolutive modes: species evolve, reach a pinnacle, and necessarily devolve and return to a germinal state.\n\nMan, therefore, is not the outcome of the evolution from a common ancestor to the primates, but rather the exponent of an eternal anthropic principle. Monkeys, apes, and other primates are instead the outcome of certain sub-sects of ancient humanity copulating with animals, and are in a complete state of devolution.\n\nHe does state however that evolution within a species is possible, yet that no species can evolve from another species. Furthermore, he states that the human or 'intellectual animal' naturally evolves in time, for example our society is an evolution from previous societies - however the evolution of species can never achieve spiritual liberation because it will always return to devolution. Spiritual liberation requires a 'revolution of consciousness'.\n\nIn many books Samael Aun Weor wrote about the \"Final Catastrophe\" or Apocalypse. His work \"The Aquarian Message\" is a commentary on the Book of Revelation, which affirms the notion that present civilization will end and a future one will emerge. Only those souls who remove their ego in the present time will avoid the Second Death and re-transmigrations. A specific date is never given, only that this civilization is in the twilight of its existence.\n\nSamael Aun Weor wrote about social problems in the books \"The Social Christ\" and \"The Social Transformation of Humanity\". \"The Social Christ\" is primarily concerned with a comprehensive critique of Marxism or Dialectical Materialism, but deals also with the injustices of the Capitalist system;\"We are filled with horror in the presence of so much infamy. The ones that cannot pay for a stall in the public markets are persecuted, but they flatter and butter up the powerful gentlemen that steal millions of pesos from the people. In this way the capitalists fertilize the soil and prepare it in order that in it the filthy flower of Communism can germinate.\"All political systems, Samael states, are a reflection of our own psychology, and he explains that in order to finally finish with oppression it is necessary to change our own psychological state through the Death of Ego, combining this with non-violent resistance and the unionization of workers.\"The struggle for the triumph of social justice is very long and hard, but we must never use violence, nor revolutions of blood and liquor.\"In order \"to start a new age and realize the Social Christ on the face of the earth\", Samael Aun Weor formed a political party called 'POSCLA', The Christian Socialist Party of Latin America, which he later disbanded as a formal organization.\n\nIn his works, \"Occult Medicine and Practical Magic\", \"Igneous Rose\" and others, Samael Aun Weor taught about elemental magic. In the former work he expressed his opposition to the medicine of modern science, allopathy, and called for the Gnostics to learn the ways of Indigenous and Elemental Medicine.\n\nSamael Aun Weor taught that all the plants of nature are living Elemental Spirits, similarly to Paracelsus and many other esoteric teachers. He states that it is the Elemental Spirits who cure, not simply the 'cadavers of the plants'. Plants should be treated as living beings, harvested at the proper hours etc. He stated that the Elementals of all plants are aspects of The Divine Mother in the form of Mother Nature. In 'Occult Medicine and Practical Magic' he spoke about the healing methods of the Kogi Mamas, who diagnose sicknesses by means of clairvoyance.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has labeled Samael Aun Weor's Christian Gnostic Movement as a pseudo-church and some Roman Catholic authors have accused Samael Aun Weor of trying to seduce Roman Catholic priests and nuns to abandon their vows of celibacy and practice the sexual teachings promulgated by the Gnostic Movement; these authors also believe that the current wave to discredit the legitimacy of the Roman Catholic Church comes from the same source while others go so far as to label it heresy.\n\nAs of 11 Feb 1984 or thereabouts, the Ministry of Tenerife, Spain, denied incorporation to Samael Aun Weor's Universal Christian Gnostic Church of Spain operating from 38 San Francisco St., in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain, on the grounds that said organization is not a legitimate church as it does not have any record of incorporation as such in any country whatsoever.\n\nIn 1990, after numerous consultations with high-ranking members of the Roman Catholic Church and other figures who prefer to remain anonymous such as lawyers, public prosecutors, psychiatrists and psychologists, Pilar Salarrullana who has been a political figure since 1974 and is considered an expert on sects, published \"Las Sectas\" (\"The Sects: a living testament to Messianic terror in Spain\") which became a best-seller with six editions the first year alone and in spite of its popularly inquisitorial tone, it denounces the Gnostic Movements among others as some of the most dangerous anti-social plagues in Spain.\n\nIn 1991, F. W. Haack (1935–1991), who was chief delegate of the Evangelical Church with responsibility for sects and ideologies, attacked Weor's ideology in a German book published in Zurich — nevertheless the Gnostic branches of the movement in Germany and Switzerland are still active and expanding. The Gnostic associations are active in Switzerland with a moderate following of Italian, French and German speaking members.\n\nSamael Aun Weor wrote over sixty books, covering a broad range of esoteric, philosophical, and anthropological subjects. The following is taken in part from the Bibliography of Samael Aun Weor although a more accurate list may in fact exist in these Writings by date, since the below list clearly shows titles supposedly written after his corporeal death and may in fact simply relate to their English translation from Spanish.\n\n"}
{"id": "21988742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21988742", "title": "Shamanic music", "text": "Shamanic music\n\nShamanic music is music played either by actual shamans as part of their rituals, or by people who, whilst not themselves shamans, wish to evoke the cultural background of shamanism in some way. So Shamanic music includes both music used as part of shamans' rituals and music that refers to, or draws on, this.\n\nIn shamanism the shaman has a more active musical role than the medium in spirit possession. But a shaman's ritual is a ritual performance and not a musical performance, and this shapes its musical dimension. A shaman uses various ways of making sounds to which different ritual purposes are ascribed. Of particular importance are the shaman's song and shaman's drumming.\n\nRecently in Siberia, music groups drawing on a knowledge of shamanic culture have emerged. In the West shamanism has served as an imagined background to musics meant to alter a listener's state of mind.\n\nKorea and Tibet are two cultures where the music of shamanic ritual has interacted closely with other traditions.\n\nAlthough shamans use singing as well as drumming and sometimes other instruments, a shamanic ritual is not a musical performance in the normal sense, and the music is directed more to spirits than to an audience. Several things follow from this. First, a shamanic ritual performance is, above all, a series of actions and not a series of musical sounds. Second, the shaman's attention is directed inwards towards her or his visualisation of the spirit world and communication with the spirits, and not outwards to any listeners who might be present. Third, it is important for the success of the ritual that it be given its own clearly defined context that is quite different from any kind of entertainment. Fourth, any theatrical elements that are added to impress an audience are of a type to make the contact with the spirits seem more real and not to suggest the performer's musical virtuosity. From a musical perspective shamanic ritual performances have the distinctive feature of . Breaks may happen because a spirit is proving difficult to communicate with, or the shaman needs to call a different spirit. Typically, phases of the performance are broken off abruptly, perhaps to be restarted after a gap, perhaps not. The rhythmic dimension of the music of shamans' rituals has been connected to the idea of both incorporating the rhythms of nature and magically re-articulating them.\n\nIt has been argued that shamanism and spirit possession involve contrasting kinds of special states of mind. The shaman actively enters the spirit world, negotiates with her or his own helper spirit and then with other spirits as necessary, and moves between different territories of the spirit world. The possessed medium, on the other hand, is the passive recipient of a powerful spirit or god. This reflects on the different uses of music involved. Possession music is typically long in duration, mesmeric, loud and intense, with climaxes of rhythmic intensity and volume to which the medium has learned to respond by entering a trance state: the music is not played by the medium but by one or more musicians. In shamanism, the music is played by the shaman, confirms the shaman's power (in the words of the shaman's song), and is used actively by the shaman to modulate movements and changes of state as part of an active journey within the spirit world. In both cases the connection between music and an altered state of mind depends on both psychoacoustic and cultural factors, and the music cannot be said to 'cause' trance-states.\n\nSound is tactile; whereas visual information is experienced at the surface, auditory information seems to be both outside and inside the body. In oral cultures in which survival involves close contact with nature, sound often connects inner feelings to features of the natural environment. In many cases, this holds also for the music in shamanistic practice, including e.g. onomatopoeia, imitation of animal cries etc.. The shaman's use of sound is to catalyse an imaginary inner environment which is experienced as a sacred space-time in which the shaman travels and encounters spirits. Sound, passing constantly between inner and outer, connects this imaginary space with the actual space of the ritual in which the shaman is moving and making ritual actions and gestures.\n\nIt has been suggested that the sound material used by the shaman constitutes a system of sounds. This idea of a semiotics of the sound material would imply a symbolic language shared between the shaman and the surrounding community. However, the evidence suggests that any symbolic language elements are understood only by the shaman and perhaps by other shamans initiated by this shaman. In other words, the symbolic language - if there is one - is more likely to be shared with the spirits than with a human community.\n\nA shaman may use different sounds for different ritual purposes: \nA very important element in Siberian shamanism is the use of hanging metallic objects - possibly including small bells - attached to the shaman's ritual cloak and to the inside of the drum and also sometimes to the beater. This sets up a continuously moving sound field, heard as a single complex sound. A further element is the spatialisation of sound brought about not only by the shaman's movement, but also by techniques of singing into the drum to create the illusion of the voice coming from elsewhere. Different individual shamans and different local traditions may use different sounds. For example, in the south of Tuva and in Mongolia the \"khomus\", or jaw harp is commonly used in shamanising.\n\nParticular sounds, like bells, may be used for purifying the place in which the ritual is to be performed. This is because a ritual involving contact with the spirits is always potentially dangerous, and one of the dangers is that of pollution.\n\nA bell may also be used for calling or sending back spirits. Shamans will also imitate the sounds of birds and animals in order to call spirits. Sami shamanic singing, called Joik, is also about summoning, for example, animal spirits, rather than singing about them or representing them: the spirit is experienced as being present.\n\nWithin shamanic ritual, sound can also be used as a healing power, conceived as a way of directing spiritual energy from the shaman into an afflicted person. In Tuva sick persons are said to have been healed by the sound of a stringed instrument made from a tree struck by lightning.\n\nThe shaman's song - or \"algysh\" in Tuvan - is personal to the shaman and tells of her or his birthplace, initiation, ancestral pedigree, special gifts and special connections to particular spirits. The melody and words are composed by the shaman and generally remain the same throughout the shaman's professional life. The \"algysh\" is often sung near the beginning of the ritual and accompanied by drumming on the dungur drum. It serves to remind the shaman of their shamanic identity and power. It proclaims the shaman's abilities and announces the shaman to the spirits. In some traditions the shaman's song may be broken up into short sections, varied and recombined in different performances.\n\nThe single headed frame drum is widely used in shamanic ritual, often with metallic ritual objects dangling inside, held by an interior wooden cross-piece, and played with a special beater that may also itself be a rattle. The drum will be made of consecrated materials, a specially chosen tree and the skin of a carefully chosen animal, sometimes by a specialist drum-maker. It will also have been 'enlivened' usually by a more powerful shaman so as to give it its spiritual properties. The head is sometimes decorated with a graphic typically representing the division of the cosmos into upper, middle and lower worlds. A shamanic ritual often begins with heating the drum head over a fire to bring it up to the desired pitch. A number of theories have been advanced to explain the importance of percussion in ritual music in general. One line of explanation is psychoacoustic, whereby the tempo of the drum enables the shaman to enter the desired brain wave state, which corresponds to the number of beats per second of the drum. However, in the case of shamanism, it seems that the portable drum is highly suited for a performance in which action and gesture are the top line. The physical gesture of playing the drum is often integrated into a shamanic dance. For this reason the drumming is not restricted to regular tempo but may speed up and slow down with irregular accents. In some regions, the skin of a shaman's drum should be cut after his/her death. In others, not.\n\nFrom the late 1980s with the loosening up of political restrictions a number of Siberian native cultures underwent a cultural renaissance, shamans began to practice openly again, and musicians formed bands drawing on shamanic traditions. Cholbon and AiTal, in Sakha/Yakutsk, Biosyntes and early Yat-Kha in Tuva fall into this category. Nevertheless, the musicians involved, if sometimes unsure of their own exact role, recognized an important difference between artists using shamanic themes and shamans themselves. In the West bands began to apply the label 'shamanic' loosely to any music that might induce a trance state. This was partly due to the rarity of actual recordings of shamans' rituals. Meanwhile, the British-Tuvan group K-Space developed ways of combining improvisation, electronics and experimental recording and montage techniques with the more shamanic side of Tuvan traditional music. In Hungary Vágtázó Halottkémek(in English: Galloping Coroners) later Vágtázó Csodaszarvas set out under the banner of shamanpunk to use ethnographic materials as manuals on how to reach and communicate ecstatic states. From 2005 Vágtázó Csodaszarvas (Galloping Wonder Stag) continued Vágtázó Halottkémek music philosophy turning it into a neotraditional music style closer to world music, replacing electronic guitars and drums with acoustic volk instruments.\n\nKorea is the only country where shamanism appears to have been a state religion practiced by the literate classes, during the Three Kingdoms Period (57BC-668AD). Under successive dynasties shamanism was gradually relegated to a popular or folk status with the arrival of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. The early official status of shamanism is the probable explanation for the fact that shamanic ritual in Korea developed highly complex and established forms. Correspondingly the music used in shamanic rituals is more elaborate in Korea than elsewhere. Furthermore, since the emergence of Korean contemporary nationalism, there has been a strong and sustained state intervention to preserve artistic traditions. All of these factors make it uniquely difficult in Korea to distinguish the 'pure' from hybrid and concert forms of shamanic ritual music. For example, \"Sinawi\" is a musical form that can be used in shamanic rituals, or to accompany folk dances, or for urban concert performance. In the ritual context \"Sinawi\" is often performed by a small ensemble with the \"changgo\" hour-glass drum and two melodic instruments, often the \"taegum\" flute and the \"piri\" oboe. In concert the ensemble is augmented with stringed instruments Modern \"Sinawi\" is played in a minor mode in 12/8 time. The role of music in Korean shamanism seems intermediary between the possession trance model and the Siberian model: in the \"Kut\" ritual, the music, played by musicians, first calls on the god to possess the \"mudang\" (shaman), then accompanies the god during their time in the shaman's body, then sends back and placates the god at the end. However, the shaman is the singer and dancer and the shaman directs the musicians.\n\nBefore Buddhism came to Tibet, the local form of shamanism was Bön. Bön developed into an organised religion. When Buddhism arrived, both religions began competing with each other, and incorporated many of each other's practices. The Bön shaman's drum on a pole became part of Tibetan Buddhist ritual music ensembles. Also, the shang - a kind of bell-cymbal - became incorporated in Buddhist rituals. It was formerly only used by shamans to clear away negative energy before shamanic rituals.\nThe practice of giving a sonorous identity to deities, of calling them and sending them back by means of sounds, may well have entered Tibetan Buddhist ritual from Bön tradition.\n\n\"Mongolie Chamanes et Lamas\", Ocora C560059 (1994)\n\n\"Shamanic and Narrative Songs from the Siberian Arctic\", Sibérie 1, Musique du Monde, BUDA 92564-2\n\n\"Musiche e sciamani\", Musica del Mondo, Textus 001 (2000).

He painted the paneled room in a rich and unified palette of brilliant blue-greens with over-glazing and metallic gold leaf. Painted between 1876–77, it now is considered one of the greatest surviving aesthetic interiors, and best examples of the Anglo-Japanese style.\n\n\"The Peacock Room\" was originally designed as a dining room in the townhouse located at in the neighbourhood of Kensington in London, and owned by the British shipping magnate Frederick Richards Leyland. Leyland engaged the British architect Richard Norman Shaw to remodel and redecorate his home. Shaw entrusted the remodelling of the dining room to , another British architect experienced in the Anglo-Japanese style. Jeckyll conceived the dining room as a \"Porsellanzimmer\" (porcelain room).\n\nHe covered the walls with 16th-century wall hangings of \"Cuir de Cordoue\" that had been originally brought to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Aragon. They were painted with her heraldic device, the open pomegranate, and a series of red roses, Tudor roses, to symbolise her union with Henry VIII. They had hung on the walls of a Tudor style house in Norfolk for centuries, before they were bought by Leyland for £1,000. Against these walls, Jekyll constructed an intricate lattice framework of engraved spindled walnut shelves that held Leyland's collection of Chinese blue and white porcelain, mostly from the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty.\n\nTo the south of the room, a walnut welsh dresser was placed in the centre, just below the large empty leather panel, and flanked on both sides by the framework shelves. On the east side, three tall windows parted the room overlooking a private park, and covered by full-length walnut shutters. To the north a fireplace, over which hung the painting by American painter James McNeill Whistler, , that served as the focal point of the room. The ceiling was constructed in a pendant panelled Tudor-style, and decorated with eight globed pendant gas light fixtures. To finish the room, Jekyll placed a rug with a red border on the floor.\n\nJeckyll had nearly completed his decorative scheme when an illness compelled him to abandon the project. Whistler, who was then working on decorations for the entrance hall of Leyland's house, volunteered to finish Jeckyll's work in the dining room. Concerned that the red roses adorning the leather wall hangings clashed with the colours in \"The Princess\", Whistler suggested retouching the leather with yellow paint, and Leyland agreed to that minor alteration. He also authorised Whistler to embellish the cornice and wainscoting with a \"wave pattern\" derived from the design in Jeckyll's leaded-glass door, and then went to his home in Liverpool. During Leyland's absence however, Whistler grew bolder with his revisions.\n\nUpon returning, Leyland was shocked by the \"improvements.\" Artist and patron quarrelled so violently over the room and the proper compensation for the work that the important relationship for Whistler was terminated. At one point, Whistler gained access to Leyland's home and painted two fighting peacocks meant to represent the artist and his patron, and which he titled .\n\nWhistler is reported to have said to Leyland, \"Ah, I have made you famous. My work will live when you are forgotten. Still, per chance, in the dim ages to come you will be remembered as the proprietor of the Peacock Room.\"\n\nThe dispute between Whistler and Leyland did not end there. In 1879, Whistler was forced to file for bankruptcy, and Leyland was his chief creditor at the time. When the creditors arrived to inventory the artist's home for liquidation, they were greeted by , a large painted caricature of Leyland portrayed as an anthropomorphic demonic peacock playing a piano, sitting upon Whistler's house, painted in the same colours featured in the \"Peacock Room\". He referenced the incident again in his book, \"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\". Adding to the emotional drama was Whistler's fondness for Leyland's wife, Frances, who separated from her husband in 1879. Another result of this drama was Jeckyll who, so shocked by the first sight of \"his\" room, returned home and was later found on the floor of his studio covered in gold leaf; he never recovered and died insane three years later.\n\nHaving acquired \"The Princess from the Land of Porcelain\", American industrialist and art collector Charles Lang Freer anonymously purchased the entire room in 1904 from Leyland's heirs, including Leyland's daughter and her husband, the British artist Val Prinsep. Freer then had the contents of the \"Peacock Room\" installed in his Detroit mansion. After Freer's death in 1919, the \"Peacock Room\" was permanently installed in the Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The gallery opened to the public in 1923.\n\n\"The Peacock Room\" was closed for renovation, along with other parts of the gallery, in January 2016. It reopened to the public in the summer of 2017. \"Filthy Lucre\", an installation by contemporary artist Darren Waterston, replicates \"The Peacock Room\" in a state of decay and disrepair. It opened in May 2015.\n\n\n"}

Kierkegaard wrote a book entitled \"A Cycle of Ethical-Religious Essays\" but chose to publish these two essays as a separate piece while leaving the rest unpublished. The unpublished work would eventually become \"The Book on Adler\". The work is in dual authorship with his signed work \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\", also completed in 1847.\n\nKierkegaard, known for his frequent use of pseudonyms, would publish only overtly religious works under his own name, but published his philosophical works under pseudonyms. Each name cultivates a different personality reflective of the overarching meaning of the work. H.H. was the first of two religious pseudonyms, the first being Anti-Climacus, the author of \"The Sickness Unto Death\" and \"Practice in Christianity\". While both are religious, H.H. is less intellectually and philosophically engaged than Anti-Climacus. H.H. is also not an idealized representation of Christianity despite writing authoritatively.\n\nThe first essay is entitled \"Has a Man the Right to Let Himself Be Put to Death for the Truth?\" The essay outlines the idea and practice of martyrdom in Christianity and whether or not the martyr has the right to die for truth. The work would parallel both his relationship to Regine Olsen and the image of the crucified Christ. \n\nHis conclusion was that humans should not die for truth but instead be lovingly concerned for others. This problem would be later addressed in his essay \"Armed Neutrality\", which is signed under his own name.\n\nThe second essay is entitled \"The Difference Between a Genius and an Apostle\". The work focuses on the issue of those who are associated with the Absolute and those who are naturally intelligent or gifted. Although both types of men are similar, the apostle speaks with authority, whereas the genius does not. Kierkegaard regarded it as thoughtless to call St. Paul a genius if he was divinely inspired, since he spoke with authority.\n"}

The original Greek term, however, merely meant an authoritarian sovereign without reference to character, bearing no pejorative connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods. However, it was clearly a negative word to Plato, a Greek philosopher, and on account of the decisive influence of philosophy on politics, its negative connotations only increased, continuing into the Hellenistic period.\n\nPlato and Aristotle define a tyrant as a person who rules without law, using extreme and cruel methods against both their own people and others. It is defined further in the Encyclopédie as a usurper of sovereign power who makes his subjects the victims of his passions and unjust desires, which he substitutes for laws. During the seventh and sixth centuries BC, tyranny was often looked upon as an intermediate stage between narrow oligarchy and more democratic forms of polity. However, in the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, a new kind of tyrant, the military dictator, arose, specifically in Sicily.\n\nAccusations of tyranny can be applied to a variety of types of government – by an individual (in an autocracy), by a minority (in an oligarchy, tyranny of the minority) or by a majority (in a democracy, tyranny of the majority). The definition is extended to other oppressive leadership and to oppressive policies. For example, a teacher may find the school administration, the textbook or standardized tests to be oppressive, considering each to represent a tyranny.\n\nThe English noun \"tyrant\" appears in Middle English use, via Old French, from the 1290s.\nThe word derives from Latin \"tyrannus\", meaning \"illegitimate ruler\", and this in turn from the Greek \"tyrannos\" \"monarch, ruler of a polis\"; \"tyrannos\" in its turn has a Pre-Greek origin, perhaps from Lydian. The final \"-t\" arises in Old French by association with the present participles in \"-ant\".\n\n\"The word 'tyranny' is used with many meanings, not only by the Greeks, but throughout the tradition of the great books.\" The Oxford English Dictionary offers alternative definitions: a ruler, an illegitimate ruler (a usurper), an absolute ruler (despot) or an oppressive, unjust or cruel ruler. The term is usually applied to vicious dictators who achieve bad results for the governed. The definition of a tyrant is cursed by subjectivity. Oppression, injustice and cruelty do not have standardized measurements or thresholds.\n\nThe Greeks defined both usurpers and those inheriting rule from usurpers as tyrants.\n\nOld words are defined by their historical usage. It is difficult to determine which characteristics of tyrants were defining rather than descriptive. Biblical quotations do not use the word tyrant, but express opinions very similar to those of the Greek philosophers, citing the wickedness, cruelty and injustice of rulers.\n\n\nThe Greek philosophers stressed the (subjective) quality of rule rather than legitimacy or absolutism. \"Both Plato and Aristotle speak of the king as a good monarch and the tyrant as a bad one. Both say that monarchy, or rule by a single man, is royal when it is for the welfare of the ruled and tyrannical when it serves only the interest of the ruler. Both make lawlessness – either a violation of existing laws or government by personal fiat without settled laws – a mark of tyranny.\"\n\nEnlightenment philosophers seemed to define tyranny by its associated characteristics.\n\n\nThe definition is dependent on perspective. A historical example is George III of England. From the British perspective he was a legitimate constitutional monarch. From the colonial perspective he was a tyrant based on a list of grievances enumerated in the United States Declaration of Independence. Colonists were not represented in parliament, so they lacked the rights of the English. Economic exploitation of the colonies was reasonable (perhaps even popular) from the British perspective, tyranny to the Yankees.\n\nBad results are also relative. Authoritarian rule might be beneficial (like with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey) or of limited lasting harm to the country ( like with Francisco Franco of Spain). Those who list or rank tyrants can provide definitions and criteria for comparison or acknowledge subjectivity. Comparative criteria may include checklists or body counts. Accounting for deaths in war is problematic – war can build empires or defend the populace – it also keeps winning tyrants in power. \"Ch'in Shih-huang is the first emperor of China. He united seven separate kingdoms into a single nation. He built the Great Wall and was buried with the terra-cotta soldiers. The Chinese have mixed feelings about him. They're proud of the nation he created, but he was a maniacal tyrant.\" Gene Luen Yang Oppressive dictators have held states together (Alexander the Great, Josip Broz Tito).\n\nA modern tyrant might be objectively defined by proven violation of international criminal law such as crimes against humanity.\n\nThe state is the product of civilization. Agriculture allowed greater concentrations of people which lead to more conflict. Political and military leaders arose to manage conflicts. All leaders were once dictators. \"[T]he very essence of politics in [agrarian civilizations] was, by our contemporary democratic standards, tyrannical\". Eventually alternative forms and methods of government arose which allowed belated definitions and criticism.\n\nHistory has labeled a set of ancient Greek and Sicilian leaders as tyrants. History remembers the rulers, their rises, methods, and ends and the environment in which they ruled. Ancient political commentators Plato and Aristotle lived late in the period of many tyrants. They had monarchies and democracies for comparison. The historical definition is best understood from their historical perspective.\n\nIn ancient Greece, tyrants were influential opportunists that came to power by securing the support of different factions of a deme. The word \"tyrannos\", possibly pre-Greek, Pelasgian or eastern in origin, then carried no ethical censure; it simply referred to anyone, good or bad, who obtained executive power in a polis by unconventional means. Support for the tyrants came from the growing middle class and from the peasants who had no land or were in debt to the wealthy landowners. It is true that they had no legal right to rule, but the people preferred them over kings or the aristocracy.\n\nThe Greek tyrants stayed in power by using mercenary soldiers from outside of their respective city-state. To mock tyranny, Thales wrote that the strangest thing to see is \"an aged tyrant\" meaning that tyrants do not have the public support to survive for long.\n\nAn aesymnetes (pl. aesymnetai) had similar scope of power to the tyrant, such as Pittacus of Mytilene (c. 640–568 BC), and was elected for life or for a specified period by a city-state in a time of crisis – the only difference being that the aesymnetes was a constitutional office and were comparable to the Roman dictator. Magistrates in some city-states were also called aesymnetai.\n\nGreek tyranny grew out of the struggle of the under classes against the aristocracy, or against priest-kings where archaic traditions and mythology sanctioned hereditary and/or traditional rights to rule. Popular coups generally installed tyrants, who often became or remained popular rulers, at least in the early part of their reigns. For instance, the popular imagination remembered Peisistratus for an episode – related by (pseudonymous) Aristotle, but possibly fictional – in which he exempted a farmer from taxation because of the particular barrenness of his plot.\n\nPeisistratus' sons Hippias and Hipparchus, on the other hand, were not such able rulers, and when the disaffected aristocrats Harmodios and Aristogeiton slew Hipparchus, Hippias' rule quickly became oppressive, resulting in the expulsion of the Peisistratids in 510 BC, who resided henceforth in Persepolis as clients of the Persian Shahanshah (King of kings).\n\nOne of the earliest known uses of the word tyrant (in Greek) was by the poet Archilochus, who lived three centuries before Plato, in reference to king Gyges of Lydia. The king's assumption of power was unconventional.\n\nThe heyday of the Archaic period tyrants came in the early 6th century BC, when Cleisthenes ruled Sicyon in the Peloponnesus and Polycrates ruled Samos. During this time, revolts overthrew many governments in the Aegean world. Chilon, the ambitious and capable ephor of Sparta, built a strong alliance amongst neighbouring states by making common cause with these groups seeking to oppose unpopular tyrannical rule. By intervening against the tyrants of Sicyon, Corinth and Athens, Sparta thus came to assume Hellenic leadership prior to the Persian invasions. Simultaneously Persia first started making inroads into Greece, and many tyrants sought Persian help against popular forces seeking to remove them.\n\nCorinth hosted one of the earliest of Greek tyrants. In Corinth, growing wealth from colonial enterprises, and the wider horizons brought about by the export of wine and oil, together with the new experiences of the Eastern Mediterranean brought back by returning mercenary hoplites employed overseas created a new environment. Conditions were right for Cypselus to overthrow the aristocratic power of the dominant but unpopular clan of Bacchiadae. Clan members were killed, executed, driven out or exiled in 657 BC. Corinth prospered economically under his rule, and Cypselus managed to rule without a bodyguard. When he then bequeathed his position to his son, Periander, the tyranny proved less secure, and Periander required a retinue of mercenary soldiers personally loyal to him.\n\nNevertheless, under Cypselus and Periander, Corinth extended and tightened her control over her colonial enterprises, and exports of Corinthian pottery flourished. However, tyrants seldom succeeded in establishing an untroubled line of succession. Periander threw his pregnant wife downstairs (killing her), burnt his concubines alive, exiled his son, warred with his father-in-law and attempted to castrate 300 sons of his perceived enemies. He retained his position. Periander's successor was less fortunate and was expelled. Afterward, Corinth was ruled by a lackluster oligarchy, and was eventually eclipsed by the rising fortunes of Athens and Sparta.\n\nAthens hosted its tyrants late in the Archaic period. In Athens, the inhabitants first gave the title of tyrant to Peisistratos (a relative of Solon, the Athenian lawgiver) who succeeded in 546 BC, after two failed attempts, to install himself as tyrant. Supported by the prosperity of the peasantry and landowning interests of the plain, which was prospering from the rise of olive oil exports, as well as his clients from Marathon, he managed to achieve authoritarian power. Through an ambitious program of public works, which included fostering the state cult of Athena; encouraging the creation of festivals; supporting the Panathenaic Games in which prizes were jars of olive oil; and supporting the Dionysia (ultimately leading to the development of Athenian drama), Peisistratus managed to maintain his personal popularity.\n\nHe was followed by his sons, and with the subsequent growth of Athenian democracy, the title \"tyrant\" took on its familiar negative connotations. The murder of Peisistratus' son, the tyrant Hipparchus by Aristogeiton and Harmodios in Athens in 514 BC marked the beginning of the so-called \"cult of the tyrannicides\" (i.e., of killers of tyrants). Contempt for tyranny characterised this cult movement. Despite financial help from Persia, in 510 the Peisistratids were expelled by a combination of intrigue, exile and Spartan arms. The anti-tyrannical attitude became especially prevalent in Athens after 508 BC, when Cleisthenes reformed the political system so that it resembled \"demokratia\" (ancient participant democracy as opposed to the modern representative democracy). Hippias (Peisistratus' other son) offered to rule the Greeks on behalf of the Persians and provided military advice to the Persians against the Greeks.\n\nThe Thirty Tyrants whom the Spartans imposed on a defeated Attica in 404 BC would not be classified as tyrants in the usual sense and were in effect an oligarchy.\n\nThe best known Sicilian tyrants appeared long after the Archaic period. The tyrannies of Sicily came about due to similar causes, but here the threat of Carthaginian attack prolonged tyranny, facilitating the rise of military leaders with the people united behind them. Such Sicilian tyrants as Gelo, Hiero I, Hiero II, Dionysius the Elder, Dionysius the Younger, and Agathocles maintained lavish courts and became patrons of culture. The dangers threatening the lives of the Sicilian tyrants are highlighted in the morale tale of the \"Sword of Damocles\".\n\nUnder the Macedonian hegemony in the 4th and 3rd century BC a new generation of tyrants rose in Greece, especially under the rule of king Antigonus II Gonatas, who installed his puppets in many cities of the Peloponnese. Examples were Cleon of Sicyon, Aristodemus of Megalopolis, Aristomachus I of Argos, Abantidas of Sicyon, Aristippus of Argos, Lydiadas of Megalopolis, Aristomachus II of Argos, and Xenon of Hermione.\n\nAgainst these rulers, in 280 BC the democratic cities started to join forces in the Achaean League which was able to expand its influence even into Corinthia, Megaris, Argolis and Arcadia. From 251 BC under the leadership of Aratus of Sicyon, the Achaeans liberated many cities, in several cases by convincing the tyrants to step down, and when Aratus died in 213 BC, Hellas had been free of tyrants for more than 15 years. The last tyrant on the Greek mainland, Nabis of Sparta, was assassinated in 192 BC and after his death the Peloponnese was united as a confederation of stable democracies in the Achaean League.\n\nRoman historians like Suetonius, Tacitus, Plutarch, and Josephus often spoke of \"tyranny\" in opposition to \"liberty\". Tyranny was associated with imperial rule and those rulers who usurped too much authority from the Roman Senate. Those who were advocates of \"liberty\" tended to be pro-Republic and pro-Senate. For instance, regarding Julius Caesar and his assassins, Suetonius wrote:\nCitizens of the empire were circumspect in identifying tyrants. \"...Cicero's head and hands [were] cut off and nailed to the rostrum of the Senate to remind everyone of the perils of speaking out against tyranny.\" There has since been a tendency to discuss tyranny in the abstract while limiting examples of tyrants to ancient Greek rulers. Philosophers have been more expressive than historians.\n\nJosephus identified tyrants in Biblical history (in Antiquities of the Jews) including Nimrod, Moses, the Maccabees and Herod the Great. He also identified some later tyrants.\n\nTyranny is considered an important subject, one of the \"Great Ideas\" of Western thought. The classics contain many references to tyranny and its causes, effects, methods, practitioners, alternatives... They consider tyranny from historical, religious, ethical, political and fictional perspectives. \"If any point in political theory is indisputable, it would seem to be that tyranny is the worst corruption of government - a vicious misuse of power and a violent abuse of human beings who are subject to it.\" While this may represent a consensus position among the classics, it is not unanimous - Hobbes (for example) dissented, claiming no objective distinction (vicious vs virtuous) existed among dictators. \"They that are discontented under monarchy, call it tyranny; and they that are displeased with aristocracy, call it oligarchy: so also, they which find themselves grieved under a democracy, call it anarchy...\" (in Leviathan)\n\nDante mentioned tyrants (\"who laid hold on blood and plunder\") in the seventh level of Hell (Divine Comedy) where they are submerged in boiling blood. These included Alexander the Great and Attila the Hun who shared the region with highway robbers.\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli conflates all rule by a single person (whom he generally refers to as a \"prince\") with \"tyranny,\" regardless of the legitimacy of that rule, in his \"Discourses on Livy\". He also identifies liberty with republican regimes; whether he would include so-called \"crowned republics\" (such as modern constitutional monarchies) is somewhat unclear from the text.\n\nAncient Greeks, as well as the Roman Republicans, became generally quite wary of many people seeking to implement a popular coup. Shakespeare portrays the struggle of one such anti-tyrannical Roman, Marcus Junius Brutus, in his play \"Julius Caesar\".\n\nIn Gibbons' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume I, Chapter III, Augustus was shown to assume the power of a tyrant while sharing power with the reformed senate. \"After a decent resistance, the crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate; and consented to receive the government of the provinces, and the general command of the Roman armies...\" Emperors \"humbly professed themselves the accountable ministers of the senate, whose supreme decrees they dictated and obeyed.\" The Roman Empire \"may be defined as an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth.\" Roman emperors were deified. Gibbons called emperors tyrants and their rule tyranny. His definitions in the chapter were related to the absolutism of power alone - not oppression, injustice or cruelty. He ignored the appearance of shared rule.\n\nIn the Enlightenment, thinkers applied the word tyranny to the system of governance that had developed around aristocracy and monarchy. Specifically, John Locke as part of his argument against the \"Divine Right of Kings\" in his book \"Two Treatises of Government\" defines it this way: \"Tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right, which nobody can have a right to; and this is making use of the power any one has in his hands, not for the good of those who are under it, but for his own private, separate advantage.\" Locke's concept of tyranny influenced the writers of subsequent generations who developed the concept of tyranny as counterpoint to ideas of human rights and democracy. Thomas Jefferson referred to the tyranny of King George III of Great Britain in the Declaration of Independence, and the concept was refined in turn to refer to the Kings of France, the tyrants of the Terror, and to Napoleon I in turn during the French Revolution and subsequent regimes.\n\nLists include:\n\nThere are also numerous book titles which identify tyrants by name or circumstances.\n\nAmong English rulers, several have been identified as tyrants by book title: John, King of England (who signed the Magna Carta), Henry VIII of England and Oliver Cromwell.\n\nThe path of a tyrant can appear easy and pleasant (for all but the aristocracy). A twentieth-century historian said,\n\n\"Hence the road to power in Greece commercial cities was simple: to attack the aristocracy, defend the poor, and come to an understanding with the middle classes. Arrived at power, the dictator abolished debts, or confiscated large estates, taxed the rich to finance public works, or otherwise redistributed the overconcentrated wealth; and while attaching the masses to himself through such measures, he secured the support of the business community by promoting trade with state coinage and commercial treaties, and by raising the social prestige of the bourgeoisie. Forced to depend upon popularity instead of hereditary power, the dictatorships for the most part kept out of war, supported religion, maintained order, promoted morality, favored the higher status of women, encouraged the arts, and lavished revenues upon the beautification of their cities. And they did all these things, in many cases, while preserving the forms of popular government, so that even under despotism the people learned the ways of liberty. When the dictatorship [of the tyrant] had served to destroy the aristocracy the people destroyed the dictatorship; and only a few changes were needed to make democracy of freemen a reality as well as a form.\"\nAncient Greek philosophers (who were aristocrats) were far more critical in reporting the methods of tyrants. The justification for ousting a tyrant was absent from the historian's description but was central to the philosophers.\n\n\"The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness... This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector.\" Plato in The Republic\n\nDictators inherit the position, rise as company men in the military/party or seize power as entrepreneurs. Early texts called only the entrepreneurs tyrants, distinguishing them from \"bad kings\". Such tyrants may act as renters, rather than owners, of the state.\n\nThe political methods of obtaining power were occasionally supplemented by theater or force. Peisistratus of Athens blamed self-inflicted wounds on enemies to justify a bodyguard which he used to seize power. He later appeared with a woman dressed as a goddess to suggest divine sanction of his rule. The third time he used mercenaries to seize and retain power.\n\nLengthy recommendations of methods were made to tyrants by Aristotle (in Politics for example) and Niccolò Machiavelli (in The Prince). These are, in general, force and fraud. They include hiring bodyguards, stirring up wars to smother dissent, purges, assassinations, unwarranted searches and seizures... Aristotle suggested an alternative means of retaining power - ruling justly.\n\nThe methods of tyrants to retain power have changed little in over two thousand years.\n\nThey placate world opinion by staging rigged elections.\nThey use or threaten violence.\n\nThey seek popular support by appeals to patriotism and claims that conditions have improved.\n\n\"The tyrant binds his followers to him by making them accomplices to his crimes.\" Anonymous\n\n\"The tyrant confuses those he can't convince, corrupts those he can't confuse, and crushes those he can't corrupt.\" Anonymous\n\nThe classics note that tyrants are often unhappy. \"In every tyrant's heart there springs in the end this poison, that he cannot trust a friend.\" (Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound). Tyrants appear to suffer psychological pathologies that result in self-destructive behavior. \"His grandiosity and his skills in deception, manipulation, and intimidation are an advantage to him in securing power. But as he moves toward absolute power, he is also apt to cross moral and geographic boundaries in ways that place him in a vulnerable position. Thus, he may engage in cruelties that serve no political purpose, challenge the conventional morality in ways that undermine his base, engage in faulty reality testing, and overreach himself in foreign engagements in ways that invite new challenges to his rule.\" These pathologies are not evident earlier in life although those without a certain level of brutal self-assurance do not become dictators. The ruled also exhibit pathologies. An attempt on Hitler's life outraged Germans. \"When Stalin died many wept, even in the concentration camps!\" There is no simple relationship between popularity and tyranny.\n\n\n"}

Under Communist rule in Czechoslovakia, Benda was rare in being a believing Christian while also a senior member of the anti-communist dissident organization Charter 77. After the Velvet Revolution, Benda became the head of an organization charged with investigating the former Communist secret police and their informants.\n\nBenda's idea of a Parallel Polis influenced the thought of other Dissidents like Vaclav Havel and has been spread in recent years by American Conservative writer Rod Dreher. The first English anthology of Benda's essays was published by St. Augustine's Press in 2017.\n\nThe son of a lawyer, Benda studied a doctorate of Philosophy at Charles University in Prague, and was also president of the Students' Academic Council. His academic career ended when he refused to join the Communist Party in the early 1970s. Benda was active in the dissident movement against the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, and in 1977 became a signatory to Charter 77. As a result of his political activities he experienced harassment from the government and economic exclusion, being forced to work for brief periods in a large number of different jobs.\n\nIn 1977, he also wrote a short \"samizdat\" essay called \"Parallel Polis\" (), calling for his fellow dissidents to abandon hope that the repressive social, economic and political institutions in Czechoslovakia could be changed by protest. Instead, Benda called for new \"parallel institutions\" to be created, which would be more responsive to human needs and may someday replace the existing corrupt institutions. He argued that as the communist state would drain any efforts at reform, it was better to start new ones than expend energy fighting old ones. The essay was translated into English in 1978.\n\nBenda's role as a spokesman for Charter 77 resulted in him being arrested in May 1979 and charged with subverting the state, for which he was imprisoned until 1983. After his release he resumed his role as spokesman. He was also a founder-member of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS). While Benda was imprisoned with Vaclav Havel in Ostrava, they co-wrote a text for the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1980.\n\nA devout Roman Catholic, Benda joined the Christian Democratic Party in 1989, becoming chairman in 1990. The party later merged with the Civic Democratic Party. Benda's politics were distinct from his former dissident colleagues, and he became an increasingly isolated figure in Czech politics. He was a supporter of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a position which was unpopular in the Czech Republic.\n\nFrom June 25 to December 31, 1992, Benda was Chairman of the Chamber of the Nations.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1998, Benda served as head of the Bureau for Investigating the Crimes of Communist Party officials.\n\nIn 1996, he was elected to the Czech Senate for the Prague 1 district, and held the seat until his death in 1999.\n\nBenda's ideas about a Parallel Polis were later revived by a group of scholars at the University of Washington, and a four-story building called Parallel polis has opened in Prague, housing a bitcoin-only cafe, co-working space, makers lab, and \"Institute of cryptoanarchy\" in Holešovice.\n\nIn his 2017 book \"The Benedict Option\", author Rod Dreher praised the ideas expressed in Benda's essays and recommended them to American Christians as an example of how to preserve and live their faith in a culture increasingly hostile to it.\n\n"}
