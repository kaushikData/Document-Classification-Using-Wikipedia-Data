{"id": "1168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1168", "title": "Anaximander", "text": "Anaximander\n\nAnaximander (; \"Anaximandros\"; was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.\n\nLittle of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies, although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.\n\nHe was an early proponent of science and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular interest in its origins, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long. Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's philosophy included contributions to many disciplines. In astronomy, he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or apeiron) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of geometry allowed him to introduce the gnomon in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of geography. He was also involved in the politics of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.\n\nAnaximander, son of Praxiades, was born in the third year of the 42nd Olympiad (610 BC). According to Apollodorus of Athens, Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547–546 BC), and died shortly afterwards.\n\nEstablishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. Themistius, a 4th-century Byzantine rhetorician, mentions that he was the \"first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature.\" Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose, at least in the Western world. By the time of Plato, his philosophy was almost forgotten, and Aristotle, his successor Theophrastus and a few doxographers provide us with the little information that remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the Monist school which began in Miletus, with Thales followed by Anaximander and finished with Anaximenes. 3rd-century Roman rhetorician Aelian depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to Apollonia on the Black Sea coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen. Indeed, \"Various History\" (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony's allegiance.\n\nAnaximander lived the final few years of his life as a subject of the Persian Achaemenid Empire.\n\nAnaximander's theories were influenced by the Greek mythical tradition, and by some ideas of Thales – the father of philosophy – as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the East (especially by the Babylonian astrologers). All these were elaborated rationally. In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, and therefore could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system.\n\nSome scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period (8th to 6th century BC) in the Greek city-states. This has given rise to the phrase \"Greek miracle\". But if we follow carefully the course of Anaximander's ideas, we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature (water, air, fire, earth) which the first Greek philosophers believed constituted the universe represent in fact the primordial forces of previous thought. Their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony. In the old cosmogonies – Hesiod (8th – 7th century BC) and Pherecydes (6th century BC) – Zeus establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony (the Titans). Anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not monarchic but geometric, and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth, which is lying in the centre of the universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature. In this space there is \"isonomy\" (equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable. The decisions are now taken by the assembly of \"demos\" in the \"agora\" which is lying in the middle of the city.\n\nThe same \"rational\" way of thought led him to introduce the abstract \"apeiron\" (indefinite, infinite, boundless, unlimited) as an origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original Chaos (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the mythical Greek cosmogony from which everything else appeared. It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements. Origin, then, must be something else unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never stop.\n\nThe \"Refutation\" attributed to Hippolytus of Rome (I, 5), and the later 6th century Byzantine philosopher Simplicius of Cilicia, attribute to Anaximander the earliest use of the word \"apeiron\" ( \"infinite\" or \"limitless\") to designate the original principle. He was the first philosopher to employ, in a philosophical context, the term \"archē\" (), which until then had meant beginning or origin. For him, it became no longer a mere point in time, but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in Homer (indefinite sea) and as in Xenophanes (6th century BC) who said that the earth went down indefinitely (to \"apeiron\") i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men.\n\nAristotle writes (\"Metaphysics\", I.III 3–4) that the Pre-Socratics were searching for the element that constitutes all things. While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element (water for Thales and air for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (\"apeiron\"), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived. He proposed the theory of the \"apeiron\" in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality, and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This \"archē\" is called \"eternal and ageless\". (Hippolytus (?), \"Refutation\", I,6,I;DK B2)\n\nFor Anaximander, the principle of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is it something halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth. Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example, water can only be wet, never dry — and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could any of the other candidates. He postulated the \"apeiron\" as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.\n\nAnaximander explains how the four elements of ancient physics (air, earth, water and fire) are formed, and how Earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions. Unlike other Pre-Socratics, he never defines this principle precisely, and it has generally been understood (e.g., by Aristotle and by Saint Augustine) as a sort of primal chaos. According to him, the Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter. It embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement of things; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in \"all the worlds\" (for he believed there were many).\n\nAnaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came (\"apeiron\"). The one surviving fragment of Anaximander's writing deals with this matter. Simplicius transmitted it as a quotation, which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements:\nWhence things have their origin,\nThence also their destruction happens,\nAccording to necessity;\nFor they give to each other justice and recompense\nFor their injustice\nIn conformity with the ordinance of Time.\nSimplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these \"in poetic terms\", meaning that he used the old mythical language. The goddess Justice (Dike) keeps the cosmic order.\nThis concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards, notably by Aristotle, and by the Greek tragedian Euripides: \"what comes from earth must return to earth.\" Friedrich Nietzsche, in his \"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\", stated that Anaximander viewed \"... all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance.\" Physicist Max Born, in commenting upon Werner Heisenberg's arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of quantum mechanics are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same “primordial substance,”' proposed that this primordial substance be called \"apeiron\".\n\nAnaximander's bold use of non-mythological explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as Hesiod. It confirms that pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demystify physical processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the Universe and the origins of life; for this he is often called the \"Father of Cosmology\" and founder of astronomy. However, pseudo-Plutarch states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities.\n\nAnaximander was the first to conceive a mechanical model of the world. In his model, the Earth floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains \"in the same place because of its indifference\", a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in \"On the Heavens\". Its curious shape is that of a cylinder with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.\n\nAnaximander's realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking. Karl Popper calls this idea \"one of the boldest, most revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking.\" Such a model allowed the concept that celestial bodies could pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek astronomy.\n\nAt the origin, after the separation of hot and cold, a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the Sun was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources) and the lunar wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining lunar phases. The stars and the planets, located closer, followed the same model.\n\nAnaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a celestial sphere. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the Zodiac as the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder reports in \"Natural History\" (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term ecliptic, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The doxographer and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.\n\nAccording to Simplicius, Anaximander already speculated on the plurality of worlds, similar to atomists Leucippus and Democritus, and later philosopher Epicurus. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They claimed that this movement was eternal, \"for without movement, there can be no generation, no destruction\".\n\nIn addition to Simplicius, Hippolytus reports Anaximander's claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds within, which are often infinite in quantity). Cicero writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds.\n\nThis theory places Anaximander close to the Atomists and the Epicureans who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the timeline of the Greek history of thought, some thinkers conceptualized a single world (Plato, Aristotle, Anaxagoras and Archelaus), while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, continuous or non-continuous (Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Empedocles and Diogenes).\n\nAnaximander attributed some phenomena, such as thunder and lightning, to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes. In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.\n\nHe saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth. A part of that mass evaporated under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant. He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun. For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle's \"Meteorology\" (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.\n\nAnaximander speculated about the beginnings and origin of animal life. Taking into account the existence of fossils , he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago. The first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark, but as they got older, the bark would dry up and break. As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, humankind had to adapt. The 3rd century Roman writer Censorinus reports:\n\nAnaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales. He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.\n\nBoth Strabo and Agathemerus (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the geographer Eratosthenes, Anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian Hecataeus of Miletus to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after Homer.\n\nMaps were produced in ancient times, also notably in Egypt, Lydia, the Middle East, and Babylon. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet BM 92687 later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks.\n\nSuch an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons. First, it could be used to improve navigation and trade between Miletus's colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, Thales would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian city-states to join in a federation in order to push the Median threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.\n\nSurely aware of the sea's convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or “navel” of the world ( \"omphalós gẽs\") could have been Delphi, but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The Aegean Sea was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. Europe was bordered on the south by the Mediterranean Sea and was separated from Asia by the Black Sea, the Lake Maeotis, and, further east, either by the Phasis River (now called the Rioni) or the Tanais. The Nile flowed south into the ocean, separating Libya (which was the name for the part of the then-known African continent) from Asia.\n\nThe \"Suda\" relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in Greece of the gnomon. In Lacedaemon, he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of sundials to indicate solstices and equinoxes. Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.\n\nIn his time, the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip's position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.\n\nThe invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve parts, came from the Babylonians. It is they, according to Herodotus' Histories (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the \"Suda\" seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.\n\nIn his philosophical work De Divinatione (I, 50, 112), Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of Lacedaemon to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near. The city collapsed when the top of the Taygetus split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an \"admirable inspiration\", as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction with divination.\n\nBertrand Russell in the \"History of Western Philosophy\" interprets Anaximander's theories as an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist. His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, in \"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\", claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed \"...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance\". (\"Ibid.\", § 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.\n\nMartin Heidegger lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture entitled \"Anaximander's Saying\" which was subsequently included in \"Off the Beaten Track\". The lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of Being or \"Dasein\" in the context of the Anaximander fragment. Heidegger's lecture is, in turn, an important influence on the French philosopher Jacques Derrida.\n\nAccording to the \"Suda\":\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He marked the end of the traditional novel era and laid the foundation of the modern novel era.\n\nCamil Petrescu lost both his parents early in life and was raised by a relative (or a nanny from the Moşilor suburb; the sources remain quite unclear on this).\n\nPetrescu went to primary school at Obor, and to high school at Saint Sava National College, where he wrote his very first poem. Being very poor, he studied assiduously, worked to support himself, and relatively late—at the age of 29—he began his studies in philosophy at the University of Bucharest. His antisemitism is controversial, having Jewish friends such as Mihail Sebastian .\n\nIn 1916, Petrescu was drafted and sent to the battlefields of then raging World War I, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Austro-Hungarians. Freed in 1918, he depicted his war experiences in his 1930 novel \"Ultima noapte de dragoste, întâia noapte de război\" (\"The Last Night of Love, the First Night of War\"). In 1933, Petrescu wrote the novel \"Patul lui Procust\" (\"The Bed of Procrustes\"). He was a teacher in Timişoara, and director of the National Theater Bucharest.

Cartesian doubt is also known as Cartesian skepticism, methodic doubt, methodological skepticism, universal doubt, systematic doubt or hyperbolic doubt.\n\nCartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in philosophy. This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy by René Descartes, who sought to doubt the truth of all his beliefs in order to determine which beliefs he could be certain were true. It is the basis for Descartes' statement, \"Cogito ergo sum\" (\"I think, therefore I am\").\n\nMethodological skepticism is distinguished from philosophical skepticism in that methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims, whereas philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of certain knowledge.\n\nCartesian doubt is methodological. Its purpose is to use doubt as a route to certain knowledge by finding those things which could not be doubted. The fallibility of sense data in particular is a subject of Cartesian doubt.\n\nThere are several interpretations as to the objective of Descartes' skepticism. Prominent among these is a account which claims that Descartes' skepticism is aimed at eliminating all belief which it is possible to doubt, thus leaving Descartes with only basic beliefs (also known as foundational beliefs). From these indubitable basic beliefs, Descartes then attempts to derive further knowledge. It's an archetypal and significant example that epitomizes the Continental Rational schools of philosophy.\n\nDescartes' method of hyperbolic doubt included:\n\nHyperbolic doubt means having the tendency to doubt, since it is an extreme or exaggerated form of doubt. (Knowledge in the Cartesian sense means to know something beyond not merely all reasonable, but all possible, doubt.) In his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" (1641), Descartes resolved to systematically doubt that any of his beliefs were true, in order to build, from the ground up, a belief system consisting of only certainly true beliefs; his end goal—or a major one, at the least—was to find an undoubtable basis for the sciences. Consider Descartes' opening lines of the \"Meditations\":\n\nRené Descartes, the originator of Cartesian doubt, put all beliefs, ideas, thoughts, and matter in doubt. He showed that his grounds, or reasoning, for any knowledge could just as well be false. Sensory experience, the primary mode of knowledge, is often erroneous and therefore must be doubted. For instance, what one is seeing may very well be a hallucination. There is nothing that proves it cannot be. In short, if there is any way a belief can be disproved, then its grounds are insufficient. From this, Descartes proposed two arguments, the dream and the demon.\n\nDescartes, knowing that the context of our dreams, while possibly unbelievable, are often lifelike, hypothesized that humans can only believe that they are awake. There are no sufficient grounds by which to distinguish a dream experience from a waking experience. For instance, Subject A sits at the computer, typing this article. Just as much evidence exists to indicate that the act of composing this article is reality as there is evidence to demonstrate the opposite. Descartes conceded that we live in a world that can create such ideas as dreams. However, by the end of \"The Meditations\", he concludes that we can distinguish dream from reality at least in retrospect:\"But when I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with my whole life without a break then I can be certain that when I encounter these things  I am not asleep but awake.\" — Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings\n\nDescartes reasoned that our very own experience may very well be controlled by an \"evil demon\" of sorts. This demon is as clever and deceitful as he is powerful. He could have created a superficial world that we may think we live in. As a result of this doubt, sometimes termed the Malicious Demon Hypothesis, Descartes found that he was unable to trust even the simplest of his perceptions.\n\nIn \"\", Descartes stated that if one were mad, even briefly, the insanity might have driven man into believing that what we thought was true could be merely our minds deceiving us. He also stated that there could be 'some malicious, powerful, cunning demon' that had deceived us, preventing us from judging correctly.\n\nDescartes argued that all his senses were lying and since your senses can easily fool you, his idea of an infinitely powerful being must be true as that idea could have only been put there by an infinitely powerful being which would have no reason to be deceitful to him.\n\nWhile methodic doubt has a nature, one need not hold that knowledge is impossible in order to apply the method of doubt. Indeed, Descartes' attempt to apply the method of doubt to the existence of himself spawned the proof of his famous saying, \"Cogito, ergo sum\" (I think, therefore I am). That is, Descartes tried to doubt his own existence, but found that even his doubting showed that he existed, since he could not doubt if he did not exist.\n\n\n\n"}

About 84% of the people would say that they were raised Catholic, though only 69% of the population are Catholic today. The 15% decline is mostly due to the spread of Pentecostalism in Latin America. Like Pentecostalism, the Charismatic Catholic Renewal began in the United States. This lay movement began in the 1960s after inspiration of people converting to Pentecostalism and other Protestant denominations. This renewal is to re-emphasize the charisms of the Holy Spirit found in 1 Corinthians in the New Testament of the Bible. Today there are 73 million Catholic Charismatics in Latin America.\n\nThe four main pillars of the renewal in Latin America are Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. \nBrazil's Catholic Charismatic Renewal began in the 1960s when Jesuit priests Edward Dougherty and Harold Rahm departed the United States for Brazil. In the early 1970s, while Rahm was calling on the Holy Spirit for the gift of healing people of addictions and other sorts of things, Edward Dougherty was holding retreats. These retreats were called \"Experience of Holy Spirit\" or \"Experience of Prayer.\" These charismatic retreats emphasized the Holy Spirit. The retreats were then handed over to the lay people of the Catholic Church. In 1979, Dougtery founded Associacao de Señor Jesus (Association of the Lord Jesus) to produce mass media similar to the Pentecostal's. 70,000 member contributors helped fund it. By the 1990s, the movement became popular for university students.\n\nCovenant communities had a huge impact on the spread of Pentecostalism in Brazil. covenant communities were established for people drawn to the movement in strong ways. They were for living in structure with other charismatics looking for encouragement, spiritual direction, and guidance in how to live out their new lives. In 1998 there were about 50 in Brazil. By 2008 that number increased to 300. One of the more popular ones is the New Song community. They provide a TV and radio station for the movement.\n\nBrazil's Charismatic Catholic Mega Church is Cachoeira Paulista. It is the largest Catholic Church in Latin American. Located between Rio and São Paulo in the Paraiba Valley, this church can hold 100,000 people and has 60,000 people coming weekly.\n\nBrazil's approach to the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to embrace popular culture.\n\nDue to 88% of the country of Mexico being Catholic, it was not too difficult for the Catholic Charismatic Renewal to gain support by the bishops. Lay people soon followed. The First Latin American Charismatic Conference was held in 1973. Prior to this movement in Mexico, the Renovation Movement of Catholic Charismatics in the Holy Spirit had already been spreading. Like Brazil, Mexico had multiple covenant communities which began appearing around 1980. By 2007, there were 27 covenant communities. The main focus on this movement in Brazil is evangelization.\n\nIn Colombia, the Catholic Charismatic Movement began in Minuto de Dios as an effort by activist priests in the early 1970s. These people are the lowest social class and priests let them know they are not forgotten. Colombia's spread is influenced by the incorporation of social justice. This confronts the Pentecostal growth in the country.\n\nThe Dominican Republic is regarded as one of the most intensively Charismatic Catholic countries. The movement was accepted by lay people and church hierarchy alike with ease.\n\nThe Catholic streams of the Charismatic Catholic renewal began in Guatemala with Fr. Francis McNutt who visited in 1970 with Tommy Tyson, Chaplain at ORU, and Ruth Carter Stapleton. About 60 clerics and a few lay persons were impacted, leaving Sor Cecilia a nun with the task of renewal. Later in the home of Catholic Dorothy Asturias, a small band of people gathered. Stella Salazar, half sister to the former President of Guatemala Jorge Serrano Elías, was praying for God to release her son from prison in Chicago. Eugene Harshbarger, and Gladys, from the American Doughnuts and former CIA officer were part of this group. Visits from Enoch Christoffersen of the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship added members as more and more people were added. Pepe Garces now owner of NAIS Restaurants was an early adherent, as well as Regina Broll, who would become the President of Women's Aglow International. Tim Rovenstine and Roberta, in their home at Dos Alicias, would hand over their small flock to the group that was formed called Ministerios El Verbo. Dr. Andres Carrodegua who later become a scholar who did a major contribution in Bible Research.\n\n\n"}

His recent publications, in the field of epistemology, have defended a version of rationalism.\n\nSon of the British theologian and biochemist Arthur Peacocke, he was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics as an undergraduate, winning both the Webb Medley Prize in Economics and the Henry Wilde Prize in Philosophy in 1971, and graduated with a first class degree. Later that year he was awarded a Kennedy Memorial Trust scholarship to study at Harvard University. He then continued at Oxford gaining a BPhil (1974) and DPhil (1979) in Philosophy, the latter under the supervision of Michael Dummett. He was Visiting Lecturer at University of California, Berkeley, 1975-6, and in 1975 elected to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. He was the Susan Stebbing Professor of Philosophy at King's College London from 1985 to 1989 and Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at Oxford University from 1989 to 2000, at which time he moved to New York University (NYU). He joined the Philosophy Department at Columbia University in 2004, where he is now Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy. In 2007 he was named to the Richard Wollheim chair in philosophy at University College, London, where he taught in the third (summer) term each year until 2015. He lives with his wife and two children. He is also Visiting Professor of Philosophy at New College of the Humanities.\n\nOf his earlier work, he is perhaps best known for the first chapter of his 1983 book, \"Sense and Content\", entitled \"Sensation and the Content of Experience.\" In this chapter, Peacocke defends the claim that perceptual experience, over and above its intentional content, has certain \"sensational properties\". He gives three different examples of visual scenarios where intentional content alone cannot capture every aspect of the experience. Those aspects which elude intentional content are thought to be the sensational properties of the experience. Some of those who defend qualia have used these examples as evidence of their existence. Several philosophers have criticized these examples (Michael Tye, Fred Dretske), claiming that the supposed extra quality can indeed be captured in terms of intentional content.\n\nIn \"Sense and Content\", Peacocke assumed that the intentional content of mental states is exclusively conceptual content, i.e. the content is such that the subject of the state needs to possess all the concepts that specify the intentional content in question. From about 1986 and onwards, Peacocke abandoned this assumption, arguing that some mental states, in particular perceptual experiences and representational states implicated in subpersonal information processing (for example, in the subconscious parsing of heard speech), have non-conceptual intentional content. Peacocke is now often seen as a leading proponent of this notion of non-conceptual intentional content.\n\nIn his 1992 book \"A Study of Concepts\", Peacocke gives a detailed exposition of a philosophical theory of concept possession, according to which the nature and identity conditions for concepts may be given, in a non-circular way, by the conditions a thinker has to satisfy in order to possess the relevant concepts. The theory is a version of a so-called \"conceptual\" or \"inferential role\" theory of concepts.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "100089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100089", "title": "Conservation (ethic)", "text": "Conservation (ethic)\n\nConservation is an ethic of resource use, allocation, and protection. Its primary focus is upon maintaining the health of the natural world, its fisheries, habitats, and biological diversity. Secondary focus is on material conservation, including non-renewable resources such as metals, minerals and fossil fuels, and energy conservation, which is important to protect the natural world. Those who follow the conservation ethic and, especially, those who advocate or work toward conservation goals are termed conservationists.\n\nThe terms \"conservation\" and \"preservation\" are frequently conflated outside the academic, scientific, and professional kinds of literature. The US National Park Service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics:\n\n″Conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing. Both terms involve a degree of protection, but how that protection is carried out is the key difference. Conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources, while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings, objects, and landscapes. Put simply, \"conservation seeks the proper use of nature, while preservation seeks protection of nature from use\".\n\nDuring the environmental movement of the early 20th century, two opposing factions emerged: conservationists and preservationists. Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether.″\n\nTo conserve habitat in terrestrial ecoregions and to stop deforestation is a goal widely shared by many groups with a wide variety of motivations.\n\nTo protect sea life from extinction due to overfishing or climate change is another commonly stated goal of conservation – ensuring that \"some will be available for future generations\" to continue a way of life.\n\nThe consumer conservation ethic is sometimes expressed by the \"four R's\": \" Rethink, Reduce, Recycle, Repair\"\nThis social ethic primarily relates to local purchasing, moral purchasing, the sustained, and efficient use of renewable resources, the moderation of destructive use of finite resources, and the prevention of harm to common resources such as air and water quality, the natural functions of a living earth, and cultural values in a built environment.\n\nThe principal value underlying most expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value – a view carried forward by the scientific conservation movement and some of the older Romantic schools of ecology movement.\n\nMore Utilitarian schools of conservation seek a proper valuation of local and global impacts of human activity upon nature in their effect upon human well being, now and to posterity. How such values are assessed and exchanged among people determines the social, political, and personal restraints and imperatives by which conservation is practiced. This is a view common in the modern environmental movement.\n\nThese movements have diverged but they have deep and common roots in the conservation movement.\n\nIn the United States of America, the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid the foundation for Romantic and Utilitarian conservation traditions in America. The posthumous publication of Henry David Thoreau's \"Walden\" established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as a citadel to nourish the spirit of man. From George Perkins Marsh a very different book, \"Man and Nature\", later subtitled \"The Earth as Modified by Human Action\", catalogued his observations of man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives.\n\nIn common usage, the term refers to the activity of systematically protecting natural resources such as forests, including biological diversity. Carl F. Jordan defines the term as:\n\nWhile this usage is not new, the idea of biological conservation has been applied to the principles of ecology, bio geography, anthropology, economy and sociology to maintain biodiversity.\n\nThe term \"conservation\" itself may cover the concepts such as cultural diversity, genetic diversity and the concept of movements environmental conservation, seedbank (preservation of seeds). These are often summarized as the priority to respect diversity, especially by Greens.\n\nMuch recent movement in conservation can be considered a resistance to commercialism and globalization. Slow Food is a consequence of rejecting these as moral priorities, and embracing a slower and more locally focused lifestyle.\n\nDistinct trends exist regarding conservation development. While many countries' efforts to preserve species and their habitats have been government-led, those in the North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in natural history, expressed at the level of the individual and the national, regional or local learned society. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term NGOs – in the shape of the RSPB, National Trust and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in laissez-faire government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that John Muir, the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.\n\nProtected areas in developing countries, where probably as many as 70–80 percent of the species of the world live, still enjoy very little effective management and protection. Some countries, such as Mexico, have non-profit civil organizations and landowners dedicated to protecting vast private property, such is the case of Hacienda Chichen's Maya Jungle Reserve and Bird Refuge in Chichen Itza, Yucatán. The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries. There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short This means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.\n\nOne of the world's foremost conservationists, Dr.Kenton Miller, stated about the importance of Rangers: \"The future of our ecosystem services and our heritage depends upon park rangers. With the rapidity at which the challenges to protected areas are both changing and increasing, there has never been more of a need for well-prepared human capacity to manage. Park rangers are the backbone of park management. They are on the ground. They work on the front line with scientists, visitors, and members of local communities.\"\n\nAdopt A Ranger, fears that the ranger deficit is the greatest single limiting factor in effectively conserving nature in 75% of the world. Currently, no conservation organization or western country or international organization addresses this problem. Adopt A Ranger has been incorporated to draw worldwide public attention to the most urgent problem that conservation is facing in developing and transition countries: protected areas without field staff. Very specifically, it will contribute to solving the problem by fundraising to finance rangers in the field. It will also help governments in developing and transition countries to assess realistic staffing needs and staffing strategies.\n\nOthers, including Survival International, have advocated instead for cooperation with local tribal peoples, who are natural allies of the conservation movement and can provide cost-effective protection.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24929180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24929180", "title": "Equative", "text": "Equative\n\nThe term equative is used in linguistics to refer to constructions where two entities are equated with each other. For example, the sentence \"Susan is our president\", equates two entities \"Susan\" and \"our president\". In English, equatives are typically expressed using a copular verb such as \"be\", although this is not the only use of this verb. Equatives can be contrasted with predicative constructions where one entity is identified as a member of a set, such as \"Susan is a president.\" \n\nDifferent world languages approach equatives in different ways. The major difference between languages is whether or not they use a copular verb or a non-verbal element (e.g. demonstrative pronoun) to equate the two expressions. \n\nThe term \"equative\" is also sometimes applied to comparative-like constructions in which the degrees compared are identical rather than distinct: e.g., \"John is as stupid as he is fat\"; some languages have a separate equative case.\n\nThe taxonomy or classification of copular clauses proposed by Higgins is the starting point of much work on syntax and semantics of copular clauses. Higgins' taxonomy distinguishes between four types of copular clauses:\n\n a. The hat is big.\n\n a. The director of \"Anatomy of Murder\" is Otto Preminger.\n\n a. That (woman) is Sylvia.\n\n a. Sylvia Obernauer is HER.\n\nThis taxonomy is based primarily on native speaker intuition, as well as on detailed observations of English copular sentences. The intuition about predicational clauses is that they predicate a property of the subject referent. The other three types of copular clauses do not involve predication. Equatives equate the referents of the two expressions on either side of the copular verb. Neither is a predicate of the other. Specificational clauses involve assigning a value to a variable: the subject expression sets up a variable and the post-copular expression provides the value for that variable. Identificational clauses typically involve a demonstrative subject and are used for teaching the names of people or of things. Many linguists are currently in disagreement regarding the taxonomy and status of equative clauses.\n\nCaroline Heycock contributes to the discussion about whether specificational sentences are a special type of equatives or if they can be reduced to 'inverted predications': she argues that these sentences are a type of equative in which only one of the two noun phrases is a simple individual. Heycock claims that specificational sentences are an 'asymmetric' equation because the noun phrase that occurs in clause-initial position is interpreted as a more intentional subject than is the post-copular noun phrase. \n\nDen Dikken states that the category of specificational sentences is more real and that it includes both categories (specificational and equative clauses).\nMikkelsen, on the other hand, maintains the distinction between specificational and equative clauses, but suggests that the identificational class be eliminated.\nHeller goes further and gives a reduced taxonomy of two classes of clauses: predicational, which includes both identificational and predicational clauses, and equative, which involve equative and specificational clauses.\n\nLinguists have also been arguing about the very existence of equative clauses as a separate class. There are languages that are claimed to lack equative constructions, e.g. Adger & Ramchand analyze Scottish Gaelic as a language without equatives. Some languages use more elaborate locutions, e.g. \"be the same person as\" in English to express the meaning of the sentence like \"Cicero is Tully.\" Geist claims that there are no monoclausal equatives in Russian. According to Geist, equation is mediated, syntactically and semantically, by a demonstrative pronoun. Mikkelsen argues that within English, outside special cases like Muhammad Ali is Cassius Clay, Mark Twain is Samuel CLemens, and Cicero is Tully, main clause equatives which involve two names are difficult to contextualize. However, equatives such as \"Sylvia Obernauer is HER\", where one NP is a pronoun and the other is a name, are easier to contextualize: they are natural answers to \"Who is who?\" in a situation where individuals can be identified both by name or by sight, e.g. at the conference.\n\nHalliday divides clauses into two categories: 'intensive', where the process is ascription (the assigning of an attribute) and the equative, which is treated as a type of effective clause with the process being syntactically one of action rather than ascription. The intensive clause, like Mary is/seems happy, Mary was/became a teacher, is a non-reversible, one-participant type with the verb being of the copulative class ('class o': be, becomes, seem, look, sound, get, turn, etc.); the equative, like 'John is the leader', is a reversible, two-participant type with the verb being of the equative sub-class (of 'class 2': be, equal, resemble, realize, represent, etc.).\n\nThe equative relates an 'identifier' with a 'thing to be identified', as in ('who is John?') // John is the leader //. This relates to the underlying WH-question, and either the identified or the identifier may come first in sequence. The equative has two interpretations, as decoding or as encoding: // John is the leader // as a decoding equative has the interpretation 'John realizes, has the function of the leader', with John as the variable and the leader as a value, and as an encoding equative has the interpretation' John is realized by, has the form of the leader', with John as value and the leader as variable. According to Halliday, all equative clauses are therefore ambiguous, for example:\n\nMandarin Chinese exhibits both DP-DP and DP-CP structures, and it is classified as having copular equative construction because there is overt copula. The copular verb 是 \"shì\" can be used in both of these structures.\n\nThere is only one copular verb in Chinese, 是 \"shì\", which is used as an equative verb. This verb is necessary when the complement of the sentence is a noun phrase.\nIn classical Chinese before the Han Dynasty, the verb 是 served as a demonstrative pronoun meaning \"this\".\nIn modern Chinese, the complementizer 的 \"de\" is needed at the end of a noun phrase that changes the category to an adjectival phrase. Consider the following two sentences:\nWhilst the two sentences aim to express the same meaning, only the second one is grammatical. The first cannot equate ’red' and 'boot(s)' without using the modifier 的 \"de\".\n\nThe example below illustrates how a DP can be equated with a CP clause by employing the copular verb 是 \"shì\".\n\nEquative sentences resemble predicative sentences in that they have two noun phrases and the copular verb ‘to be’. However, the similarity is superficial. Compare the following two sentences:\nAnalysis of these sentences will show that there is a radical difference between the equative sentence and the predicational sentence in English. The predicational sentence in (5) ascribes the property to the referent noun phrase whereas the equative sentence basically says that the first and second noun phrase share the same referent. It is difficult to distinguish between a predicative and equative sentence in English as both use a similar construction and both require the copular verb ‘to be’. Unlike specificational sentences, truly equative sentences cannot be analyzed as syntactically inverted predications, because neither expression is functioning as a predicate. Note that even English examples like (4) have predicational interpretations, as in a context where Tully is a character in a play, or where Tully refers to the property of being named Tully, rather than referring to the actual referent.\n\nIn Haitian Creole the equative clause pattern involves the equative copula \"sé\" which joins a subject noun phrase with a complement noun phrase that refers back to the subject. \n\nA simple copula predicate consists of \"sé\" 'am/is/are' only. The negative marker \"pa\" and the TMA (tense-mood-aspect) markers can co-occur with the copula-type predicate, subject to certain rules (TMA markers: \"té\" 'past' or 'anterior', \"kay\" 'prospective' or 'irrealis', \"ka\" 'nonpunctual', \"sa\" 'abilitative'). One such rule is that té + sé → sété (or just té without sé). The combinations permitted in an equative clause are limited in natural speech: a maximum number of two tense, mood, aspect and copula morphemes can co-occur in a given clause. \nHere are some examples of the equative clause type in Haitian Creole (predicates are in bold):\nEscure & Schwegler claim that \"sé\" is a copula verb. DeGraff argues that \"sé\" in Haitian Creole is a resumptive pronominal that spells out the trace produced by subject-raising to Spec (CP) from within a small clause headed by the nominal predicate. The subject is first merged within the (extended) projection of the nominal predicate – i .e., in the subject position of the small clause – but it must move to Spec (CP) in order to check its Case and satisfy the Extended Projection Principle.\n\nThe copula -i- in Korean is ubiquitously found in presumed ‘Sluicing’ and ‘Fragment’ constructions. The copula denotes the equative relation between the subject and the complement of the copula. In (8), through the assumed equative relation, the complement of the copula describes the ‘categorial membership’ of the subject. \nOn top of it, again through the equative relation, in (9) the complement of the copula describes the ‘characteristic property’ of the subject.\n\nWhen the copula is not present, no equative relation holds, prohibiting the pronominal subject of the small clause. In the former case, the indefinite expression as a correlate expression is equative with the surviving expression. In the latter case, the usual referring expression as a correlate expression cannot be equative with the surviving expression that it is in contrast with. Equative (Identificational) Copular Construction (ECC) as shown in (10), both nominal expressions in the Equative Copular Construction are referential expressions and hence denote individual entities denoted by the two nominal expressions. The construction expresses the identity relation between the entities denoted by the two nominal expressions. \n\nSince the Equative Copular Construction is involved with the two referential nouns, no word order restriction is expected with regard to the focus information.\n\nRussian equative sentences have a distinct syntactical structure which distinguishes them from predicational sentences. They require a constant form of the demonstrative pronoun \"eto\" 'this' (Sg. Neutral) to indicate that the two XPs have the same referent. \nThis is because Russian has a zero present form copula (the present tense form of \"byt’\", \"est’\", is never used in this context). The demonstrative pronoun, however, is excluded from predicational sentences. In addition, although Russian has case endings on the ends of nouns, both XPs occur in the Nominative case in an equative sentence but not in a predicational one. The demonstrative pronoun likewise never gets inflected in equative sentences. In order to warrant that XP2 in the Instrumental is excluded from éto-sentence (and not because of lacking an overt copula), we have an overt form of the \"byt\"' copula. \nThere is strong evidence that in (12), XP2 is the underlying subject: the copula agrees with XP2 and not with \"ėto\", which remains Singular Neuter. Nominative. Whereas XP1 functions as an external topic, the demonstrative pronoun éto is a base-generated internal topic. \n\nPolish equatives differ in syntactic structure considerably from predicational and specificational copula classes, with respect to agreement pattern. Polish true equatives contain two nominative DPs (proper names or pronouns), which surround the copula. There are two types of copula: the pronominal copula \"to\", and the verbal copula \"być\" 'to be'. Unlike Polish to-predicational clauses in which they are restricted to 3rd person pronouns only, the equatives with pronominal copula \"to\" allows the pre-copular element to be in 1st or 2nd person perspective.\n\nMoreover, in Polish equative sentences, the verb always agrees with the pre-copular element. The two copulas can also co-occur with each other. If it is in the present tense, it can always be omitted. If it is omitted in the past or future tense, the time interpretation will be misunderstood as referring to the present only.\nPolish equatives sometimes involve both the operation of wh-movement and deletion. All instances of unbounded deletion obeying island constraints are instances of wh-movement and deletion. The deletion might apply in conjunction with wh-movement or it might apply alone. When it applies alone, it is both unbounded and subject to island constraints. For instance, in (17), \"Jak\" appears in wh-questions, which suggests that the equative shown in (18) involves wh-movement. In (19), deletion applies in conjunction with wh-movement. \nThis description concerns Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Like Russian and Polish, MSA uses no copular verb in present tense equative sentences but requires one in the past and future. The subject and predicate in MSA equative sentences must agree in case (nominative), number, and gender The subject must always be definite for a sentential reading, while the predicate is definite or indefinite depending on whether an article is also used in the sentence.\n\nThe following equation does not involve an article, so the predicate 'the student' is in indefinite form.\n\nIn the following construction, an article interferes between the subject and predicate, so the predicate is in definite form. 3MS means 3rd person masculine singular.\n\nThis description concerns the Interior Salish language of the Colville-Okanagan region, named Nsyilxcən. Its classification here as non-copular is due to its lack of an overt copula. Rather, Nsyilxcən equatives are said to be projections of a null head. \nNsyilxcən DP-DP structures involve a null, equative copula. \nThe interpretation of DP-DP structures in Nsyilxcən overlaps with that of both predicational and equative clauses in English. The semantics of the equative head fit with intensionality-based accounts of English equatives. The distinction between predicational and equative sentences is motivated by a word order restriction that is for DP-DP structures in answer to WH-questions, which is not apparent for a corresponding direct predication. As well, Nsyilxcən does not have specificational sentences in the classic sense, but it does have DP-DP equatives with a fixed information structure resembling inverse specificational copular clauses in English.\n\nIn Nsyilxcən, equatives exhibit a DP=DP structure. As in English, two adjacent DPs standing in an equivalence relationship are interpreted as semantically equative, given that neither DP can be a predicate. This equative has an encoded word order restriction which is absent from predications involving other syntactic categories, such that in answer to a WH-question, a directly referential demonstrative or proper name must precede a DP headed by the determiner \"iʔ\" (an “iʔ DP”). The implication is that specificational sentences are not possible in Nsyilxcən. \nNsyilxcən clefts are structurally equivalent to DP=DP structures, implying that clefts are also equatives in this language.\n\nThe null equative head in Nsyilxcən lexically assigns the syntactic feature ‘F’ to its second (leftmost) argument, which is interpretable as ‘focus’ at the interfaces\n\nNsyilxcən equatives can also involve relative clause modification.\nThe bracketed, relative clause \"iʔ wíkən\" ‘that I saw’ restricts the bird under discussion in (36a), and the nominalized relative clause \"[iʔ] isck’ʷúl\" ‘the (one) that I made’ restricts the type of shirt under discussion in (36b). \n\nFor Nsyilxcən, a relative clause is not identifiable by special inflectional morphology on the clausal modifier, but instead by an \"iʔ\" determiner and/or \"t\" marker which precede the modifying head. Relative clause modification can be either head final or head initial.\nSalish relative clauses can be analyzed based not only on relative head-modifier ordering, but also on whether or not a particle introduces both the head and modifier.\n\nAlthough Chinese was discussed earlier as having copular equative constructions, it also holds non-copular equative constructions. \nThe copular verb 是 \"shì\" is often interpreted as having been left out optionally, but this is actually no the case, as the following sentence is ungrammatical:\nFor (25b) to be grammatical, the complementizer 的 \"de\" is necessary at the end of the adjectival phrase [\"bù hǎokàn\"].\n\n\n"}

This custom reflects a reluctance to switch from the old (Julian) style calendar to the new (Gregorian) calendar.\n\nThe word \"handsel\" originates from old Saxon word which means “to deliver into the hand”. It refers to small tips and gifts of money given as a token of good luck, particularly at the beginning of something; the modern house-warming gift would be a good example. An 1825 glossary marks Handsel Monday as an occasion \"when it is customary to make children and servants a present\". On this day, tips of small gifts were expected by servants, as well as by the postman, the deliverers of newspapers, scavengers, and all persons who wait upon the house.\n\nIn this respect it is somewhat similar to Boxing Day, which eventually supplanted it. If the handsel was a physical object rather than money, tradition said that the object could not be sharp, or it would \"cut\" the relationship between the giver and the recipient. The day is known in Scottish Gaelic as (drained Monday).\n\nThe custom was also known as “handseling a purse”. A new purse would not be given to anyone without placing money in it for good luck. Money received during Handsel Monday is supposed to insure monetary luck all for the rest of the year.\n\n"}

CEHD initiatives include the Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, the Pritzker Consortium on Early Childhood Development, the Heckman Equation, the Research Network on the Determinants of Life Course Capabilities and Outcomes, and the Asian Family in Transition Initiative.\n\nHeckman is noted for his contributions to selection bias and self-selection analysis, especially Heckman correction, which awarded him the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also well known for his empirical research in labor economics, particularly regarding the efficacy of early childhood education programs.\n\nHis work has been devoted to the development of a scientific basis for economic policy evaluation, with special emphasis on models of individuals and disaggregated groups, and the problems and possibilities created by heterogeneity, diversity, and unobserved counterfactual states. He developed a body of new econometric tools that address these issues. His research has given policymakers important new insights into areas such as education, jobtraining, the importance of accounting for general equilibrium in the analysis of labor markets, anti-discrimination law, and civil rights. He demonstrated a strong causal effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in promoting African-American economic progress.

There is also an accompanying sourcebook of readings: \"Justice: A Reader\".\n\nSandel addresses a series of alternative theories of justice. The utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham is outlined and criticised and then John Stuart Mill's refinements are discussed. The libertarians, in particular Robert Nozick, and their arguments are discussed. Then Sandel discusses Immanuel Kant and his 'categorical imperative'. The discussion then goes on to John Rawls's work. Then Aristotle and the concept of 'telos' is discussed. It is here that Sandel begins to make clear his own perspective. He argues that justice, rather than being autonomous (as Kantians or Rawlsians might have it), has a goal. A form of communitarianism. Sandel quotes Alasdair MacIntyre and his characterisation of humans as being 'storytelling beings' who live their lives with \"narrative quests\".\n\nDespite the controversial and polarizing nature of the material, the reviews have largely been positive. \"The New York Times\" praised Sandel's ability to teach and says, \"If 'Justice' breaks no new philosophical ground, it succeeds at something perhaps no less important: in terms we can all understand, it confronts us with the concepts that lurk, so often unacknowledged, beneath our conflicts.\" \"The Guardian\" calls it a \"timely plea for us to desist from political bickering and see if we can have a sensible discussion about what sort of society we really want to live in.\" \"The Portsmouth Review\" calls it an \"enlightening read\".\n\n"}

These glosses were written by Peter the Lombard during his teaching career and before he became the bishop of Paris (1159–1160). His gloss of Psalms and his gloss of the Pauline Epistles (referred to as the \"Collectanea\") were compiled and became a part of the official gloss on the Bible. This collection of glosses would take on the name of \"Magna glossatura\" and would, during the 12th century, replace the \"Glossa ordinaria\" as the most frequently studied and copied exegetical gloss of the Bible. His other works included the \"Libri Quatuor Sententiarum\" (or the \"Four Books of Sentences\") and his commentaries in the \"glossa Ordinaria\". The \"Magna glossatura\", along with other systematic glosses, would have been developed at theological schools such as Laon and St.-Victor of Paris, and would have been used for the research conducted by theologians as well as the teaching of students in biblical exegesis.\n\nThe layout of text in the \"Magna glossatura\", is written in the \"intercisum\" (or intercut) format, which was developed by Peter Lombard. It was developed as a way of distinguishing scripture from the commentaries by writing the biblical verses in a larger script and on alternate lines next to the commentary, which would be ordered into columns. Blocks of scripture were then placed on the left edge of the columns to balance the biblical verses with the commentary. The \"intercisum\" method, from ca.1160, began to be applied to glosses on all the books of the Bible. This layout also gave glosses and their commentators greater influence in their relationship with the Word of God, as these glosses played a larger role in theological books by forming an essential reading in connection with the biblical text.\n\nPeter Lombard's gloss of the Pauline Epistles features not only commentaries concerning the traditional mode of reflection on the Christian faith, which regards the biblical text as \"sacra pagina\", but also commentaries of systematic theology. As a result, Lombard writes on specific theological themes which deal with issues such as the nature of the Trinity. Lombard's glosses also include references to the works of other ecclesiastical figures and theologians, Ambrose and Augustine to name a few.

Matching fund payments usually arise in situations of charity or public good. The terms cost sharing, in-kind, and matching are often used interchangeably.\n\nIn philanthropic giving, foundations and corporations often give money to non-profit entities in the form of a matching gift. Corporate matches often take the form of employee matching gifts, which means that if an employee donates to a nonprofit, the employee's corporation will donate money to the same nonprofit according to a predetermined match ratio (usually 1:1). For foundations, matching gifts are in the form of grants made directly to nonprofits if that the nonprofit raises a set quantity of money before the grant is bestowed. The benefit of foundation matching grants is that they provide greater incentive leverage when a nonprofit is fundraising from its constituency. If a foundation approves a 1:1 matching grant, donors know that their dollars will be doubled. On the other side, foundations who give matching grants receive assurance of the nonprofit's capacity to raise adequate funds.\n\nFor example, Dr. Booker T. Washington, a famous African-American educator, had a long-time friendship with millionaire industrialist Henry H. Rogers, who provided him with substantial amounts of money to be applied for the betterment and education of black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nWashington later wrote that Rogers had encouraged projects with at least partial matching funds\" so that two ends were accomplished: \n\nUsing the matching funds philosophy, after Rogers's death, Julius Rosenwald and the Rosenwald Fund continued and expanded the work, eventually funding over 5,000 Rosenwald Schools between 1912 and 1932. During that time, over US$4.6 million additional dollars were contributed by blacks in the communities to respond to the challenge thus presented.\n\nIn 1954, the General Electrics Foundation created the Corporate Alumni Program to match donations to the colleges and universities that employees graduated from. This eventually broadened to other charities. The foundation is one of the most generous with a $25,000 match per employee or retiree. \n\nSome companies facilitate the process, allowing employers to match the gifts of their employees. A matching gift, typically a one-time charitable gift made by an employee and matched by the employer, should not be confused with an employer matching program, which has to do with the employee's 401(k) plan and retirement.\n\nIn 2014, corporations donated $17.8 Billion to nonprofit organizations. This is a 13.7% increase over 2013 corporate giving levels. In 2010, matching gifts represented ~20% of corporate cash donations. In 2016, over 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer an employee matching gift program. \n\nIn the UK, the not-for-profit organisation, the Big Give, have used match funding to raise over £97m for thousands of different charitable projects. The match funding is provided by a network of philanthropists and funders, called 'Champions'. Research commissioned by the Big Give shows that more people give when donations are matched (84% of surveyed respondents said they would be more likely to give if donation was matched) and people give more (one in three donors said they would give more than they usually would if do). \n\nIn the United States, many projects in the various states and communities are partially funded with federal grants with a requirement for matching funds. For example, the Interstate Highway System was primarily built with a mix of 90% FHWA funds from the Highway Trust Fund and 10% matching state DOT funds. In some cases, borrowed money may be used to meet criteria for a matching grant; the $550 million Canadian federal government investment to connect a Detroit River International Crossing to Interstate 75 in Michigan qualifies the state for US$2 billion in US federal matching grants that can rebuild other Michigan highways even though the Canadian money is nominally a loan, to be repaid by tolls on the new bridge.\n\nUS federal matching grants have also funded historic preservation initiatives; a local historic property may be able to seek a 1:1 federal matching grant for specific capital projects, such as restoration of structures on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn American politics, the term refers to the money a presidential candidate is given by federal government to match the money they have raised personally. Candidates can expect up to US$250 extra from public funds for each contribution from an individual they receive.\n\nThat usually applies to the two main parties; as in order for a candidate to gain the benefits of matching funds, they must raise $5,000 from 20 states during the primaries or have received 5% of the popular vote in the general election. Pat Buchanan, running as the Reform Party candidate in 2000, received matching funds despite winning only 0.4% of the vote.\n\nThe source of the funds comes from a $3 voluntary checkoff on the US Income tax form. The program was established by the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. The law also \"established overall spending limits for eligibility to receive matching funds, and provided for public funding of major party candidates in the general election for president\".\n\nThe effect that these have on the candidates for presidential campaigns is to strengthen the role that the party plays in raising money.\n\nFormer New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party (United States) candidate for president, qualified for federal matching funds in the 2012 US presidential election. Later, on June 30, 2012, Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, also received enough contributions to qualify.\n\nOn July 15, 2016, ALL Party presidential candidate, Alberto Cedeno, intentionally received no contributions to avoid qualifying for federal matching funds.\n\nPrior to a 2011 Supreme Court decision, states like Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin were using a system that distributed \"additional funding to publicly financed candidates when they face big-spending opponents or opposition groups\". The combined cases, \"Arizona Free Enterprise Fund v. Bennett\" (2011) and \"McComish v. Bennett\" (2011) held that \"the law impermissibly forces private candidates and independent political organizations to either restrain their spending or risk triggering matching funds to their publicly financed opponents\".\n\nNow, states and cities are considering the implementation of programs like New York City's public financing model; public funds are used to multiply the impact of a small donor. The program is administered by the New York City Campaign Finance Board, which has avoided partisan divisions. The programs work by making each contribution worth more than their current value, thereby increasing the proportional impact of the contribution. In New York City, for example, a $6-to-$1 program has resulted in \"small dollar donors constitute the vast majority of spending in New York City elections, representing 73% of all contributions in 2013 and 80% specifically to City Council race\". A report by the Brennan Center found that \"by pumping up the value of small contributions, the New York City system gives [candidates] an incentive to reach out to their own constituents rather than focusing all their attention on wealthy out-of-district donors, leading them to attract more diverse donors into the political process\".\n\nPrograms of this type incentivize candidates to \"fuse fundraising with voter outreach\" and incentivize political engagement by communities that can afford only modest contributions. Candidates may then have more an incentive to reach out to their constituents rather than devoting their energy to financing their campaigns. The \"Election Law Journal\" found that matching funds through a multiplier has increased the proportional role of small donors as well as the number of small donors. The programs have also helped to shift the demographic and class profile of those who give. Finally, besides diluting the power of major givers, these programs led candidates to reach out and engage a more representative set of constituents during fundraising.\n\nThere is some dispute regarding the impact of matching funds programs like the one implemented in New York City. For example, \"after implementing the public matching funds program in NYC, [the] most recent mayoral election of 2009 witnessed the lowest voter turnout it's had since the 1960's\".\n\nOthers argue that the matching funds system benefits candidates with higher name recognition, especially if they are tied to a measure of popular support. Some have suggested that public funding actually has a negative effect on the perceptions the public has of the government, perhaps because public funding programs do not meet \"the expectations set by reformers\".\n\n"}

Their views are grouped under the names realist (also realistic) phenomenology or phenomenology of essences. Munich Phenomenology represents one branch of what is referred to as the early phenomenology.\n\nIn 1895, a number of students working with the psychologist Theodor Lipps at the University of Munich founded the \"Psychologische Verein\" (\"Psychological Association\"). A number of the participants in this student association, notably , Moritz Geiger, Alexander Pfänder, and Adolf Reinach, were inspired by Edmund Husserl's \"Logical Investigations\" (1900/01). The book was critical of the psychologism of their teacher (Lipps), and presented a new way of doing philosophy, known as phenomenology. Choosing to align themselves with Husserl, they became the \"Munich Circle\" of phenomenologists. Around 1905, many of Lipps' students (following the lead of Daubert) temporarily abandoned Munich and headed to the University of Göttingen to study with Husserl directly. This is referred to as the Munich invasion of Göttingen, and is generally considered to be the starting point of the phenomenological movement proper. The arrival of students from Munich eventually led to the establishment of a similar student group in Göttingen circa 1910, known as the Göttingen Circle.\n\nIn 1912 the \"Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung\" was founded with Husserl, Geiger, Reinach, Pfänder, and Max Scheler as its editors. After Husserl's publication of the \"Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie. Erstes Buch\" (\"Ideas I\") in the first edition of the \"Jahrbuch\", a number of his followers took a critical stance towards Husserl's new vision of phenomenology. Many members of the Munich group distanced themselves from Husserl's idealism and his transcendental phenomenology, preferring the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the \"Logical Investigations\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48243754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48243754", "title": "Negative consequentialism", "text": "Negative consequentialism\n\nNegative consequentialism is a version of the ethical theory consequentialism, which is \"one of the major theories of normative ethics.\" Like other versions of consequentialism, negative consequentialism holds that moral right and wrong depend only on the value of outcomes. That is, for negative and other versions of consequentialism, questions such as \"what should I do?\" and \"what kind of person should I be?\" are answered only based on consequences. Negative consequentialism differs from other versions of consequentialism by giving greater weight in moral deliberations to what is bad (e.g. suffering or injustice) than what is good (e.g. happiness or justice).\n\nA specific type of consequentialism is utilitarianism, which says that the consequences that matter are those that affect well-being. Consequentialism is broader than utilitarianism in that consequentialism can say that the value of outcomes depend on other things than well-being; for example, justice, fairness, and equality. Negative utilitarianism is thus a form of negative consequentialism. Much more has been written explicitly about negative utilitarianism than directly about negative consequentialism, although since negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism, everything that has been written about negative utilitarianism is by definition about a specific (utilitarian) version of negative consequentialism. Similarly to how there are many variations of consequentialism and negative utilitarianism, there are many versions of negative consequentialism, for example negative prioritarianism and negative consequentialist egalitarianism.\n\nG. E. Moore's ethics can be said to be a negative consequentialism (more precisely, a consequentialism with a negative utilitarian component), because he has been labeled a consequentialist, and he said that \"consciousness of intense pain is, by itself, a great evil\" whereas \"the mere consciousness of pleasure, however intense, does not, \"by itself\", appear to be a \"great\" good, even if it has some slight intrinsic value. In short, pain (if we understand by this expression, the consciousness of pain) appears to be a far worse evil than pleasure is a good.\" Moore wrote in the first half of the 20th century before any of the terms 'consequentialism,' 'negative utilitarianism' or 'negative consequentialism' were coined, and he did not use the term 'negative consequentialism' himself. Similarly to Moore, Ingemar Hedenius defended a consequentialism that could be called negative (or could be said to have a negative utilitarian component) because he assigned more importance to suffering than to happiness. Hedenius saw the worst in life, such as infernalistic suffering, as so evil that calculations of happiness versus suffering becomes unnecessary; he did not see that such evil could be counterbalanced by any good, such as happiness.\n\nPhilosophy professor Clark Wolf defends \"negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice.\" Walter Sinnott-Armstrong interprets Bernard Gert's moral system as a \"sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism.\" Jamie Mayerfeld argues for a strong duty to relieve suffering, which is consequentialist in form. He says that \"suffering is more bad than happiness is good,\" and that \"the lifelong bliss of many people, no matter how many, cannot justify our allowing the lifelong torture of one.\"\n\n"}

In the final phases of the exercise, a hypothetical \"massive influx\" of refugees from the attack \"overwhelmed\" the resources of neighboring states.\n\nIn addition to FEMA, other agencies and organizations which participated in the exercise included the Morris County Office of Emergency Management, the New Jersey National Guard, the Military Auxiliary Radio System, the Metro Urban Search and Rescue Strike Team, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the FBI, the New Jersey State Police, various municipal departments of the City of New York, and others.\n\nGotham Shield occurred simultaneous with several partnered exercises testing the responsiveness of different agencies of the United States in the fulfillment of their own organizational priorities as they would apply to the core attack scenario, including Vibrant Response (led by United States Army North), Prominent Hunt 17-1 (led by the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office), and \"Fuerzas Amigas\" (a joint planning event of the Mexican Armed Forces and United States Armed Forces).\n\nArdent Sentry 17 (led by the Northern Command), was another simultaneous operation which focused on military aid to the civil power, specifically \"marshalling simulated forces\". Ardent Sentry 17 was a command post exercise with staff operating from a primary command post at the 42nd Infantry Division headquarters in Troy, and a redundancy command post at the New York National Guard Joint Force Headquarters in Latham. It was overseen by GEN Timothy LaBarge of the New York National Guard who was given \"dual status command\", or authority to command both State of New York and United States military forces.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada conducted an overlapping exercise, Staunch Maple 17, whose scenario involved simultaneous \"nuclear threats\" in Ottawa and Halifax, and which also involved the friendly intervention of U.S. military forces into eastern Canada. Unlike Gotham Shield, Canada's Department of National Defence did not publicly describe the scenario around which Staunch Maple 17 was based, but media outlets would later cite sources who confirmed it involved a \"nuclear event\" and was a test of scaled contingency plans the country had involving \"a wide range of scenarios involving attacks on Canada, including a missile attack.\"\n\nOperation Gotham Shield was billed as a \"false flag\" by some conspiracy theorists, who predicted it was designed to cover up a planned, actual nuclear weapons attack against the New York metropolitan area, or as distraction from a planned U.S. nuclear weapons attack against North Korea. The British tabloid \"Daily Express\", meanwhile, propagated a different take on the conspiracy theory which hypothesized that \"a major incident will happen to US President Donald Trump on Wednesday\" (the date of the first day of Gotham Shield).\n\n"}

Patrick was a world authority on imprinting in birds — the process of learning to recognise their parents and members of their own species — and his work led to new principles in behavioural development.\n\nBateson devised original experiments that showed how characteristics of imprinting depend on the bird’s early life experiences. Bateson's investigation of learning in birds has led to greater understanding of the neural basis of memory. He had an interest in how developmental and behavioural processes influence evolution.\n\nBateson was concerned with the ethics of using animals in research and the analysis of animal pain and suffering. This led to a study into the effects on red deer of hunting with hounds, an inquiry into dog breeding and a review of the use of animals in research.\n\nPrevious academic positions include a Harkness Fellowship at Stanford University and ten years as head of the Cambridge sub-department of Animal Behaviour.

{"id": "2749924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2749924", "title": "Psychological biblical criticism", "text": "Psychological biblical criticism\n\nPsychological biblical criticism is a re-emerging field within biblical criticism that seeks to examine the psychological dimensions of scripture through the use of the behavioral sciences. The title itself involves a discussion about \"the intersections of three fields: psychology, the Bible, and the tradition of rigorous, critical reading of the biblical text.\" (Kille, 2001). Known figures within biblical scholarship advocating this interdisciplinary field in the United States include Rev. D. Andrew Kille (2001; 2004), J. Harold Ellens (2004), Wayne G. Rollins (1983; 1999; 2004), and, in Europe, Eugen Drewermann (Beier, 2004), Gerd Theissen (1983, 1987, 2007).\n\nRollins was the first to define psychological biblical criticism as having the hermeneutical intent of examining\nUnlike many other forms of biblical criticism, psychological biblical criticism is not a particular \"method\" for interpretation, but is rather a \"perspective\" (Kille, 2001). This approach to the biblical text seeks to complement studies on the cultural, sociological, and anthropological influences on scripture, by discussing the psychological dimensions of: the authors of the text, the material they wish to communicate to their audience, and the reflections and meditations of the reader. As a result, the material under study involves three dimensions of text (Rollins, 1983; Kille, 2001; 2004). \n\nWhat was the author of the text thinking? What was their background, why were they writing? What situations drove them to put pen to paper and produce this work? What is the cultural, historical, and social context of the text? Although traditional uses of psychological theory in the study of ancient texts have sought to generate a complete psychoanalysis of scriptural writers, there has always been the hindrance of temporal and cultural distance between the analyst and analysand. Psychological biblical criticism best serves not as a reductionistic tool, but as another heuristic for use alongside traditional methods of historical and cultural criticism, illuminating aspects of purpose and meaning in the language and cognition of texts (Kille, 2001: 22–23; 2004: 23–25). In essence, a study of the world behind the text involves such questions as \"... what makes them write the way they do and what realities, truths, and insights they want to share with us.\" (Rollins, 1983: 99).\n\nWhy did King Saul decide try to skewer David—his greatest warrior—with a spear? Why did Judas hand Jesus over? What is the meaning of Genesis Chapter 1? To analyze the world of the text is to \"describe the qualities of a character as he or she is presented in the text\" (Kille, 2001:24), their actions and relationships, as well as develop insight into the motivations the writer has programmed into them. Kille in particular warns that one should be wary of trying to reach beyond the world of the text to the actual historical persons, since one may accidentally perform the function of eisegesis rather than exegesis. The world of the text may also shine light on the conditions and intent of the writer. On the one hand the characters and events within the text may reflect more the writer's socio-cultural situation than actual events, while at the same time they may inform us as to what the writer desires from us—transformation, repentance, enlightenment, etc. (Kille, 2004).\n\nHow do I approach the text? What does the text ask of me? How do I respond to it? What meaning do I give to this relationship? The world in front of the text discusses the interplay between the text before our very eyes and the eisegetical processes that take place within our mind. In this exchange the interest is not in the psychological world of the writer, or the original meaning of the text and the characters displayed, but in how the reader manipulates, interprets, and is filled by the text; how they make it relevant to their lives, how it \"speaks\" to them, and how this relationship reflects their personal world (Rollins 1983: 97–100; Kille, 2001: 25–27; 2004: 27–29).\n\nA psychological study of the hermeneutical levels of religious texts has the capability of granting a better understanding not only of the text itself, but also of the mind that produced it, the mind that it describes, and the mind that interacts with it. This knowledge has promise for interdisciplinary application as well, by informing the field of religious studies, the psychotherapeutic encounter, and the psychology of religion. Hence, proponents of psychological biblical criticism argue that it has the potential of crossing the gap between psychology and religion, providing a platform for dialogue without reducing religion to mere drives and internal objects, but by discussing the aspects of this very human mode of meaning (Ellens, 2004).\n\nThere is a website sponsored by the Psychology and Biblical Studies Section of the Society of Biblical Literature which is devoted to psychological biblical criticism at www.psybibs.org.\n\n\n"}

Democracy, in its liberal form, is no exception. Moreover, because democracy is a relatively young phenomenon, Cohen-Almagor asserts that it lacks experience in dealing with pitfalls involved in the working of the system. This is what he calls the “catch” of democracy. Cohen-Almagor maintains that the freedoms the media enjoy in covering events are respected as long as they do not imperil the basic values that underlie democracy. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right, an important anchor of democracy; but it should not be used in an uncontrolled manner.\n\nConcern and respect are reiterated themes in Cohen-Almagor’s scholarship. He argues that we should give equal consideration to the interest of others and grant equal respect to a person’s life objects so long as they do not deliberately undermine the interests of others by interfering in a disrespectful manner. The popular culture of a democratic society is committed to seeking the influence of social cooperation that can be discerned on the basis of mutual respect between free and equal individuals. This line of reasoning should be supplemented, so Cohen-Almagor maintains, by our emphasis on the notion of concern, which is seen as the value of well-being. We ought to show equal concern for each individual’s good, to acknowledge that human beings are not only rational creations but irrational, emotional creatures. In the context of medical ethics, treating people with concern means treating them with empathy – viewing people as human beings who may be furious and frustrated while, at the same time, are capable of smiling and crying, of careful decision-making, and of impulsive reactions. Concern means giving equal weight to a person’s life and autonomy. This is a combination of mind, body, and communication between the agent and those around her bed.\n\nCohen-Almagor is a strong proponent of physician-assisted suicide and equally strong critic of euthanasia. Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide. People should have the ability to control the time and place of their death. Cohen-Almagor’s thesis is that people, as autonomous moral agents, deserve to be treated with dignity. To treat a person with dignity requires respecting her choices and life decisions. \nTherefore, Cohen-Almagor calls to judge each case on its own merits and refrain from drawing sweeping conclusions that relate to categories of patients. One may try to prescribe detailed guidelines of conduct but, at the end of the day, the guidelines should be judged and evaluated in relation to each patient under consideration. The fear of sliding down the slippery-slope is, indeed, tangible. Cohen-Almagor prescribes cautionary measures and safety valves. Through real-life situations his plea for physician-assisted suicide is circumscribed.\n\nCohen-Almagor dedicates much of his scholarship to delineate the confines of free expression. He has formulated principles conducive to safeguarding fundamental civil rights. His focus is on the ethical question of the constraints on speech. He advances two arguments relating to the ‘Harm Principle’ and the ‘Offence Principle’. Under the ‘Harm Principle’, restrictions on liberty may be prescribed when there are sheer threats of immediate violence (incitement) against some individuals or groups. Under the ‘Offence Principle’, expressions which intend to inflict psychological offence are morally on a par with physical harm, so he argues there are grounds for abridging them. A case in point is the Illinois Supreme Court which permitted the Nazis to hold a hateful demonstration in Skokie. Cohen-Almagor argues that the decision was flawed. Similarly, allowing Jewish racists to march in an Arab town in Israel is flawed.\n\nIn recent writings, Cohen-Almagor calls to strike a balance between freedom of expression and social responsibility. Responsibility is commonly associated with accountability and answerability. We live within a community and have some responsibilities to it. The responsibilities are positive and negative. That is, we have a responsibility to better the society in which we live, and a responsibility to refrain from acting in a way that knowingly might harm our community. The responsibility is ethical in nature. We can reasonably expect people to know the difference between good and evil, and then to act accordingly. In the Internet context, Cohen-Almagor distinguishes between Netusers and Netcitizens. The term “Netuser” refers to people who use the Internet. It is a neutral term. It does not convey any clue as to how people use the Internet. It does not convey any appraisal of their use. The term “netcitizen”, on the other hand, is not neutral. It describes a responsible use of the Internet. Netcitizens are people who use the Internet as an integral part of their real life. That is to say, their virtual life is not separated from their real life. Even if they invent an identity for themselves on social networks such as Second Life, they do it in a responsible manner. They still hold themselves accountable for the consequences of their Internet use. In other words, netcitizens are good citizens of the Internet. They contribute to the Internet's use and growth while making an effort to ensure that their communications and Net use are constructive, fostering free speech, open access and social culture of respecting others, and not harming others. Netcitizens, asserts Cohen-Almagor, are netusers with a sense of responsibility.\n\nTo what extent can liberal democracies interfere in internal affairs of their subcultures, especially when their conduct is illiberal? This question occupies much of Cohen-Almagor’s scholarship on multiculturalism. In a piece co-authored with Will Kymlicka, Cohen-Alamgor contends that if an illiberal minority is seeking to oppress other groups, then intervention is justified in the name of self-defense. Both Cohen-Almagor and Kymlicka further assert that in the case of immigrants who come to a country knowing its laws, there is no objection to imposing liberal principles on them. The situation is more complicated with national minorities, particularly if (a) they were involuntarily incorporated into the larger state (as the Palestinians claim with regard to their incorporation into the Jewish state), and (b) they have their own formalized governments, with their own internal mechanisms for dispute resolution. In these circumstances, the legitimate scope for coercive intervention by the state may be limited. \nCohen-Almagor and Kymlicka maintain that there are several things which liberals can do to promote respect for individual rights within non-liberal minority groups. Since a national minority which rules in an illiberal way acts unjustly, liberals have a right - indeed a responsibility - to speak out against such injustice, and to support any efforts the group makes to liberalize their culture. Since the most enduring forms of liberalization are those that result from internal reform, the primary focus for liberals outside the group should be to provide this sort of support. Moreover, incentives can be provided, in a non-coercive way, for liberal reforms. Cohen-Almagor and Kymlicka further recommend promoting the development of regional or international mechanisms for protecting human rights.\n\nCohen-Almagor is a human rights and peace activist. He has written against administrative detention, religious coercion, discrimination against Arabs in Israel, the 1982 Lebanon War, and the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War. He spoke in favour of separation between state and religion, women and minority rights, patients’ rights, a two state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. In 2000, he opened an international campaign to evacuate the Gaza Strip, seeing this move as the start of a Palestinian State (“Gaza First”). In late 2006 he called for early elections in Israel after he lost trust in Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the tragic architect of the Israel-Hezbollah War. This campaign ended in February 2009, when Israel held early elections that terminated the Olmert government. In 2009, Cohen-Almagor called upon Israel to institute a national enquiry commission to address all the issues mentioned in the Goldstone Report regarding Israel’s war conduct during its Cast Lead Operation (2008–2009).\nDuring 2009-2011 he was engaged in a campaign which called for a prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas that would bring Gilad Shalit back home. That campaign ended in October 2011, when Gilad was united with his family, and more than 1000 Palestinians were released from Israeli jails. Since 2011, Cohen-Almagor is calling for a two state solution, believing this is the only viable and just option for both Israel and Palestine.\n\nUnlike most liberals, Cohen-Almagor confines his scholarship to the democratic world. He says explicitly that he is concerned with all countries around the world, because he thinks that what he says is appropriate, simply because he is realistic. Cohen-Almagor believes that there are some basic universal needs that all people wish to secure such as food, raiment, and shelter. Sexual drives are universal and people need to have some sleep to be able continue functioning. He also believes that we should strive to universalise moral principles. But sociologically speaking we cannot ignore the fact that universal values do not underlie all societies. Some societies reject the moral notions of liberty, tolerance, autonomy, equality, and justice that liberal democracies promote. If a country is not founded on these notions, then it would be futile for us to speak about these values. Thus, his practical recommendations on freedom of expression, end-of-life and multiculturalism are restricted to the democratic world.\n\nIn the course of his career, Professor Cohen-Almagor has won numerous grants, scholarships and fellowships from major institutions around the world including the Bogliasco Foundation, the British Council, the Canadian Government, The Fulbright Foundation, the Hastings Center, the Israel Ministry of Science, the Italian Foreign Office, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Volkswagen Education Foundation, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

It advocated the use of mercury to make the body immortal. This school was based on the texts Rasārṇava, Rasahṛidaya and Raseśvarasiddhānta, composed by Govinda Bhagavat and Sarvajña Rāmeśvara.\n\nRaseśvaras, like many other schools of Indian philosophy, believed that liberation was identity of self with Supreme lord Shiva and freedom from transmigration. However, unlike other schools, Raseśvaras thought that liberation could only be achieved by using mercury to acquire an imperishable body. Hence, they called mercury pārada or the means of conveyance beyond transmigratory existence. Extrication of soul to Raseśvaras was a cognizable act and therefore, for liberation it was necessary to maintain an imperishable bodily life. They used scriptural evidence from the Purusha Sukta and Puranas to support this point of view.\n\nMercury was sacred to the Raseśvaras, so much so that they considered disparaging mercury blasphemy. Rasahṛidaya mentions mercury to be a creation by Shiva and Gauri whereas, Rasārṇava holds the worship of mercury to be more beatific than the worship of all symbols of supreme lord Shiva. Raseśvaras described eighteen methods of treating mercury—sweating, rubbing, swooning, fixing, dropping, coercion, restraining, kindling, going, falling into globules, pulverising, covering, internal flux, external flux, burning, colouring, pouring, and eating it by parting and piercing it. Mercury could applied to both blood and body.\n\nRaseśvarasiddhānta described three modes in which mercury could be used together with air—swooning, dead and bound. Swooning mercury and air were thought to carry diseases, dead they were thought to restore life and bound they were thought to give the power of levitation. Mercury was described as swooning when it was of various colours and free from excessive volatility. It was dead when it showed wetness, thickness, brightness, heaviness and mobility. And it was bound when it was continuous, fluent, luminous, pure, heavy, and if it parted under friction.\n\nHowever, it is now known that exposure to mercury and its compounds causes hydrargyria or mercury poisoning.\n\n\n"}

In his theory, he stressed that it is more appropriate to seek a balanced variety of them all instead of devoting oneself to one kind. His conception of virtue is different from the view that an agent ought to maximize their own good, which requires being virtuous. Instead, Hurka stressed that \"agents ought to maximize the good of all, which requires conventionally right action, and as a side effect can maximize their own good.\"\n\nHurka has also studied the ethics of fighting Global Warming.

{"id": "17125359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17125359", "title": "Zen yoga", "text": "Zen yoga\n\nZen yoga refers to a variety of physical and energetic practices that can be found within the Zen Buddhist tradition, and increasingly taught in the West. Some Zen temples include a taiso (exercise) period, often early in the morning, including yoga-like postures, quick repetitive exercises, and/or more flowing exercises reminiscent of Tai Chi. These exercises are designed to open and unblock the body in preparation for sitting meditation, develop a deeper awareness of the body, and as an opportunity to practice \"becoming one” with what’s happening in the moment (expressed in Japanese through the terms \"narikiru\" – become one – or \"ima-koko\" – now-here).\n\nThe Buddha grew up around 500 B.C.E. in a time of great political and spiritual upheaval. The brahmanas, the spiritual orthodoxy, followed the teachings of the Vedas (written in the ninth century B.C.E.) and the Upanishads (compiled from around the seventh century B.C.E.). Ritual and offering were central to their beliefs, and these could only be performed by the spiritual caste, the Brahmins. The ritual act of making offerings was even, at times, venerated even more than the gods themselves, and as a consequence the Brahmins became very powerful and secretive.\n\nA number of ‘radical’ spiritual schools and teachers emerged (the shramana schools) in reaction to this brahmana orthodoxy (sometimes called the “movement of the forest sages”), of which the Buddha was one. What the Buddha offered was a straightforward method to alleviate suffering and lead towards liberation, accessible to people of all castes. As opposed to some of the more extreme positions that appeared (emphasising severe austerities or sensual indulgence) he taught what he called the 'middle way', emphasising moderation, calmness and non-forcing.\n\nHe taught that there are no absolute \"things\", there are only processes in a constant state of change (annica); that there is no fixed or permanent essence or soul (\"annata\"); and that suffering is inherent to life (dukkha) (the Three Marks of Existence). In the Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha described four foundations (or bases) of mindfulness – mindfulness of the body, of sensations, of the mind, and of dharmas (i.e. phenomena, thoughts, arisings), and is recorded as saying, \"There is one thing that leads to happiness in the present and liberation in the future; and what is this one thing? It is mindfulness of the body.\" (Anguttara Nikaya, sutta I, 21.) Thus mindfulness of the body is the direct way to liberation and the end of suffering. Zen yoga practice is primarily concerned with the body and sensations, and observing life as a process in a constant state of change, so is in direct line with the Buddha's method of awakening.\n\nAgain in the Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha says\n\nHatha Yoga emerged as a discipline in the centuries following the Buddha, tracing its origins to the Yoga-sutras written by the sage Patañjali (from the 2nd century B.C.E.) and the Goraksha Samhita (written in the 11th century by yogi Gorakshanath). The word 'hatha' in Sanskrit literally means 'force', so Hatha Yoga is the “Discipline of Force”. It stresses mastery of the body as a way of attaining a state of spiritual perfection in which the mind is withdrawn from external objects. The Buddha once related his experiences with a Hatha Yoga-type breath-retention practice and found it had a great effect, but not conducive to awakening:\n\nThe word hatha can also be seen as a combination of two separate \"Bīja mantras\" or single syllables – \"ha\" representing the masculine or solar energy and \"tha\" as the feminine or lunar energy. Thus Hatha Yoga is the practice of bringing balance to the two opposing forces. The first occurrence of the term 'hatha yoga' is in fact found in the Buddhist Guhyasamāja tantra dating from the 8th century.\n\nYantra yoga (or Trul khor) is the Tibetan Buddhist parallel to the Hindu or Vedic Hatha yoga tradition. The discipline includes similar body postures (asanas) and pranayama practices, and includes mantra practice and visualisations. Originating with the mahasiddhas of India, it was brought to Tibet in the eighth century by the great master Padmasambhava and transmitted to the Tibetan Dzogchen master Vairochana. Its practice is nowadays found in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nWith the revival of the brahmana and caste system around the turn of the first millennium C.E. and the Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent in the 12th century C.E., Buddhism began to decline. However, yoga and Buddhism had already spread into neighbouring countries, including Tibet and China to the north. At around 500 C.E., an Indian monk called Bodhidharma arrived in southern China and taught practices centered on physical health and wellbeing, meditation and the direct mind-to-mind transmission teachings of the Lankavatara Sutra. According to Chinese legend, the physical practices he taught monks to prepare them for meditation included a series of external exercises called the Eighteen Arhat Hands (Shi-ba Lohan Shou) and an internal (energetic) practice called the Sinew Metamorphosis Classic. The Yijin Jing (\"Muscle/Tendon Change Classic\") is also attributed to Bodhidharma. As these practices developed, they led to the creation of Shaolinquan school of Kung Fu.\n\nAs the Buddhism of Bodhidharma fused with the prevailing Chinese philosophies and practices of Confucianism and Taoism, it became Ch’an (from Sanskrit \"dhyāna\", meaning \"meditation\" or \"meditative state\"). Over the centuries, Ch'an spread to Japan where it become known as Zen, taking with it the rich combination of physical and energetic practices known variously as yoga, Qigong, and Tao Yin.\n\nDating back to around the fourth century C.E., Yogācāra (literally \"yoga practice\") is one of the two main philosophical systems that underlies Zen, and includes the Lankavatara Sutra mentioned above. It contains a sophisticated psychology of awakening and emphasises the practice of mindfulness. This mindfulness leads not to an experience but to a total shift in the way we relate to all experiences. This shift is referred to in the Yogācāra tradition as parāvṛtti, \"turning around”.\n\nThere are three terms in contemporary Japan used to describe yoga-style movement work: do-in (from the Chinese Tao Yin), Zen taiso (literally Zen exercise), and Zen yoga (first coined by Zen master Masahiro Oki). See below for more information.\n\nIn modern times, Zen masters Hogen Daido Roshi and Harada Tangen Roshi, in particular, have advocated and taught yoga practices to compliment their Zen training. One student of Hogen Daido Roshi recalls that he constantly imparted the importance of mixing moving Zen (do-zen) into Zen practice: \"...there are four kinds of Zen: sitting, standing, lying, and moving. We should practise them all. Whatever we do, we must do it fully, mindfully, wholeheartedly, one thing at a time without being attached to or involved in it. When we practise moving Zen, the quality of our daily lives becomes very different.”\n\nIn Zen, the inseparability of the \"body-mind\" is often stressed, together with the need to retain our flexibility for life. Hogen Roshi taught that \"By doing yoga and zazen, we can begin to appreciate the real state of our body and mind, both of which are stiff and unpeaceful. We should not hate them. Please, let them be as they are. Taste their special bitter taste\".\n\nZen practice in general, and Zen Yoga in particular, emphasize three intertwined areas – physical alignment, the flow of energy in the body and awareness or mindfulness (Japanese “nen” 念).\n\nPhysical alignment is highly emphasised in Zen. The founder of the Soto Zen school, Master Dōgen (d. 1253) wrote in his zazen (meditation) instructions:\n\nBy practising Zen yoga we therefore prepare the body for prolonged upright sitting. Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki teaches that we must then carry this alignment out into all activities of our daily life:\n\nOne of the reasons why correct posture is so emphasised is because it powerfully influences both our mind-state and our energy. Underlying Zen is a conception of the human system as an energetic phenomenon. This energy or ki is seen as something that can be enhanced or depleted. Moreover, the courses of energy flow are not random but follow particular directions and routes called “myaku” (Jp.; or meridians). This energy has two basic dimensions – one that influences our health, wellbeing and emotional state, and one that takes us beyond any particular state to a condition of non-dual awareness.\n\nWe can characterise these two energetic dimensions as:\n\nEnergy and consciousness are inextricably linked – when we change our energy, we change our consciousness and vice versa.\n\nOne of the traditional Japanese names for yoga is do-in (from the Chinese Tao Yin), which translates as “guiding and stretching”. Through the yoga practice we stretch the body and energy routes, and guide the energy in beneficial directions. Intention is ultimately the means through which this guiding happens. The manifestation of intention may be through the breath, through imagery or simply through focused attention.\n\nMuch modern yoga practice aims to open and energise our wellbeing energy circuits (energy channels that operate in the world of opposites – left, right, back, front, etc.) without touching on the non-dual areas. Although it is a worthwhile and noble aspiration to attain optimal health and wellbeing, the practitioner nevertheless remains in the world of duality – the world of this and that, of me and the universe. Zen is emphatic that within this worldview there is no happy ending to the story of life, no liberation from our fundamental suffering. However healthy and emotionally balanced we are, we remain in a condition of separation, where the Universe is seen as huge, threatening and ultimately indifferent.\n\nThis is just a worldview. It is possible to live in a place which is beyond this duality, which is the main aim of Zen practice.\n\nThe third aspect of Zen yoga is the application of awareness or mindfulness (Japanese, \"nen\" 念). As mentioned above, the Buddha is recorded as saying, \"There is one thing that leads to happiness in the present and liberation in the future; and what is this one thing? It is mindfulness of the body.\"\n\nHow do we find this happiness and liberation? Strangely enough it is through coming face-to-face with our unhappiness and reactivity – in this case as they manifest in the body. Makko-ho, a traditional Japanese sequence of stretches, literally means \"the practice of facing things\". These are a set of curative exercises originally developed from temple prostration practice in the 1930s by the pioneering Japanese yoga teacher, Nagai Wataru, then taken up and extended by Shizuto Masunaga, populariser of shiatsu massage.\n\nThe most important Zen master in the last 500 years, Hakuin Zenji had a saying that \"Buddhas are like water and ordinary people are like ice\". In Zen yoga practice, postures and movements are used to bring the body into focus so that we can notice any tightnesses or restrictions. The student is then directed to bring their non-judgemental attention to these blocked or closed areas, and it's this simple awareness that causes the ice to begin to melt. All we need is an attitude of curiosity and non-judgemental kindness.\n\nZen master Julian Daizan Skinner Roshi, teacher of Zen yoga, says that \"rather than causing our ice to melt into an inert puddle, this liberated water becomes more like a fountain; it has shape, dynamism and energy but nevertheless there’s an ungraspable quality.\"\n\nThe Yogacara philosophy (one of the two main philosophical systems that underlies Zen) emphasises that, as the individual begins to open and become more free, flowing and dynamic, they come to inhabit a different world which takes on a similar quality.\n\nAs mentioned above, some Zen temples include a taiso (exercise) period somewhere within their daily (or if not, retreat) schedule. Taiso practice routines differ from popular modern yoga classes. Rather than focussing on “sun salutations”, “warrior poses” and muscular flexibility, the quality of mindfulness and honing in on releasing energy in the body’s meridian lines is deliberately emphasised.\n\nAccording to the experience of one Zen monk who studied in a variety of contemporary Japanese and Korean Zen monasteries, both monks and laity practice a variety of yoga-like practices ranging from individual stretching (lunges, hip releases, and chest openers) to temple-wide taiso routines held every morning. He recalls \"These routines focussed on consciously and mindfully relaxing areas of the body through stretching (in particular areas that needed extra care owing to long hours of sitting). The practice also worked directly with the body as one’s object of focus, and the corresponding awareness incorporated in the process, was viewed as extremely powerful.” Ultimately, the time spend doing temple yoga, both individually and as a group, was taught to be the ideal opportunity for attaining awakening (kensho) through mindfulness of the body.\n\nIn Japan, if the temple holds formal taiso sessions, they would often be held at the beginning of the day, say 4am each morning for 20-25 mins. See here for an example. At Bukkoku-ji (where Tangen Harada was the Roshi – see above), they took the form of a mixture of quick repetitive exercise (everyone counting together) with poses held for longer times. These poses were incorporated to isolate openings in for example, the stomach and spleen meridians for a back bend, the liver and gall bladder meridians for a wide-legged side bend, and so on. They were integrated with a specific purpose in mind and were to be done with awareness alongside breathing in the hara (belly).\n\nTemple taiso routines, however, vary according to the temple and teacher. At the Weoljeong-sa temple in South Korea, for example, the monks spend an hour or more each morning doing taiso under the direction of the lead monk while on their 3-month winter retreat.\n\nOki-do yoga is a system originating with the Japanese teacher-healer-philosopher Masahiro Oki. It is a unique blend of traditional Indian hatha yoga with Zen meditation, dancing, physical games, martial arts, and chanting. The training method emphasizes balance between opposites: tension and relaxation, heat and cold, stillness and movement.\n\nMasahiro Oki is credited as the first person to use the term \"zen yoga\".\n\nZenways is an organisation set up by Zen master Julian Daizan Skinner Roshi in 2007 to promote and encourage activities and practices that enhance human wellbeing and awakening (satori or kensho). Zenways offers a 200hr Zen yoga teacher training course, together with meditation and mindfulness teacher training courses, workshops, retreats, meditation classes, and opportunities for zen study.\n\nOver the years of his Zen training, Daizan Roshi studied yoga-style physical movement in Zen temples in Europe, USA and Japan. He synthesises his knowledge of these disciplines into a Zen yoga practice that combines physical challenge with mental and spiritual development. He teaches regularly at “Yugagyo Dojo” (ZenYoga), a Zen training place he established with his students in London. With more than 5000 hours of yoga teaching experience, Daizan Roshi offers a yoga teacher training programme to help teachers to find an expression that is authentically their own and will bring them success when they teach.\n\nYoga teacher Aaron Hoopes founded a style of yoga he called Zen Yoga as a variation of traditional yoga that combines the different philosophies of various Eastern health and fitness traditions. He created this form to increase accessibility to people who are less athletic. The philosophies of shanti yoga, qigong, and tai-chi are combined to help increase flexibility, improve the flow of breathing, and open joints. The philosophy of Zen is incorporated through being mindfully aware of the present moment. The basic principle of Zen Yoga is that simple breathing, movement and stretching exercises are available to anyone regardless of age, fitness, or health.\n\nZen Yoga teacher and shiatsu therapist Tatjana Mesar created a contemporary fusion of holistic asana flow, mindfulness meditation and applied anatomy and physiology of postures, movement and breathing for the modern body. The central perspective of her Dynamic Mindfulness Yoga School emerges from Buddhist philosophy, ethics and methodology, specifically the Chan school of Buddhism.\n\nShosan Victoria Austin is a Soto Zen priest transmitted in the lineage of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. She began practicing Zen and yoga in 1971, and trained as a yoga teacher in the 1980s to bring yoga to the Buddhist community in America. A senior Iyengar yoga teacher, she emphasizes the faithful transmission of each discipline using its own language and methods. In cross-disciplinary teaching, she emphasizes teachings common to both traditions, such as bare attention; alignment of posture, breathing and intention; universal and provisional truth; dedicating the daily practice; and transformation of the causal body through applying universal moral precepts and individual practices in daily life. Yoga and Zen\n\nNon-profit organization dedicated to practice, study and teaching of Zenyoga with headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. \nThe group goes back to the mid-seventies and was founded by Zarko Andricevic, Chan master and one of the five Western Dharma-heirs of the late Chan master Shifu Sheng-yen, as an affiliate to Buddhist Centre in Zagreb.\n\nZenyoga, as taught by Zarko and other longtime teachers and mentors - Mira Punik, Mirjana Halsey, Ela Vukelja and Karmen Mihalinec - is an extension of threefold training within the Chan tradition of Buddhism - that is, it aims to bring the body, breath and mind in order or harmony. It rests on the notion that \"meditation in movement\" is a valuable companion to \"meditation in stillness\" of a more formal Chan practice, especially practice of Silent Illumination or \"mochao\" in Chinese tradition. \n\nSince 2003 Association runs a two-year teachers' training school consisting of over 650 contact hours, including a seven-day Chan meditation retreat. The school is registered on 500 level with Yoga Alliance since 2005.\n\nZenyoga is currently taught in a number of locations in Zagreb, in Pula, Rovinj, Samobor, Krk Island, Rijeka and Split. International affiliates include groups in Celje (Slovenia), Berlin (Germany) and Cape Cod (USA).\n\n"}
