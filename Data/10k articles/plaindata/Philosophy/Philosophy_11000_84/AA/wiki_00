He was the founder and first Warden of the Sheffield Educational Settlement.\n\nFreeman came from a middle-class, non-conformist background, the family involved in importing tobacco and manufacturing cigars. At various times they lived in different houses within the Hoxton area of London. He is the brother of Sir Ralph Freeman consulting engineer for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and of Labour M.P. Peter Freeman. He and his brothers all attended Haberdashers' Aske's School. On completing school in 1905, Arnold went on to study at St John's College, Oxford where, being a committed Socialist, he joined the Fabian Society. He was a vegetarian and engaged in social work from an early age, having been a member of the Highbury Quadrant Congregationalist church.\n\nHe and his sister Daisy spent a year at the Quaker Settlement in Woodbrooke, Birmingham and thereafter he began to do extramural work in tutorial classes for the Universities of Sheffield, London and Oxford. He also began lecturing at the same time he started to teach History and Economic History for the Workers' Educational Association, gradually expanding this into a concern with human nature and human idealism as expressed through Literature, Art and Philosophy. Particularly his work in Sheffield brought him into the mining areas of South Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1918 he became founding Warden of the Sheffield Educational Settlement in Shipton Street, Upperthorpe, Sheffield at first under the YMCA and later under a Council that included notable local figures. It was part of the University Settlement movement, which \"sought to bring education, improvement and hope to the lives of the poor and socially disadvantaged in the decades before the development of the Welfare State following the Second World War. The early decades of the Sheffield Settlement coincided with the serious hardship of the post-First World War era, typified by the Depression and mass unemployment.\"\n\nIts stated mission was \"to establish in the City of Sheffield the Kingdom of God\". \n\nOn a visit to Germany in 1913, Freeman had had a brief meeting with Rudolf Steiner which had left no strong impression, as he describes in Thou Eye Among the Blind. In 1921, however, he described a second encounter: \n\nIn 1922 he was co-organiser together with Professor Millicent Mackenzie of the large public conference \"Spiritual Values in Education and in Social Life\", run predominantly at Manchester College whose principal, Dr L.P. Jacks was another sympathiser and where Rudolf Steiner was able to put forward his ideas to a group of British educators. This conference marked the beginning of the establishment of Steiner-Waldorf education in the UK.\n\nThese convictions caused some conflict amongst some members of the Settlement's Council but it was Freeman's main aim to achieve spiritual values through education. He had come to Sheffield as a University tutor, and members of the University's staff played a major role in the work of the Settlement, though it had no formal association with the University. There were a lot of activities besides: courses of handicrafts, rambles, camping expeditions and involving the membership in the performance of plays. “The Settlement's Little Theatre put on a great variety of productions by the best serious dramatists, with some of whom Freeman corresponded. He never compromised over the quality of the work selected for presentation. Several notable local people, including industrialists, supported the work with donations, and a number of people later active in the public life of the city were associated with the Settlement.”\n\nIn 1923 Freeman stood as a Labour Parliamentary candidate in the Hallam constituency.\n\nWhen Freeman retired in 1955 at the age of 69 the Wardenship went to Christopher Boulton, an anthroposophist and lover of theatre. In 1961 the Shipton Street Settlement, along with its Little Theatre, vanished. In its place Christopher Boulton founded a Rudolf Steiner Settlement where the Merlin Theatre and the Arnold Freeman Hall still flourish. The Sheffield Repertory Company also started with the plays its members presented at the Little Theatre before they became independent in 1923.\n\nArnold Freeman died in 1972\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1082417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1082417", "title": "Arnold Geulincx", "text": "Arnold Geulincx\n\nArnold Geulincx (; 31 January 1624 – November 1669) was a Flemish philosopher. He was one of the followers of René Descartes who tried to work out more detailed versions of a generally Cartesian philosophy. Samuel Beckett cited Geulincx as a key influence and interlocutor because of Geulincx's emphasis on the powerlessness and ignorance of the human condition.\n\nGeulincx was born in Antwerp. He studied at the University of Leuven and was made professor of philosophy there in 1646. He lost his post in 1658, possibly for religious reasons, or (as has been suggested) a combination of unpopular views and his marriage in that year. Geulincx then moved north to the University of Leiden and converted to Calvinism. Initially he gave private lessons. He was appointed reader in logic there in 1662 and extraordinary professor in 1665. He died in Leiden in 1669, leaving most of his works, all written in Latin, to be published after his death. They were edited by Cornelis Bontekoe.\n\nDespite Geulincx's thesis that God cannot act without an instrumentality of variety, he was strongly attacked in the early eighteenth century, for example by Ruardus Andala and Carolus Tuinman, as a Spinozist. This criticism had originated from Christian Thomasius in 1710. The attack from Andala was on behalf of the 'true' Cartesians, classing Geulincx as pernicious, with Burchardus de Volder, Jean LeClerc, Frederik van Leenhof, Pontiaan van Hattem and Willem Deurhoff. Geulincx was also attacked by the Pietist Joachim Lange, as part of a campaign against Christian Wolff; and regarded with Pierre Bayle as insidiously anti-Christian by Johann Franz Buddeus.\n\nGeulincx summarized his philosophy in the phrase, \"ita est, ergo ita sit\" (\"it exists, therefore it is so\"). He believed in a \"pre-established harmony\" as a solution to the mind-body problem, dying 25 years before Leibniz's better–remembered formulation of the idea. In Leibniz's philosophy, the doctrine of pre-established harmony was linked with optimism, the notion of this world as the \"best of all possible worlds\". But Geulincx made no such linkage.\n\nThe occasionalism of Geulincx is ethical rather than cosmological in its inception. The first tract of his \"Ethics\" is a study of what in his terms are the cardinal virtues. Virtue according to Geulincx is the love of God and of Reason (III, 16-17; 29). The cardinal virtues are the properties of virtue which immediately flow from its very essence and have nothing to do with externals: diligence, obedience, justice, humility (III, 17). Humility divides his view of the world into two parts: one, the understanding of our relation to the world; and the other, the concept of our relation to God. Humility consists in the knowledge of self and the forsaking of self. I find in myself nothing that is my own but to know and to will. I therefore must be conscious of all that I do, and that of which I am not conscious is not the product of my own causality. Hence the universal principle of causality--\"quod nescis quo modo fiat, non facis\"—if you do not know how a thing is done then you do not do it. He also states a form of this principle in his \"Metaphysica vera\". Since then, the movements of my body take place without my knowing how the nervous impulse passes to the muscles and there-causes them to contract I do not cause my own bodily actions. \"I am therefore a mere spectator of this machine. In it I form naught and renew naught, I neither make anything here nor destroy it. Everything is the work of someone else\" (III, 33). This one is the Deity who sees and knows all things. The second part of Geulincx's philosophy is connected with Occasionalism as the effect with the cause. Its guiding principle is: Where you can do nothing there also you should desire nothing (III, 222). This leads to a mysticism and asceticism which however must not be taken too seriously for it is tempered by the obligation of caring for the body and propagating the species.\n\nAll published in Latin, the works appearing in his lifetime were:\n\nThe \"De virtute\" was the first part of the \"Ethica\", which ran to six parts when published posthumously.\n\nStudents seeking English editions of Geulincx's works will find:\n\n\nHe is cited by Samuel Beckett, whose character Murphy remembers the \"beautiful Belgo-Latin of Arnold Geulincx\", and in particular the gloomy nostrum (frequently repeated by Beckett to inquisitive critics) \"Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil velis\" (roughly, 'Where you are worth nothing, there you should want nothing'). In the novel \"Molloy\" (1950), Beckett's eponymous character describes himself as \"I who had loved the image of old Geulincx, dead young, who left me free, on the black boat of Ulysses, to crawl towards the East, along the deck\". Geulincx is also mentioned in Beckett's short story, \"The End.\"\n\nA citation of Geulincx's method of \"despectus sui\" appears in the 'Third Essay' of Nietzsche's \"Genealogy of Morals\".\n\n"}

{"id": "632423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=632423", "title": "Cainites", "text": "Cainites\n\nThe Cainites, or Cainians (Greek: Καϊνοί \"Kainoi\", Καϊανοί \"Kaianoi\"), were a Gnostic and Antinomian sect who were known to venerate Cain as the first victim of the Demiurge, the deity of the Tanakh, who was identified by many groups of Gnostics as evil. The sect following was relatively small. They were mentioned by Tertullian and Irenaeus as existing in the eastern Roman Empire during the 2nd century. One of their purported religious texts was the \"Gospel of Judas\".\n\nThe oldest source is to be found in Irenaeus, .\n\nHe tells us that the Cainites regarded Cain as derived from the higher principle. They claimed fellowship with Esau, Korah, the men of Sodom, and all such people, and regarded themselves as on that account persecuted by the Creator. But they escaped injury from him, for Sophia used to carry away from them to herself that which belonged to her.\n\nEpiphanius (\"Haer\". 38) characteristically gives a much longer account, in substantial harmony with what Irenaeus says. He appears to have had some source of information independent of Irenaeus. He speaks of Abel as derived from the weaker principle—a statement which bears the marks of authenticity.\n\nThe account given by Irenaeus is unduly curt and the text not quite secure, but it is not difficult to form a general estimate of the sect from it, especially with the assistance of other sources. Like other Gnostics, the Cainites drew a distinction between the Creator and the Supreme God. They identified the Creator with the God of the Jews. They viewed him and those whom he favoured with undisguised hostility; redemption had for its end the dissolution of his work. They claimed kinship with those to whom he showed antagonism in his book, the Old Testament, and shared themselves in the same hostility. Nevertheless, he was the weaker power, who could do them no permanent harm, for Sophia, the Heavenly Wisdom, drew back to herself those elements in their nature which they had derived from her.\n\nPresumably, then, they thought of a division of mankind into two classes—the spiritual and the material, the latter belonging to the realm of the Creator and deriving their being from him, but doomed to dissolution, while the former class contained the spiritual men, imprisoned, it is true, in bodies of flesh, but yet deriving their essential being from the highest Power, opposed by the Creator and his minions, but winning the victory over them as Cain did over Abel.\n\nThey regarded Judas the traitor as having full cognizance of the truth. He therefore, rather than the other disciples, was able to accomplish the mystery of the betrayal, and so bring about the dissolution of all things both celestial and terrestrial. The Cainites possessed a work entitled \"The Gospel of Judas,\" and Irenaeus says that he had himself collected writings of theirs, where they advocated that the work of Hystera should be dissolved. By Hystera they meant the Maker of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThere is no doubt that they applauded the action of Judas in the betrayal, but our authorities differ as to the motive which prompted him. The view that Judas through his more perfect \"Gnosis\" penetrated the wish of Jesus more successfully than the others, and accomplished it by bringing him to the Cross through which he effected redemption, is only one of them.\n\nEpiphanius also says that Judas forced the Archons, or rulers, against their will to slay Christ, and thus assisted us to the salvation of the Cross. Philaster, on the other hand, assigns the action of Judas to his knowledge that Christ intended to destroy the truth—a purpose which he frustrated by the betrayal.\n\nSo far as the moral character and conduct of the Cainites is concerned, there is no doubt that Irenaeus intended to represent them as shrinking from no vileness, but rather as deliberately practising it. He states that they taught, as did Carpocrates, that salvation could be attained only by passing through all experience. Whenever any sin or vile action was performed by them, they asserted that an angel was present whom they invoked, claiming that they were fulfilling his operation. Perfect knowledge consisted in going without a tremor into such actions as it is not lawful even to name.\n\nCarpocrates, we are told, defended this practice by a theory of transmigration. It was necessary to pass through all experiences, and hence the soul had to pass from body to body till the whole range of experience had been traversed. If, however, this could all be crowded into a single lifetime, then the transmigration became unnecessary. We have no ground to suppose that the Cainites held such a view, but they seem to have professed the belief that this fullness of experience was essential to salvation. We have no substantial justification for doubting the truth of Irenaeus' account, though accusations of immorality urged against heretics should always be received with caution. G.R.S. Mead (\"Fragments of a Faith Forgotten\", 1900, p. 229) thinks that originally they were ascetics, while N. Lardner (\"History of Heretics\", bk. ii. ch. xiv. [= Works, 1829, viii. 560]) questions whether a sect guilty of such enormities ever existed. But there is no valid reason to deny the generally accepted view that the Gnostic attitude to matter did lead to quite opposite results. To some it would seem a duty to crush the flesh beneath the spirit by the severest austerity, but the premise might lead to a libertine as well as to an ascetic conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Classical philosophies of the Greeks had already expired and diluted beyond recognition except for small bands of continuators of the traditions of the Pythagoreans, of Plato, and Aristotle (whose library was lost for centuries). The new philosophies of the Hellenistic world were those of the Cynics, Skeptics, and increasingly the Stoics; it's these philosophers who bring us into the world of Hellenistic philosophy. Slowly, a more integral and rounded tendency emerged within Hellenism, but also in certain respects in opposition at times to it in regard to one philosophical problem or another, or an ensemble of problems. Here are some of those thinkers most closely associated with Hellenistic Christian philosophies, listed more or less in chronological order:\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, these writers reference something in an earlier philosopher, without adding to the ongoing problem-historical shape of Western philosophical knowledge. Between Calvin, and Arminius, born four years before Calvin's death, a Protestant scholasticism took from various loci and authorities of the Western Middle Ages. It begins already with Luther's colleague Philip Melanchthon, who turned from Luther's \"sola Scriptura\" to philosophical theology; but Protestant Scholasticism's Reformed variants are diverse. There were no real alternatives until Herman Dooyeweerd and D. H. Th. Vollenhoven in the last century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864889", "title": "Cosmology", "text": "Cosmology\n\nCosmology (from the Greek κόσμος, \"kosmos\" \"world\" and -λογία, \"-logia\" \"study of\") is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its ultimate fate, as well as the scientific laws that govern these areas.\n\nThe term \"cosmology\" was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's \"Glossographia\", and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in \"Cosmologia Generalis\".\n\nReligious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology.\n\nPhysical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.\n\nTheoretical astrophysicist David N. Spergel has described cosmology as a \"historical science\" because \"when we look out in space, we look back in time\" due to the finite nature of the speed of light.\n\nPhysics and astrophysics have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. Physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the Big Bang, followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation; an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago. Cosmogony studies the origin of the Universe, and cosmography maps the features of the Universe.\n\nIn Diderot's Encyclopédie, cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).\n\nMetaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by Marcus Aurelius's observation that a man's place in that relationship: \"He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is.\"\n\nPhysical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as \"celestial mechanics\", the study of the heavens. Greek philosophers Aristarchus of Samos, Aristotle, and Ptolemy proposed different cosmological theories. The geocentric Ptolemaic system was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when Nicolaus Copernicus, and subsequently Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei, proposed a heliocentric system. This is one of the most famous examples of epistemological rupture in physical cosmology.\nIsaac Newton's \"Principia Mathematica\", published in 1687, was the first description of the law of universal gravitation. It provided a physical mechanism for Kepler's laws and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the Copernican principle—that the bodies on earth obey the same physical laws as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.\n\nModern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with Albert Einstein's publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper \"Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity\" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of World War I). General relativity prompted cosmogonists such as Willem de Sitter, Karl Schwarzschild, and Arthur Eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 Alexander Friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the Great Debate took place, with early cosmologists such as Heber Curtis and Ernst Öpik determining that some nebulae seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.\nIn parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system only; while Heber D. Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda galaxy in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way.\n\nSubsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the cosmological constant, introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an expanding universe, depending on its value. Thus the Big Bang model was proposed by the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by Edwin Hubble's discovery of the red shift in 1929 and later by the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many alternative cosmologies.\n\nSince around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the COBE, WMAP and Planck satellites, large new galaxy redshift surveys including 2dfGRS and SDSS, and observations of distant supernovae and gravitational lensing. These observations matched the predictions of the cosmic inflation theory, a modified Big Bang theory, and the specific version known as the Lambda-CDM model. This has led many to refer to modern times as the \"golden age of cosmology\".\n\nOn 17 March 2014, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the detection of gravitational waves, providing strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang. However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the cosmic inflation findings was reported.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, at the \"Planck 2014\" meeting in Ferrara, Italy, astronomers reported that the universe is 13.8 billion years old and is composed of 4.9% atomic matter, 26.6% dark matter and 68.5% dark energy.\n\nReligious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.\n\nCosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion. In modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like dialectics. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:\n\n\nTable notes: the term \"static\" simply means not expanding and not contracting.

Some common law jurisdictions also distinguish between spoken defamation, called slander, and defamation in other media such as printed words or images, called libel.\n\nFalse light laws protect against statements which are not technically false, but which are misleading.\n\nIn some civil law jurisdictions, defamation is treated as a crime rather than a civil wrong. The United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled in 2012 that the libel law of one country, the Philippines, was inconsistent with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as urging that \"State parties [to the Covenant] should consider the decriminalization of libel\". In Saudi Arabia, defamation of the state, or a past or present ruler, is punishable under terrorism legislation.\n\nA person who defames another may be called a \"defamer\", \"libeler\", \"slanderer\", or rarely \"famacide\".\n\nThe term \"Libel\" is derived from Latin \"libellus\" (literally, \"small book' or \"booklet\").\n\nAs of 2017, at least 130 UNESCO Member States retained criminal defamation laws. In 2017, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media issued a report on criminal defamation and anti-blasphemy laws among its Member States, which found that defamation is criminalized in nearly three-quarters (42) of the 57 OSCE participating States. Many of the laws pertaining to defamation include specific provisions for harsher punishment for speech or publications critical of heads of state, public officials, state bodies and the State itself. The OSCE report also noted that blasphemy and religious insult laws exist in around one third of OSCE participating States; many of these combine blasphemy and/or religious insult with elements of hate speech legislation.\n\nIn Africa, at least four Member States decriminalized defamation between 2012 and 2017. The ruling by the African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights in Lohé Issa Konaté v. the Republic of Burkina Faso set a precedent in the region against imprisonment as a legitimate penalty for defamation, characterizing it as a violation of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the treaty of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nCountries in every region have moved to advance the criminalization of defamation by extending legislation to online content. Cybercrime and anti-terrorism laws passed throughout the world have led to bloggers appearing before courts, with some serving time in prison. The United Nations, OSCE, Organisation of American States (OAS) and African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Special Rapporteurs for Freedom of Expression stated in a joint declaration in March 2017 that ‘general prohibitions on the dissemination of information based on vague and ambiguous ideas, including “false news” or “non-objective information”, are incompatible with international standards for restrictions on freedom of expression…and should be abolished.’\n\nThe common law origins of defamation lie in the torts of \"slander\" (harmful statement in a transient form, especially speech) and \"libel\", each of which gives a common law right of action.\n\n\"Defamation\" is the general term used internationally, and is used in this article where it is not necessary to distinguish between \"slander\" and \"libel\". Libel and slander both require publication. The fundamental distinction between libel and slander lies solely in the \"form\" in which the defamatory matter is published. If the offending material is published in some fleeting form, as by spoken words or sounds, sign language, gestures or the like, then it is slander.\n\nLibel is defined as defamation by written or printed words, pictures, or in any form other than by spoken words or gestures. The law of libel originated in the 17th century in England. With the growth of publication came the growth of libel and development of the tort of libel.\n\nAn early example of libel is the case of John Peter Zenger in 1735. Zenger was hired to publish \"New York Weekly Journal\". When he printed another man's article that criticized William Cosby, who was then British Royal Governor of Colonial New York, Zenger was accused of Seditious Libel. The verdict was returned as \"Not Guilty\" on the charge of seditious libel, because it was proven that all the statements Zenger had published about Cosby had been true, so there was not an issue of defamation. Another example of libel is the case of \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\" (1964). The U.S. Supreme Court overruled a State court in Alabama that had found \"The New York Times\" guilty of libel for printing an advertisement that criticized Alabama officials for mistreating student civil rights activists. Even though some of what \"The Times\" printed was false, the Court ruled in its favor, saying that libel of a public official requires proof of actual malice, which was defined as a \"knowing or reckless disregard for the truth\".\n\nThere are several things a person must prove to establish that libel has taken place. In the United States, a person must prove that 1) the statement was false, 2) caused harm, and 3) was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. These steps are for an ordinary citizen. For a celebrity or public official, a person must prove the first three steps, \"and\" that the statement was made with the intent to do harm or with reckless disregard for the truth, which is usually specifically referred to as \"actual malice\".\n\nMany nations have criminal penalties for defamation in some situations, and different conditions for determining whether an offense has occurred. ARTICLE 19, a British free expression advocacy group, has published global maps charting the existence of criminal defamation law across the globe, as well as showing countries that have special protections for political leaders or functionaries of the state.\n\nThere can be regional statutes that may differ from the national norm. For example, in the United States, defamation is generally limited to the living. However, there are nine states (Idaho, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Washington) that have criminal statutes regarding defamation of the dead.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has also published a detailed database on criminal and civil defamation provisions in 55 countries, including all European countries, all member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the United States and Canada.\n\nIn a 2012 ruling on a complaint filed by a broadcaster who had been imprisoned for violating Philippine libel law, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights held that the criminalization of libel without provision of a public figure doctrine – as in Philippine criminal law – violates freedom of expression and is inconsistent with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nQuestions of group libel have been appearing in common law for hundreds of years. One of the earliest known cases of a defendant being tried for defamation of a group was the case of Rex v. Orme and Nutt (1700). In this case, the jury found that the defendant was guilty of libeling several subjects, though they did not specifically identify who these subjects were. A report of the case told that the jury believed that “where a writing … inveighs against mankind in general, or against a particular order of men, as for instance, men of the gown, this is no libel, but it must descend to particulars and individuals to make it libel.” This jury believed that only individuals who believed they were specifically defamed had a claim to a libel case. Since the jury was unable to identify the exact people who were being defamed, there was no cause to identify the statements were a libel.\n\nAnother early English group libel which has been frequently cited is King v. Osborne (1732). In this case, the defendant was on trial “for printing a libel reflecting upon the Portuguese Jews.” The printing in question claimed that Jews who had arrived in London from Portugal burned a Jewish woman to death when she had a child with a Christian man, and that this act was common. Following Osborne’s anti-Semitic publication, several Jews were attacked. Initially, the judge seemed to believe the court could do nothing since no individual was singled out by Osborne’s writings. However, the court concluded that “since the publication implied the act was one Jews frequently did, the whole community of Jews was defamed.” Though various reports of this case give differing accounts of the crime, this report clearly shows a ruling based on group libel. Since laws restricting libel were accepted at this time because of its tendency to lead to a breach of peace, group libel laws were justified because they showed potential for an equal or perhaps greater risk of violence. For this reason, group libel cases are criminal even though most libel cases are civil torts.\n\nFrom early times, people have comprehended defamatory and injurious statements made in a public manner (\"convicium adversus bonos mores\").\n\nThe Praetorian Edict, codified circa 130 A.D., declared that an action could be brought up for shouting at someone contrary to good morals: \"qui, adversus bonos mores convicium cui fecisse cuiusve opera factum esse dicitur, quo adversus bonos mores convicium fieret, in eum iudicium dabo.\" In this case the essence of the offense lay in the unwarrantable public proclamation. According to Ulpian, not all shouting was actionable. Drawing on the argument of Labeo, he asserted that the offense consisted in shouting contrary to the morals of the city (\"adversus bonos mores huius civitatis\") something apt to bring in disrepute or contempt (\"quae... ad infamiam vel invidiam alicuius spectaret\") the person exposed thereto. Any act apt to bring another person into disrepute gave rise to an \"actio injurarum\". In such a case the truth of the statements was no justification for the public and insulting manner in which they had been made. But even in public matters, the accused had the opportunity to justify his actions by openly stating what he considered necessary for public safety to be denounced by the libel, and proving his assertions to be true. The second head included defamatory statements made in private, and in this case the offense lay in the content of the imputation, not in the manner of its publication. The truth was therefore a sufficient defense, for no man had a right to demand legal protection for a false reputation.\n\nRoman law was aimed at giving sufficient scope for the discussion of a man's character, while it protected him from needless insult and pain. The remedy for verbal defamation was long confined to a civil action for a monetary penalty, which was estimated according to the significance of the case, and which, although vindictive in its character, doubtless included practically the element of compensation. But a new remedy was introduced with the extension of the criminal law, under which many kinds of defamation were punished with great severity. At the same time increased importance attached to the publication of defamatory books and writings, the \"libri\" or \"libelli famosi\", from which we derive our modern use of the word libel; and under the later emperors the latter term came to be specially applied to anonymous accusations or pasquils, the dissemination of which was regarded as particularly dangerous, and visited with very severe punishment, whether the matter contained in them were true or false.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, slander was punished by cutting out the tongue.\n\nEven if a statement is defamatory, there are circumstances in which such statements are permissible in law.\n\nIn many legal systems, adverse public statements about legal citizens presented as fact must be proven false to be defamatory or slanderous/libellous. Proving adverse public character statements to be true is often the best defense against a prosecution for libel or defamation. Statements of opinion that cannot be proven true or false will likely need to apply some other kind of defense. The use of the defense of justification has dangers, however; if the defendant libels the plaintiff and then runs the defense of truth and fails, he may be said to have aggravated the harm.\n\nAnother important aspect of defamation is the difference between fact and opinion. Statements made as \"facts\" are frequently actionable defamation. Statements of opinion or pure opinion are not actionable. Some jurisdictions decline to recognize any legal distinction between fact and opinion. To win damages in a libel case, the plaintiff must first show that the statements were \"statements of fact or mixed statements of opinion and fact\" and second that these statements were false. Conversely, a typical defense to defamation is that the statements are opinion, relying on opinion privilege. One of the major tests to distinguish whether a statement is fact or opinion is whether the statement can be proved true or false in a court of law. If the statement can be proved true or false, then, on that basis, the case will be heard by a jury to determine whether it is true or false. If the statement cannot be proved true or false, the court may dismiss the libel case without it ever going to a jury to find facts in the case.\n\nUnder English common law, proving the truth of the allegation was originally a valid defense only in civil libel cases. Criminal libel was construed as an offence against the public at large based on the tendency of the libel to provoke breach of peace, rather than being a crime based upon the actual defamation \"per se\"; its veracity was therefore considered irrelevant. Section 6 of the Libel Act 1843 allowed the proven truth of the allegation to be used as a valid defense in criminal libel cases, but only if the defendant also demonstrated that publication was for the \"Public Benefit\".\n\nIn some systems, however, notably the Philippines, truth alone is not a defense.\n\nIt is also necessary in these cases to show that there is a well-founded public interest in the specific information being widely known, and this may be the case even for public figures. Public interest is generally not \"what the public is interested in\", but rather \"what is in the interest of the public\".\n\n\"Noonan v. Staples\" is sometimes cited as precedent that truth is not always a defense to libel in the U.S., but the case is actually not valid precedent on that issue because Staples did not argue First Amendment protection, which is one theory for truth as complete defense, for its statements. The court assumed in this case that the Massachusetts law was constitutional under the First Amendment without it being argued by the parties.\n\nIn a 2012 ruling involving Philippine libel law, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights commented, \"Penal defamation laws should include defense of truth.\"\n\nPrivilege provides a complete bar and answer to a defamation suit, though conditions may have to be met before this protection is granted.\nPrivilege is any circumstance that justifies or excuses a prima facie tort. It can be said that privilege recognizes a defendant's action stemmed from an interest of social importance – and that society wants to protect such interests by not punishing those who pursue them. Privilege can be argued whenever a defendant can show that he acted from a justifiable motive. While some privileges have long been recognized, the court may create a new privilege for particular circumstances – privilege as an affirmative defense is a potentially ever-evolving doctrine. Such newly created or circumstantially recognized privileges are referred to as residual justification privileges.\n\nThere are two types of privilege in the common law tradition:\n\nDefenses to claims of defamation include:\n\nIn addition to the above, the defendant may claim that the allegedly defamatory statement is not actually capable of being defamatory—an insulting statement that does not actually harm someone's reputation is \"prima facie\" not libelous. Also, the public figure doctrine, also called the absence of malice rule, may be used as a defense.\n\nIn the United States, special rules apply in the case of statements made in the press concerning public figures, which can be used as a defense. A series of court rulings led by \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\", 376 U.S. 254 (1964) established that for a public official (or other legitimate public figure) to win a libel case in the United States, the statement must have been published knowing it to be false or with reckless disregard to its truth (also known as actual malice).\n\nUnder United States law, libel generally requires five key elements: the plaintiff must prove that the information was published, the plaintiff was directly or indirectly identified, the remarks were defamatory towards the plaintiff's reputation, the published information is false, and that the defendant is at fault.\n\nThe Associated Press estimates that 95% of libel cases involving news stories do not arise from high-profile news stories, but \"run of the mill\" local stories like news coverage of local criminal investigations or trials, or business profiles. Media liability insurance is available to newspapers to cover potential damage awards from libel lawsuits.\n\nDefamation laws may come into tension with freedom of speech, leading to censorship or chilling effects where publishers fear lawsuits. Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights permits restrictions on freedom of speech when necessary to protect the reputation or rights of others.\n\nJurisdictions resolve this tension in different ways, in particular in determining where the burden of proof lies when unfounded allegations are made. The power of the internet to disseminate comment, which may include malicious comment, has brought a new focus to the issue.\n\nThere is a broader consensus against laws that \"criminalize\" defamation. Human rights organizations, and other organizations such as the Council of Europe and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, have campaigned against strict defamation laws that criminalize defamation. The European Court of Human Rights has placed restrictions on criminal libel laws because of the freedom of expression provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. One notable case was \"Lingens v. Austria\" (1986).\n\nArticle 17 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states\n\nIn Azerbaijan, the crime of defamation (Article 147) may result in a fine up to \"500 times the amount of minimum salaries\", public work for up to 240 hours, correctional work for up to one year, or imprisonment of up to six months. Penalties are aggravated to up to three years of prison if the victim is falsely accused of having committed a crime \"of grave or very grave nature\" (Article 147.2). The crime of insult (Article 148) can lead to a fine of up to 1000 times the minimum wage, or to the same penalties of defamation for public work, correctional work or imprisonment.\nAccording to the OSCE report on defamation laws, \"Azerbaijan intends to remove articles on defamation and insult from criminal legislation and preserve them in the Civil Code\".\n\nArticle 246 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China () criminalizes defamation.\n\nDefamation can be prosecuted either criminally or civilly, according to what is followed under Article 230-1 of the Criminal Code of Japan.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of India, the fundamental right to free speech (Article 19) is subject to reasonable restrictions. Accordingly, for the purpose of criminal defamation, \"reasonable restrictions\" are defined in \"Section 499\" of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. This section defines Defamation and provides valid exceptions when a statement is not considered to be Defamation. It says that Defamation takes place \"by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, to make or publish any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation, of such person\". In India, a defamation case can be filed under either criminal law or civil law or cyber crime law, together or in sequence.\n\nThe punishment for Defamation is a simple imprisonment for up to two years or with fine or with both.\n\nIn a 2015 case, a Saudi writer was arrested for defaming a former ruler of the country. Reportedly, under a [2014] counterterrorism law, \"actions that 'threaten Saudi Arabia’s unity, disturb public order, or defame the reputation of the state or the king' are considered acts of terrorism. The law decrees that a suspect can be held incommunicado for 90 days without the presence of their lawyer during the initial questioning.\"\n\nIn Korea true and false statements are punishable criminally and civilly with defamation; any words harming another can be considered illegal and may be punishable with fines and imprisonment up to seven years. \n\nSouth Korea is the only country in the world where an individual can be found criminally liable and imprisoned for damaging another's reputation by publically revealing true facts.\n\nDefamation is covered by several laws in Korea, civil law, traditional criminal law and modern internet criminal law-under the \"Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Data Protection, etc.\" (Internet and email related laws) – 2005 CHAPTER IX Article 61 (Penal Provisions). Korean defamation varies significantly from Western laws and in general by country and by case. As image and \"public face\" are very important in East Asia, it is not difficult to file a police report for \"loss of face\" (defamation) in Korea. Even middle school students are active with cases.\n\nIn addition to this criminal law, in Korea one can also sue for damages with civil actions. Generally, criminal actions proceed civil ones with Korean police as judicial investigators.\n\nAs of June 2010, Korean courts were still hearing cases and individuals frequently fined a few thousand dollars for true facts. International \"comity\" procedure or \"intent\" appear not key in Korea.\n\nIn the former Soviet Union, defamatory insults \"could only constitute a criminal offense, not a civil wrong\".\n\nDefamation Act, 1859\n\nTitle thirteen of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines addresses \"Crimes Against Honor\". Chapter one of that title addresses libel and slander. Libel is defined as \"public and malicious imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to blacken the memory of one who is dead\". Slander is defined as oral defamation. Slander by deed is defined as \"any act not included and punished in this title, which shall cast dishonor, discredit or contempt upon another person\". Penalties of fine or imprisonment are specified for these crimes and for the threat of libel. A notable characteristic of these crimes under Philippine law is the specification that they apply to imputations both real and imaginary.\n\nIn 2012, the Philippines enacted Republic Act 10175, titled \"Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012\". Essentially, this Act provides that libel is criminally punishable and describes it as: \"Libel – the unlawful or prohibited act as defined in Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, committed through a computer system or any other similar means which may be devised in the future.\" Professor Harry Roque of the University of the Philippines has written that under this law, electronic libel is punished with imprisonment from 6 years and one day to up to 12 years. , five petitions claiming the law to be unconstitutional had been filed with the Philippine Supreme Court, one by Senator Teofisto Guingona III. The petitions all claim that the law infringes on freedom of expression, due process, equal protection and privacy of communication.\n\nArticle 310 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of China () criminalizes defamation, held constitutional on 7 July 2000 by the Justices of the Constitutional Court, Judicial Yuan ().\n\nAccording to the Criminal Code of Albania, defamation is a crime. Insulting (Article 119) can lead to a fine or up to six months of imprisonment (if in public, up to a year), while libel (Article 120) may result in a fine or up to a year of prison (up to 2 years when in public). In addition, defamation of authorities, public officials or foreign representatives (Articles 227, 239 to 241) are separate crimes with maximum penalties varying from 1 to 3 years of imprisonment.\n\nIn Austria, the crime of defamation is foreseen by Article 111 of the Criminal Code. Related criminal offenses include \"slander and assault\" (Article 115), that happens \"if a person insults, mocks, mistreats or threatens will ill-treatment another one in public\", and yet \"malicious falsehood\" (Article 297), defined as a false accusation that exposes someone to the risk of prosecution.\n\nIn Belgium, crimes against honour are foreseen in Chapter V of the Belgian Penal Code, Articles 443 to 453-bis. Someone is guilty of calumny \"when law admits proof of the alleged fact\" and of defamation \"when law does not admit this evidence\" (Article 443). The penalty is 8 days to one year of imprisonment, plus a fine (Article 444). In addition, the crime of \"calumnious denunciation\" (Article 445) is punished with 15 days to six months in prison, plus a fine. In any of the crimes covered by Chapter V of the Penal Code, the minimum penalty may be doubled (Article 453-bis) \"when one of the motivations of the crime is hatred, contempt or hostility of a person due to his or her intended race, color of the skin, ancestry, national origin or ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, place of birth, age, patrimony, philosophical or religious belief, present or future health condition, disability, native language, political belief, physical or genetical characteristic, or social origin\".\n\nIn Bulgaria, defamation is formally a criminal offense, but the penalty of imprisonment was abolished in 1999. Articles 146 (insult), 147 (criminal defamation) and 148 (public insult) of the Criminal Code prescribe a penalty of fine.\n\nIn Croatia, the crime of insult prescribes a penalty of up to three months in prison, or a fine of \"up to 100 daily incomes\" (Criminal Code, Article 199). If the crime is committed in public, penalties are aggravated to up to six months of imprisonment, or a fine of \"up to 150 daily incomes\" (Article 199-2). Moreover, the crime of defamation occurs when someone affirms or disseminates false facts about other person that can damage his reputation. The maximum penalty is one year in prison, or a fine of up to 150 daily incomes (Article 200-1). If the crime is committed in public, the prison term can reach one year (Article 200-2). On the other hand, according to Article 203, there is an exemption for the application of the aforementioned articles (insult and defamation) when the specific context is that of a scientific work, literary work, work of art, public information conducted by a politician or a government official, journalistic work, or the defense of a right or the protection of justifiable interests, in all cases \"provided that\" the conduct was not aimed at damaging someone's reputation.\n\nAccording to the Czech Criminal Code, Article 184, defamation is a crime. Penalties may reach a maximum prison term of one year (Article 184-1) or, if the crime is committed through the press, film, radio, TV, publicly accessible computer network, or by \"similarly effective\" methods, the offender may stay in prison for up to two years or be prohibited of exercising a specific activity.\nHowever, only the most severe cases will be subject to criminal prosecution. The less severe cases can be solved by an action for apology, damages or injunctions.\n\nIn Denmark, libel is a crime, as defined by Article 267 of the Danish Criminal Code, with a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine, with proceedings initiated by the victim. In addition, Article 266-b prescribes a maximum prison term of two years in the case of public defamation aimed at a group of persons because of their race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or \"sexual inclination\".\n\nIn Finland, defamation is a crime, according to the Criminal Code (Chapter 24, Section 9), with a penalty of imprisonment of up to six months or a fine. When the defamation occurs in public, the crime is \"aggravated defamation\" (Chapter 24, Section 10), with a maximum punishment of two years in prison or a fine. In addition, there is a crime called \"dissemination of information violating personal privacy\" (Chapter 24, Section 8), which consists in disseminating information, even accurate, in a way that is apt to harm someone's right to privacy. Information that may be relevant with regard to a person's conduct in public office, in business, or in a comparable position, or of information otherwise relevant to a matter of public interest, is not covered by this prohibition.\n\nIn France, defamation is a criminal offense defined as \"the allegation or [the] allocation of a fact that damages the honor or reputation of the person or body to which the fact is imputed\". A defamatory allegation is considered an insult if it does not include any facts or if the claimed facts cannot be verified.\n\nIn German law, there is no distinction between libel and slander. , German defamation lawsuits are increasing. The relevant offences of Germany's Criminal Code are §90 (denigration of the Federal President), §90a (denigration of the [federal] State and its symbols), §90b (unconstitutional denigration of the organs of the Constitution), §185 (\"insult\"), §186 (defamation of character), §187 (defamation with deliberate untruths), §188 (political defamation with increased penalties for offending against paras 186 and 187), §189 (denigration of a deceased person), §192 (\"insult\" with true statements). Other sections relevant to prosecution of these offences are §190 (criminal conviction as proof of truth), §193 (no defamation in the pursuit of rightful interests), §194 (application for a criminal prosecution under these paragraphs), §199 (mutual insult allowed to be left unpunished), and §200 (method of proclamation). Paragraph 188 has been criticized for allowing certain public figures additional protection against criticism.\n\nIn Greece, the maximum prison term for defamation, libel or insult is five years, while the maximum fine is €15,000.\n\nThe crime of insult (Article 361, § 1, of the Penal Code) may lead to up to one year of imprisonment and/or a fine, while unprovoked insult (Article\n361-A, § 1) is punished with at least three months in prison. In addition, defamation may result in up to two months in prison and/or a fine, while aggravated defamation can lead to at least 3 months of prison, plus a possible fine (Article 363) and deprivation of the offender's civil rights. Finally, disparaging the memory of a deceased person is punished with imprisonment of up to 6 months (Penal Code, Article 365).\nIndividuals are protected under the Defamation Act 2009 which came into force on the first of January 2010. This 2009 Act repeals the Defamation Act 1961, which had, together with the underlying principles of the common law of tort, governed Irish defamation law for almost half a century. The 2009 Act represents significant changes in Irish law, as many believe that it previously attached insufficient importance to the media's freedom of expression and weighed too heavily in favour of the individual's right to a good name. The Act has a one-year limitation period which can be extended to two years in exceptional circumstances.\n\nIn Italy, there used to be different crimes against honor. The crime of injury (Article 594 of the penal code) referred to the act of offending someone's honor in their presence and was punishable with up to six months in prison or a fine of up to €516. The crime of defamation (Article 595, Penal Code) refers to any other situation involving offending one's reputation before many persons, and is punishable with a penalty of up to a year in prison or up to €1032 in fine, doubled to up to two years in prison or a fine of €2065 if the offense consists in the attribution of a determined fact. When the offense happens by the means of the press or by any other means of publicity, or in a public demonstration, the penalty is of imprisonment from six months to three years, or a fine of at least €516. Both of them were \"a querela di parte\" crimes, that is, the victim had the right of choosing, in any moment, to stop the criminal prosecution by withdrawing the \"querela\" (a formal complaint), or even prosecute the fact only with a civil action with no \"querela\" and therefore no criminal prosecution at all. However, beginning from 15 January 2016, injury is no longer a crime, but a tort, while defamation is still considered a crime like before.\n\nFinally, Article 31 of the Penal Code establishes that crimes committed with abuse of power or with abuse of a profession or art, or with the violation of a duty inherent to that profession or art, lead to the additional penalty of a temporary ban in the\nexercise of that profession or art.\n\nDeliberately false accusations of defamation, as with any other crime, lead to the crime of calumny (Article 368, Penal Code), which, under the Italian legal system, is defined as the crime of falsely accusing, before the authorities, one of a crime it didn't commit.\n\nAs to the trial, judgment on the legality of the evidence fades into its relevance.\n\nIn the Netherlands, defamation is mostly dealt with by lodging a civil complaint at the District Court. Article 167 of book 6 of the Civil Code holds: \"When someone is liable towards another person under this Section because of an incorrect or, by its incompleteness, misleading publication of information of factual nature, the court may, upon a right of action (legal claim) of this other person, order the tortfeasor to publish a correction in a way to be set by court.\" If the court grants an injunction, the defendant is usually ordered to delete the publication or to publish a rectification statement.\n\nIn Norway, defamation is a crime punished with imprisonment of up to 6 months or a fine (Penal Code, Chapter 23, § 246). When the offense is likely to harm one's \"good name\" and reputation, or exposes him to hatred, contempt or loss of confidence, the maximum prison term goes up to one year, and if the defamation happens in print, in broadcasting or through an especially aggravating circumstance, imprisonment may reach two years (§ 247). When the offender acts \"against his better judgment\", he is liable to a maximum prison term of three years (§ 248). According to § 251, defamation lawsuits must be initiated by the offended person, unless the defamatory act was directed to an indefinite group or a large number of persons, when it may also be prosecuted by public authorities.\n\nUnder the new Penal Code, decided upon by the Parliament in 2005, defamation will cease to exist as a crime. Rather, any person who believes he or she has been subject to defamation will have to press civil lawsuits. The Penal Code has not taken effect as of 2010, and there are no set date for this.\n\nIn Poland, defamation is a crime that consists of accusing someone of a conduct that may degrade him in public opinion or expose him \"to the loss of confidence necessary for a given position, occupation or type of activity\". Penalties include fine, limitation of liberty and imprisonment for up to a year (Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code). The penalty is more severe when the offense happens through the media (Article 212.2). When the insult is public and aims at offending a group of people or an individual because of his or their nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or lack of religion, the maximum prison term is 3 years.\n\nIn Portugal, defamation crimes are: \"defamation\" (article 180 of the Penal Code; up to six months in prison, or a fine of up to 240 days), \"injuries\" (art. 181; up to 3 months in prison, or a fine up to 120 days), and \"offense to the memory of a deceased person\" (art. 185; up to 6 months in prison or a fine of up 240 days). Penalties are aggravated in cases with publicity (art. 183; up to two years in prison or at least 120 days of fine) and when the victim is an authority (art.184; all other penalties aggravated by an extra half). There is yet the extra penalty of \"public knowledge of the court decision\" (costs paid by the defamer) (art. 189 of Penal Code) and also the crime of \"incitation of a crime\" (article 297; up to 3 years in prison, or fine).\n\nIn Spain, the crime of calumny (Article 205 of the Penal Code) consists of offending one's reputation knowing the falsity of the offense, or with a reckless contempt for truth. Penalties for cases with publicity are imprisonment from six months to two years or a fine of 12 to 24 months-fine, and for other cases only a fine of 6 to 12 months-fine (Article 206). Additionally, the crime of injury (Article 208 of the Penal Code) consists of hurting someone's dignity, depreciating his reputation or injuring his self-esteem, and is only applicable if the offense, by its nature, effects and circumstances, is considered by the general public as strong. Injury has a penalty of fine from 3 to 7 months-fine, or from 6 to 14 months-fine when it's strong and with publicity. According to Article 216, an additional penalty to calumny or injury may be imposed by the judge, determining the publication of the judicial decision (in a newspaper) at the expenses of the defamer.\n\nIn Sweden, the criminal offense of denigration (\"ärekränkning\") is regulated in Chapter 5 of the Criminal Code. Article 1 regulates defamation (\"förtal\") and consists of pointing out someone as a criminal or as \"having a reprehensible way of living\", or of providing information about him \"intended to cause exposure to the disrespect of others\". The penalty is a fine. It is generally not a requirement that the statements are untrue, it is enough if they statements are meant to be vilifying.\n\nArticle 2 regulates gross defamation (\"grovt förtal\") and has a penalty of up to 2 years in prison or a fine. In judging if the crime is gross, the court should consider whether the information, because of its content or the scope of its dissemination, is calculated to produce \"serious damage\". For example, if it can be established that the defendant knowingly conveyed untruths.\nArticle 4 makes it a crime to defame a deceased person according to Article 1 or 2. Most obviously, the paragraph is meant to make it illegal to defame someone's parents as a way to bypass the law.\n\nArticle 3 regulates other insulting behavior (\"förolämpning\"), not characterized under Article 1 or 2 and is punishable with a fine or, if it is gross, with up to six months of prison or a fine. While an act of defamation involves a third person, it is not a requirement for insulting behavior.\n\nUnder exemptions in the Freedom of the Press Act, Chapter 7, both criminal and civil lawsuits may be brought to court under the laws on denigration.\n\nIn Switzerland, the crime of wilful defamation is punished with a maximum term of three years in prison, or with a fine of at least 30 days' fine, according to Article 174-2 of the Swiss Criminal Code. There is wilful defamation when the offender knows the falsity of his/her allegations and intentionally looks to ruin the reputation of one's victim (see Articles 174-1 and 174-2).\n\nOn the other hand, defamation is punished only with a maximum monetary penalty of 180 daily penalty units (Article 173-1). When it comes to a deceased or absent person, there is a limitation to enforce the law up to 30 years (after the death).\n\nWith the rise of the internet, and also intranets (closed computer networks), defamatory statements may be communicated on webpages or internal memos, without reaching the attention of the courts. Such \"closet defamation\" may be used to conceal other criminal or negligent acts.\n\nModern libel and slander laws (as implemented in many, but not all, Commonwealth nations) in the United Kingdom, and in the Republic of Ireland are originally descended from English defamation law. The history of defamation law in England is somewhat obscure. Civil actions for damages seem to have been relatively frequent so far back as the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), though it is unknown whether any generally applicable criminal process was in use. The first fully reported case in which libel is affirmed generally to be punishable at common law was tried during the reign of James I. From that time, both the criminal and civil remedies have been in full operation.\n\nEnglish law allows actions for libel to be brought in the High Court for any published statements alleged to defame a named or identifiable individual or individuals (under English law companies are legal persons, and allowed to bring suit for defamation) in a manner that causes them loss in their trade or profession, or causes a reasonable person to think worse of them. Allowable defences are justification (the truth of the statement), fair comment (whether the statement was a view that a reasonable person could have held), absolute privilege (whether the statements were made in Parliament or in court, or whether they were fair reports of allegations in the public interest) and qualified privilege (where it is thought that the freedom of expression outweighs the protection of reputation, but not to the degree of granting absolute immunity). An offer of amends is a barrier to litigation. A defamatory statement is presumed to be false unless the defendant can prove its truth. Furthermore, to collect compensatory damages, a public official or public figure must prove actual malice (knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth). A private individual must only prove negligence (not using due care) to collect compensatory damages. To collect punitive damages, all individuals must prove actual malice.\n\nCriminal libel was abolished on 12 January 2010 by section 73 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. There were only a few instances of the criminal libel law being applied. Notably, the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta was convicted of criminal libel for denouncing the Italian state agent Ennio Belelli in 1912.\n\nLibel law in England and Wales was reformed by the Defamation Act 2013.\n\nIn Scots law, as in other jurisdictions that base themselves on the civil law tradition, there is no distinction between libel and slander, and all cases are simply defamation. The equivalent of the defence of justification is \"veritas\".\n\nIn Argentina, the crimes of calumny and injury are foreseen in the chapter \"Crimes Against Honor\" (Articles 109 to 117-bis) of the Penal Code. Calumny is defined as \"the false imputation to a determined person of a concrete crime that leads to a lawsuit\" (Article 109). However, expressions referring to subjects of public interest or that are not assertive don't constitute calumny. Penalty is a fine from 3,000 to 30,000 pesos. He who intentionally dishonor or discredit a determined person is punished with a penalty from 1,500 to 20,000 pesos (Article 110).\n\nHe who publishes or reproduces, by any means, calumnies and injuries made by others, will be punished as responsible himself for the calumnies and injuries whenever its content is not correctly attributed to the corresponding source. Exceptions are expressions referring to subjects of public interest or that are not assertive (see Article 113). When calumny or injury are committed through the press, a possible extra penalty is the publication of the judicial decision at the expenses of the guilty (Article 114). He who passes to someone else information about a person that is included in a personal database and that one knows to be false, is punished with six months to 3 years in prison. When there is harm to somebody, penalties are aggravated by an extra half (Article 117 bis, §§ 2nd and 3rd).\n\nIn Brazil, defamation is a crime, which is prosecuted either as \"defamation\" (three months to a year in prison, plus fine; Article 139 of the Penal Code), \"calumny\" (six months to two years in prison, plus fine; Article 138 of the PC) and/or \"injury\" (one to six months in prison, or fine; Article 140), with aggravating penalties when the crime is practiced in public (Article 141, item III) or against a state employee because of his regular duties. Incitation to hatred and violence is also foreseen in the Penal Code (incitation to a crime, Article 286). Moreover, in situations like bullying or moral constraint, defamation acts are also covered by the crimes of \"illegal constraint\" (Article 146 of the Penal Code) and \"arbitrary exercise of discretion\" (Article 345 of PC), defined as breaking the law as a vigilante.\n\nIn Chile, the crimes of calumny and slanderous allegation \"(injurias)\" are covered by Articles 412 to 431 of the Penal Code. Calumny is defined as \"the false imputation of a determined crime and that can lead to a public prosecution\" (Article 412). If the calumny is written and with publicity, penalty is \"lower imprisonment\" in its medium degree plus a fine of 11 to 20 \"vital wages\" when it refers to a crime, or \"lower imprisonment\" in its minimum degree plus a fine of 6 to 10 \"vital wages\" when it refers to a misdemeanor (Article 413). If it is not written or with publicity, penalty is \"lower imprisonment\" in its minimum degree plus a fine of 6 to 15 \"vital wages\" when it's about a crime, or plus a fine of 6 to 10 \"vital wages\" when it's about a misdemeanor (Article 414).\n\nAccording to Article 25 of the Penal Code, \"lower imprisonment\" is defined as a prison term between 61 days and five years. According to Article 30, the penalty of \"lower imprisonment\" in its medium or minimum degrees carries with it also the suspension of the exercise of a public position during the prison term.\n\nArticle 416 defines \"injuria\" as \"all expression said or action performed that dishonors, discredits or causes contempt\". Article 417 defines broadly \"injurias graves\" (grave slander), including the imputation of a crime or misdemeanor that cannot lead to public prosecution, and the imputation of a vice or lack of morality, which are capable of harming considerably the reputation, credit or interests of the offended person. \"Grave slander\" in written form or with publicity are punished with \"lower imprisonment\" in its minimum to medium degrees plus a fine of 11 to 20 \"vital wages\". Calumny or slander of a deceased person (Article 424) can be prosecuted by the spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings and heirs of the offended person. Finally, according to Article 425, in the case of calumnies and slander published in foreign newspapers, are considered liable all those who from Chilean territory sent articles or gave orders for publication abroad, or contributed to the introduction of such newspapers in Chile with the intention of propagating the calumny and slander.\n\nIn March 2016 a civil action for defamation led to imposition of a four-year prison sentence on a newspaper publisher.\n\nAs is the case for most Commonwealth jurisdictions, Canada follows English law on defamation issues (except in Quebec where the private law is derived from French civil law). In common law, defamation covers any communication that tends to lower the esteem of the subject in the minds of ordinary members of the public. Probably true statements are not excluded, nor are political opinions. Intent is always presumed, and it is not necessary to prove that the defendant intended to defame. In \"Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto\" (1995), the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the \"actual malice\" test adopted in the US case \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\". Once a claim has been made, the defendant may avail themselves of a defense of justification (the truth), fair comment, responsible communication, or privilege. Publishers of defamatory comments may also use the defense of innocent dissemination where they had no knowledge of the nature of the statement, it was not brought to their attention, and they were not negligent.\n\nIn Quebec, defamation was originally grounded in the law inherited from France. To establish civil liability for defamation, the plaintiff must establish, on a balance of probabilities, the existence of an injury (fault), a wrongful act (damage), and of a causal connection (link of causality) between the two. A person who has made defamatory remarks will not necessarily be civilly liable for them. The plaintiff must further demonstrate that the person who made the remarks committed a wrongful act. Defamation in Quebec is governed by a reasonableness standard, as opposed to strict liability; a defendant who made a false statement would not be held liable if it was reasonable to believe the statement was true.\n\nRegarding defamation on the internet, in 2011 the Supreme Court of Canada held that a person who posts hyperlinks on a website which lead to another site with defamatory content is not publishing that defamatory material for the purposes of libel and defamation law.\nIn Canada, the \"Criminal Code\" specifies the following as criminal offences:\n\n\nThe criminal portion of the law has been rarely applied, but it has been observed that, when treated as an indictable offence, it appears to arise from statements made against an agent of the Crown, such as a police officer, a corrections officer, or a Crown attorney. In the most recent case, in 1994 Bradley Waugh and Ravin Gill were charged with criminal libel for publicly accusing six prison guards of the racially motivated murder of a black inmate.\n\nAccording to an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe official report on defamation laws issued in 2005, 57 persons in Canada were accused of defamation, libel and insult, among which 23 were convicted – 9 to prison sentences, 19 to probation and one to a fine. The average period in prison was 270 days, and the maximum sentence was 1460 days of imprisonment.\n\nThe origins of U.S. defamation law pre-date the American Revolution; one famous 1734 case involving John Peter Zenger sowed the seed for the later establishment of truth as an absolute defense against libel charges. The outcome of the case is one of jury nullification, and not a case where the defense acquitted itself as a matter of law, as before the Zenger case defamation law had not provided the defense of truth.\n\nThough the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was designed to protect freedom of the press, for most of the history of the United States, the Supreme Court neglected to apply the First Amendment to libel cases involving media defendants. This left libel laws, based upon the traditional common law of defamation inherited from the English legal system, mixed across the states. The 1964 case \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\" dramatically altered the nature of libel law in the United States by elevating the fault element for public officials to actual malice—that is, public figures could win a libel suit only if they could demonstrate the publisher's \"knowledge that the information was false\" or that the information was published \"with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\".\n\nLater the Supreme Court held that statements that are so ridiculous to be clearly not true are protected from libel claims, as are statements of opinion relating to matters of public concern that do not contain a provably false factual connotation. Subsequent state and federal cases have addressed defamation law and the Internet.\n\nDefamation law in the United States is much less plaintiff-friendly than its counterparts in European and the Commonwealth countries. A comprehensive discussion of what is and is not libel or slander under United States law is difficult, as the definition differs between different states and is further affected by federal law. Some states codify what constitutes slander and libel together, merging the concepts into a single defamation law.\n\nAlthough laws vary by state, in the United States a defamation action typically requires that a plaintiff claiming defamation prove that the defendant:\n\nAmerican writers and publishers are protected from foreign libel judgments not compliant with the US First Amendment, or libel tourism, by the SPEECH Act, which was passed by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. It is based on the New York State 2008 Libel Terrorism Protection Act (also known as \"Rachel's Law\", after Rachel Ehrenfeld who initiated the state and federal laws). Both the New York state law and the federal law were passed unanimously.\n\nDefenses to defamation that may defeat a lawsuit, including possible dismissal before trial, include the statement being one of opinion rather than fact or being \"fair comment and criticism\". Truth is always a defense.\n\nMost states recognize that some categories of statements are considered to be defamatory \"per se\", such that people making a defamation claim for these statements do not need to prove that the statement was defamatory.\n\nIn an action for defamation \"per se\", the law recognizes that certain false statements are so damaging that they create a presumption of injury to the plaintiff's reputation, allowing a defamation case to proceed to verdict with no actual proof of damages. Although laws vary by state, and not all states recognize defamation \"per se\", there are four general categories of false statement that typically support a \"per se\" action:\nIf the plaintiff proves that such a statement was made and was false, to recover damages the plaintiff need only prove that someone had made the statement to any third party. No proof of special damages is required. However, to recover full compensation a plaintiff should be prepared to prove actual damages.\n\nAs with any defamation case, truth remains an absolute defense to defamation \"per se\". This means that even if the statement would be considered defamatory \"per se\" if false, if the defendant establishes that it is in fact true, an action for defamation \"per se\" cannot survive.\n\nThe conception of what type of allegation may support an action for defamation per se can evolve with public policy. For example, in May 2012 an appeals court in New York, citing changes in public policy with regard to homosexuality, ruled that describing someone as gay is not defamation.\n\nThe record libel verdict in the United States was rendered in 1997 against Dow Jones in favor of MMAR Group Inc., awarding $222.7 million. However, the verdict was dismissed in 1999 amid allegations that MMAR failed to disclose audiotapes made by its employees.\n\nLess than half of U.S. states have criminal defamation laws, and the applicability of those laws is limited by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the laws are rarely enforced. At the federal level, there are no criminal defamation or insult laws in the United States. However, on the state level, 17 states and 2 territories have criminal defamation laws on the books: Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota,Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. Three additional states had such laws in 2005; Colorado's law was repealed in 2012, and Washington's was repealed in 2009, Georgia's O.C.G.A. § 16-11-40 was repealed in 2015\n\nGroup libel has been on many occasions shown to be found by United States courts to be a crime which was punishable under common law. There were three notable early cases in United States law which found group libel to be a criminal offense. The first of these cases was \"State v. Brady\" (1890). The holding of this court found that \"The law is elementary that a libel need not be on a particular person, but may be upon a family, or a class of persons, if the tendency of the publication is to stir up riot and disorder, and incite to a breach of the peace.\" This holding is similar to that of \"King v. Osborne\", in that the court found the prevention of riots to take priority over the protection of speech.\n\n\"Jones v. State of Texas\" (1897) took place a few years after Brady and held a similar view on group libel. This case was, however, different in that it concerned the defamation of streetcar conductors in Galveston. The court still sided with the state, saying that \"It therefore would be a violation of our statute to libel any sect, company, or class of men without naming any person in particular who may belong to said class\". Going further than strictly outlawing libel against a religious or racial group, the Jones court found that libel against any group, even a class of workers, had potential to lead to violence between groups.\n\n\"People v. Spielman\" (1925) upheld same statute as the one in \"Beauharnais\". In this case, publications defamed members of the Knights of Columbus, falsely assigning an oath to them. In this case the defendant was found guilty of a libel on both \"the membership of the American Legion and certain named members of that organization\". The holding that individual members were libeled relied on doctrine from the Osborne case. Though these individual members were not named in the publication, their ties to the legion gave them adequate claim to a criminal libel offense. These three cases played a large role in solidifying the American conception of group libel law as it was interpreted in the \"Beauharnais\" case.\n\nThough the common law interpretation of group libel law has generally been referred to in United States court cases prior to the case of \"Beauharnais v. Illinois\", the courts have not always taken this stance. There are two notable group libel cases prior to \"Beauharnais\" where the court went contrary to the holding of Osborne. This first of these cases was \"Drozda v. State\" (1920). This case examined an instance of libel on the leaders of a Bohemian national organization. The court dismissed their claim, stating that \"A government or other body politic, a corporation, religious system, race of people, or a political party, are not subject to criminal libel. Nor could a publication referring generally to any of these be made specific or libelous.\" This judge believed that since the libel in question was directed towards \"those people whom you call leaders\", there was not sufficient evidence that those claiming to have been libeled against actually had any comments directed towards them.\n\nThe court in \"People v. Edmonson\" (1930) also denied claims to an apparent case of group libel. In this case, the defendant was accused of libel towards the Jewish community. The judge sided with the defendant, writing that \"such an indictment cannot be sustained under the laws of this State, and that no such indictment as one based upon defamatory matter directed against a group or community so large as 'all persons of the Jewish Religion' has ever been sustained in this or any other jurisdiction\". The judge further said that \"when one realizes how many forms of religion might consider themselves libeled and seek legal redress, where our laws so extended, and when we reflect on how our courts might, in such event, find themselves forced into the position of arbiters of religious truth, it is apparent that more would be lost than could be gained by attempting to protect the good name of a religion by an appeal to the criminal law\". In this case, the judge finds that it would be unreasonable to expect courts to take on the responsibility of deciding whether statements towards a religion should or should or should not be considered libel. Though group libel generally favored the Osborne holding prior to the Beauharnais case, there is also a well documented record of United States courts taking a position which more closely resembles that of the Orme and Nutt holding.\n\n\"Beauharnais v. Illinois\" is one of the better known cases of group libel in the United States judicial system. Joseph Beauharnais was arrested in 1950 for distributing leaflets in Chicago. Within these leaflets, Beauharnais called upon the Chicago government to take action to address \"the constant and continuous invasion, harassment and encroachment by the Negro\". An Illinois law outlawed the distribution of any material which \"portrays depravity, criminality, unchastity, or lack of virtue of a class of citizens, of any race, color, creed or religion which said publication or exhibition exposes the citizens of any race, color, creed or religion to contempt, derision, or obloquy or which is productive of breach of the peace or riots\". Beauharnais disagreed with this law, and believed that his publications should be viewed as protected speech rather than group libel.\n\nIn a 5–4 decision, the court found Beauharnais guilty of libel. In his majority opinion, Justice Frankfurter wrote that Beauharnais' comments provoked hostility, and, given Illinois' history of racial tensions, should be outlawed.\n\nJustice Black, in his dissent, stated that he believed that the statute could be abused to protect speech that otherwise should not be protected. However Frankfurt disagreed and said that \"Every power may be abused, but the possibility of abuse is a poor reason for denying Illinois the power to adopt measures against criminal libels sanctioned by centuries of Anglo-American law.\" Group libel laws, according to Frankfurt, played an important role in the history of common law, and its existence prevents speech that could lead to violence from being recognized as protected speech.\n\nThough the \"Beauharnais\" case seemed to set a strong precedent protecting criminal group libel laws at the time, subsequent cases took a stance which more strongly favors speech protections. \"R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul\" (1992) is one of the most notable of these cases. In St. Paul, Minnesota, it was a crime to place something in public which could cause \"anger, alarm, or resentment ... on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender\". Representing the unanimous court that held the ordinance invalid on its face, Justice Scalia explained and qualified the categorical exclusions for defamation, obscenity, and fighting words. These categories of speech are not \"entirely invisible to the Constitution\", but instead \"can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content\". In this case, Scalia believed that the St. Paul law was a clear case of viewpoint-based discrimination, and therefore unconstitutional.\n\nThe Court in \"Virginia v. Black\" (2003) held in a 7–2 decision that its opinion in \"R. A. V.\" did not make it unconstitutional for a state to prohibit burning a cross with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons because it prevents intimidation rather than discriminate on the basis of a defendant’s beliefs. In her opinion, Justice O'Connor wrote that \"as a factual matter it is not true that cross burners direct their intimidating conduct solely to racial or religious minorities. ... The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burning done with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages\". She clarified that \"a State may choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm\".\n\nJustice Thomas dissented to this holding, giving similar to arguments made for prohibiting flag burning. He wrote that all cross burning should be exempt from the 1st amendment \"due to the historical association of cross-burning with terrorism\".\n\nJustice Souter had his own opinion, defending all cross burning, even those acts which are committed to cause fear because of \"R. A. V.\", citing a problem with \"the statute's content-based distinction\".\n\nWhile common law has traditionally interpreted group libel laws in a way which protects against defamation, subsequent United States court holdings such as that in \"R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul\" (1992) and \"Virginia v. Black\" (2003) have taken a stance that is more protective of free speech.\n\nCrimes of calumny, defamation and slanderous allegation \"(injurias)\" have been abolished in the Federal Penal Code as well as in 15 states. These crimes remain in the penal codes of 17 states, where penalty is, in average, from 1.1 years (for ones convicted for slanderous allegation) to 3.8 years in jail (for those convicted for calumny).\n\nAustralian law tends to follow the English law of defamation, though there are differences introduced by statute and by the implied constitutional limitation on governmental powers to limit speech of a political nature established in \"Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997)\".\n\nIn 2005, uniform defamation laws were introduced across Australia. The laws made a number of changes to the common law position, including:\n\n\nOn 10 December 2002, the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in the Internet defamation case of \"Dow Jones v Gutnick\". The judgment established that internet-published foreign publications that defamed an Australian in their Australian reputation could be held accountable under Australian defamation law. The case gained worldwide attention and is often said, inaccurately, to be the first of its kind. A similar case that predates \"Dow Jones v Gutnick\" is \"Berezovsky v Forbes\" in England.\n\nAmong the various common law jurisdictions, some Americans have presented a visceral and vocal reaction to the \"Gutnick\" decision. On the other hand, the decision mirrors similar decisions in many other jurisdictions such as England, Scotland, France, Canada and Italy.\n\nUniform defamation law reform came into effect in Australia on 1 January 2006, severely restricting the right of corporations to sue for defamation (see e.g. \"Defamation Act 2005\" (Vic), s 9). This makes defamation laws across states and territories similar. The only corporations excluded from the general ban are not-for-profit corporations or those with fewer than ten employees and not affiliated with another company. Corporations may, however, still sue for the tort of injurious falsehood, where the burden of proof is greater than for mere defamation, because the plaintiff must show that the defamation was made with malice and resulted in economic loss.\n\nThe 2006 reforms also established across all Australian states the availability of truth as an unqualified defense; previously a number of states only allowed a defense of truth with the condition that a public benefit existed. The defendant needs to prove that the defamatory imputations are substantially true. Lawyers for plaintiffs often use the initial high expense of lodging a defense to their advantage, demanding the immediate payment of tens of thousands of dollars from potential defendants. Even though a plaintiff may have little chance of winning defamation action, or even having the courts accept the case, the unpredictable outcomes of such cases usually sees defence lawyers asking for large payments before any legal work begins, and advising clients to pay the out-of-court demands.\n\nThe law as it currently stands in Australia was summarized in the 2015 case of Duffy v Google by Justice Blue in the Supreme Court of South Australia.\n\nA more recent case in defamation law was \"Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited\" [2015], heard in the Federal Court of Australia. This judgment was significant as it demonstrated that tweets, consisting of even as little as three words, can be defamatory, as was held in this case.\n\nNew Zealand received English law with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in February 1840. The current Act is the Defamation Act 1992 which came into force on the 1 February 1993 and repealed the Defamation Act 1954.\n\nNew Zealand law allows for the following remedies in an action for defamation: compensatory damages; an injunction to stop further publication; a correction or a retraction; and in certain cases, punitive damages. Section 28 of the Act allows for punitive damages only when a there is a flagrant disregard of the rights of the person defamed. \n\nAs the law assumes that an individual suffers loss if a statement is defamatory, there is no need to prove that specific damage or loss has occurred. However, Section 6 of the Act allows for a defamation action brought by a corporate body to proceed only when the body corporate alleges and proves that the publication of the defamation has caused or is likely to cause pecuniary loss to that body corporate.\n\nThe following defences are allowed: \nmatters.\n\nThe Hebrew term lashon hara is the halakhic term for derogatory speech about another person. \"Lashon hara\" differs from defamation in that its focus is on the use of true speech for a wrongful purpose, rather than falsehood and harm arising. By contrast, \"hotzaat shem ra\" (\"spreading a bad name\"), also called \"hotzaat diba\", consists of untrue remarks, and is best translated as \"slander\" or \"defamation\". \"Hotzaat shem ra\" is worse, and consequently a graver sin, than \"lashon hara\".\n\nIn Roman Catholic theology there are seen to be two sins, that of lying and that of impinging on a person's right to a reputation. It is considered to be closed to detraction, the sin of revealing previously unknown faults or sins of another person to a third person.\n\nSome jurisdictions have a separate tort or delict of \"verbal injury\", \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\", \"outrageousness\", or \"convicium\", involving the making of a statement, even if truthful, intended to harm the claimant out of malice; some have a separate tort or delict of \"invasion of privacy\" in which the making of a true statement may give rise to liability: but neither of these comes under the general heading of \"defamation\". Some jurisdictions also have the tort of \"false light\", in which a statement may be technically true, but so misleading as to be defamatory. There is also, in almost all jurisdictions, a tort or delict of \"misrepresentation\", involving the making of a statement that is untrue even though not defamatory. Thus a surveyor who states a house is free from risk of flooding has not defamed anyone, but may still be liable to someone who purchases the house relying on this statement. Other increasingly common claims similar to defamation in U.S. law are claims that a famous trademark has been diluted through tarnishment, see generally trademark dilution, \"intentional interference with contract\", and \"negligent misrepresentation\".\n\nCriminal laws prohibiting protests at funerals, sedition, false statements in connection with elections, and the use of profanity in public, are also often used in contexts similar to criminal libel actions.\n\nThe boundaries of a court's power to hold individuals in \"contempt of court\" for what amounts to alleged defamatory statements about judges or the court process by attorneys or other people involved in court cases is also not well established in many common law countries.\n"}
{"id": "27207307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27207307", "title": "Ferdinand Fellmann", "text": "Ferdinand Fellmann\n\nFerdinand Fellmann (born 1939) is a German philosopher. After the expulsion of his family in 1946 out of Hirschberg (now Jelenia Góra, Poland) Fellmann grew up in Hameln/Weser (Germany).\n\nFellmann studied at the University of Münster and the University of Pavia, promoted by the “Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes” (German National Merit Foundation). He graduated from his studies in English and Romance Languages and Literature in 1959. From 1962–1965 Fellmann continued his studies in Giessen (Germany). He studied there under his most influential professors: Professor of Romance Languages and Literature, Hans Robert Jauss, and Professor of Philosophy, Blumenberg. Due to the conflict between Jauss, a former SS-Man, and Blumenberg, who was a victim of persecution by the Nazi Regime, Fellmann sought out to find his own way of thinking. In 1967 Fellmann completed his doctorate in Bochum and in 1973 he finished his postdoctoral lecture qualification (“Habilitation”) in Münster. A representation of his relation to Blumenberg can be found in the \"Journal Information Philosophie\" (2008, Issue 3, 49-54).\n\nFellmann was appointed Professor of Philosophy in 1980. In 1985, he occupied the position of Guest Professor in Naples (Italy) and translated texts of Giordano Bruno, Giambattista Vico, and Benedetto Croce. Later he moved away from historicism and towards systematic themes. In opposition to the dominance of analytic philosophy at the German universities, Fellmann remained devoted to continental (“alteuropäisch”, old European) philosophical tradition. In 1994 he was appointed “Gründungsprofessor” of philosophy at Chemnitz University of Technology, where he worked on synthesizing idealistic and materialistic forms of thought. His concept of philosophy as practical orientation appears in his book entitled \"Orientierung Philosophie: was sie kann, was sie will\" [Orientation Philosophy: What You Can, What You Want To], first published in 1998. Several of Fellmann's colleagues opposed the book, calling it destructive to academic tradition. After being emeritus professor in 2005, Fellmann served as a Visiting Professor in Vienna (Austria) and Trento (Italy). He currently lives in Münster. As unconventional thinker, he does not belong to any particular philosophical community. In his homepage he ironically refers to himself as the Accademico di nulla accademia, “Academic of no Academy”.\n\nFellmann's thought developed from the Philosophy of History to Philosophical Anthropology. Man is always in the focus of his interest, but the perspective is always changing from upside down from the idea of history to bottom up from the human world of life. There are four distinguished phases:\n\n1. Philosophy of history\n\nFellmann's entrance into academic discussion followed from the publication of his book, \"Das Vico-Axiom: Der Mensch macht die Geschichte\" [The Vico-Axiom: The man makes the history] (1976). Contrary to the influential, idealistic conception of history presented in Hegel's philosophy of spirit, Fellmann interprets Giambattista Vico's\" The New Science\" in light of cultural anthropology. Thus, man is the only originator of history, however, he cannot govern the course of history with will or consciousness. Fellmann's conception of history was strongly attacked by the Idealists as well as by the Materialists. For the Idealists, his conception of history was too naturalistic, and the Marxists accused his work of being a “spätbürgerlicher” revisionism. Currently, Fellmann interprets philosophy of history formally as the theory of historical consciousness.\n\n2. Phenomenology and hermeneutics\n\nIn the 1980s Fellmann shifted his focus to the phenomenological account of the theory of consciousness. In \"Phänomenologie als ästhetische Theorie\" (1989) he interprets Husserl's teachings of phenomenological ideation (“Wesensschau”) with the example of the photographic snapshot as a case of aesthetic perception of the general in the particular. A further development of Phenomenology as a general media theory by Fellmann is presented in his book \"Phänomenologie zur Einführung\" (3. edition 2015). In his theory of mental imagery (“Bildbewusstsein”), Fellmann turns against the popular dogma of the exclusively linguistic construction of the world. In many essays, he works out the logic of the image as an autonomous, symbolic form, located between sign and language. He explains the primate of image consciousness in his book, \"Symbolischer Pragmatismus: Hermeneutik nach Dilthey\" (1991), as an “imagic turn” (different from the current “pictorial turn”) — indicating by this term that images possess a magical dimension that cannot be completely resolved in intentionality. In a recent article Hermes und Pandora Fellmann shows how the mythical background still is present in modern hermeneutic philosophy.\n\n3.Philosophy of life, art of living\n\nInsight into the limitations of the epistemological theory of consciousness led Fellmann after 1990 to a turning point in his thinking towards a modern philosophy of life. In his book \"Lebensphilosophie. Elemente einer Theorie der Selbsterfahrung\" (1993) it is clearly recognizable that he does not believe that the destruction of reason forms the core of “Lebensphilosophie”. Rather, he sees that man as a rational being will always have to deal with uncontrollable desires and emotions that frustrate reasonable intentions. These emotions cannot and should not be transformed into reasons, because they offer humans stability and support in behaviour. This approach to Philosophy of life led Fellmann to an ethic with strong utilitarian and hedonistic traits. In \"Die Angst des Ethiklehrers vor der Klasse. Ist Moral lehrbar?\" (2000) and in \"Philosophie der Lebenskunst zur Einführung\" (2009), he makes clear that practical ethics can only be developed on the foundation of a realistic idea of human life. Fellmann has recently translated a key text of Confuzius into German to underpin his view of life through an intercultural perspective.\n\n4. Philosophical anthropology\n\nFellmann's philosophical anthropology has found its provisionally definite expression in a widely discussed book\" Das Paar. Eine erotische Rechtfertigung des Menschen\" [The Couple: An erotic Justification of Man] (2005). In analogy to the Pauline doctrine of justification (\"justificatio sola fide\"), Fellmann interprets justification as an emotional bonding with a loved one that cannot be replaced by rational reasons. In this respect Fellmann's concept of emotional justification opposes the epistemic conception of justification and truth held by Jürgen Habermas. In Fellmann's view epistemic justification of single actions is not sufficient to support man as a being in constant need of justification of his contingent existence. He reconstructs erotic love in terms of genetic phenomenology being the source of self-consciousness, a position that he recently sought out to underpin through socio biology. In his later essays, Fellmann argues that the „eccentric positionality“ of man's self-consciousness is the outcome of his exceptional sexuality, namely the constant erotic susceptibility apart from procreation. His attempt to connect biology and philosophy has been acclaimed. Especially the hypothesis of emotional selection and the step from sexuality to eroticism as essential for the process of hominization is currently discussed by both parties as controversial.\n\nFellmann's philosophical position is outstanding in German academic tradition by his attempt to transform the fundamental questions of metaphysics and ontology into anthropological descriptions and practical devices. His work shows a sound historical knowledge reformulated in the scope of a realistic reconstruction of the human world of life including the various forms of symbolic representation. Thus, he avoids a naturalistic reduction balancing out transcendental idealism and pragmatic realism. The philosopher to whom Fellmann refers in most of his texts is Schopenhauer, the father of modern Philosophy of Life, regarding the world as Will and Representation.\n\n\n\n"}

Russell, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jeff Baena.\n\nA self-named \"existential comedy\", \"I ♥ Huckabees\" follows a couple of detectives (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin), hired to investigate the meaning of the life of their clients (Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman, Mark Wahlberg, and Naomi Watts). As the different investigations cross paths, their rival and nemesis (Isabelle Huppert) tries to drag their clients into her own views on the meaning of their lives. It also features the screen debuts of Jonah Hill (in a minor role) and Ger Duany.\n\nAlbert Markovski is a young man who heads the local chapter of an environmental group, the \"Open Spaces Coalition\". One of their current projects is an attempt to stop the building of a new Huckabees store, a chain of \"big-box\" department stores. Albert is a rival of Brad Stand, a shallow power executive at Huckabees. Brad infiltrates Open Spaces and charismatically displaces Albert as the leader. Dawn Campbell is Brad's live-in girlfriend and the face and voice of Huckabees; she appears in all of the store's commercials.\n\nAfter seeing the same conspicuous stranger three times, Albert contacts two existential detectives, Bernard, and Vivian Jaffe. The detectives offer Albert their optimistic brand of existentialism—they name it \"universal interconnectivity\" (which has some tenets of romantic and transcendentalist philosophies)—and spy on him, ostensibly to help him solve the coincidence. Bernard and Vivian introduce Albert to Tommy Corn, an obsessively anti-petroleum firefighter. Tommy is assigned to Albert as his 'other'.\n\nTommy grows dissatisfied with the Jaffes, feeling that they are not helping him. Seeking out other possibilities, Tommy ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban, a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing nihilistic/absurdist philosophy. She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of \"pure being.\" Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that it is inevitable to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness.\n\nIn order to prove her point, Caterine takes Albert to go and have sex in the woods, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy finds out about the two of them being together and feels hurt. Caterine tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them, furious and lost. Meanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: Dawn rejects the modeling world and looks for deeper meaning, while Brad realizes that his whole ascent on the corporate ladder is meaningless, as he has lived his whole life just trying to please others and not himself.\n\nAll the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire. While the fire trucks get stuck in a traffic jam, Tommy comes on his bicycle to put out the fire, which incidentally trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his house, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of enlightenment when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Vauban to realize the cosmic truth of everything. Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to Brad that he burned Brad's jet skis, and the fire spread to the house. Albert understands that he and Brad are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, hoping she will help him as she did Albert and Tommy. Albert and Tommy talk later about everything that has happened. As the two talk, Caterine and the Jaffes watch them, concluding that they can close both of their cases.\n\nIn an interview with the SuicideGirls website, director Russell said in response to the question \"How do you describe \"I Heart Huckabees\"?\": \n\nBefore directing his first feature, \"Spanking the Monkey\", Russell intended to make a film \"about a guy who sits in the back of a Chinese restaurant with microphones on every table to surreptitiously listen to everybody’s conversations, then write perversely personal fortunes for each of the people.\" Hitting a writer's block, Russell could not figure out how to make the film work. In the meantime Russell was called for jury duty, after which he stopped writing the film. Ideas in the script stayed with him though and they would later form the basis for the Huckabee script. The final idea came to Russell in a dream where \"This female detective she was not following me for criminal reasons, but she was following me for spiritual and metaphysical reasons.\" Russell, who makes a habit of writing his dreams down, knew instantly upon reading his summary of the dream that this was the story he wanted to pursue.\n\nIn March 2007, two videos were leaked onto YouTube portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names. When the \"Miami New Times\" asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, \"I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie—even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And he's a very free-form kind of guy anyway.\"\n\nJon Brion provided the score and seven original songs for the film. His unique methods for writing previous film scores (\"Punch-Drunk Love\", \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\") involved very close collaboration with the director. Through this process, David O. Russell was able to sit in the same room with Brion and watch an early cut of the film. Russell described what he wanted to portray and Brion would compose music to Russell's descriptions. The process can be seen on a featurette on the film's special edition DVD.\n\nDavid O. Russell, while working with Brion, had come across Brion's first solo album, \"Meaningless\". Russell has mentioned that Brion's album asks similar questions to the ones Russell was trying to ask with \"I Heart Huckabees\". In particular, Russell notes that the questions on \"Meaningless\" are closer to the questions directed from Caterine Vauban's negative and dark point of view.\n\nMany cues used in the film feature a Chamberlin, a keyboard instrument from the 1950s that replicates instrumental sounds using recorded tape.\n\nIn an advertising campaign for the film, four fictional websites were created. They were portrayed as if they were actual websites involving the characters and organizations featured in the film. Each website had a link called \"Disclaimer\" at the bottom that leads to FOX Searchlight's official website for the film. Websites were rendered inactive a few months after release, each now redirecting to FOX Searchlight's website.\n\n\"I Heart Huckabees\" opened in a limited release on October 1, 2004, earning $292,177 and ranking number 24 in the weekend's box office. The film was granted a wide release three weeks later on October 22, earning $2,902,468, ranking tenth in the box office. At the end of its run, the film grossed $12,785,432 domestically and $7,286,740 overseas for a worldwide total of $20,072,172.\n\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Some critics were displeased with the existential subject matter and said the script was unfocused, while others celebrated its performances (especially Wahlberg as Tommy Corn) and originality. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 62% rating based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. Metacritic reports a 55 out of 100 rating based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37279990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37279990", "title": "Ideocracy", "text": "Ideocracy\n\nIdeocracy (a portmanteau word combining \"ideology\" and \"kratos\", Greek for \"power\") is \"governance of a state according to the principles of a particular (political) ideology; a state or country governed in this way\". It is government based on a monistic ideology — as distinct from an authoritarian state which is characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms. An ideocratic state can either be totalitarian—citizens being forced to follow an ideology—or populist (citizens voluntarily following an ideology). \n\nEvery government has ideological bases from which assumptions and policies are drawn, but ideocracies are governments wherein one dominant ideology has become deeply ingrained into politics and, generally, politics has become deeply ingrained into all or most aspects of society. The ideology of an ideocracy presents itself as an absolute, universal, and supreme system for understanding social life, much as a god in a monotheistic belief system.\n\nSidney and Beatrice Webb used the term \"ideocracy\" in 1936, and it was given added currency by Nicholas Berdyaev in 1947. \n\nAn ideocracy may take a totalitarian form, reliant on force, or a populist form, reliant on the voluntary support of true believers. The totalitarian form contains six components; 1) ideology, 2) a single party typically with one leader, 3) a terroristic police, 4) a monopoly of communications, 5) a monopoly of weaponry, 6) a centrally directed or planned economy.\n\nAccording to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, in addition, an ideocracy such as a strict Islamic state or Nazi Germany, will suppress scientific research and knowledge if it conflicts with the ideology,\nPiekalkiewicz and Penn, argue that every state is either organic (the organized expression of a community, within which all individuals are dependent and subsumed, as the fingers belong to the body), or mechanical/pragmatic (an artificial concept in which individuals have rights against the state and are co-equal). As Adlai Stevenson II has said, \"Since the beginning of time governments have been engaged in kicking people around. The astonishing achievement in modern times is the idea that citizens should do the kicking\". \n\nIdeocracies derive political legitimacy, in the view of Piekalkiewicz and Penn, from one of the following ideological sources: nation, race, class, or culture. They also believe that ideocrats will project their own feelings of guilt onto groups of people—Jews, communists, capitalists, heretics—as forces undermining the ideocracy. These scapegoats symbolize the forces that true believers must combat within themselves. Blame for failures of policy is diverted away from the ideocrats onto the scapegoats, who are subjected to mob attacks, terrorism, show trials, and stylized punishments. In Hitler's Germany the drive to exterminate the Jews eventually took priority over every other goal.\n\nCitizens of pluralist states may emigrate freely, but those who leave an ideocracy may be branded as traitors.\n\nIndividuals within ideocracies develop an authoritarian personality, say Piekalkiewicz and Penn, in order to succeed or survive. Long after the collapse of the ideocracy, these individuals remain resistant to democratization. They develop a closed mind in which their self-realization within the ideocracy overrides the hostility of the 'heretical' outside world. Simple slogans are adopted and repeated as signs of conformity and loyalty. Those who disbelieve the ideology are fatalistic, supporting the system because they feel powerless to change it, or Machiavellian, cynically exploiting the system for their own ends. Both groups develop a form of doublethink\n\nA small minority of self-actualisers, tolerant of ambiguity, are able to resist the monistic belief system and continue to search long-term for new ideas and complex answers.\n\nAccording to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ideocracies rise and fall in the following manner;\n\na) Civil war: As in the USSR, China, Cuba, Yugoslavia. In order to establish the ideocracy, there must be a ruthless charismatic leader: a Lenin, Mao, Castro, Tito.\n\nb) Takeover: Usually a political party with a determined leader (\"the leader is the movement\") takes power by coup d'état, which creates a bandwagon effect: as in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, and in Iran.\n\nc) In an isolated colony: e.g., White South Africa, and the Puritans of New England\n\nThis usually takes 10-15 years. The leader is no longer a Prophet, but is now deified. There is a purge of followers, and bureaucratization of the state and party. The economy is nationalized, and totally mobilized in support of the ideocracy. There will be scapegoating of enemies and terrorizing of dissidents.\n\na) Self-destruction. One or more of the following may cause decline. The ideocracy may split into 'warring camps'. It may be ended by a military coup, as in Peronist Argentina. There may be a popular rebellion. The economy may stagnate, as demands exceed ability. There may be external attacks by other states which fear the spread of the ideology,\n\nb) Peaceful erosion. A new generation matures which is less fervent and more tolerant of pluralism. Technological developments and artistic expression (for example, the plays of Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia) erode faith in the ideology. The leadership become a less-effective self-serving, careerist elite.\n\nc) Regeneration may prevent or postpone collapse. The ideology is rethought and adapted, or replaced by a completely new set of ideals. For example, in Poland, communist ideocracy failed in 1980, the recognition of Lech Walesa's Solidarity Trade Union leading to a military coup and authoritarian military rule. Romanian communism ended abruptly in 1989 and again the military took over, trying and executing Ceaușescu.\n\nPiekalkiewicz and Penn described Pharaonic Egypt, ancient Babylon, the Aztec and Inca empires, Sparta, the Islamic empire, Imperial Russia and Imperial China as ideocracies and cite Tito's Yugoslavia, Peronist Argentina, Iraq under Saddam, the USSR, Salazar's Portugal, Albania, the Warsaw pact countries, and Imperial Japan as among those that rose and fell in the 20th century. Both Catholic and Protestant extremists in Northern Ireland sought ideocratic solutions, but were thwarted by British troops.\n\nAccording to Uwe Backes and Steffan Kailitz, the USSR, Italy under Fascism, Nazi Germany and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) all rose and fell as ideocracies during the 20th century.\n\nThe Populist form of ideocracy has been an important force in Latin American political history, where many charismatic leaders have emerged since the beginning of the 20th century, \n\nUwe Backes lists the People's Republic of China, North Korea and Communist Cuba as regimes currently showing ideocratic tendencies. Willfried Spohn claims that \"China is an ideocracy\", but Gordon White says it has ceased to be one.\n\nPiekalkiewicz and Penn cite Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Sudan as still extant ideocracies. In Israel, only the religious Jewish settlers and ultranationalists seek ideocratic solutions.\n\nPeter Bernholz asserts that Saudi Arabia, with its Wahhabist ideology, has been an ideocracy since 1924.\n\n"}

{"id": "39282128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39282128", "title": "International legal theories", "text": "International legal theories\n\nInternational legal theory comprises a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches used to explain and analyse the content, formation and effectiveness of public international law and institutions and to suggest improvements. Some approaches center on the question of compliance: why states follow international norms in the absence of a coercive power that ensures compliance. Other approaches focus on the problem of the formation of international rules: why states voluntarily adopt international legal norms, that limit their freedom of action, in the absence of a world legislature. Other perspectives are policy oriented; they elaborate theoretical frameworks and instruments to criticize the existing rules and make suggestions on how to improve them. Some of these approaches are based on domestic legal theory, others are interdisciplinary, while others have been developed expressly to analyse international law.\n\nMany early international legal theorists were concerned with axiomatic truths thought to be reposed in natural law. 16th century natural law writer, Francisco de Vitoria, a professor of theology at the University of Salamanca, examined the questions of the just war, the Spanish authority in the Americas, and the rights of the Native American people.\n\nHugo Grotius, a Dutch theologian, humanist and jurist played a key role in the development of modern international law. In his \"De jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres\" (\"Three Books on the Law of War and Peace\") of 1625, and drawing from the Bible and from the St. Augustine's just war theory, he argued that nations as well as persons ought to be governed by universal principle based on morality and divine justice. Drawing, though, from domestic contract law, he argued that relations among polities ought to be governed by the law of peoples, the \"jus gentium\", established by the consent of the community of nations on the basis of the principle of \"pacta sunt servanda\", that is, on the basis of the observance of commitments. On his part, Christian von Wolff, contended the international community should be a world superstate (\"civitas maxima\"), having authority over the component member states. Emmerich de Vattel rejected this view and argued instead for the equality of states as articulated by 18th century natural law. In \"Le droit des gens\", Vattel suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the basic tenets of the Grotian or eclectic school, especially the doctrines of legal equality, territorial sovereignty, and independence of states, became the fundamental principles of the European political and legal system and were enshrined in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.\n\nThe early positivist school emphasized the importance of custom and treaties as sources of international law. Early positivist scholar Alberico Gentili used historical examples to posit that positive law (\"jus voluntarium\") was determined by general consent. Another positivist scholar, Richard Zouche, published the first manual of international law in 1650.\n\nLegal positivism became the dominant legal theory of 18th century and found its way into international legal philosophy. At the time, Cornelius van Bynkershoek asserted that the bases of international law were customs and treaties commonly consented to by various states. John Jacob Moser emphasized the importance of state practice in international law. Georg Friedrich von Martens, published the first systematic manual on positive international law, \"Precis du droit des gens moderne de l'Europe\". During the 19th century, positivist legal theory became even more dominant due to nationalism and the Hegelian philosophy. International Commercial law became a branch of domestic law: private international law, separate from public international law. Positivism narrowed the range of international practice that might qualify as law, favouring rationality over morality and ethics. The 1815 Congress of Vienna marked the formal recognition of the political and international legal system based on the conditions of Europe.\n\nModern legal positivists consider international law as a unified system of rules that emanates from the states' will. International law, as it is, is an \"objective\" reality that must be distinguished from law \"as it should be.\" Classic positivism demands rigorous tests for legal validity. Extralegal arguments, i.e., arguments that have no textual, systemic or historical basis on the law, are deemed irrelevant to legal analysis. There is only hard law, no soft law. Criticisms of positivist international legal theory include its rigidity, its focus on state consent, without allowing for interpretation, and the fact that it does not allow moral judgements regarding a State's conduct as long as it follows international norms.\n\nLegal scholars have drawn from the four main schools of thought in the areas of political science and international relations: realism, liberalism, institutionalism, and constructivism to examine, through an interdisciplinary approach, the content of legal rules and institutions, to explain why and how legal institutions came to be and why they are effective. These methods have led some scholars to reconceptualize international law in general.\n\nRealism contends that, in an anarchic international system, states main objective is for survival that obligates them to maximize their relative power in order to preserve their territory and existence. Since international cooperation is possible only inasmuch as it responds to the states' self-interest in maximizing their power and prospects for survival, states do not pursue cooperation on the basis of normative commitments. According to Realist legal scholars, states adopt only international legal norms that either enhance their power, formalize the subordination of weaker states, or that they intend to violate deliberately to their own advantage. International Law may thus address only peripheral matters that do not impact the states´ power or autonomy. Consequently, for realists, international law is a \"tenuous net of breakable obligations\"\n\nWithin the Realist approach, some scholars have proposed an \"enforcement theory\" according to which international legal norms are effective insofar as they \"publicize clear rules, enhance monitoring of compliance, and institutionalize collective procedures for punishing violations, thereby enhancing the deterrent and coercive effects of a stable balance of power.\" Thus, the role of reciprocity and sanctions is underlined. Morrow, for instance, notes that:\nBased on the Liberal international relations theory, some scholars argue that the states' stance towards international law is determined by their domestic politics and, in particular, by the aggregation of the preferences of key domestic individuals and groups toward the rule of law. Thus, democratic states, having a representative government, are more likely than non-democratic states to accept the legal regulation of both domestic and international politics, and more likely to accept and observe international law. Furthermore, democratic societies are linked by a complex net of interstate, transnational and transgovernmental relations so that both their foreign policy bureaucracies and their civil societies are interested in promoting and strengthening transnational cooperation through the creation and observance of international legal norms. Hence, the adoption of and the compliance with international legal norms among democratic states should be easier and more peaceful than the observance of international law among non-democratic states. In this regard, Slaughter notes that:\nThis approach to law applies theories or economics to identify the legal implications of maximizing behavior inside and outside of markets. Economics is the study of rational choice under limited conditions. Rational choice is the assumption that individual actors seek to maximize their preferences.\nMost of the economic theory employed here is neoclassical traditional economics. Economic techniques include price theory, which evaluates strategic interaction between actors. Transaction cost economics, which incorporates cost of identifying actors, negotiating, and costs of enforcing agreements into price theory. Game Theory can demonstrate how actors with maximizing behavior might fail to take action increase join gain. Public choice applies economic tools to problems outside of markets.\nThese tools are used to describe and evaluate law. Using these tools, laws are tested for economic efficiency. Economic theories are also used to propose changes in the law. This approach urges the adoption of laws that maximize wealth.\nPotential application of this approach would begin with a text-based interpretation. A secondary concern is whether or not an actual \"market\" context is functioning well. Thirdly, ways to improve the imperfect market are proposed.\nThis approach could be used to analyze general legal questions, because this approach provides highly specified rules and provides the rationale for using them.\nThis approach relies on assumptions that perfect competition exists, and that individuals will behave to maximize their preferences. The empirical presence of these conditions is often difficult to determine.\n\nThe classic International Legal Process is the method of studying how international law is practically applied to, and functions within international policy, as well as the study of how international law can be improved. \"It concentrates not so much on the exposition of rules and their content as on how international legal rules are actually used by the makers of foreign policy\". ILP was developed in response to the \"realists from the discipline of international relations\", who realized with the beginning of the Cold War how little international law played a role in international affairs. ILP was made a legitimate theory in the 1968 casebook International Legal Process, by Chayes, Ehrlich and Lowenfeld, in which the American legal process method was adapted to create an international legal process. ILP describes the way international legal processes work, and the formal and informal ways that foreign offices incorporate international law. ILP also measures the extent to which individuals are held accountable for abuses in international conflicts. While ILP recognizes that international law does not force decision makers' actions, it suggests that international law serves as a justification, constraint, and organizing device. Criticism of ILP's lack of normative qualities in its method resulted in the emergence of a new ILP.\nThe New International Legal Process (NLP) incorporates both law as a process and as the values of each society respectively. Unlike the American Legal System, it considers normative values other than democracy, such as \"…feminism, republicanism, law and economics, liberalism as well as human rights, peace and protection to the environment.\" The NLP is unique in its flexibility in adapting to the evolution of values. This component of the method is important in order to resolve the changing of legal standards over time. The NLP\nshows its true departure from the ILP by addressing what happens in the situation of conflict, as well as what should be happening.\n\nThe New Haven School is a policy-oriented perspective on international law pioneered by Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and W. Michael Reisman. Its intellectual antecedents lie in sociological jurisprudence of Roscoe Pound and the reformist ambitions of the American Legal Realists. From the standpoint of the New Haven approach, jurisprudence is a theory about making social choices. International law itself reflects the expectations of relevant community members about stable patterns of behavior created by assertions of control by legal authorities. The primary jurisprudential and intellectual tasks are the prescription and application of policy in ways that maintain community order and simultaneously achieve the best possible approximation of the community's social goals. These normative social goals or values of the New Haven approach include maximizing shared community values, such as wealth, enlightenment, skill, well-being, affection, respect and rectitude. The teleological goal of New Haven School jurisprudence is the interpretation of international law as a system of creating minimum world public order, with continued progress toward the development of shared values into an optimum order.\n\nCritical Legal Studies (CLS) emerged as a legal theory in America during the 1970s. It exists to this day as a method of analyzing international law from a highly theoretical perspective. The method proposes that the nature of international law is limited because it is determined by language, which is biased and still stuck in the conventional structures of politics and power. Critical Legal scholars argue that those structures of power can be found within the binaries that exist in legal language (man vs. woman, majority vs. minority, etc.). Recognizing the political aspect of international law, these scholars also argue that universality is impossible. Criticism of this method suggests that this radical practice is impossible to put into application. It was successful, however, in pushing forward other approaches to international law (feminist, cultural relativist, etc.) because of its deep analysis of language, and all the imbalance that it reveals.\n\nThe central case approach is a method of looking at human rights situations. This approach recognizes the existence of certain universal rights. It begins analyzing a human rights issue by constructing a hypothetical ideal situation in which those rights are applied, a standard against which to compare an actual situation. The central case approach then investigates to what extent, and in what ways the actual situation deviates from the ideal (or the central case).\nThe central case approach allows for more complexity than the traditional binary method of analysis. In binary terms, human rights are simply violated or they are upheld. This does not allow for degrees of severity of a human rights violation, which creates a deceptively simplistic view of a situation.\n\nJohn Finnis developed the concept of a central case as it applied to assessing legal systems; Tai-Heng Cheng was the first to apply it to human rights. If used by decision-makers, the central case approach could be effective in preventing human rights abuses. It takes into account a society's political and social situations in addition to specific human rights abuses. This enables it to detect trends of human rights abuses, and the reasons behind these trends. The depth of a central case analysis exposes the different degrees of human rights abuses that occur, allowing policy makers to focus on the most severe cases and patterns of abuse with more urgency.\nThe central case approach provides an accurate and flexible picture of situations that are in a state of change. Whereas a binary appraisal would conclude whether a human right had been violated at one point in time, the central case approach can detect shifting political and social conditions and patterns that give a more nuanced view of the state of human rights.\n\nFeminist legal theory critiques current legal vocabulary and practice by arguing it is patriarchal, presenting men as the norm and women as a deviation from the norm. Feminist theorists propose to change legal language to make it more inclusive of women, or to rethink law completely, so it is possible to promote broader social goals of justice and equality. Feminist methods seek to expose the biases from which international law is written and particularly the notion that women are more vulnerable than men and need special protection under the law. Feminist theorist Hilary Charlesworth criticizes the dialogue of women as victims in need of protection from both men and international law. Additionally, she argues that the irony of the dominant language is that while it aims to especially protect women, the emphasis is on the protection of her honor and not on the protection of her social, cultural and economic rights.\n\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender/Transsexual (LGBT) International Law Theory is a critical school of thought that continues to develop as the shortcomings of international law are realized, in regard to the integration of queer theory into international law theory. While human rights conventions have recently begun to generalize in regard to equality and its recipients, in the past, any discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity have gone largely untouched. The movement of LGBT International Law Theory centers on the inclusion and awareness of LGBT rights (and protection of persons), as well as the integration of queer theory within the realm of international law.\nAs LGBT theory has become more prominent in scholarly works, international courts and international law organizations (particularly the European Union Council and the United Nations) have considered workplace discrimination on the basis of sexuality, issues stemming from the definition of family in regard to homosexual unions, the position of\ntranssexuals in the question of sexual orientation, the need for recognition of LGBT rights in regard to general health advocacy and the HIV/AIDS crisis, the inclusion of and LGBT advocacy group within the UN (with advisor status), and the ongoing active persecution of people engaging in homosexual acts, among other issues.\nAccording to scholar Nancy Levit, the challenges for gay legal theory are twofold: to move away from the frailties of both formal equality and antisubordination theories, and to develop ways of representing sexual minorities that will make them more acceptable, if not valuable, in a broader cultural context, that is the critical body of LGBT International Law Theory.\n\nThe idea of international law in Roman times is a complicated one. For, not only does the Roman Republic and following empire itself dominate a long period of time in history, but also the very debate over whether or not the term \"international law\" is an applicable term is not yet decided. Many scholars and authors define international law as \"the law governing relations between sovereign, territorial states.\"\nAny attempt to find a similar parallel in Roman law would find a logical starting point in the ius gentium (the laws of nations). The ius gentium began as a Roman recognition of like legal practices and institutions (such as slavery) that was found at that time in most states. This brand of law was in fact private law in itself and mainly dictated the way in which the Roman state was to deal with individual foreigners, not entire states. However, when citizenship was granted to all free men in the empire in 212 A.D. ius gentium ceased to cling to its original definition and instead was applied to states as a whole. Some semblance of modern international law can therefore be found in this shift. The actual extent of these origins and their relevance to modern law is a topic that has not yet been approached in any depth.\n\nThird World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL) is a critical approach to international law that is not a \"method\" in the strict sense of questioning \"what the law is\". Rather, it is an approach to law that is unified by a particular set of concerns and analytical tools with which to explore them. It is an approach that draws primarily from the history of the encounter between international law and colonized peoples. TWAIL shares many concepts with post-colonial studies, feminist theory, Critical legal studies, Marxist theory and critical race theory. TWAIL scholarship prioritizes in its study the power dynamic between the First World and Third World and the role of international law in legitimizing the subjugation and oppression of Third World peoples. TWAIL scholars try to avoid presenting the \"Third World\" as a unified, coherent place but rather use the term to indicate peoples who have the shared experience of underdevelopment and marginalization.\n\nContemporary TWAIL scholarship has it origins in works of jurists such as B. S. Chimni, Georges Abi-Saab, F. Garcia-Amador R.P. Anand, Mohammed Bedjaoui, and Taslim O. Elias. Over the years, several Western scholars have been sympathetic to the Third World's position and made important contributions to this body of scholarship, and these include, scholars such as C.H. Alexandrowicz, Richard Falk, Nico Schrijver and PJ.I.M. de Waart. David Kennedy and Martti Koskenniemi have also contributed support in their own work. TWAIL as a loose network of scholars has had several conferences thus far.\n\n\n\n"}

Smith (born 1970) is a Canadian philosopher who is currently Professor of Philosophy at Calvin College, holding the Gary & Henrietta Byker Chair in Applied Reformed Theology & Worldview. He is a notable figure associated with radical orthodoxy, a theo-philosophical movement within postmodern Christianity. His work is undertaken at the borderlands between philosophy, theology, ethics, aesthetics, science, and politics. Drawing from continental philosophy and informed by a long Augustinian tradition of theological cultural critique—from Augustine of Hippo and John Calvin to Jonathan Edwards and Abraham Kuyper—his interests are in bringing critical thought to bear on the practices of the church and the church's witness to culture, culminating in the need to interpret and understand what he has called \"cultural liturgies\".\n\nSmith was born in 1970 in Embro, Ontario. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo and Emmaus Bible College. He earned a Master of Philosophy degree in philosophical theology in 1995 at the Institute for Christian Studies where he studied under James Olthuis. He went on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1999 from Villanova University where he was advised by John D. Caputo. After teaching for a short time at Loyola Marymount University, Smith accepted his current position at Calvin College.\n\nHe currently resides in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nAs a former proponent of radical orthodoxy, Smith's claim is that it is actually \"theology\" or, more specifically, the story told by the church that is capable of countering modernism. His popular-level work largely aims at educating evangelicals regarding postmodernism and radical orthodoxy. Though he is critical of the emergent church movement, it should be said that he is at the same time sympathetic to much that could be described as part of that movement. It seems that a primary concern in his work is to expose certain postmodern philosophical claims (and certain ecclesial attempts to work with them) as not actually postmodern enough, pointing out instead that they too have accepted the agenda set by the enlightenment. This is seen in his warnings that the emergent tendency away from historic ecclesial tradition is a grave mistake, and that putting down roots, committing to a community for the long haul, and engaging the deep discourses within historic Christian orthodoxy are in fact the truly post- or counter-modern practices for the church today.\n\nGiven his training in continental philosophy and in the theology of the Reformed and Pentecostal traditions, his intellectual interests are a natural fit. Smith's research topics range from the continental philosophy of religion to urban altruism to the relationship between science and theology.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51182", "title": "Jean le Rond d'Alembert", "text": "Jean le Rond d'Alembert\n\nJean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert (; ; 16 November 1717 – 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was co-editor with Denis Diderot of the \"Encyclopédie\". D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him. The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation.\n\nBorn in Paris, d'Alembert was the natural son of the writer Claudine Guérin de Tencin and the chevalier Louis-Camus Destouches, an artillery officer. Destouches was abroad at the time of d'Alembert's birth. Days after birth his mother left him on the steps of the church. According to custom, he was named after the patron saint of the church. D'Alembert was placed in an orphanage for foundling children, but his father found him and placed him with the wife of a glazier, Madame Rousseau, with whom he lived for nearly 50 years. She gave him little encouragement. When he told her of some discovery he had made or something he had written she generally replied, \n\nDestouches secretly paid for the education of Jean le Rond, but did not want his paternity officially recognised.\n\nD'Alembert first attended a private school. The chevalier Destouches left d'Alembert an annuity of 1200 livres on his death in 1726. Under the influence of the Destouches family, at the age of twelve d'Alembert entered the Jansenist Collège des Quatre-Nations (the institution was also known under the name \"Collège Mazarin\"). Here he studied philosophy, law, and the arts, graduating as \"baccalauréat en arts\" in 1735.\n\nIn his later life, d'Alembert scorned the Cartesian principles he had been taught by the Jansenists: \"physical promotion, innate ideas and the vortices\". The Jansenists steered d'Alembert toward an ecclesiastical career, attempting to deter him from pursuits such as poetry and mathematics. Theology was, however, \"rather unsubstantial fodder\" for d'Alembert. He entered law school for two years, and was nominated \"avocat\" in 1738.\n\nHe was also interested in medicine and mathematics. Jean was first registered under the name \"Daremberg\", but later changed it to \"d'Alembert\". The name \"d'Alembert\" was proposed by Frederick the Great of Prussia for a suspected (but non-existent) moon of Venus.\n\nIn July 1739 he made his first contribution to the field of mathematics, pointing out the errors he had detected in \"Analyse démontrée\" (published 1708 by Charles-René Reynaud) in a communication addressed to the Académie des Sciences. At the time \"L'analyse démontrée\" was a standard work, which d'Alembert himself had used to study the foundations of mathematics. D'Alembert was also a Latin scholar of some note and worked in the latter part of his life on a superb translation of Tacitus, for which he received wide praise including that of Denis Diderot.\n\nIn 1740, he submitted his second scientific work from the field of fluid mechanics \"Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides\", which was recognised by Clairaut. In this work d'Alembert theoretically explained refraction.\n\nIn 1741, after several failed attempts, d'Alembert was elected into the Académie des Sciences. He was later elected to the Berlin Academy in 1746 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1748.\n\nIn 1743, he published his most famous work, \"Traité de dynamique\", in which he developed his own laws of motion.\n\nWhen the \"Encyclopédie\" was organised in the late 1740s, d'Alembert was engaged as co-editor (for mathematics and science) with Diderot, and served until a series of crises temporarily interrupted the publication in 1757. He authored over a thousand articles for it, including the famous \"Preliminary Discourse\". D'Alembert \"abandoned the foundation of Materialism\" when he \"doubted whether there exists outside us anything corresponding to what we suppose we see.\" In this way, d'Alembert agreed with the Idealist Berkeley and anticipated the transcendental idealism of Kant.\n\nIn 1752, he wrote about what is now called D'Alembert's paradox: that the drag on a body immersed in an inviscid, incompressible fluid is zero.\n\nIn 1754, d'Alembert was elected a member of the Académie des sciences, of which he became Permanent Secretary on 9 April 1772.\n\nIn 1757, an article by d'Alembert in the seventh volume of the \"Encyclopedia\" suggested that the Geneva clergymen had moved from Calvinism to pure Socinianism, basing this on information provided by Voltaire. The Pastors of Geneva were indignant, and appointed a committee to answer these charges. Under pressure from Jacob Vernes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others, d'Alembert eventually made the excuse that he considered anyone who did not accept the Church of Rome to be a Socinianist, and that was all he meant, and he abstained from further work on the encyclopaedia following his response to the critique.\n\nHe was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.\n\nD'Alembert's first exposure to music theory was in 1749 when he was called upon to review a \"Mémoire\" submitted to the Académie by Jean-Philippe Rameau. This article, written in conjunction with Diderot, would later form the basis of Rameau's 1750 treatise \"Démonstration du principe de l'harmonie\". D'Alembert wrote a glowing review praising the author's deductive character as an ideal scientific model. He saw in Rameau's music theories support for his own scientific ideas, a fully systematic method with a strongly deductive synthetic structure.\n\nTwo years later, in 1752, d'Alembert attempted a fully comprehensive survey of Rameau's works in his \"Eléments de musique théorique et pratique suivant les principes de M. Rameau\". Emphasizing Rameau's main claim that music was a mathematical science that had a single principle from which could be deduced all the elements and rules of musical practice as well as the explicit Cartesian methodology employed, d'Alembert helped to popularise the work of the composer and advertise his own theories. He claims to have \"clarified, developed, and simplified\" the principles of Rameau, arguing that the single idea of the \"\" was not sufficient to derive the entirety of music. D'Alembert instead claimed that three principles would be necessary to generate the major musical mode, the minor mode, and the identity of octaves. Because he was not a musician, however, d'Alembert misconstrued the finer points of Rameau's thinking, changing and removing concepts that would not fit neatly into his understanding of music.\n\nAlthough initially grateful, Rameau eventually turned on d'Alembert while voicing his increasing dissatisfaction with J. J. Rousseau's \"Encyclopédie\" articles on music. This led to a series of bitter exchanges between the men and contributed to the end of d'Alembert and Rameau's friendship. A long preliminary discourse d'Alembert wrote for the 1762 edition of his \"Elémens\" attempted to summarise the dispute and act as a final rebuttal.\n\nD'Alembert also discussed various aspects of the state of music in his celebrated \"Discours préliminaire\" of Diderot's \"Encyclopédie\". D'Alembert claims that, compared to the other arts, music, \"which speaks simultaneously to the imagination and the senses,\" has not been able to represent or imitate as much of reality because of the \"lack of sufficient inventiveness and resourcefulness of those who cultivate it.\" He wanted musical expression to deal with all physical sensations rather than merely the passions alone. D'Alembert believed that modern (Baroque) music had only achieved perfection in his age, as there existed no classical Greek models to study and imitate. He claimed that \"time destroyed all models which the ancients may have left us in this genre.\" He praises Rameau as \"that manly, courageous, and fruitful genius\" who picked up the slack left by Jean-Baptiste Lully in the French musical arts.\n\nD'Alembert was a participant in several Parisian salons, particularly those of Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin, of the marquise du Deffand and of Julie de Lespinasse. D'Alembert became infatuated with Mlle de Lespinasse, and eventually took up residence with her.\n\nHe suffered bad health for many years and his death was as the result of a urinary bladder illness. As a known unbeliever, D'Alembert was buried in a common unmarked grave.\n\nIn France, the fundamental theorem of algebra is known as the d'Alembert/Gauss theorem, as an error in d'Alembert's proof was caught by Gauss.\n\nHe also created his ratio test, a test to see if a series converges.\n\nThe D'Alembert operator, which first arose in D'Alembert's analysis of vibrating strings, plays an important role in modern theoretical physics.\n\nWhile he made great strides in mathematics and physics, d'Alembert is also famously known for incorrectly arguing in \"Croix ou Pile\" that the probability of a coin landing heads increased for every time that it came up tails. In gambling, the strategy of decreasing one's bet the more one wins and increasing one's bet the more one loses is therefore called \"the D'Alembert system\", a type of martingale.\n\nIn South Australia, a small inshore island in south-western Spencer Gulf was named\" Ile d'Alembert\" by the French explorer, Nicolas Baudin during his expedition to New Holland. The island is better known by the alternative English name of Lipson Island. The island is a conservation park and seabird rookery.\n\nDiderot portrayed d'Alembert in \"Le rêve de D'Alembert\" (\"D'Alembert's Dream\"), written after the two men had become estranged. It depicts d'Alembert ill in bed, conducting a debate on materialist philosophy in his sleep.\n\n\"D'Alembert's Principle\", a novel by Andrew Crumey (1996), takes its title from D'Alembert's principle in physics. Its first part describes d'Alembert's life and his infatuation with Julie de Lespinasse.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A Festschrift with responses by Cottingham, \"The Moral Life\", was published by Palgrave in 2008.\n\nCottingham was educated at Merchant Taylors’ School near London, and St John’s College, Oxford.\n\nCottingham introduced trialism as an alternative interpretation of the mind-body dualism of Descartes. Although composed of two substances, mind and body, the human being possesses distinctive attributes in its own right (including sensations, passions, emotions), and these form a third category, that cannot be reduced to thought or extension. Cottingham has also argued that Descartes’s view of animals as ‘machines’ does not have the reductionistic implications commonly supposed. Finally, Cottingham has explored the importance of Descartes as a moral philosopher, with a comprehensive picture of the good life that draws both on his scientific work (in physiology and psychology) and also on the theistic outlook that informs all his philosophy. Cottingham is co-editor and translator of the three-volume Cambridge edition of \"The Philosophical Writings of Descartes\".\n\nCottingham criticizes a putative psychological impoverishment of contemporary moral philosophy, and argues that any plausible theory of a good and integrated life for human beings needs to draw on the insights available from a broadly psychoanalytic perspective. His work on partiality defends the importance of self-concern as a central ingredient in virtue. In \"On the Meaning of Life\", he addresses the relationship between moral, aesthetic and religious modes of awareness in constituting a meaningful life. Cottingham’s more recent work in the philosophy of religion argues for the primacy of the moral and spiritual aspects of religious allegiance over theoretical and doctrinal components.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43805", "title": "McCarthyism", "text": "McCarthyism\n\nMcCarthyism is the practice in the United States of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence. The term refers to U.S. senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisconsin) and has its origins in the period in the United States known as the Second Red Scare, lasting from the late 1940s through the 1950s. It was characterized by heightened political repression as well as a campaign spreading fear of Communist influence on American institutions and of espionage by Soviet agents.\n\nWhat would become known as the McCarthy era began before McCarthy's term in 1953. Following the First Red Scare, in 1947 President Truman signed an executive order to screen federal employees for association with organizations deemed \"Totalitarian, Fascist, Communist or subversive\", or advocating \"to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.\" In 1949 a high-level State Department official was convicted of perjury in a case of espionage, and the Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb. The Korean War started the next year, raising tensions in the United States. In a speech in February 1950, Senator McCarthy presented an alleged list of members of the Communist Party working in the State Department, which attracted the press' attention. The term \"McCarthyism\" was published for the first time in a political cartoon by Herblock in the \"Washington Post\" that same year. The term has taken on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts. In the early 21st century, the term is used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries.\n\nDuring the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers; they became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, academics and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some were imprisoned. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts that were later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures, such as informal blacklists, that would come into general disrepute.\n\nThe most notable examples of McCarthyism include the so-called investigations conducted by Senator McCarthy, and the hearings conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9835 of March 21, 1947, required that all federal civil service employees be screened for \"loyalty.\" The order said that one basis for determining disloyalty would be a finding of \"membership in, affiliation with or sympathetic association\" with any organization determined by the attorney general to be \"totalitarian, Fascist, Communist or subversive\" or advocating or approving the forceful denial of constitutional rights to other persons or seeking \"to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.\"\n\nThe historical period that came to be known as the McCarthy era began well before Joseph McCarthy's own involvement in it. Many factors contributed to McCarthyism, some of them with roots in the First Red Scare (1917–20), inspired by Communism's emergence as a recognized political force and widespread social disruption in the United States related to unionizing and anarchist activities. Thanks in part to its success in organizing labor unions and its early opposition to fascism, and offering an alternative to the ills of capitalism during the Great Depression, the Communist Party of the United States increased its membership through the 1930s, reaching a peak of about 75,000 members in 1940–41. While the United States was engaged in World War II and allied with the Soviet Union, the issue of anti-communism was largely muted. With the end of World War II, the Cold War began almost immediately, as the Soviet Union installed Communist puppet régimes in areas it had occupied across Central and Eastern Europe. The United States backed anti-communist forces in Greece and China.\n\nAlthough the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs had raised the issue of Soviet espionage in 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply increased the sense of threat in the United States related to Communism. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected, and raising the stakes in the Cold War. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. Many US policy people did not fully understand the situation in China, despite the efforts of China experts to explain conditions. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China.\n\nDuring the following year, there was evidence of increased sophistication in Soviet Cold War espionage activities in the West. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 in the United States on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.\n\nOther forces encouraged the rise of McCarthyism. The more conservative politicians in the United States had historically referred to progressive reforms, such as child labor laws and women's suffrage, as \"Communist\" or \"Red plots\", trying to raise fears against such changes. They used similar terms during the 1930s and the Great Depression when opposing the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Many conservatives equated the New Deal with socialism or Communism, and thought the policies were evidence of too much influence by so-called Communist policy-makers in the Roosevelt administration. In general, the vaguely defined danger of \"Communist influence\" was a more common theme in the rhetoric of anti-Communist politicians than was espionage or any other specific activity.\nMcCarthy's involvement in these issues began publicly with a speech he made on Lincoln Day, February 9, 1950, to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. He brandished a piece of paper, which he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted as saying: \"I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.\" This speech resulted in a flood of press attention to McCarthy and helped establish his path to becoming one of the most recognized politicians in the United States.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"McCarthyism\" was in a political cartoon by \"Washington Post\" editorial cartoonist Herbert Block (aka Herblock), published on March 29, 1950. The cartoon depicted four leading Republicans trying to push an elephant (the traditional symbol of the Republican Party) to stand on a platform atop a teetering stack of ten tar buckets, the topmost of which was labeled \"McCarthyism\". Block later wrote that there was \n\"nothing particularly ingenious about the term, which is simply used to represent a national affliction that can hardly be described in any other way. If anyone has a prior claim on it, he's welcome to the word and to the junior senator from Wisconsin along with it. I will also throw in a set of free dishes and a case of soap.\"\n\nA number of anti-Communist committees, panels, and \"loyalty review boards\" in federal, state, and local governments, as well as many private agencies, carried out investigations for small and large companies concerned about possible Communists in their work force.\n\nIn Congress, the primary bodies that investigated Communist activities were the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Between 1949 and 1954, a total of 109 investigations were carried out by these and other committees of Congress.\n\nOn December 2, 1954, the United States Senate voted 65 to 22 to condemn McCarthy for \"conduct that tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute\".\n\nIn the federal government, President Harry Truman's Executive Order 9835 initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947. It called for dismissal if there were \"reasonable grounds ... for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the Government of the United States.\" Truman, a Democrat, was probably reacting in part to the Republican sweep in the 1946 Congressional election and felt a need to counter growing criticism from conservatives and anti-communists.\n\nWhen President Dwight Eisenhower took office in 1953, he strengthened and extended Truman's loyalty review program, while decreasing the avenues of appeal available to dismissed employees. Hiram Bingham, Chairman of the Civil Service Commission Loyalty Review Board, referred to the new rules he was obliged to enforce as \"just not the American way of doing things.\" The following year, J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project that built the first atomic bomb, then working as a consultant to the Atomic Energy Commission, was stripped of his security clearance after a four-week hearing. Oppenheimer had received a top-secret clearance in 1947, but was denied clearance in the harsher climate of 1954.\n\nSimilar loyalty reviews were established in many state and local government offices and some private industries across the nation. In 1958, it was estimated that roughly one out of every five employees in the United States was required to pass some sort of loyalty review. Once a person lost a job due to an unfavorable loyalty review, it could be very difficult to find other employment. \"A man is ruined everywhere and forever,\" in the words of the chairman of President Truman's Loyalty Review Board. \"No responsible employer would be likely to take a chance in giving him a job.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice started keeping a list of organizations that it deemed subversive beginning in 1942. This list was first made public in 1948, when it included 78 items. At its longest, it comprised 154 organizations, 110 of them identified as Communist. In the context of a loyalty review, membership in a listed organization was meant to raise a question, but not to be considered proof of disloyalty. One of the most common causes of suspicion was membership in the Washington Bookshop Association, a left-leaning organization that offered lectures on literature, classical music concerts and discounts on books.\n\nFBI director J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background investigations of employees were carried out by FBI agents. This was a major assignment that led to the number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases they were not even told what they were accused of.\n\nHoover's influence extended beyond federal government employees and beyond the loyalty-security programs. The records of loyalty review hearings and investigations were supposed to be confidential, but Hoover routinely gave evidence from them to congressional committees such as HUAC.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1955, the FBI operated a secret \"Responsibilities Program\" that distributed anonymous documents with evidence from FBI files of Communist affiliations on the part of teachers, lawyers, and others. Many people accused in these \"blind memoranda\" were fired without any further process.\n\nThe FBI engaged in a number of illegal practices in its pursuit of information on Communists, including burglaries, opening mail and illegal wiretaps. The members of the left-wing National Lawyers Guild were among the few attorneys who were willing to defend clients in communist-related cases, and this made the NLG a particular target of Hoover's. The office of this organization was burgled by the FBI at least fourteen times between 1947 and 1951. Among other purposes, the FBI used its illegally obtained information to alert prosecuting attorneys about the planned legal strategies of NLG defense lawyers.\n\nThe FBI also used illegal undercover operations to disrupt Communist and other dissident political groups. In 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by Supreme Court decisions that limited the Justice Department's ability to prosecute Communists. At this time he formalized a covert \"dirty tricks\" program under the name COINTELPRO. COINTELPRO actions included planting forged documents to create the suspicion that a key person was an FBI informer, spreading rumors through anonymous letters, leaking information to the press, calling for IRS audits, and the like. The COINTELPRO program remained in operation until 1971.\n\nHistorian Ellen Schrecker calls the FBI \"the single most important component of the anti-communist crusade\" and writes: \"Had observers known in the 1950s what they have learned since the 1970s, when the Freedom of Information Act opened the Bureau's files, 'McCarthyism' would probably be called 'Hooverism'.\"\n\nThe House Committee on Un-American Activities – commonly referred to as the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) – was the most prominent and active government committee involved in anti-Communist investigations. Formed in 1938 and known as the Dies Committee for Rep. Martin Dies, who chaired it until 1944, HUAC investigated a variety of \"activities,\" including those of German-American Nazis during World War II. The Committee soon focused on Communism, beginning with an investigation into Communists in the Federal Theatre Project in 1938. A significant step for HUAC was its investigation of the charges of espionage brought against Alger Hiss in 1948. This investigation ultimately resulted in Hiss's trial and conviction for perjury, and convinced many of the usefulness of congressional committees for uncovering Communist subversion.\n\nHUAC achieved its greatest fame and notoriety with its investigation into the Hollywood film industry. In October 1947, the Committee began to subpoena screenwriters, directors, and other movie industry professionals to testify about their known or suspected membership in the Communist Party, association with its members, or support of its beliefs. It was at these testimonies that what became known as \"the $64,000 question\" was asked: \"Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party of the United States?\" Among the first film industry witnesses subpoenaed by the Committee were ten who decided not to cooperate. These men, who became known as the \"Hollywood Ten\", cited the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and free assembly, which they believed legally protected them from being required to answer the Committee's questions. This tactic failed, and the ten were sentenced to prison for contempt of Congress. Two of the ten were sentenced to six months, the rest to a year.\n\nIn the future, witnesses (in the entertainment industries and otherwise) who were determined not to cooperate with the Committee would claim their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. While this usually protected them from a contempt of Congress citation, it was considered grounds for dismissal by many government and private industry employers. The legal requirements for Fifth Amendment protection were such that a person could not testify about his own association with the Communist Party and then refuse to \"name names\" of colleagues with Communist affiliations. Thus many faced a choice between \"crawl[ing] through the mud to be an informer,\" as actor Larry Parks put it, or becoming known as a \"Fifth Amendment Communist\"—an epithet often used by Senator McCarthy.\n\nIn the Senate, the primary committee for investigating Communists was the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), formed in 1950 and charged with ensuring the enforcement of laws relating to \"espionage, sabotage, and the protection of the internal security of the United States.\" The SISS was headed by Democrat Pat McCarran and gained a reputation for careful and extensive investigations. This committee spent a year investigating Owen Lattimore and other members of the Institute of Pacific Relations. As had been done numerous times before, the collection of scholars and diplomats associated with Lattimore (the so-called China Hands) were accused of \"losing China,\" and while some evidence of pro-communist attitudes was found, there was nothing to support McCarran's accusation that Lattimore was \"a conscious and articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy\". Lattimore was charged with perjuring himself before the SISS in 1952. After many of the charges were rejected by a Federal Judge and one of the witnesses confessed to perjury, the case was dropped in 1955.\n\nMcCarthy headed the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953 and 1954, and during that time used it for a number of his Communist-hunting investigations. McCarthy first examined allegations of Communist influence in the Voice of America, and then turned to the overseas library program of the State Department. Card catalogs of these libraries were searched for works by authors McCarthy deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. Yielding to the pressure, the State Department ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves \"material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.\" Some libraries actually burned the newly forbidden books.\n\nMcCarthy's committee then began an investigation into the United States Army. This began at the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but ultimately nothing came of this investigation.\n\nMcCarthy next turned his attention to the case of a U.S. Army dentist who had been promoted to the rank of major despite having refused to answer questions on an Army loyalty review form. McCarthy's handling of this investigation, including a series of insults directed at a brigadier general, led to the Army–McCarthy hearings, with the Army and McCarthy trading charges and counter-charges for 36 days before a nationwide television audience. While the official outcome of the hearings was inconclusive, this exposure of McCarthy to the American public resulted in a sharp decline in his popularity. In less than a year, McCarthy was censured by the Senate and his position as a prominent force in anti-communism was essentially ended.\n\nOn November 25, 1947 (the day after the House of Representatives approved citations of contempt for the Hollywood Ten), Eric Johnston, President of the Motion Picture Association of America, issued a press release on behalf of the heads of the major studios that came to be referred to as the Waldorf Statement. This statement announced the firing of the Hollywood Ten and stated: \"We will not knowingly employ a Communist or a member of any party or group which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States[...]\" This marked the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist. In spite of the fact that hundreds would be denied employment, the studios, producers and other employers did not publicly admit that a blacklist existed.\n\nAt this time, private loyalty-review boards and anti-communist investigators began to appear to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that were concerned about the sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations.\n\nAt such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as \"Red Channels\" and newsletters such as \"Counterattack\" and \"Confidential Information\" were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.\n\nEfforts to protect the United States from the perceived threat of Communist subversion were particularly enabled by several federal laws. The Alien Registration Act or Smith Act of 1940 made it a criminal offense for anyone to \"knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the [...] desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association\".\n\nHundreds of Communists and others were prosecuted under this law between 1941 and 1957. Eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949 in the Foley Square trial. Ten defendants were given sentences of five years and the eleventh was sentenced to three years. The defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences. In 1951, twenty-three other leaders of the party were indicted, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union. Many were convicted on the basis of testimony that was later admitted to be false. By 1957, 140 leaders and members of the Communist Party had been charged under the law, of whom 93 were convicted.\n\nThe McCarran Internal Security Act, which became law in 1950, has been described by scholar Ellen Schrecker as \"the McCarthy era's only important piece of legislation\" (the Smith Act technically predated McCarthyism). However, the McCarran Act had no real effect beyond legal harassment. It required the registration of Communist organizations with the U.S. Attorney General and established the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate possible Communist-action and Communist-front organizations so they could be required to register. Due to numerous hearings, delays and appeals, the act was never enforced, even with regard to the Communist Party of the United States itself, and the major provisions of the act were found to be unconstitutional in 1965 and 1967. In 1952, the Immigration and Nationality, or McCarran–Walter, Act was passed. This law allowed the government to deport immigrants or naturalized citizens engaged in subversive activities and also to bar suspected subversives from entering the country.\n\nThe Communist Control Act of 1954 was passed with overwhelming support in both houses of Congress after very little debate. Jointly drafted by Republican John Marshall Butler and Democrat Hubert Humphrey, the law was an extension of the Internal Security Act of 1950, and sought to outlaw the Communist Party by declaring that the party, as well as \"Communist-Infiltrated Organizations\" were \"not entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and immunities attendant upon legal bodies.\" While the Communist Control Act had an odd mix of liberals and conservatives among its supporters, it never had any significant effect.\n\nThe Act was successfully applied only twice: in 1954 it was used to prevent Communist Party members from appearing on the New Jersey state ballot, and in 1960 it was cited to deny the CPUSA recognition as an employer under New York State's unemployment compensation system. The \"New York Post\" called the act \"a monstrosity\", \"a wretched repudiation of democratic principles,\" while \"The Nation\" accused Democratic liberals of a \"neurotic, election-year anxiety to escape the charge of being 'soft on Communism' even at the expense of sacrificing constitutional rights.\"\n\nIn addition to the Federal laws and responding to the worries of the local opinion, several states enacted anti-Communist statutes.\n\nBy 1952, several states had enacted statutes against criminal anarchy, criminal syndicalism and sedition, banned from public employment or even from receiving public aid Communists and \"subversives,\" asked for loyalty oaths from public servants, and severily restricted or even banned the Communist party; in addition, six states, among them California (see California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities) had equivalents to the HUAC.\n\nSome of these states had very severe, or even extreme, laws against Communism. In 1950, Michigan enacted life imprisonment for subversive propaganda; the following year, Tennessee enacted death penalty for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. Death penalty for membership of the Communist party was discussed in Texas by Governor Allan Shivers, who described it as \"worse than murder.\"\n\nMunicipalities and counties also enacted anti-Communist ordinances: Los Angeles banned any Communist or \"Muscovite model of police-state dictatorship\" from owning any arm and Birmingham, Alabama and Jacksonville, Florida banned any Communist from being within the city's limits.\n\nMcCarthyism was supported by a variety of groups, including the American Legion and various other anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's groups such as the American Public Relations Forum and the Minute Women of the U.S.A.. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into study groups, letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate what they saw as subversion.\n\nAlthough far-right radicals were the bedrock of support for McCarthyism, they were not alone. A broad \"coalition of the aggrieved\" found McCarthyism attractive, or at least politically useful. Common themes uniting the coalition were opposition to internationalism, particularly the United Nations; opposition to social welfare provisions, particularly the various programs established by the New Deal; and opposition to efforts to reduce inequalities in the social structure of the United States.\n\nOne focus of popular McCarthyism concerned the provision of public health services, particularly vaccination, mental health care services and fluoridation, all of which were denounced by some to be communist plots to poison or brainwash the American people. Such viewpoints led to collisions between McCarthyite radicals and supporters of public health programs, most notably in the case of the Alaska Mental Health Bill controversy of 1956.\n\nWilliam F. Buckley Jr., the founder of the influential conservative political magazine \"National Review\", wrote a defense of McCarthy, \"McCarthy and his Enemies\", in which he asserted that \"McCarthyism ... is a movement around which men of good will and stern morality can close ranks.\"\n\nIn addition, as Richard Rovere points out, many ordinary Americans became convinced that there must be \"no smoke without fire\" and lent their support to McCarthyism. The Gallup poll found that at his peak in January 1954 50% of the American public supported McCarthy, while 29% had an unfavorable opinion. His support fell to 34% in June 1954. Republicans tended to like what McCarthy was doing and Democrats did not, McCarthy also has significant support from traditional Democratic ethnic groups, especially Catholics as well as many unskilled workers and small business owners. (McCarthy himself was a Catholic.) He had very little support among union activists and Jews.\n\nThose who sought to justify McCarthyism did so largely through their characterization of Communism, and American Communists in particular. Proponents of McCarthyism claimed that the CPUSA was so completely under Moscow's control that any American Communist was a puppet of the Soviet and Russian intelligence services. This view is supported by recent documentation from the archives of the KGB as well as post-war decodes of wartime Soviet radio traffic from the Venona Project, showing that Moscow provided financial support to the CPUSA and had significant influence on CPUSA policies. J. Edgar Hoover commented in a 1950 speech, \"Communist members, body and soul, are the property of the Party.\"\n\nThis attitude was not confined to arch-conservatives. In 1940, the American Civil Liberties Union ejected founding member Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, saying that her membership in the Communist Party was enough to disqualify her as a civil libertarian. In the government's prosecutions of Communist Party members under the Smith Act (see above), the prosecution case was based not on specific actions or statements by the defendants, but on the premise that a commitment to violent overthrow of the government was inherent in the doctrines of Marxism–Leninism. Passages of the CPUSA's constitution that specifically rejected revolutionary violence were dismissed as deliberate deception.\n\nIn addition, it was often claimed that the Party did not allow any member to resign, so a person who had been a member for a short time decades previously could be considered as suspect as a current member. Many of the hearings and trials of McCarthyism featured testimony by former Communist Party members such as Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, and Whittaker Chambers, speaking as expert witnesses.\n\nVarious historians and pundits have discussed alleged Soviet-directed infiltration of the U.S. government and the possible collaboration of high U.S. government officials.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of victims of McCarthy. The number imprisoned is in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs. In many cases simply being subpoenaed by HUAC or one of the other committees was sufficient cause to be fired. Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs, or were questioned by committees did in fact have a past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party.\n\nBut for the vast majority, both the potential for them to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous. After the extremely damaging \"Cambridge Five\" spy scandal (Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt, et al.), suspected homosexuality was also a common cause for being targeted by McCarthyism. The hunt for \"sexual perverts\", who were presumed to be subversive by nature, resulted in over 5,000 federal workers being fired, and thousands were harassed and denied employment. Many have termed this aspect of McCarthyism the \"Lavender scare\".\n\nHomosexuality was classified as a psychiatric disorder in the 1950s. However, in the context of the highly politicised Cold War environment, homosexuality became framed as a dangerous, contagious social disease that posed a potential threat to state security. As the family was believed to be the cornerstone of American strength and integrity, the description of homosexuals as \"sexual perverts\" meant that they were both unable to function within a family unit and presented the potential to poison the social body. This era also witnessed the establishment of widely spread FBI surveillance intended to identify homosexual government employees.\n\nThe McCarthy hearings and according \"sexual pervert\" investigations can be seen to have been driven by a desire to identify individuals whose ability to function as loyal citizens had been compromised. McCarthy began his campaign by drawing upon the ways in which he embodied traditional American values in order to become the self-appointed vanguard of social morality. Accusations of alleged homosexual behavior marked the end of McCarthy's political career.\nIn the film industry, more than 300 actors, authors and directors were denied work in the U.S. through the unofficial Hollywood blacklist. Blacklists were at work throughout the entertainment industry, in universities and schools at all levels, in the legal profession, and in many other fields. A port security program initiated by the Coast Guard shortly after the start of the Korean War required a review of every maritime worker who loaded or worked aboard any American ship, regardless of cargo or destination. As with other loyalty-security reviews of McCarthyism, the identities of any accusers and even the nature of any accusations were typically kept secret from the accused. Nearly 3,000 seamen and longshoremen lost their jobs due to this program alone.\n\nSome of the notable people who were blacklisted or suffered some other persecution during McCarthyism are listed here:\nIn 1953, Robert K. Murray, a young professor of history at Pennsylvania State University who had served as an intelligence officer in World War II, was revising his dissertation on the Red Scare of 1919–20 for publication until Little, Brown and Company decided that \"under the circumstances ... it wasn't wise for them to bring this book out.\" He learned that investigators were questioning his colleagues and relatives. The University of Minnesota press published his volume, \"Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919–1920\", in 1955.\n\nThe nation was by no means united behind the policies and activities that have come to be associated with McCarthyism. There were many critics of various aspects of McCarthyism, including many figures not generally noted for their liberalism.\n\nFor example, in his overridden veto of the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950, President Truman wrote, \"In a free country, we punish men for the crimes they commit, but never for the opinions they have.\" Truman also unsuccessfully vetoed the Taft–Hartley Act, which among other provisions denied trade unions National Labor Relations Board protection unless union leaders signed affidavits swearing they were not and had never been Communists. In 1953, after he left office, Truman criticized the current Eisenhower administration:\n\nOn June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, delivered a speech to the Senate she called a \"Declaration of Conscience\". In a clear attack upon McCarthyism, she called for an end to \"character assassinations\" and named \"some of the basic principles of Americanism: The right to criticize; The right to hold unpopular beliefs; The right to protest; The right of independent thought\". She said \"freedom of speech is not what it used to be in America\", and decried \"cancerous tentacles of 'know nothing, suspect everything' attitudes\". Six other Republican senators—Wayne Morse, Irving M. Ives, Charles W. Tobey, Edward John Thye, George Aiken, and Robert C. Hendrickson—joined Smith in condemning the tactics of McCarthyism.\nElmer Davis, one of the most highly respected news reporters and commentators of the 1940s and 1950s, often spoke out against what he saw as the excesses of McCarthyism. On one occasion he warned that many local anti-Communist movements constituted a \"general attack not only on schools and colleges and libraries, on teachers and textbooks, but on all people who think and write [...] in short, on the freedom of the mind\".\n\nIn 1952, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision in \"Adler v. Board of Education of New York\", thus approving a law that allowed state loyalty review boards to fire teachers deemed \"subversive\". In his dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote: \"The present law proceeds on a principle repugnant to our society—guilt by association.[...] What happens under this law is typical of what happens in a police state. Teachers are under constant surveillance; their pasts are combed for signs of disloyalty; their utterances are watched for clues to dangerous thoughts.\"\nOne of the most influential opponents of McCarthyism was the famed CBS newscaster and analyst Edward R. Murrow. On October 20, 1953, Murrow's show \"See It Now\" aired an episode about the dismissal of Milo Radulovich, a former reserve Air Force lieutenant who was accused of associating with Communists. The show was strongly critical of the Air Force's methods, which included presenting evidence in a sealed envelope that Radulovich and his attorney were not allowed to open.\n\nOn March 9, 1954, \"See It Now\" aired another episode on the issue of McCarthyism, this one attacking Joseph McCarthy himself. Titled \"A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy\", it used footage of McCarthy speeches to portray him as dishonest, reckless and abusive toward witnesses and prominent Americans. In his concluding comment, Murrow said:\n\nThis broadcast has been cited as a key episode in bringing about the end of McCarthyism.\n\nIn April 1954, McCarthy was also under attack in the Army–McCarthy hearings. These hearings were televised live on the new American Broadcasting Company network, allowing the public to view first-hand McCarthy's interrogation of individuals and his controversial tactics. In one exchange, McCarthy reminded the attorney for the Army, Joseph Welch, that he had an employee in his law firm who had belonged to an organization that had been accused of Communist sympathies. In an exchange that reflected the increasingly negative public opinion of McCarthy, Welch rebuked the senator: \"Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\"\n\nIn the mid- and late 1950s, the attitudes and institutions of McCarthyism slowly weakened. Changing public sentiments heavily contributed to the decline of McCarthyism. Its decline may also be charted through a series of court decisions.\n\nA key figure in the end of the blacklisting of McCarthyism was John Henry Faulk. Host of an afternoon comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He was scrutinized by AWARE, Inc., one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of communist \"disloyalty\". Marked by AWARE as unfit, he was fired by CBS Radio. Almost uniquely among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957 and finally won the case in 1962.\n\nWith this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put on notice that they were legally liable for the professional and financial damage they caused. Although some informal blacklisting continued, the private \"loyalty checking\" agencies were soon a thing of the past. Even before the Faulk verdict, many in Hollywood had decided it was time to break the blacklist. In 1960, Dalton Trumbo, one of the best known members of the Hollywood Ten, was publicly credited with writing the films \"Exodus\" and \"Spartacus\".\n\nMuch of the undoing of McCarthyism came at the hands of the Supreme Court. As Richard Rovere wrote in his biography of Joseph McCarthy, \"[T]he United States Supreme Court took judicial notice of the rents McCarthy was making in the fabric of liberty and thereupon wrote a series of decisions that have made the fabric stronger than before.\" Two Eisenhower appointees to the court—Earl Warren (who was made Chief Justice) and William J. Brennan, Jr.—proved to be more liberal than Eisenhower had anticipated, and he would later refer to the appointment of Warren as his \"biggest mistake\".\n\nIn 1956, the Supreme Court heard the case of \"Slochower v. Board of Education\". Harry Slochower was a professor at Brooklyn College who had been fired by New York City for invoking the Fifth Amendment when McCarthy's committee questioned him about his past membership in the Communist Party. The court prohibited such actions, ruling \"...we must condemn the practice of imputing a sinister meaning to the exercise of a person's constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment.[...] The privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury.\"\n\nThe 1956 \"Cole v. Young\" ruling also greatly weakened the ability to discriminate in the federal civilian workforce.\n\nAnother key decision was in the 1957 case \"Yates v. United States\", in which the convictions of fourteen Communists were reversed. In Justice Black's opinion, he wrote of the original \"Smith Act\" trials: \"The testimony of witnesses is comparatively insignificant. Guilt or innocence may turn on what Marx or Engels or someone else wrote or advocated as much as a hundred years or more ago.[...] When the propriety of obnoxious or unfamiliar view about government is in reality made the crucial issue, [...] prejudice makes conviction inevitable except in the rarest circumstances.\"\n\nAlso in 1957, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of \"Watkins v. United States\", curtailing the power of HUAC to punish uncooperative witnesses by finding them in contempt of Congress. Justice Warren wrote in the decision: \"The mere summoning of a witness and compelling him to testify, against his will, about his beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of governmental interference. And when those forced revelations concern matters that are unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the general public, the reaction in the life of the witness may be disastrous.\"\n\nIn its 1958 decision in \"Kent v. Dulles\", the Supreme Court halted the State Department from using the authority of its own regulations to refuse or revoke passports based on an applicant's communist beliefs or associations.\n\nThe political divisions McCarthyism created in the United States continue to make themselves manifest, and the politics and history of anti-Communism in the United States are still contentious. Portions of the massive security apparatus established during the McCarthy era still exist. Loyalty oaths are still required by the California Constitution for all officials and employees of the government of California (which is highly problematic for Quakers and Jehovah's Witnesses whose beliefs preclude them from pledging absolute loyalty to the state). At the federal level, a few portions of the McCarran Internal Security Act remain in effect.\n\nA number of observers have compared the oppression of liberals and leftists during the McCarthy period to recent actions against suspected terrorists, most of them Muslims. In \"The Age of Anxiety: McCarthyism to Terrorism\", author Haynes Johnson compares the \"abuses suffered by aliens thrown into high security U.S. prisons in the wake of 9/11\" to the excesses of the McCarthy era.\nSimilarly, David D. Cole has written that the Patriot Act \"in effect resurrects the philosophy of McCarthyism, simply substituting 'terrorist' for 'communist.'\"\n\nFrom the opposite pole, conservative writer Ann Coulter devotes much of her book \"\" to drawing parallels between past opposition to McCarthy and McCarthyism and the policies and beliefs of modern-day liberals, arguing that the former hindered the anti-Communist cause and the latter hinder the War on Terrorism.\nOther authors who have drawn on a comparison between current anti-terrorism policies and McCarthyism include Geoffrey R. Stone, Ted Morgan,\nand Jonah Goldberg.\n\nMcCarthyism also attracts controversy purely as a historical issue. Through declassified documents from Soviet archives and Venona project decryptions of coded Soviet messages, it has become known that the Soviet Union engaged in substantial espionage activities in the United States during the 1940s. It is also known that the Communist Party USA was substantially funded and its policies controlled by the Soviet Union, and there are accusations that CPUSA members were often recruited as spies.\n\nIn the view of some contemporary commentators, these revelations stand as at least a partial vindication of McCarthyism. Some feel that there was a genuinely dangerous subversive element in the United States, and that this danger justified extreme measures. Others, while acknowledging that there were inexcusable excesses during McCarthyism, argue that some contemporary historians of McCarthyism underplay the depth of Soviet espionage in America or the undemocratic nature of the CPUSA, the latter concern being shared by some Trotskyites who felt that they, and anti-Stalin socialists in general, were persecuted by the CPUSA.\n\nThe opposing view holds that, recent revelations notwithstanding, by the time McCarthyism began in the late 1940s, the CPUSA was an ineffectual fringe group, and the damage done to U.S. interests by Soviet spies after World War II was minimal. Historian Ellen Schrecker, herself criticised for pro-Stalinist leanings, has written, \"\"in this country,\" McCarthyism did more damage to the constitution than the American Communist Party ever did.\"\n\nSince the time of McCarthy, the word \"McCarthyism\" has entered American speech as a general term for a variety of practices: aggressively questioning a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting civil and political rights in the name of national security, and the use of demagoguery are all often referred to as \"McCarthyism\". McCarthyism can also be synonymous with the term witch-hunt, both referring to mass hysteria and moral panic.\n\nThe 1951 novel \"The Troubled Air\" by Irwin Shaw tells the story of the director of a (fictional) radio show, broadcast live at the time, who is given a deadline to investigate his cast for alleged links to communism. The novel recounts the devastating effects on all concerned.\n\nThe 1952 Arthur Miller play \"The Crucible\" used the Salem witch trials as a metaphor for McCarthyism, suggesting that the process of McCarthyism-style persecution can occur at any time or place. The play focused on the fact that once accused, a person had little chance of exoneration, given the irrational and circular reasoning of both the courts and the public. Miller later wrote: \"The more I read into the Salem panic, the more it touched off corresponding images of common experiences in the fifties.\"\n\nThe 1976 film \"The Front\" starring Woody Allen dealt with the McCarthy-era Hollywood blacklist. The film was made by those blacklisted, producer and director Martin Ritt, written by Walter Bernstein, with actors Zero Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, Michael Murphy, John Randolph, Lloyd Gough, and Joshua Shelley.\n\nThe 2005 film \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" by George Clooney starred David Strathairn as broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and contained archival footage of McCarthy.\n\n\"Guilty by Suspicion\" is a 1991 American drama film about the Hollywood blacklist, McCarthyism, and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Written and directed by Irwin Winkler, it starred Robert De Niro, Annette Bening, and George Wendt.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "97321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97321", "title": "Moral realism", "text": "Moral realism\n\nMoral realism (also ethical realism or moral Platonism) is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world (that is, features independent of subjective opinion), some of which may be true to the extent that they report those features accurately. This makes moral realism a non-nihilist form of ethical cognitivism (which accepts that ethical sentences express propositions and can therefore be evaluated as true or false) with an ontological orientation, standing in opposition to all forms of moral anti-realism and moral skepticism, including ethical subjectivism (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), error theory (which denies that any moral propositions are true); and non-cognitivism (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all). Within moral realism, the two main subdivisions are ethical naturalism and ethical non-naturalism.\n\nMany philosophers claim that moral realism may be dated back at least to Plato as a philosophical doctrine,\nand that it is a fully defensible form of moral doctrine. A survey from 2009 involving 3,226 respondents found that 56% of philosophers accept or lean towards moral realism (28%: anti-realism; 16%: other). Some notable examples of robust moral realists include David Brink, John McDowell, Peter Railton, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord, Michael Smith, Terence Cuneo, Russ Shafer-Landau, G. E. Moore, John Finnis, Richard Boyd, Nicholas Sturgeon, Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. Norman Geras has argued that Karl Marx was a moral realist. Moral realism has been studied in the various philosophical and practical applications.\n\nA delineation of moral realism into a minimal form, a moderate form, and robust form has been put forward in the literature.\n\nThe robust model of moral realism commits moral realists to three theses:\n\n\nThe minimal model, i.e. moral universalism, leaves off the metaphysical thesis, treating it as matter of contention \"among\" moral realists (as opposed to \"between\" moral realists and moral anti-realists). This dispute is not insignificant, as acceptance or rejection of the metaphysical thesis is taken by those employing the robust model as the key difference between moral realism and moral anti-realism. Indeed, the question of how to classify certain logically possible (if eccentric) views—such as the rejection of the semantic and alethic theses in conjunction with the acceptance of the metaphysical thesis—turns on which model we accept. Someone employing the robust model might call such a view \"realist non-cognitivism,\" while someone employing the minimal model might simply place such a view alongside other, more traditional, forms of non-cognitivism.\n\nThe robust model and the minimal model also disagree over how to classify moral subjectivism (roughly, the view that moral facts are not mind-independent in the relevant sense, but that moral statements may still be true). The historical association of subjectivism with moral anti-realism in large part explains why the robust model of moral realism has been dominant—even if only implicitly—both in the traditional and contemporary philosophical literature on metaethics.\n\nIn the minimal sense of realism, R. M. Hare could be considered a realist in his later works, as he is committed to the objectivity of value judgments, even though he denies that moral statements express propositions with truth-values per se. Moral constructivists like John Rawls and Christine Korsgaard may also be realists in this minimalist sense; the latter describes her own position as procedural realism. Some readings of evolutionary science such as those of Charles Darwin and James Mark Baldwin have suggested that in so far as an ethics may be associated with survival strategies and natural selection then such behavior may be associated with a moderate position of moral realism equivalent to an ethics of survival.\n\nMoral realism allows the ordinary rules of logic (modus ponens, etc.) to be applied straightforwardly to moral statements. We can say that a moral belief is \"false\" or \"unjustified\" or \"contradictory\" in the same way we would about a factual belief. This is a problem for expressivism, as shown by the Frege–Geach problem.\n\nAnother advantage of moral realism is its capacity to resolve moral disagreements: if two moral beliefs contradict one another, realism says that they cannot both be right, and therefore everyone involved ought to be seeking out the right answer to resolve the disagreement. Contrary theories of meta-ethics have trouble even formulating the statement \"this moral belief is wrong,\" and so they cannot resolve disagreements in this way.\n\nPhilippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing Stevenson's idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a \"committal in a new dimension.\" She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word \"injury.\" Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalistic fallacy?\n\nFoot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.\nSeveral criticisms have been raised against moral realism: The first is that, while realism can explain how to resolve moral conflicts, it does not explain how these conflicts arose in the first place. The widespread disagreement about what is right and wrong is puzzling if humans are assumed to have access to moral facts.\n\nThe evolutionary debunking argument suggests that because human psychology is primarily produced by evolutionary processes which do not seem to have a reason to be sensitive to moral facts, that taking a moral realist stance can only lead to moral skepticism. This undercuts the motivations for taking a moral realist stance, namely to be able to assert there are reliable moral standards.\n\nOthers are critical of moral realism because it postulates the existence of a kind of \"moral fact\" which is nonmaterial and does not appear to be accessible to empirical investigation. Moral truths cannot be observed in the same way as material facts (which are objective), so it seems odd to count them in the same category. However, such an argument may be applicable to our concepts of epistemic justification as well, possibly leading to radical skepticism, an undesirable result for the moral anti-realist as it would undercut their argument too. This criticism is also not applicable to ethical naturalism, a form of moral realism which suggests the possibility of a science of morality by considering morality claims to be referring to observable entities (such as wellbeing).\n\n"}

The book documents the author’s several near-death experiences and purported visits to Heaven between 1954 and 1956; the author’s quest to uncover a hidden past from 2003 to 2011; and the events of the author’s major NASA science discovery in 1979.\n\nDuring the time the memoir was compiled, a fifty-year-old mystery in Morabito Meyer’s life was solved. She discovered that her parents had been members of the Temple of the Abundant Life in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, run by a convicted criminal who was wanted on outstanding warrants in the United States. William Franklin Wolsey was masquerading as a Bishop in this cult, and was the target of investigative reporting by the \"Vancouver Sun\" newspaper. The author’s memories of horrific childhood abuse documented in the book, corresponded to the events reported in the news in 1959, at the time she learned about the cult in 2011. This information is summarized in the book’s epilogue. Her memories included near death experiences as a result of her parents’ involvement with William Franklin Wolsey, in which she remembers visiting Heaven and seeing Jesus. Meyer maintains that William Franklin Wolsey was responsible for the deaths of four children she witnessed. Meyer, who moved with her parents to the United States in 1961, became an astronomer and working for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on NASA’s Voyager mission to Jupiter, discovered the volcanic activity on Jupiter’s moon Io in 1979. The memoir interleaves the author’s noteworthy science, personal, and religious experiences.\n\nThe book interweaves three journeys told in the author’s words. She expresses her love of astronomy, which led her to make the discovery of the volcanic activity on Jupiter’s moon Io in 1979. The discovery is considered the largest of NASA's planetary exploration program.\n\nShe expresses the horror of a childhood marred by her parents' involvement with a Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada cult between the years of 1954 and 1956. To aid victims of childhood abuse, the author highlights a treatment used for post traumatic stress disorder.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, Linda Morabito Meyer provided an early version of the book in Amazon Kindle electronic format, with the ability for the public to update the book through Amazon.com at no charge, as Morabito Meyer’s investigation into her past was completed. The Kindle version was updated to match the final version of the book released in paperback on October 13, 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2941735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2941735", "title": "Pirzada", "text": "Pirzada\n\nA Pirzada () is historically described as official custodians of Sufi mausoleums and shrines in Muslim lands, with their earliest mentions being in Baghdad, Iraq, during the period of the Umayyad caliphate. Often a Peerzada was a descendant of those buried within the tomb they were assigned to, hence most of the Peerzadas are syeds.\n\nIt also serves as surname for their ascendants in many Indo-Aryan cultures and their accompanying languages, with Peerzada translating into “the son of a saint” in Persian. Today, predominantly-Muslim families bearing the name can be found in various regions around the world, including Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir and the northern regions of India. Much of their lineage can be traced to the central Asian plateaus, consisting of the Soviet Union’s former republics, such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Much of the modern-day Peerzada diaspora derives from the mass migration of the community from Central Asia towards several different areas immediately at a date that is estimated to be sometime during the 15th century.\n\nPirzadas found within Pakistan are most likely to belong to either the Punjabi, Siraiki, Sindhi, Haryanvi, Urdu-speaking ethnic groups, as these regions comprise Pakistan’s northernmost borders. The earliest recorded instance of the surname lays in a Mughal court official named Nur-ud-din Peerzada, who served at the Serai Nurmahal in the city of Nurmahal in Punjab, in 1693. By the time the Indian subcontinent was fully under control of the British Empire, Ehsan Peerzada ran a carpet-weaving guild in Amritsar that wove rugs for use by members of the British Royal Family, and Anglo aristocrats that resided in the British Raj, such as Sir John Lawrence, the first British governor of the Punjab province. At the time of partition of India in 1947, Peerzadas still resided primarily in the city of Amritsar, the bastion of Sikhism in the province of Punjab, with their eventual migration to the Pakistani portion of Punjab leading to their eventual spreading out over the province, albeit with a concentration of individuals in the city of Lahore.\n\nPeerzadas in Kashmir moved from Iran with Muslim missionaries to spread Islam. The family name Most of the Peerzadas in Kashmir have the suffix as Shah, Owaisi, Abtahie with there names owing to the origin in Iran. The roots of Peerzadas in Kashmir is Syed.\n\nThe origins of Peerzadas as they lay in Central Asia also translated into their presence in the realms of the former Ottoman Empire. As late as 1710, Ottoman census records indicate Peerzadas residing in Turkish municipalities such Istanbul, Denizli, Bursa, and Tokat, with their professions revolving around textiles, finance, and military service. Cüneyt Peerzada held the rank of Binbaşı, or Major, in the Kapıkulu Süvarileri, or Six Divisions of Cavalry of the Ottoman Empire, as per records from 1741. The Peerzadas of Turkey also practiced carpet-weaving in much the same fashion as their counterparts in the Indian subcontinent, with Ottoman tax receipts displaying a thriving artisan practice in Tokat as late as 1874. Today, Peerzadas, having fully assimilated into Turkish society, can be found living mainly in the country’s economical and social hubs of Istanbul and Ankara, while retaining ties with their kin in other countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan.\n\nPeerzadas were first recorded in modern-day Persia during the rule of the Qajar Dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925. Census records indicate their first presence being in the village of Urmia, close to the border with Azerbaijan, in the year 1783, although they had been a mainstay in the region for close to a century prior. Originally a farming community, Peerzadas eventually began to emerge as an astute family of financial bankers in the cities of Tehran and Qom, with tax records indicating their roles as facilitators of mercantile trade and credit among officials of the Qajar dynasty and foreigners wishing to ship their wares to Persia. Some Peerzadas eventually harnessed their financial backgrounds for the purpose of the Qajar themselves, with an upwards of six generations of the family serving as civil servants and bureaucrats for the government till the last-recorded instance of 1911. In addition, Peerzadas combined their expertise in textiles and finance in order to benefit from Isfahan’s status as the artisan hub of Islamic crafts and goods, as the family not only wove, but handled the business behind their own autonomous carpeting businesses.\n\nThe Peerzadas of Afghanistan were relatively few in number: the community never expanded beyond a few dozen patrons of a single family, although a minority of them are found in the city of Ghazni Afghanistan.\n\nPeerzadas are affiliated with Islam due to their origins in Central Asia, although there does exist a diversity in regards to the sects and subdivisions of the faith. Peerzada s found in Pakistan and Northern India sympathize with the Shia branch of Islam, while there exists a small minority of them within them who actively profess faith in the Aga Khan and subsequently the practices of the Shia Imami Ismaili Nizaris. A few belong to Sikh community.\n\nAt their core, every individual belonging to the Peerzada family comes from an Uzbek bloodline originating in Central Asia. They originally belong to the Aryan race, which is predominately found in India. They are not Semite (not a lost tribe of Jews, as thought by some historians). They are found in the footprints of Aryan peoples like, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Turkey etc.\n\nDr. Muhammad Aslam Pirzada - famous Pakistani doctor, Professor of Medicine at King Edward Medical College Lahore in post-partition years\n Yousuf Pirzada \n\nSyed Sharifuddin Pirzada (Wikipedia)\n\nSalman Pirzada http://salmanpirzada.com/salman/about.php#\n\nMuhammad Ali Pirzada\n\nAta ul Haq Qasmi (Wikipedia)\n\nMoeed Pirzada (Wikipedia)\n\nMehreen Pirzada (Wikipedia)\n"}
{"id": "261450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261450", "title": "Platonic epistemology", "text": "Platonic epistemology\n\nPlato's epistemology holds that knowledge of Platonic Ideas is innate, so that learning is the development of ideas buried deep in the soul, often under the midwife-like guidance of an interrogator. In several dialogues by Plato, the character Socrates presents the view that each soul existed before birth with the Form of the Good and a perfect knowledge of Ideas. Thus, when an Idea is \"learned\" it is actually just \"recalled\".\n\nPlato drew a sharp distinction between knowledge, which is certain, and mere true opinion, which is not certain. Opinions derive from the shifting world of sensation; knowledge derives from the world of timeless Forms, or essences. In \"The Republic\", these concepts were illustrated using the metaphor of the sun, the analogy of the divided line, and the allegory of the cave.\n\nThe \"Platonic doctrine of recollection\" or \"anamnesis\", is the idea that we are born possessing all knowledge and our realization of that knowledge is contingent on our discovery of it. Whether the doctrine should be taken literally or not is a subject of debate. The soul is trapped in the body. The soul once lived in \"Reality\", but got trapped in the body. It once knew everything, but forgot it. The goal of Recollection is to get back to true Knowledge. To do this, one must overcome the body. This doctrine implies that nothing is ever learned, it is simply recalled or remembered. In short it says that all that we know already comes pre-loaded on birth and our senses enable us to identify and recognize the stratified information in our mind.\n\nIn The Republic (507b-509c) Plato's Socrates uses the sun as a metaphor for the source of \"intellectual illumination,\" which he held to be \"The Form of the Good\". The metaphor is about the nature of ultimate reality and how we come to know it. It starts with the eye, which Socrates says is unusual among the sense organs in that it needs a medium, namely light, in order to operate. The strongest and best source of light is the sun; with it, we can discern objects clearly. Analogously for intelligible objects \"The Form of the Good\" is necessary in order to understand any particular thing. Thus, if we attempt to understand why things are as they are, and what general categories can be used to understand various particulars around us, without reference to any forms (universals) we will fail completely. By contrast, \"the domain where truth and reality shine resplendent\" is none other than Plato's world of forms—illuminated by the highest of the forms, that of the Good.\n\nIn Plato's Republic, Book VI, the divided line has two parts that represent the intelligible world and the smaller visible world. Each of those two parts is divided, the segments within the intelligible world represent higher and lower forms and the segments within the visible world represent ordinary visible objects and their shadows, reflections, and other representations. The line segments are unequal and their lengths represent \"their comparative clearness and obscurity\" and their comparative \"reality and truth,\" as well as whether we have knowledge or instead mere opinion of the objects.\n\nIn his best-known dialogue, \"The Republic\", Plato drew an analogy between human sensation and the shadows that pass along the wall of a cave - an allegory known as Plato's allegory of the cave.\n\nAlong with these other allegories, Plato's charioteer myth (Phaedrus 245c-257b) certainly also deserves mention. The ascent of the mind to celestial and trans-celestial realms is likened to a charioteer and a chariot drawn by two winged horses, one dark and one white. Figuratively represented is the famous Platonic \"tripartite model\" of the soul: the charioteer represents reason, or intellect, the dark horse appetitive passions, and the white horse irascible nature. Only by taming and controlling the two horses can the charioteer ascend to the heavens and enjoy a banquet of divine knowledge. Key epistemological features of the charioteer myth are (1) an emphasis, as with the cave allegory, upon true knowledge as ascent, (2) and the need to tame one's passionate nature to obtain true knowledge.\n\nA good example of how Plato presents the acquiring of knowledge is contained in the \"Ladder of Love\". In \"Symposium\" (210a-211b), Plato's Socrates cites the priestess Diotima as defining a \"lover\" as someone who loves and love as a desire for something that one does not have. According to this ladder model of love, a lover progresses from rung to rung from the basest love to the pure form of love as follows:\n\n\nKnowledge concerning other things is similarly gained by progressing from a base reality (or shadow) of the thing sought (red, tall, thin, keen, etc.) to the eventual form of the thing sought, or the thing sought itself. Such steps follow the same pattern as Plato's metaphor of the sun, his allegory of the cave and his divided line; progress brings one closer and closer to reality as each step explains the relative reality of the past.\n"}

It has been described as \"consensual, ethical, and responsible non-monogamy\". People who identify as polyamorous believe in an open relationship with a conscious management of jealousy; they reject the view that sexual and relational exclusivity are necessary for deep, committed, long-term loving relationships.\n\n\"Polyamory\" has come to be an umbrella term for various forms of non-monogamous, multi-partner relationships, or non-exclusive sexual or romantic relationships. Its usage reflects the choices and philosophies of the individuals involved, but with recurring themes or values, such as love, intimacy, honesty, integrity, equality, communication, and commitment.\n\nThe word \"polyamorous\" first appeared in an article by Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart, \"A Bouquet of Lovers\", published in May 1990 in \"Green Egg Magazine\", as \"poly-amorous\". In May 1992, Jennifer L. Wesp created the Usenet newsgroup \"alt.polyamory\", and the Oxford English Dictionary cites the proposal to create that group as the first verified appearance of the word. The words \"polyamory, -ous, and -ist\" were added to the OED in 2006. In 1999, Zell-Ravenheart was asked by the editor of the OED to provide a definition of the term, and had provided it for the UK version as \"the practice, state or ability of having more than one sexual loving relationship at the same time, with the full knowledge and consent of all partners involved.\"\n\nAlthough sources define polyamory as a sexual or romantic relationship involving multiple people, with the consent of all the people involved, the North American version of the OED declares it a philosophy or state, and some believe that it should be classified an orientation or identity (like sexual orientation or gender identity).\n\nThere is a cultural divide between the polyamorous and swinger communities, the former emphasizing the emotional and egalitarian aspects of plural relationships and the latter emphasizing sexual non-monogamy and emotional monogamy. A person with polyamorous relationships may also engage in swinging and other open relationships. As well, swingers occasionally develop deep emotional attachments with their sexual friends. Swingers and polyamorous people alike might engage in secret infidelities, though this is no more acceptable than in monogamy.\n\nSeparate from polyamory as a philosophical basis for relationship, are the practical ways in which people who live polyamorously arrange their lives and handle certain issues, as compared to those of a more conventional monogamous arrangement.\n\n\nBenefits of a polyamorous relationship might include:\n\nIn 1998, a Tennessee court granted guardianship of a child to her grandmother and step-grandfather after the child's mother April Divilbiss and partners outed themselves as polyamorous on MTV. After contesting the decision for two years, Divilbiss eventually agreed to relinquish her daughter, acknowledging that she was unable to adequately care for her child and that this, rather than her polyamory, had been the grandparents' real motivation in seeking custody.\n\nCompersion (or, in Britain, frubble) is an empathetic state of happiness and joy experienced when another individual experiences happiness and joy, and by members of the polyamory community in the context of polyamorous relationships. It is used to describe when a person experiences positive feelings when a lover is enjoying another relationship.\n\nThe concept of compersion within the polyamorous community was originally coined by the Kerista Commune in San Francisco, who also coined polyfidelity to describe their relational ideal.\n\nEaston and Liszt wrote that jealousy will inherently occur in open romantic relationships.\n\nIn the Cuckold/Hotwife lifestyle, compersion may include the feelings associated with \"Cuckold Angst\" this feeling is often described as anxiety, fear, happiness and fulfillment. \n\n\nBertrand Russell published \"Marriage and Morals\" in 1929, questioning contemporary notions of morality regarding monogamy in sex and marriage. This viewpoint was criticized by John Dewey.\n\nA 2003 article in \"The Guardian\" proposed six primary reasons for choosing polyamory: \n\nThe Oneida Community in the 1800s in New York (a Christian religious commune) believed strongly in a system of free love known as complex marriage, where any member was free to have sex with any other who consented. Possessiveness and exclusive relationships were frowned upon.\n\nSome people consider themselves Christian and polyamorous, but mainstream Christianity does not accept polyamory.\n\nOn August 29, 2017, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \"Nashville Statement\". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief. Among other things, it states, \"We deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship.\"\n\nSome Jews are polyamorous, but mainstream Judaism does not accept polyamory; however, Sharon Kleinbaum, the senior rabbi at Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York, has said that polyamory is a choice that does not preclude a Jewishly observant and socially conscious life. Some polyamorous Jews also point to biblical patriarchs having multiple wives and concubines as evidence that polyamorous relationships can be sacred in Judaism. An email list was founded dedicated to polyamorous Jews, called \"AhavaRaba\", which roughly translates to \"big love\" in Hebrew, and whose name echoes God's \"great\" or \"abounding\" love mentioned in the Ahava rabbah prayer.\n\nLaVeyan Satanism is critical of Abrahamic sexual mores, considering them narrow, restrictive and hypocritical. Satanists are pluralists, accepting polyamorists, bisexuals, lesbians, gays, BDSM, transgender people, and asexuals. Sex is viewed as an indulgence, but one that should only be freely entered into with consent. The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth only give two instructions regarding sex: \"Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal\" and \"Do not harm little children,\" though the latter is much broader and encompasses physical and other abuse. This has always been consistent part of CoS policy since its inception in 1966, as Peter H. Gillmore wrote in an essay supporting same-sex marriage:\n\nUnitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness, founded in 2001, has engaged in ongoing education and advocacy for greater understanding and acceptance of polyamory within the Unitarian Universalist Association. At the 2014 General Assembly, two UUPA members moved to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\" in the UUA's nondiscrimination rule, along with other amendments; the package of proposed amendments was ratified by the GA delegates.\n\nBigamy is the act of marrying one person while already being married to another, and is legally prohibited in most countries in which monogamy is the cultural norm. Some bigamy statutes are broad enough to potentially encompass polyamorous relationships involving cohabitation, even if none of the participants claim marriage to more than one partner.\n\nIn most countries, it is legal for three or more people to form and share a sexual relationship (subject sometimes to laws against homosexuality or adultery if two of the three are married). With only minor exceptions no developed countries permit \"marriage\" among more than two people, nor do the majority of countries give legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners. Individuals involved in polyamorous relationships are generally considered by the law to be no different from people who live together, or \"date\", under other circumstances. In 2017 John Alejandro Rodriguez, Victor Hugo Prada, and Manuel Jose Bermudez become Colombia's first polyamorous family to have a legally recognized relationship, though not a marriage: \"By Colombian law a marriage is between two people, so we had to come up with a new word: a special patrimonial union.\"\n\nIn many jurisdictions where same-sex couples can access civil unions or registered partnerships, these are often intended as parallel institutions to that of heterosexual monogamous marriage. Accordingly, they include parallel entitlements, obligations, and limitations. Among the latter, as in the case of the New Zealand Civil Union Act 2005, there are parallel prohibitions on civil unions with more than one partner, which is considered bigamy, or dual marriage/civil union hybrids with more than one person. Both are banned under Sections 205–206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous heterosexual marriages. As yet, there is no case law applicable to these issues.\n\nHaving multiple non-marital partners, even if married to one, is legal in most U.S. jurisdictions; at most it constitutes grounds for divorce if the spouse is non-consenting, or feels that the interest in a further partner has destabilized the marriage. In jurisdictions where civil unions or registered partnerships are recognized, the same principle applies to divorce in those contexts. There are exceptions to this: in North Carolina, a spouse can sue a third party for causing \"loss of affection\" in or \"criminal conversation\" (adultery) with their spouse, and more than twenty states in the US have laws against adultery although they are infrequently enforced. Some states were prompted to review their laws criminalizing consensual sexual activity in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Lawrence v. Texas\".\n\nAt present, the extension to multiple-partner relationships of laws that use a criterion similar to that adopted in the United Kingdom, i.e., \"married \"or living together as married\"\" remains largely untested. That is, it is not known whether these laws could treat some trios or larger groups as common-law marriages.\n\nIf marriage is intended, some countries provide for both a religious marriage and a civil ceremony (sometimes combined). These recognize and formalize the relationship. Few countries outside of Africa or Asia give legal recognition to marriages with three or more partners. While a recent case in the Netherlands was commonly read as demonstrating that Dutch law permitted multiple-partner civil unions, the relationship in question was a \"\", or \"cohabitation contract\", and not a registered partnership or marriage. The Netherlands' law concerning registered partnerships provides that\n\nAuthors have explored legalistic ramifications of polyamorous marriage. \n\nSuch endeavors, however, may be moot. In 1979, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), an international bill of rights for women, with 99 initial signatories and an eventual 189 ratifying parties. The intent is to make monogamous marriage the only legal form, worldwide, with progress monitored by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Polygamy is seen as contrary to CEDAW Article 16, which bars \"discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations.\"\n\nDuring a PinkNews question-and-answer session in May 2015, Redfern Jon Barrett questioned Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, about her party's stance towards polyamorous marriage rights. Bennett responded by saying that her party is \"open\" to discussion on the idea of civil partnership or marriages between three people. Bennett's announcement aroused media controversy on the topic and led to major international news outlets covering her answer. A follow-up article written by Barrett was published by PinkNews on May 4, 2015, further exploring the topic.\n\nPolyamory was the subject of the 2018 Louis Theroux documentary \"Love Without Limits\", where Theroux travels to Portland, Oregon to meet a number of people engaged in polyamorous relationships. Also in 2018, a web series about a black lesbian couple dealing with their relationship being newly polyamorous, called \"195 Lewis\", received the Breakthrough Series – Short Form award from the Gotham Awards. That series premiered in 2017.\n\nResearch into polyamory has been limited. A comprehensive government study of sexual attitudes, behaviors and relationships in Finland in 1992 (age 18–75, around 50% female and male) found that around 200 out of 2250 (8.9%) respondents \"agreed or strongly agreed\" with the statement \"I could maintain several sexual relationships at the same time\" and 8.2% indicated a relationship type \"that best suits\" at the present stage of life would involve multiple partners. By contrast, when asked about other relationships at the same time as a steady relationship, around 17% stated they had had other partners while in a steady relationship (50% no, 17% yes, 33% refused to answer).\n\nThe article,\"What Psychology Professionals Should Know About Polyamory\", based on a paper presented at the 8th Annual Diversity Conference in March 1999 in Albany, New York, states the following:\n\nA study by Moors et al. examined \"consensual non-monogamy\" or CNM (which includes polyamory) in the context of attachment in adults, particularly with regards to \"anxiety\" (insecurity about a partner's availability) and \"avoidance\" (discomfort with closeness). The first sample was of exclusively monogamous individuals who were not told the nature of what was being studied, and found that those with greater discomfort with emotional closeness tended to view CNM more positively as well as being more willing to engage in it (but had not \"actually\" engaged in it). The authors theorized this was \"because these relationships promote distance from their partners and support their accepting attitudes toward uncommitted and casual sex\". Individuals with high attachment anxiety tended to view CNM negatively, but no correlation was found regarding willingness to engage in it. The second sample was a targeted recruitment of individuals currently engaged in CNM relationships. This sample showed low levels of attachment avoidance, and no correlation related to attachment anxiety. The lack of correlation with anxiety in either sample with regards to willingness or actual engagement suggested it may have little impact on the matter. The large disparity in attachment avoidance between those willing to engage in CNM and those that actually engage in it could not be fully explained within the context of the study, but the authors offer several hypotheses. The study also had a few limitations, including that all subjects were heterosexual, the data was anonymous self-report and the second sample may have suffered from social desirability bias due to its targeted recruitment.\n\nIn 2002, a paper titled \"Working with polyamorous clients in the clinical setting\" (Davidson) addressed the following areas of inquiry:\n\n\nIts conclusions were that \"Sweeping changes are occurring in the sexual and relational landscape\" (including \"dissatisfaction with limitations of serial monogamy, i.e. exchanging one partner for another in the hope of a better outcome\"); that clinicians need to start by \"recognizing the array of possibilities that 'polyamory' encompasses\" and \"examine our culturally-based assumption that 'only monogamy is acceptable'\" and how this bias impacts on the practice of therapy; the need for self-education about polyamory, basic understandings about the \"rewards of the poly lifestyle\" and the common social and relationship challenges faced by those involved, and the \"shadow side\" of polyamory, the potential existing for coercion, strong emotions in opposition, and jealousy.\n\nThe paper also states that the configurations a therapist would be \"most likely to see in practice\" are individuals involved in primary-plus arrangements, monogamous couples wishing to explore non-monogamy for the first time, and \"poly singles\".\n\nA manual for psychotherapists who deal with polyamorous clients was published in September 2009 by the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom \"What Psychotherapists Should Know About Polyamory\".\n\nMichael Shernoff cites two studies in his report on same-sex couples considering nonmonogamy.\n\nMorin (1999) stated that a couple has a very good chance of adjusting to nonexclusivity if at least some of the following conditions exist:\n\nGreen and Mitchell (2002) stated that direct discussion of the following issues can provide the basis for honest and important conversations:\n\nAccording to Shernoff, if the matter is discussed with a third party, such as a therapist, the task of the therapist is to \"engage couples in conversations that let them decide for themselves whether sexual exclusivity or nonexclusivity is functional or dysfunctional for the relationship.\"\n\nPolyamory, along with other forms of consensual non-monogamy, is not without drawbacks. Morin (1999) and Fleckenstein (2014) noted that certain conditions are favorable to good experiences with polyamory, but that these differ from the general population. Heavy public promotion of polyamory can have the unintended effect of attracting people to it for whom it is not well-suited. Unequal power dynamics, such as financial dependence, can also inappropriately influence a person to agree to a polyamorous relationship against their true desires. Even in more equal power dynamic relationships, the reluctant partner may feel coerced into a proposed non-monogamous arrangement due to the implication that if they refuse, the proposer will pursue other partners anyway, will break off the relationship, or that the one refusing will be accused of intolerance.\n\nScientific studies on polyamory have also not been without bias and methodological issues. First, a significant number of studies rely on small samples that are recruited from referrals, snowball sampling, and websites devoted to polyamory. Individuals recruited this way tend to be relative homogeneous in terms of values, beliefs and demographics, which limits the generalizability of the findings. These samples also tend to be self-selecting toward individuals with positive experiences, whereas those who found polyamory to be distressing or hurtful might be more reluctant to participate in the research. A second problem is that most of the studies rely entirely on self-report measures. This is problematic because prior research has shown that self-reports of well-being and relationship satisfaction over time are flawed, and are often based on beliefs rather than actual experiences. Self-report measures are also at risk of self-enhancement bias; subjects may feel pressure to give positive responses about their well-being and relationship satisfaction in the face of stereotype threat. This disparity was noted by Moors et al. (2014), who compared respondents expressing interest in consensual non-monogamy drawn from the general population to those drawn from online communities devoted to it. In academic works involving volunteer interviews, the participant is almost always a single partner of such relationships or a small group where certain partners are not present, resulting in one-sided views being recorded about the relationship.\n\nPolyamorous relationships also can have practical pitfalls. One common complaint from participants is time management, as more partners means one must divide one's time and attention up between them, leaving less for each. Related is that the complexity of the arrangement can lead to so much effort being spent on the relationship that personal, individual needs can be overlooked. Another potential issue is lopsided power dynamics, such as one partner having significantly more resources, being more attractive or being much better at initiating new relationships, making the arrangement clearly more beneficial to that partner than the others. The strong emphasis on communication can also unintentionally marginalize partners who are less articulate. Finally, negotiating the sometimes complex rules and boundaries of these relationships can be emotionally taxing, as can reconciling situations where one partner goes outside those boundaries.\n\nA number of symbols have been created to represent polyamory. These include a parrot (a pun, as \"Polly\" is a common name for domesticated parrots) and the \"infinity heart\". The \"infinity heart\" symbol has appeared on pins, T-shirts, bumper stickers and other media.\nThe polyamory pride flag, designed by Jim Evans in 1995, has stripes of blue (representing openness and honesty among all partners), red (representing love and passion), and black (representing solidarity with those who must hide their polyamorous relationships from the outside world). In the center of the flag is a gold Greek lowercase letter 'pi', as the first letter of 'polyamory'. Gold represents \"the value that we place on the emotional attachment to others... as opposed to merely primarily physical relationships\". There is also a similar ribbon.\n\nPolyamory-related media\n\nPolyamory-related media coverage\n\nResearch and articles\n"}

In his view, a being's interests should always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties, and not according to its belonging to some abstract group. Singer studies a number of ethical issues including: race, sex, ability, species, abortion, euthanasia, infanticide, embryo experimentation, the moral status of animals, political violence, overseas aid, and whether we have an obligation to assist others.

{"id": "2372571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2372571", "title": "Representation term", "text": "Representation term\n\nA representation term is a word, or a combination of words, that semantically represent the data type (value domain) of a data element. A representation term is commonly referred to as a \"class word\" by those familiar with data dictionaries. ISO/IEC 11179-5:2005 defines \"representation term\" as a \"designation of an instance of a representation class\" As used in ISO/IEC 11179, the representation term is that part of a data element name that provides a semantic pointer to the underlying data type. A \"Representation class\" is a class of representations. This \"representation class\" provides a way to classify or group data elements.\n\nA \"Representation Term\" may be thought of as an attribute of a data element in a metadata registry that classifies the data element according to the type of data stored in the data element.\n\nRepresentation terms are typically \"approved\" by the organization or standards body using them. For example, the UN publishes its approved list as part of the UN/CEFACT Core Components Technical Specification. The Universal Data Element Framework uses a subset of CCTS representation terms and assigns numeric codes to those used.\n\nA value domain expresses the set of allowed values for a data element. The representation term (and typically the corresponding data type term) comprise a taxonomy for the value domains within a data set. This taxonomy is the representation class. Thus the representation term can be used to control proliferation of value domains by ensuring equivalent value domains use the same representation term.\n\nWhen a person or software agent is analyzing two separate metadata registries to find property equivalence, the Representation Term can be used as a guide. For example, if system A has a Data Element such as PersonGenderCode and system B has a data element such as PersonSexCode the code suffix might assist the two systems to only match data elements that have the suffix \"Code\". However, a taxonomy of property terms (i.e. \"Sex\" or \"Gender\") is much more efficient in this respect.\n\nThe Representation Term can be used in many ways to do inferences on data sets. Representation Terms tells the observer of any data stream about the data types and gives an indication of how the Data Element can be used. This is critical when mapping metadata registries to external Data Elements. For example, if you are sent a record about a person you may look for any \"ID\" suffix to understand how the remote system may differentiate two distinct records.\n\nRepresentation Terms are also used to make inferences about the requirements of a property. For example, if a data stream had Data Element PersonBirthDateAndTime you would know that BOTH the date AND time are available and relevant, not just the date. If the birth time was optional, a separate data elements should be used such as PersonBirthDate and PersonBirthTime.\n\nWhen creating a data warehouse, a business analyst looks at the Representation Terms to quickly find the dimensions and measures of a subject matter in order to build OLAP cubes. For example:\n\n\nThe joint ISO/UN Core Components Technical Specification formally define both the allowed set of representation terms and the corresponding set of data types. ISO 15000-5 is an implementation layer of ISO 11179 and normatively expresses a set of rules to semantically define conceptual and physical/logical data models for a wide variety of uses. In ISO 15000-5, the representation term provides a mechanism to harmonize the value domains of candidate data elements before being added to the overall data model(s). ISO 15000-5 is being used by a number of government, standards development organizations, and private sector as the basis for data modeling.\n\nSome informal standards such as the Universal Data Element Framework (which refer to a Representation Term as a \"Property Word\") assign unique integer IDs to each Representation Term. This allows metadata mapping tools to map one set of data elements into other metadata vocabularies. An example of these mappings can be found at Property word ID. Note that as of November 2005 the UDEF concepts have not been widely adopted.\n\nFor example, if an XML Data fragment had the following:\n\nIn the example above, the Representation terms are \"ID\" for the <PersonID>, the suffix \"Name\" for the Given and Family names, and \"Date\" for the <PersonBirthDate>.\n\nThe following are samples of Representation Terms that have been used for the exchange of electronic messages in systems such as NIEM or GJXDM 3.0: [note: the restrictions expressed here are limited to those specifications and do not represent universal consensus]\n\n\n\n[Note] This is an extremely limited set of the wide range of standards that specify the use of representation terms.\n\n\n\n"}

Dan Willard was the first to investigate their properties, and he has described a family of such systems. According to Gödel's incompleteness theorem, these systems cannot contain the theory of Peano arithmetic, and in fact, not even its weak fragment \"Robinson arithmetic\"; nonetheless, they can contain strong theorems.\n\nIn outline, the key to Willard's construction of his system is to formalise enough of the Gödel machinery to talk about provability internally without being able to formalise diagonalisation. Diagonalisation depends upon being able to prove that multiplication is a total function (and in the earlier versions of the result, addition also). Addition and multiplication are not function symbols of Willard's language; instead, subtraction and division are, with the addition and multiplication predicates being defined in terms of these. Here, one cannot prove the formula_1 sentence expressing totality of multiplication:\n\nwhere formula_3 is the three-place predicate which stands for formula_4.\nWhen the operations are expressed in this way, provability of a given sentence can be encoded as an arithmetic sentence describing termination of an analytic tableau. Provability of consistency can then simply be added as an axiom. The resulting system can be proven consistent by means of a relative consistency argument with respect to ordinary arithmetic.\n\nWe can add any true formula_5 sentence of arithmetic to the theory and still remain consistent.\n\n"}

Since it appears that Kuki's mother, Hatsu, was already pregnant when she fell in love with Okakura Kakuzō (岡倉 覚三), otherwise known as Okakura Tenshin (岡倉 天心), a protégé of her husband's (a notable patron of the arts), the rumour that Okakura was Kuki's father would appear to be groundless. It is true, however, that Shūzō as a child, after his mother had separated and then divorced his father, thought of Okakura, who often visited, as his real father, and later certainly hailed him as his spiritual father. From Okakura, he gained much of his fascination for aesthetics and perhaps foreign languages, as indeed his fascination with the peculiar cultural codes of the pleasure quarters of Japan owes something to the fact that his mother had once been a geisha.\n\nAt age 23 in 1911 (Meiji 44), Kuki converted to Catholicism; and he was baptized in Tokyo as Franciscus Assisiensis Kuki Shūzō. The idealism and introspection implied by this decision were early evidence of issues which would have resonance in the characteristic mindset of the mature man.\n\nA graduate in philosophy of Tokyo Imperial University, Kuki spent eight years in Europe to polish his knowledge of languages and deepen his already significant studies of contemporary Western thought. At the University of Heidelberg, he studied under the neo-Kantian Heinrich Rickert, and he engaged Eugen Herrigel as a tutor. At the University of Paris, he was impressed by the work of Henri Bergson, whom he came to know personally; and he engaged the young Jean-Paul Sartre as a French tutor. It is little known outside Japan that Kuki influenced Jean-Paul Sartre to develop an interest in Heidegger's philosophy.\n\nAt the University of Freiburg, Kuki studied phenomenology under Edmund Husserl; and he first met Martin Heidegger in Husserl's home. He moved to the University of Marburg for Heidegger's lectures on phenomenological interpretation of Kant, and for Heidegger's seminar \"Schelling's Essay on the Essence of Human Freedom.\" Fellow students during these years in Europe were Tetsurō Watsuji and Kiyoshi Miki.\n\nShortly after Kuki's return to Japan, he wrote and published his masterpiece, \"The Structure of \"Iki\"\" (1930). In this work he undertakes to make a phenomenological analysis of \"iki\", a variety of chic culture current among the fashionable set in Edo in the Tokugawa period, and asserted that it constituted one of the essential values of Japanese culture.\n\nKuki took up a teaching post at Kyoto University, then a prominent center for conservative cultural values and thinking. His early lectures focused on Descartes and Bergson. In the context of a faculty with a primarily Germanic philiosophical background, his lectures offered a somewhat different perspective based on the work of French philosophers.\n\nHe became an Associate Professor in 1933 (\"Shōwa\" 8); and in that same year, he published the first book length study of Martin Heidegger to appear in Japanese. In this context, it is noteworthy that the German philosopher explicitly referenced a conversation \"between a Japanese and an inquirer\" in \"On the Way to Language\" (\"Aus einem Gespräch von der Sprache\"). Also, Heidegger expressed a desire to have written the preface to the German translation of \"The Structure of \"Iki\"\"\n\nAt the University of Kyoto, Kuki was elevated to Professor of Philosophy in March 1934 (\"Shōwa\" 10). The next year, he published \"The Problem of Contingency\", also known as \"The Problem of the Accidental.\" This work was developed from his personal experiences in Europe and the influences of Heidegger. As a single Japanese man within an encompassing \"white\" or non-Japanese society, he considered the extent to which he became a being who lacked necessity. His Kyoto University lectures on Heidegger, \"Man and Existence\", were published in 1939.\n\nFrom the mid-thirties, while Japan drifted towards totalitarianism and the war in China dragged on, Kuki seemed not to be much disturbed by the growth of fascism.\n\nIn 1941, Kuki died prematurely from consequences following an attack of peritonitis.\n\n\n\n"}

It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflicts—thus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.\n\nA study published in the \"Journal of Conflict Resolution\" in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stability–instability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When a nuclear monopoly exists between two states, and their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.\n\nThis effect can be seen in the India–Pakistan relationship and to some degree in Russia–NATO relations.\n\nOne of the major assumptions in the concept of mutually assured destruction and the stability-instability phenomenon as its consequence is that all actors are rational and that this rationality implies an avoidance of complete destruction. Particularly the second part of the assumption might not necessarily be given in real-world politics. When imagining a theocratic nation whose leaders believe in the existence of an afterlife which they assume to be sufficiently better than our current life, it becomes rational for them to do everything in their power to facilitate a swift transition for as many people as possible into that afterlife. This connection between certain religious beliefs and politics of weapons of mass destruction has been pointed out by some atheists in order to point out perceived dangers of theocratic societies. \n\n"}

The Lexington Principles were completed and published on April 1, 2009. The instrument consists of 45 principles and countless annotations prepared by the project's law student editorial board. A primary purpose of the drafters of the Lexington Principles was to assist the jurisprudential evolution of American constitutional due process standards after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"Boumediene v. Bush\". While each Principle is based on international law, all provisions have been drafted to facilitate vertical norm internalization into the domestic legal system of the United States and other common law countries.\n\n\"The mission of the Lexington Principles Project is to engage the international community to clarify and strengthen transnational norms pertaining to due process of law and the treatment of persons detained on suspicion of terrorist activities, and to foster a common approach to these matters, in keeping with the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission on this subject.\".\n\nOn July 22, 2004, the 9/11 Commission issued its report on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In this report, the Commission made numerous recommendations to U.S. government officials on how to better defend the United States against the spread of international terrorism. In reference to detainee treatment standards, the Commission recommended that:\n\"(t)he United States should engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. New principles might draw upon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions on the law of armed conflict. That article was specifically designed for those cases in which the usual laws of war did not apply. Its minimum standards are generally accepted throughout the world as customary international law.\".\nThe White House responded to the 9-11 Commission's recommendation with the following statement:\n\"The United States has worked closely with its coalition partners regarding the detention and treatment of captured terrorists, and is open to exploring whether a \"common coalition approach\" is feasible and consistent with our national security.\".\nSeventeen months later the 9/11 Commission met again to grade the government's progress on implementing each of the 41 recommendations detailed in its Report. The Commission gave an \"F\" to the Commission's recommendation regarding \"Coalition Standards for Terrorist Detention.\".\n\nTo explain its issuance of a failing grade with respect to the government's compliance with this recommendation, the Commission stated that:\n\"The U.S. has not engaged in a common coalition approach to developing standards for detention and prosecution of captured terrorists. Indeed, U.S. treatment of detainees has elicited broad criticism, and makes it harder to build the necessary alliances to cooperate effectively with partners in a global war on terror.\".\nSeveral professors and alumni at Washington and Lee University sought to assist the process of implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendation by initiating a scholarly dialogue between military practitioners and legal experts aimed at identifying the high end of prevailing transnational norms pertaining to detainee treatment. They created The Lexington Principles Project and began the lengthy process of research and analysis that culminated in the publication of the Draft Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees on September 25, 2008. These draft principles were approved and published in final form on April 1, 2009 along with student-edited annotations.\n\nThe Lexington Principles Project's participants did not want simply to restate existing international norms. Many groups had already aptly performed that function and such an effort would have been redundant, and possibly even counterproductive to developing a universal approach to detainee treatment. The Lexington Principles Project therefore aimed to develop a progressive set of principles recognizing the highest standards set forth in international law and the domestic legal systems of foreign nations.\n\nTo overcome the difficulties inherent in applying international law in domestic courts, the Lexington Principles Project structured its efforts in accordance with the theory of Transnational Legal Process developed by Harold Hongju Koh, the Dean of Yale Law School. The Project's use of this approach was facilitated by the availability of the considerable transnational law resources of the Transnational Law Institute at Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nThe Transnational Legal Process approach required the group to focus on vertical process throughout all stages of norm definition. The result was the creation of an innovative conceptual framework based on the familiar common law due process paradigm. Accordingly, the bulk of detainee rights under international law are categorized into one of three groups:\n\n\nThe term \"due process\" is unique to common law legal systems, and is not generally found in the text of international human rights and humanitarian law treaties. Due process is a powerful concept at common law, so it was important for the Lexington Principles to be phrased in those terms. All of the transnational norms discovered during the lengthy research phase of the Lexington Principles Project needed to be translated into aspects of due process. This was accomplished by distilling all points of mutuality in the law governing detainee treatment under both international law and domestic U.S. law down to one central right: the right to physical liberty. Principle 1 of the Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees codified this right, and all other rights were drafted as essentially derivative of this central guarantee. \n\nPrinciple 1 states, \"Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.\".\n\nThe Transnational Incorporation Doctrine, first developed for the Lexington Principles, asserts that there are some principles of international law that are so fundamental to accepted global standards of justice that they should be implied as part the right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This is a new progressive theory that has yet to be adopted by the United States Supreme Court. The theory was constructed by the professors drafting the Lexington Principles as a means of offering modern judges a jurisprudential concept that could afford them the opportunity to recognize a host of modern human rights that have developed in legal systems around the world since the American Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. This conceptual mechanism for transnational norm internalization, if adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court, would give progressive American judges the opportunity to protect individual liberty by incorporating into the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause a variety of new and emerging human rights protections that pertain to modern American life in the Information Age. Liberty rights associated with privacy and personal autonomy in cyberspace were inconceivable in 1791 during the drafting of the original Bill of Rights. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would provide a way for courts to modernize the rights all American citizens enjoy vis-a-vis their government without the need to amend the Constitution through the cumbersome process prescribed in Article V. The formal amendment process makes meaningful change practically impossible to achieve, which is why the Lexington Principles Project crafted this new mechanism to facilitate bringing Americans rights up to the highest transnational standards.\n\nA significant ancillary consequence of the novel and still unadopted Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would be its effect on the rights afforded to non-United States persons under U.S. law. Presently, United States citizens and permanent residents are afforded full protection under the United States Constitution both at home and abroad, with limited exceptions. Persons who are not American citizens or permanent residents are afforded no protection under the U.S. Constitution outside of U.S. borders and substantially diminished rights while on U.S. soil. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine, if adopted, would change the American understanding of Constitutional rights making them \"human\" rights rather than rights tied to nationality or territorial location. \n\nSupport for this result comes from the emerging transnational trend toward universality of international human rights law. Because international human rights are universal, the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine's new interpretation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause could result in universal application of all incorporated rights regardless of nationality or physical location. With respect to these newly domesticated transnational rights, former barriers to rights recognition based on nationality and territoriality would no longer affect applicability. Any rights incorporated through the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would likely have to be universally afforded to all human beings by the U.S. government. \n\nThese new transnational rights likely would not be nearly as extensive as those offered to U.S. citizens in the United States, but at a minimum they would ensure that the most fundamental due process rights are always afforded in all instances where a human being is detained by the U.S. government for any reason anywhere in the world.\n\nPhysical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.\n\nThe fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and apply in all situations where a person has been detained by a State or its agents regardless of the reasons for, or circumstances surrounding, the detention.\n\nThe fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to the location of capture or detention.\n\nThe fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any other such criteria.\n\nEach State has the responsibility to protect the right to physical liberty for all persons within its territory or otherwise under its control except insofar as they are properly detained in accordance with Principle 1.\n\nAt a minimum, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person begins at the moment the person is detained by its agents.\n\nOnce initiated, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person continues until that individuals physical liberty is ultimately restored.\n\nTransfer of a Person to the custody of another State does not terminate the transferring States responsibility to protect the rights of the transferee. The transferring State should maintain an active interest in the rights of the transferee and seek periodic assurances that due process rights are continuously afforded until the transferees physical liberty is ultimately restored.\n\nA State's compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of persons it deprives of physical liberty is a concern of humankind and therefore should be of interest to all members of the international community.\n\nThese Principles should not be construed to diminish any human right or protection afforded by any other source of law.\n\nProcedural due process is a human right requiring that all persons be afforded notice of, and an opportunity to challenge, any State action substantially affecting their fundamental right to physical liberty in a fair and public hearing before an impartial adjudicator with the independent authority to remedy violations through direct action and without undue restrictions.\n\nDue process requires that no deprivation of liberty occur outside of a legal process designed and equipped to assess the legality of the deprivation before, after, and during the period of detention.\n\nNo State should subject any person to nonconsensual transfer from one national jurisdiction to another unless such transfer is performed pursuant to judicial process.\n\nWhen a State substantially impairs the right to physical liberty of any person it should provide that person with effective written notice of the reasons for the impairment and the procedural mechanisms through which the person may challenge the deprivation.\n\nThe required notice should be sufficient to inform the person of the laws authorizing the impairment and the nature of the evidence justifying its use in the specific case, described with sufficient particularity to allow the person to evaluate the factual and legal basis for the deprivation. If full disclosure of the evidence underlying the factual basis for the detention would result in a substantial risk of harm to individuals or national security, the detainee may be informed of the general nature of the States justification for the detention sufficient to allow the detainee to communicate relevant information to the detaining authorities which might assist them in determining whether continued detention is justified.\n\nAll persons should have the right to challenge any substantial State deprivations of their right to physical liberty before a fair and impartial decision maker with the authority to remedy undue infringements without unnecessary delay.\n\nAll persons charged with a criminal offense should be presumed innocent until proven guilty through an adjudicative process conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process.\n\nAll persons should be afforded the opportunity to participate in legal proceedings adjudicating matters directly affecting their right to physical liberty.\n\nAll persons should be afforded the opportunity to consult legal counsel before and during legal proceedings adjudicating matters pertaining to substantial deprivations of their right to physical liberty.\n\nDecision makers charged with adjudicating matters affecting a person's fundamental rights should be impartial and adequately educated to properly perform that function.\n\nAdjudicators should have the means to report their concerns regarding suspected rights violations to appropriate authorities outside of the control of the governmental entity suspected of committing the violations.\n\nImplicit in the fundamental right to due process of law is the requirement that no State should deprive any person of life, liberty, or security of person in violation of any right fundamental to accepted principles of global justice.\n\nNo State should arrest or detain any person for reasons that are arbitrary. An arrest or detention is arbitrary if it is not performed pursuant to law or if it is incompatible with the fundamental principles of global justice.\n\nNo person should be deprived of the right to physical liberty except pursuant to the rule of law. State actors should never deprive any person of physical liberty except pursuant to specific and demonstrable legal authority governed by written laws and procedures.\n\nNo State should detain any person based solely on that persons exercise of a fundamental human right.\n\nNo State should detain any person based solely on that persons nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any similar criteria.\n\nNo State should try any person for a penal offense based on acts or omissions which did not constitute a penal offense at the time they were committed.\n\nNo State should detain, try, or punish any person for an offence for which the person has already been finally convicted or acquitted.\n\nNo State should deprive any person of liberty based solely on the alleged or actual wrongdoing of a third party.\n\nExtrajudicial detention beyond the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective is inconsistent with the principles of due process. No State should detain any person outside the judicial process unless such detention is conducted in accordance with substantial procedural safeguards narrowly tailored to ensure the detention is strictly limited to the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective.\n\nAll persons should be afforded the right to return to their country of nationality or citizenship upon the cessation of detention by a foreign State.\n\nProlonged incommunicado detention is incompatible with the substantive liberty guarantees inherent in the fundamental right to due process of law.\n\nPersons subjected to prolonged detention should be allowed to communicate with their family at regular intervals, subject to the supervision of the detaining authorities, unless the State demonstrates that the denial of such communication is necessary based on a demonstrable risk to national security or the safety of any person.\n\nAll persons deprived of their liberty by the government of a foreign State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic or consular representatives of their home State as soon as practicable after the deprivation and periodically throughout the period of detention as needed to ensure they are afforded the full benefits of the protections guaranteed to foreign nationals under international law.\n\nAll persons who are refugees, stateless persons, or nationals of States without diplomatic or consular representation in the detaining State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic and consular representatives of the State which takes charge of their interests or any national or international authority whose task it is to protect such persons.\n\nAll persons subjected to prolonged deprivations of liberty should be afforded the right to periodic unmonitored communications with the physicians charged with providing their medical care in order to allow the disclosure of allegations of abuse by the detaining authorities.\n\nPhysicians charged with providing medical care for persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded a mechanism for disclosure of suspected detainee abuse to an authority outside the control of the entity committing the abuse, under conditions affording the physician adequate protection against retribution.\n\nAll persons deprived of their liberty for an extended time should be given regular access to periodicals, books, educational materials, audio programs, writing materials, and other such items intended to keep them mentally engaged, informed of world events, and to allow them to make productive use of their time while in detention.\n\nA detaining State should make the general procedures governing the operation of its detention facilities available to the public. Sensitive security information may be exempted from public disclosure, although such procedures should be subject to review through an independent mechanism within the detaining government.\n\nNo State should unduly restrict the ability of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other appropriate relief organizations to inspect detention facilities and to engage in unmonitored communication with individual detainees for the purpose of monitoring the States compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of detainees under its control.\n\nNo State should subject any person to torture, cruel treatment, biological experiments, murder, mutilation, maiming, rape, sexual abuse, or the intentional infliction of serious bodily or psychological injury.\n\nNo State should interrogate any person employing methods that have not been approved for use by law.\n\nA State employing physical interrogation methods on any person should be required to maintain records detailing the specific dates, times, and duration of each physical interrogation session and specifying all of the physical methods employed together with the written legal authorization approving their use. Such records should be maintained for a period of fifty years, and destruction of such records should be a criminal offense.\n\nAll persons subjected to physical interrogation methods by a State should be given full access to the records pertaining to such interrogations.\n\nAll persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded adequate healthcare, nutrition, and opportunities for physical exercise necessary for the maintenance of both physical and mental fitness during the period of detention.\n\nAll persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded reasonable accommodations necessary to permit religious observance in accordance with the tenets of their faith or dictates of their conscience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15869716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15869716", "title": "Truth and Method", "text": "Truth and Method\n\nTruth and Method () is a 1960 book by Hans-Georg Gadamer, his major philosophical work. In \"Truth and Method\", Gadamer deploys the concept of \"philosophical hermeneutics\" as it is worked out in Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" (1927).\n\nGadamer draws heavily on the ideas of Romantic hermeneuticists such as Friedrich Schleiermacher and the work of later hermeneuticists such as Wilhelm Dilthey. He rejects as unachievable the goal of objectivity, and instead suggests that meaning is created through intersubjective communication.\n\nGadamer's philosophical project, as explained in \"Truth and Method\", was to elaborate on the concept of \"philosophical hermeneutics\", which Heidegger in his \"Being and Time\" initiated but never dealt with at length. Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In the book Gadamer argued that \"truth\" and \"method\" were at odds with one another. He was critical of two approaches to the human sciences (\"\"). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modelled themselves on the natural sciences (and thus on rigorous scientific methods). On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approach to the humanities, represented for instance by Dilthey and Schleiermacher, which believed that correctly interpreting a text meant recovering the original intention of the author who wrote it.\n\nIn contrast to both of these positions, Gadamer argued that people have a 'historically effected consciousness' (') and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. Thus interpreting a text involves a fusion of horizons (') where the scholar finds the ways that the text's history articulates with their own background. \"Truth and Method\" is not meant to be a programmatic statement about a new 'hermeneutic' method of interpreting texts. Gadamer intended \"Truth and Method\" to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): \"My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing\".\n\n\"Truth and Method\" was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's \"Collected Works\" includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on poet Paul Celan (entitled \"Who Am I and Who Are You?\") has been considered by many—including Heidegger and Gadamer himself—as a \"second volume\" or continuation of the argument in \"Truth and Method\".\n\n\"Truth and Method\" is regarded as Gadamer's magnum opus, and has influenced many philosophers and sociologists, notably Jürgen Habermas. In reaction to Gadamer, critic E. D. Hirsch, in \"Validity and Interpretation\" (1967), reasserted a traditionalist approach to interpretation (following Dilthey and Schleiermacher), seeing—contra \"Truth and Method\"—the task of interpretation consisting of reconstructing the intentions of the original author of a text. Critic George Steiner writes that Gadamer's influential model of textual understanding is \"developed explicitly out of Heidegger's concept and practice of language.\"\n"}
