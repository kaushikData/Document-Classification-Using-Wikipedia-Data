{"id": "33404319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33404319", "title": "Argument from analogy", "text": "Argument from analogy\n\nArgument from analogy is a special type of inductive argument, whereby perceived similarities are used as a basis to infer some further similarity that has yet to be observed. Analogical reasoning is one of the most common methods by which human beings attempt to understand the world and make decisions. When a person has a bad experience with a product and decides not to buy anything further from the producer, this is often a case of analogical reasoning. It is also implicit in much of science; for instance, experiments on laboratory rats typically proceed on the basis that some physiological similarities between rats and humans entails some further similarity (e.g. possible reactions to a drug).\n\nThe process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things, and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property. The structure or form may be generalized like so:\n\nThe argument does not assert that the two things are \"large and very big\", only that they are \"similar\". The argument may provide us with \"good evidence\" for the conclusion, but the conclusion does not follow as a matter of logical necessity. Determining the strength of the argument requires that we take into consideration more than just the \"form\": the \"content\" must also come under scrutiny.\n\nSeveral affect the strength of the argument from analogy:\n\nArguments from analogy may be attacked by use of disanalogy, counteranalogy, and by pointing out unintended consequences of an analogy. In order to understand how one might go about analyzing an argument from analogy, consider the teleological argument and the criticisms of this argument put forward by the philosopher David Hume.\n\nAccording to the analogical reasoning in the teleological argument, it would be ridiculous to assume that a complex object such as a watch came about through some random process. Since we have no problem at all inferring that such objects must have had an intelligent designer who created it for some purpose, we ought to draw the same conclusion for another complex and apparently designed object: the universe.\n\nHume argued that the universe and a watch have many relevant dissimilarities; for instance, the universe is often very disorderly and random. This is the strategy of \"disanalogy\": just as the amount and variety of relevant similarities between two objects strengthens an analogical conclusion, so do the amount and variety of relevant dissimilarities weaken it. Creating a \"counteranalogy,\" Hume argued that some natural objects seem to have order and complexity — snowflakes for example — but are not the result of intelligent direction. But then just as the snowflake's order and complexity itself might not have direction, the causes of the order and complexity might. So this would be an example of disproof by begging the question. Finally, Hume provides many possible \"unintended consequences\" of the argument; for instance, given that objects such as watches are often the result of the labor of groups of individuals, the reasoning employed by the teleological argument would seem to lend support to polytheism.\n\nA false analogy is a faulty instance of the argument from analogy.\n\nAn argument from analogy is weakened if it is inadequate in any of the above respects. The term \"false analogy\" comes from the philosopher John Stuart Mill, who was one of the first individuals to engage in a detailed examination of analogical reasoning. One of Mill's examples involved an inference that some person is lazy from the observation that his or her sibling is lazy. According to Mill, sharing parents is not all that relevant to the property of laziness.\n\nA basic example:\n\"The model of the solar system is similar to that of an atom, with planets orbiting the sun like electrons orbiting the nucleus. Electrons can jump from orbit to orbit; so we should study ancient records for sightings of planets jumping from orbit to orbit.\"\n\nAnother example is:\n\nPerson A: \"I think that people can have some affection for their cultural heritage.\"\n\nPerson B: \"You're just like Hitler!\"\n\nIn the above example, Person B has evaded a reasoned discussion by tarring Person A with an irrelevant association to an idea that Hitler used.\nNo one person is identical to another to the extent that their proposals can be disparaged by a mere reference to that other person. It is a form of ad hominem: Attacking the messenger, rather than the message. The above example is also an example of Reductio ad Hitlerum and, in an online context, invokes Godwin's law.\n\n"}
{"id": "50519030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50519030", "title": "Armen Avanessian", "text": "Armen Avanessian\n\nArmen Avanessian (*1973 in Vienna) is an Austrian philosopher, literary theorist, and political theorist. He has taught at the Free University of Berlin, among other institutions, and held fellowships in the German departments of Columbia University and Yale University. His work on Speculative Realism and Accelerationism in art and philosophy has found a wide audience beyond academia.\n\nOf Armenian descent, born 1973 in Vienna, Armen Avanessian studied philosophy and political science under Jacques Rancière in Paris. He completed his dissertation, 'Phenomenology of Ironic Spirit: Ethics, Poetics, and Politics in Modernity' , under the supervision of conservative theorist Karl Heinz Bohrer at the University of Bielefeld. For several years, he worked as a free-lance journalist, journal editor (Le Philosophoire, Paris), and in the publishing industry in London.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2014, he taught in the Peter Szondi Institute for Comparative Literature at the Free University of Berlin. In 2011 he was a Visiting Fellow in the German Department at Columbia University and in 2012 in the German Department at Yale University. Since 2013, he has held visiting appointments at a number of art schools (in Nuremberg, Vienna, Basel, Copenhagen, California). In 2014, he became the chief editor at Merve Verlag, a Berlin publisher specializing in philosophy and political theory. In 2011, Armen Avanessian founded the bilingual research and publication platform Speculative Poetics that brings together philosophers, writers, and artists from across the world around the idea of a new theoretical discipline in the making.\n\nFollowing his dissertation, which had already explored phenomena at the intersection of art, politics, and philosophy, Avanessian focused on developing a new approach in literary theory and philosophy of language. Collaborating with colleagues such as Anke Hennig, he began working in 2011 on connecting new speculative-ontological approaches with twentieth-century philosophies of language, which resulted most notably in two co-written books, 'Present Tense: A Poetics' (2012, English translation 2015) and 'Metanoia: A Speculative Ontology of Language, Thinking, and the Brain' (2014, English translation forthcoming 2016). Moreover, he played a central role in bringing accelerationism into German-language political philosophy. In 2015, Wired Magazine named him an intellectual innovator, noting in particular his concern with post-capitalist ideas.\n\nAvanessian’s work has come to be situated primarily outside the academy. It includes widely discussed statements on current affairs such as the refugee crisis, numerous lectures in the international art and culture scene, as well as a large number of interviews and intellectual portraits. Beyond the classical academic mainstream, Avanessian has repeatedly managed to introduce new concepts and theoretical constellations into public discourse. These consist partly of neologisms, partly of concepts used in smaller circles, which Avanessian’s work as editor re-produces for the German-language context. Examples include “speculative realism,” “acceleration,” “Xenofeminism,” “hyperstition,” and, most recently, the concept of the “time complex: postcontemporary.” Hyperstition, moreover, is not just another concept, it also designates a method, namely the actualization in the present, from out of the future, of ideas or fictions.\n\nAvanessian’s books have been translated into several languages, including English, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, and French.\n\nAvanessian’s early publications are mostly scholarly books and essays on linguistics, semantics, and literary studies. His philosophical breakthrough came with the edited volumes on 'Speculative Realism' (Realism Now) and the German edition of the reader, '#Acceleration'. His move to Merve has emphasized his focus on editing current, not yet established philosophy, treating, in particular, questions in feminism, finance theory, and technology. He has also published books discussing the possibility of poeticizing philosophy.\n\nHis book 'Overwrite: Ethics of Knowledge, Poetics of Existence' (2015, English translation forthcoming) confronts the deplorable state of academia in an explicitly accelerationist way. Not limiting himself to mere criticism, Avanessian is constantly at work constructing alternative platforms such as the summer school he organized with Reza Negarestani and Pete Wolfendale at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, on “Emancipation as Navigation: From the Space of Reasons to the Space of Freedoms.”\n\nAvanessian’s recently intensified activity in the field of art can also be understood as that of a postcontemporary artist trying to combine speculative questions in philosophy and art and make them accessible to a larger public. To that end, he uses not only classical publication formats in print, film projects, and academic lectures but also art festivals and exhibitions. The 2015 gallery festival “Tomorrow Today / curated by_vienna” for example, was based on Avanessian’s homonymous essay and combined the work of twenty well-known curators with the idea of an actual post-capitalism. Within the framework of the ninth Berlin Biennale, Avanessian conducted a ten-day Young Curators Workshop on alternatives to the economic and political models of contemporary art.\n\nAn analogous sense of discontent with the state of political theory and practice and with the lack of efficacy of political art led to the idea of a democratic and transparent intelligence agency named DISCREET, it will be founded by Alexander Martos and Avanessian, as artist, in the course of multi-week project at the 2016 Berlin Biennale. Armen Avanessian is a regular contributor to art journals such as Spike, Texte zur Kunst, and DIS Magazine. He also writes frequently about art in philosophical contexts. For several years now, Avanessian has collaborated with the graphic artist, Andreas Töpfer, which has led to publications in print (with Merve and Sternberg Press) and on film.\n\nWith columnist Georg Diez, media theorist Paul Feigelfeld, and author Julia Zange, Armen Avanessian hosts “60 Hertz” a talk show airing every Monday on Berlin Community Radio. The show is conceived as an artistic rendering, in interviews and conversations, of everyday life in the 2010s. Episodes are usually broadcast in a mix of English and German language.\n\nWith Berlin director Christopher Roth, he has produced the film \"Hyperstition\" (2016), which draws on ontology, science fiction, and sociology to question the concept of time. Screened at several festivals in Europe and the United States, the film consists of conversations with established as well as younger philosophers such as Nick Srnicek, Elie Ayache, Ray Brassier and others.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "293380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293380", "title": "Bernardino Telesio", "text": "Bernardino Telesio\n\nBernardino Telesio (; 7 November 1509 – 2 October 1588) was an Italian philosopher and natural scientist.\nWhile his natural theories were later disproven, his emphasis on observation made him the \"first of the moderns\" who eventually developed the\nscientific method.\n\nTelesio was born of noble parentage in Cosenza, a city in Calabria, Southern Italy. He was educated in Milan by his uncle, Antonio, himself a scholar and a poet of eminence, and afterwards in Rome and Padua. His studies included all the wide range of subjects, classics, science and philosophy, which constituted the curriculum of the Renaissance savants. Thus equipped, he began his attack upon the medieval Aristotelianism which then flourished in Padua and Bologna. In 1553 he married and settled in Cosenza, becoming the founder of the Cosentian Academy. For a time he lived in the household of Alfonso III Carafa, Duke of Nocera. In 1563, or perhaps two years later, appeared his great work \"De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia\" (\"On the Nature of Things according to their Own Principles\"), which was followed by a large number of scientific and philosophical works of subsidiary importance. The heterodox views which he maintained aroused the anger of the Church on behalf of its cherished Aristotelianism, and a short time after his death his books were placed on the Index.\n\nInstead of postulating matter and form, he bases existence on matter and force. This force has two opposing elements: heat, which expands, and cold, which contracts. These two processes account for all the diverse forms and types of existence, while the mass on which the force operates remains the same. The harmony of the whole consists in this, that each separate thing develops in and for itself in accordance with its own nature while at the same time its motion benefits the rest. The obvious defects of this theory, (1) that the senses alone cannot apprehend matter itself, (2) that it is not clear how the multiplicity of phenomena could result from these two forces, thought it is no less convincing than Aristotles hot/cold, dry/wet explanation, and (3) that he adduced no evidence to substantiate the existence of these two forces, were pointed out at the time by his pupil, Patrizzi.\n\nMoreover, his theory of the cold earth at rest and the hot sun in motion was doomed to disproof at the hands of Copernicus. At the same time, the theory was sufficiently coherent to make a great impression on Italian thought. It should be mentioned, though, that his obliteration of a distinction between superlunar and sublunar physics was certainly quite prescient though not acknowledged by his successors as particularly worthy of note. When Telesio went on to explain the relation of mind and matter, he was still more heterodox. Material forces are, by hypothesis, capable of feeling; matter also must have been from the first endowed with consciousness. For consciousness exists, and could not have been developed out of nothing. This leads him to a form of hylozoism. Again, the soul is influenced by material conditions; consequently the soul must have a material existence. He further held that all knowledge is sensation (\"non-ratione sed sensu\") and that intelligence is, therefore, an agglomeration of isolated data, given by the senses. He does not, however, succeed in explaining how the senses alone can perceive difference and identity.\n\nAt the end of his scheme, probably in deference to theological prejudices, he added an element which was utterly alien, namely, a higher impulse, a soul superimposed by God, in virtue of which we strive beyond the world of sense. This divine soul is hardly a completely novel concept if viewed in the context of Averroestic or Thomasian perceptual theory.\n\nThe whole system of Telesio shows gaps in his argument, and ignorance of essential facts, but at the same time it is a forerunner of all subsequent empiricism, scientific and philosophical, and marks clearly the period of transition from authority and reason to experiment and individual responsibility.\n\nTelesio was the head of the great Southern Italian movement which protested against the accepted authority of abstract reason, and sowed the seeds from which sprang the scientific methods of Tommaso Campanella and Giordano Bruno, of Francis Bacon and René Descartes, with their widely divergent results. He, therefore, abandoned the purely intellectual sphere and proposed an inquiry into the data provided by the senses, from which he held that all true knowledge really comes (his theory of sense perception was essentially a reworking of Aristotle's theory from \"De Anima\").\n\nTelesio writes in the beginning of the Proem of the first book of the third edition of \"De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia Libri Ix\"... \"That the construction of the world and the magnitude of the bodies contained within it, and the nature of the world, is to be searched for not by reason as was done by the ancients, but is to be understood by means of observation.\" (\"Mundi constructionem, corporumque in eo contentorum magnitudinem, naturamque non-ratione, quod antiquioribus factum est, inquirendam, sed sensu percipiendam.\") This statement, found on the very first page, summarizes what many modern scholars have generally considered to be Telesian philosophy, and it often seems that many did not read any further for on the very next page he sets up his hot/cold theory of informed matter, a theory that is clearly not informed by our modern idea of observation. For Telesio, observation (\"sensu percipiendam\") is a much larger mental process than simply recording data, observation also includes analogical thought.\n\nThough Francis Bacon is generally credited nowadays with the codification of an inductive method that wholeheartedly endorses observation as the primary procedure for acquiring knowledge, he was certainly not the first to suggest that sensory perception should be the primary source for knowledge. Among natural philosophers from the Renaissance, this honor is generally bestowed upon Telesio. Bacon himself acknowledges Telesio as being \"the first of the moderns\" (\"De Telesio autem bene sentimus, atque eum ut amantem veritatis, & Scientiis utilem, & nonnullorum Placitorum emendatorem & novorum hominum primum agnoscimus.\", from Bacon's \"De principiis atque originibus\") for putting observation above all other methods for acquiring knowledge about the natural world. This frequently quoted phrase from Bacon, though, is misleading, for it oversimplifies and misrepresents Bacon's opinion of Telesio. Most of Bacon's essay is an attack on Telesio and this phrase, invariably taken out of context, has facilitated a general misconception of Telesian natural philosophy by giving to it a Baconian stamp of approval, which was far from Bacon's original intentions. Bacon sees in Telesio an ally in the fight against ancient authority, but he has little positive to say about Telesio's specific theories.\n\nWhat is perhaps most striking about \"De rerum natura\" is Telesio's attempt to mechanize as much as possible. Telesio clearly strives to explain everything in terms of matter informed by hot and cold and to keep his arguments as simple as possible. When his discussions turn to human beings he introduces an instinct of self-preservation to account for their motivations. And when he discusses the human mind and its ability to reason in the abstract about immaterial and divine topics, he adds a soul. For without a soul, all thought, by his reasoning, would be limited to material things. This would make God unthinkable and clearly this was not the case, for observation proves that people think about God.\n\nBesides \"De Rerum Natura\", he wrote:\n\n\n"}

She received a PhD in Philosophy  from Princeton University in 1989 and a Fulbright Scholarship to study in the Leibniz Archives in the University of Münster in 1984.\n\nMercer has been the Guest Professor, Seminar für Geistesgeschichte und Philosophie der Renaissance, University of Munich, 2003; gave the Ernst Cassirer Lectures at the University of Hamburg, 2006; and was visiting professor at the University of Oslo (2012-15).\n\nSome of her fellowships are from: Humboldt Foundation (1993-94), NEH (2002), Herzog August Bibliotek, the American Academy in Rome (2013), the National Humanities Center (2012), Harvard’s Villa I Tatti Library (2015), the ACLU (2015-16), and  the Folger Library (2016). In 2012, Mercer was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and in 2018-19  was chosen to be the Mildred Londa Weisman Fellow at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies. From 2004 to 2015, Mercer was the North American Editor for Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie. Her teaching awards include the 2008 Columbia College Great Teacher Award and the 2012 Mark van Doren Award, which annually recognizes a professor for her \"commitment to undergraduate instruction, as well as for humanity, devotion to truth and inspiring leadership.\" \n\nAt Columbia, Mercer has been active in interdisciplinary pursuits. From 2010-2012 and 2013-2014, she was the Chair for the Core Curriculum course, Literature Humanities, an interdisciplinary course on the masterpieces of Western literature and philosophy taken by all first-year undergraduates at Columbia College. She was the Director for the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at Columbia from 2000-2001. She has also written articles on plagiarism, Literature Humanities, and queer identity for the Columbia Daily Spectator undergraduate newspaper. She appears in Pat Blute’s Hardcore as a naughty professor, a comic comment on Literature Humanities and the Core Curriculum at Columbia.\n\nMercer began her career working primarily in early modern philosophy. Her book, \"Leibniz's Metaphysics: Its Origins and Development\" (CUP, 2001), offers a new interpretation of Leibniz's philosophical development. She has published widely on Leibniz and on the diversity and importance of early modern Platonisms. \n\nMercer has begun to devote herself more and more to contextualizing the history of philosophy. She has designed a book series, Oxford Philosophical Concepts, that enlists prominent international scholars to think creatively about the \"lives\" of concepts in the history of philosophy. As of 2018, there are more than 20 volumes in various stages of production, and 11 published. These include \"Animals, Dignity, Efficient Causation, Embodiment, Eternity, The Faculties, Memory, Moral Motivation, Pleasure, Self-Knowledge,\" and \"Sympathy\". Each of the volumes traces the historical development of central philosophical concepts and includes interdisciplinary \"reflections.\" She is also the editor of the Oxford New Histories of Philosophy series, which she launched with the late Eileen O’Neill and now co-edits with Melvin Rogers, and which \"speaks to a growing concern to broaden and reexamine philosophy’s past\". The first book in this series is titled \"Mexican Philosophy in the 20th Century\" (2017) was edited by Carlos Alberto Sanchez and Robert Eli Sanchez. Mercer has written about about the importance of inclusive history of philosophy in op-eds for the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post\".\n\nMotivated by her friend, Eileen O’Neill, she has become increasingly devoted to discovering and articulating the ideas of early modern and late medieval women. Her paper, “Descartes’ Debt to Teresa of Ávila, Or Why We Should Work on Women in the History of Philosophy,” in \"Phil Studies\", August, 2016, exposes Descartes’ debt to Teresa of Ávila. Alongside her book on the philosophy of the English philosopher, Anne Conway, she is publishing a new edition and translation of Conway’s \"Principles\", with Andrew Arlig, Marcy Lascano and Jasper Reid. Her forthcoming book, \"Feeling the Way to Truth: Women, Reason and the Development of Modern Philosophy,\" argues that historians of philosophy need to rethink core assumptions about seventeenth-century philosophy and that the writings of women play a much more significant part in that history than has been recognized.\n\nMercer's Twitter profile describes her as a \"sometimes activist.\" In 2015, she was the first Columbia University professor to teach in a prison as part of Columbia’s Justice In-Education Initiative. At Taconic Correctional Facility, she taught female prisoners texts including the Aeschylus's \"Oresteia\", Euripides's \"Medea\", Aristophanes's \"Lysistrata\", and William Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\". She has been active in the education and prison reform movements, publishing op-eds and posts in the \"Washington Post\" and other outlets about philosophy's gender bias, the history of Christianity, and the prison-industrial complex. In 2015, her post on the Columbia prison divestment campaign was publicly challenged by Jonathan Burns, director of public affairs for the Corrections Corporation of America, who accused her of making \"multiple misleading and false statements about our company.\" Mercer's response argued that \"Mr. Burns’s demand for corrections exemplifies the tortured logic of the corporation he represents.\"\n\nMercer is the founder of the Rethinking Justice initiative, which is “encouraging collaboration among philosophers and social activists to explore social issues, especially concerning criminal justice reform.” Her experience with teaching incarcerated students was featured in a nationally broadcast segment on \"CBS This Morning\" and described in her op-ed for the \"Washington Post\" and in a piece about her experience for \"Columbia News\". She has also taught in Metropolitan Detention Center, a Federal Prison in Brooklyn, which she wrote about in \"NBC Think\". Since early 2018, she has organized mini-courses that are available to the men of Metropolitan Detention Center. Each year, roughly 250 MDC men graduate from a mini-course, and a dozen professors and two dozen Columbia undergraduates take up the opportunity to teach. \n\n\n\n"}

Hitchens was the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of over 30 books, including five collections of essays on culture, politics and literature. A staple of public discourse, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded intellectual and a controversial public figure. He contributed to \"New Statesman\", \"The Nation\", \"The Weekly Standard\", \"The Atlantic\", \"London Review of Books\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\", \"Slate\", \"Free Inquiry\" and \"Vanity Fair\".\n\nHaving long described himself as a democratic socialist, Marxist and an anti-totalitarian, he broke from the political left after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left to the \"Satanic Verses\" controversy, followed by the left's embrace of Bill Clinton and the antiwar movement's opposition to NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. His support of the Iraq War separated him further. His writings include critiques of public figures Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Mother Teresa and Diana, Princess of Wales. He was the elder brother of the conservative journalist and author Peter Hitchens. He also advocated for the separation of church and state.\n\nAs an antitheist, he regarded concepts of a god or supreme being as a totalitarian belief that impedes individual freedom. He argued in favour of free expression and scientific discovery, and that it was superior to religion as an ethical code of conduct for human civilization. The dictum \"What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence\" has become known as Hitchens's razor.\n\nHitchens was born the elder of two boys in Portsmouth, Hampshire. Even when they were children Christopher never got on well with his brother Peter Hitchens, a Christian and socially conservative journalist. His parents, Eric Ernest Hitchens (1909–1987) and Yvonne Jean Hitchens (née Hickman; 1921–1973), met in Scotland when both were serving in the Royal Navy during World War II. Christopher often referred to Eric as simply the 'commander'. Eric was deployed on which took part in the sinking of the in the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943. Christopher would pay tribute to his father's contribution to the war: \"Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done.\" He also stated that \"the remark that most summed him [his father] up was the flat statement that the war of 1939 to 1945 had been 'the only time when I really felt I knew what I was doing'.\" Eric Hitchens would later work as a bookkeeper for boatbuilders, speedboat-manufacturers and at a prep school. Later in life, Hitchens identified as a secular Jew—since Judaism is matrilineal and he discovered his mother was Jewish. His mother was a 'Wren' (a member of the Women's Royal Naval Service). His father's naval career required the family to move a number of times from base to base throughout Britain and its dependencies, including to Malta, where Christopher's brother Peter was born in Sliema in 1951.\n\nHitchens attended Mount House School (now absorbed into Mount Kelly) in Tavistock, Devon, from the age of eight, followed by the independent Leys School in Cambridge. In 1967, Hitchens enrolled at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was tutored by Steven Lukes and Anthony Kenny and read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in 1970 with a third-class degree. Hitchens was 'bowled over' in his adolescence by Richard Llewellyn's \"How Green Was My Valley\", Arthur Koestler's \"Darkness at Noon,\" Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\", R. H. Tawney's critique on \"Religion and the Rise of Capitalism,\" and the works of George Orwell. In 1968, he took part in the TV quiz show \"University Challenge\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Hitchens joined the political left, drawn by disagreement over the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, racism, and oligarchy, including that of \"the unaccountable corporation\". He expressed affinity with the politically charged countercultural and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He avoided the recreational drug use of the time, saying \"in my cohort we were slightly anti-hedonistic...it made it very much easier for police provocation to occur, because the planting of drugs was something that happened to almost everyone one knew.\" Hitchens was inspired to become a journalist after reading a piece by James Cameron. Hitchens was bisexual during his younger days. He claimed to have had sexual relations with two male students at Oxford who would later become Tory ministers during the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher, although he would not reveal their names publicly.\n\nHitchens joined the Labour Party in 1965, but along with the majority of the Labour students' organisation was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called \"Prime Minister Harold Wilson's contemptible support for the war in Vietnam\". Under the influence of Peter Sedgwick, who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and Soviet dissident Victor Serge, Hitchens forged an ideological interest in Trotskyism and anti-Stalinist socialism. Shortly after, he joined \"a small but growing post-Trotskyist Luxemburgist sect\".\n\nEarly in his career Hitchens began working as a correspondent for the magazine \"International Socialism\", published by the International Socialists, the forerunners of today's British Socialist Workers Party. This group was broadly Trotskyist, but differed from more orthodox Trotskyist groups in its refusal to defend communist states as \"workers' states\". Their slogan was \"Neither Washington nor Moscow but International Socialism\".\n\nIn 1971 Hitchens went to work at the \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" where he served as a social science correspondent. Hitchens admitted that he hated the position, and was fired after six months in the job. Next he was a researcher for ITV's \"Weekend World\". In 1973 he went to work for the \"New Statesman\", where his colleagues included the authors Martin Amis, whom he had briefly met at Oxford, Julian Barnes and James Fenton, with whom he had shared a house in Oxford. Around that time, the Friday lunches began, which were attended by writers including Clive James, Ian McEwan, Kingsley Amis, Terence Kilmartin, Robert Conquest, Al Alvarez, Peter Porter, Russell Davies and Mark Boxer. At the \"New Statesman\" Hitchens acquired a reputation as a left-winger, reporting internationally from areas of conflict such as Northern Ireland, Libya, and Iraq.\n\nIn November 1973, while in Greece, Hitchens reported on the constitutional crisis of the military junta. It became his first leading article for the \"New Statesman\". In December 1977, Hitchens interviewed Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, a conversation he later described as \"horrifying\". In 1977, unhappy at the \"New Statesman\", Hitchens defected to the \"Daily Express\" where he became a foreign correspondent. He returned to the \"New Statesman\" in 1979 where he became foreign editor.\n\nHitchens went to the United States in 1981 as part of an editor exchange programme between the \"New Statesman\" and \"The Nation\". After joining \"The Nation\", he penned vociferous critiques of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and American foreign policy in South and Central America. He became a contributing editor of \"Vanity Fair\" in 1992, writing ten columns a year. He left \"The Nation\" in 2002 after profoundly disagreeing with other contributors over the Iraq War. There is speculation that Hitchens was the inspiration for Tom Wolfe's character Peter Fallow in the 1987 novel \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\", but others—including Hitchens—believe it to be \"Spy Magazine\"s \"Ironman Nightlife Decathlete\", Anthony Haden-Guest. In 1987, Hitchens's father died from cancer of the oesophagus, the same disease that would later claim his own life. In April 2007, Hitchens became a US citizen; he later stated that he saw himself as Anglo-American.\n\nHe became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. At \"Slate\", he usually wrote under the news-and-politics column \"Fighting Words\".\n\nHitchens spent part of his early career in journalism as a foreign correspondent in Cyprus. Through his work there he met his first wife Eleni Meleagrou, a Greek Cypriot, with whom he had two children, Alexander and Sophia. His son, Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, born in 1984, has worked as a policy researcher in London. Hitchens continued writing essay-style correspondence pieces from a variety of locales, including Chad, Uganda and the Darfur region of Sudan. In 1991, he received a Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction.\n\nHitchens met Carol Blue in Los Angeles in 1989 and they married in 1991. Hitchens called it love at first sight. In 1999, Hitchens and Blue, both harsh critics of President Clinton, submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Therein they swore that their then friend Sidney Blumenthal had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker. This allegation contradicted Blumenthal's own sworn deposition in the trial, and it resulted in a hostile exchange of opinion in the public sphere between Hitchens and Blumenthal. Following the publication of Blumenthal's \"The Clinton Wars,\" Hitchens wrote several pieces in which he accused Blumenthal of manipulating the facts. The incident ended their friendship and sparked a personal crisis for Hitchens, who was stridently criticised by friends for what they saw as a cynical and ultimately politically futile act.\n\nBefore Hitchens's political shift, the American author and polemicist Gore Vidal was apt to speak of Hitchens as his \"dauphin\" or \"heir\". In 2010, Hitchens attacked Vidal in a \"Vanity Fair\" piece headlined \"Vidal Loco\", calling him a \"crackpot\" for his adoption of 9/11 conspiracy theories. On the back of Hitchens's memoir \"Hitch-22,\" among the praise from notable figures, Vidal's endorsement of Hitchens as his successor is crossed out in red and annotated \"NO, C.H.\" Hitchens's strong advocacy of the war in Iraq gained him a wider readership, and in September 2005 he was named as fifth on the list of the \"Top 100 Public Intellectuals\" by \"Foreign Policy\" and \"Prospect\" magazines. An online poll ranked the 100 intellectuals, but the magazines noted that the rankings of Hitchens (5), Noam Chomsky (1), and Abdolkarim Soroush (15) were partly due to their respective supporters' publicising of the vote. Hitchens later responded to his ranking with a few articles about his status as such.\n\nHitchens did not leave his position writing for \"The Nation\" until after the September 11 attacks, stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position \"that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden\". The 11 September attacks \"exhilarated\" him, bringing into focus \"a battle between everything I love and everything I hate\" and strengthening his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy that challenged \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insisted he was not \"a conservative of any kind\", and his friend Ian McEwan described him as representing the anti-totalitarian left. Hitchens recalls in his memoir having been \"invited by Bernard-Henri Levy to write an essay on political reconsiderations for his magazine \"La Regle du Jeu\". I gave it the partly ironic title: 'Can One Be a Neoconservative?' Impatient with this, some copy editor put it on the cover as 'How I Became a Neoconservative.' Perhaps this was an instance of the Cartesian principle as opposed to the English empiricist one: It was decided that I evidently was what I apparently only thought.\" Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he \"still [thought] like a Marxist\" and considered himself \"a leftist.\"\n\nIn 2007, Hitchens's work for \"Vanity Fair\" won the National Magazine Award in the category \"Columns and Commentary\".\nHe was a finalist in the same category in 2008 for some of his columns in \"Slate\" but lost out to Matt Taibbi of \"Rolling Stone\".\nHe won the National Magazine Award for Columns about Cancer in 2011. Hitchens also served on the Advisory Board of Secular Coalition for America and offered advice to the Coalition on the acceptance and inclusion of nontheism in American life. In December 2011, prior to his death, Asteroid 57901 Hitchens was named after him.\n\nHitchens wrote a monthly essay in \"The Atlantic\" and occasionally contributed to other literary journals. One of his books, \"Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere\", collected these works. In \"Why Orwell Matters\", he defends Orwell's writings against modern critics as relevant today and progressive for his time. In the 2008 book \"Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left\", many literary critiques are included of essays and other books of writers, such as David Horowitz and Edward Said.\n\nDuring a three-hour \"In Depth\" interview on \"Book TV\", he named authors who influenced his views, including Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis, P. G. Wodehouse and Conor Cruise O'Brien.\n\nIn 2009 Hitchens was listed by \"Forbes\" magazine as one of the \"25 most influential liberals in the U.S. media\". The same article noted, however, that he would \"likely be aghast to find himself on this list\", as it reduces his self-styled radicalism to mere liberalism. Hitchens's political perspectives also appear in his wide-ranging writings, which include many dialogues. He said of objectivism, \"I have always found it quaint, and rather touching, that there is a movement in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough.\"\n\nWhile Hitchens supported Israel's right to exist, he was critical of the Israeli government's handling of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Having long described himself as a socialist and a Marxist, Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left to the controversy over \"The Satanic Verses\", followed by the left's embrace of Bill Clinton, and the antiwar movement's opposition to NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. He later became a liberal hawk and supported the War on Terror, but he had some reservation, such as his characterization of waterboarding as torture after voluntarily undergoing the procedure. In January 2006, he joined with four other individuals and four organizations, including the ACLU and Greenpeace, as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, \"ACLU v. NSA\", challenging Bush's NSA warrantless surveillance; the lawsuit was filed by the ACLU.\n\nHitchens wrote book-length biographical essays on Thomas Jefferson (\"\"), Thomas Paine (\"\") and George Orwell (\"Why Orwell Matters\"). He also became known for his excoriating critiques of public contemporary figures including Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton and Henry Kissinger, the subjects of three full-length texts: \"\", \"\", and \"The Trial of Henry Kissinger\" respectively. In 2007, while promoting his book \"God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything\", Hitchens described the Christian evangelist Billy Graham as \"a self-conscious fraud\" and \"a disgustingly evil man\". Hitchens claimed that the evangelist, who had recently been hospitalized for intestinal bleeding, made a living by \"going around spouting lies to young people. What a horrible career. I gather it's soon to be over. I certainly hope so.\"\n\nIn response to the comments, writers Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy published an article in \"Time Magazine\" in which, among other things, they refuted Hitchens's suggestion that Graham went into ministry to make money. They argued that during his career Graham 'turn[ed] down million-dollar television and Hollywood offers'. They also pointed out that having established the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in 1950, Graham drew a straight salary, comparable to that of a senior minister, irrespective of the money raised by his meetings.\n\nHitchens was an antitheist, and said that a person \"could be an atheist and wish that belief in God were correct\", but that \"an antitheist, a term I'm trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there's no evidence for such an assertion.\" He often spoke against the Abrahamic religions. In a 2010 interview at New York Public Library, Hitchens stated that he was against infant circumcision. When asked by readers of \"The Independent\" (London) what he considered to be the \"axis of evil\", Hitchens replied \"Christianity, Judaism, Islam—the three leading monotheisms\".\n\nIn his bestseller \"God Is Not Great\", Hitchens expanded his criticism to include all religions, including those rarely criticised by Western secularists, such as Buddhism and neo-paganism.\nHitchens said that organised religion is \"the main source of hatred in the world\", calling it \"[v]iolent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: [it] ought to have a great deal on its conscience\". Hitchens therefore says in \"God Is Not Great\" that humanity is in need of a renewed Enlightenment. The book received mixed responses, ranging from praise in \"The New York Times\" for his \"logical flourishes and conundrums\" to accusations of \"intellectual and moral shabbiness\" in the \"Financial Times\". \"God Is Not Great\" was nominated for a National Book Award on 10 October 2007.\n\n\"God Is Not Great\" affirmed Hitchens's position in the \"New Atheism\" movement. Hitchens was made an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist International and the National Secular Society shortly after its release, and he was later named to the Honorary Board of distinguished achievers of the Freedom From Religion Foundation. He also joined the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America, a group of atheists and humanists. Hitchens said he would accept an invitation from any religious leader who wished to debate with him. On 30 September 2007, Richard Dawkins, Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens's residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and titled \"The Four Horsemen\". In it, Hitchens stated at one point that he considered the Maccabean Revolt the most unfortunate event in human history due to the reversion from Hellenistic thought and philosophy to messianism and fundamentalism that its success constituted.\n\nThat year, Hitchens began a series of written debates on the question \"Is Christianity Good for the World?\" with Christian theologian and pastor Douglas Wilson, published in \"Christianity Today\" magazine. This exchange eventually became a book with the same title published in 2008. During their promotional tour of the book, they were accompanied by the producer Darren Doane's film crew. Thence Doane produced the film \"Collision: Is Christianity GOOD for the World?,\" which was released on 27 October 2009. On 4 April 2009, Hitchens debated William Lane Craig on the existence of God at Biola University. On 19 October 2009, Intelligence Squared explored the question \"Is the Catholic Church a force for good in the world?\". John Onaiyekan and Ann Widdecombe argued that it was, while Hitchens joined Stephen Fry in arguing that it was not. The latter side won the debate according to an audience poll. On 26 November 2010, Hitchens appeared in Toronto, Ontario, at the Munk Debates, where he debated religion with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a convert to Roman Catholicism. Blair argued religion is a force for good, while Hitchens argued against that.\n\nThroughout these debates, Hitchens became known for his use of persuasive and enthusiastic rhetoric in public speaking. \"Wit and eloquence\", \"verbal barbs and linguistic dexterity\" and \"self-reference, literary engagement and hyperbole\" are all elements of his speeches. The term \"Hitch-slap\" has come about as an informal term among his supporters for a carefully crafted remark designed to humiliate his opponents. Hitchens's line \"one asks wistfully if there is no provision in the procedures of military justice for them to be taken out and shot\", condemning the perpetrators of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, was cited by \"The Humanist\" as an example. A tribute in \"Politico\" stated that this was a trait Hitchens shared with fellow atheist and intellectual, Gore Vidal.\n\nHitchens was raised nominally Christian and attended Christian boarding schools, but from an early age he declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother's side and that his Jewish-born ancestors were immigrants from Eastern Europe (including Poland). Hitchens was married twice, first to Eleni Meleagrou, a Greek Cypriot in 1981; the couple had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Sophia. In 1991, Hitchens married his second wife, Carol Blue, an American screenwriter, in a ceremony held at the apartment of Victor Navasky, editor of \"The Nation.\" They had a daughter together, Antonia.\n\nIn November 1973, Hitchens's mother committed suicide in Athens in a pact with her lover, a defrocked clergyman named Timothy Bryan. The pair overdosed on sleeping pills in adjoining hotel rooms, and Bryan slashed his wrists in the bathtub. Hitchens flew alone to Athens to recover his mother's body, initially under the impression that she had been murdered. Both her children were then independent adults.\n\nIn June 2010, Hitchens was on tour in New York promoting his memoirs \"Hitch-22\" when he was taken into emergency care suffering from a severe pericardial effusion. Soon after he announced he was postponing his tour to undergo treatment for esophageal cancer. In a \"Vanity Fair\" piece titled \"Topic of Cancer\", he stated that he was undergoing treatment for the cancer. He said that he recognised the long-term prognosis was far from positive, and that he would be a \"very lucky person to live another five years\". A heavy smoker and drinker since his teenage years, Hitchens acknowledged that these habits likely contributed to his illness. During his illness, Hitchens was under the care of Francis Collins and was the subject of Collins' new cancer treatment, which maps out the human genome and selectively targets damaged DNA.\n\nHitchens died of hospital-acquired pneumonia on 15 December 2011 in the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, aged 62. In accordance with his wishes, his body was donated to medical research. 'Mortality', a collection of seven of Hitchen's \"Vanity Fair\" essays about his illness, was published posthumously in September 2012.\n\nFormer British prime minister Tony Blair said, \"Christopher Hitchens was a complete one-off, an amazing mixture of writer, journalist, polemicist, a unique character. He was fearless in the pursuit of truth and any cause in which he believed. And there was no belief he held that he did not advocate with passion, commitment, and brilliance. He was an extraordinary, compelling, and colourful human being whom it was a privilege to know.\"\n\nRichard Dawkins, a friend of Hitchens, said, \"I think he was one of the greatest orators of all time. He was a polymath, a wit, immensely knowledgeable, and a valiant fighter against all tyrants, including imaginary supernatural ones.\"\n\nAmerican theoretical physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss said, \"Christopher was a beacon of knowledge and light in a world that constantly threatens to extinguish both. He had the courage to accept the world for just what it is and not what he wanted it to be. That's the highest praise, I believe, one can give to any intellect. He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare, and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning only to the extent that we give them meaning.\" Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", saying, \"We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time.\" Salman Rushdie and English comedian Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012. Three weeks before Hitchens's death, George Eaton of the \"New Statesman\" wrote, \"He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended one or more of these principles. The tragedy of Hitchens's illness is that it came at a time when he enjoyed a larger audience than ever. The great polemicist is certain to be remembered, but, as he was increasingly aware, perhaps not as he would like.\" \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" asked if Hitchens was the last public intellectual.\n\nIn 2015, an annual prize of $50,000 was established in his honour by The Dennis and Victoria Ross Foundation for \"an author or journalist whose work reflects a commitment to free expression and inquiry, a range and depth of intellect, and a willingness to pursue the truth without regard to personal or professional consequence\".\n\n\n"}

Commenting on the destructive impact of hegemonic Western science on developing countries and non-Western cultures, Visvanathan calls for the recognition of alternative sciences or non-Western forms of knowledge. He argues that different knowledges are connected with different livelihoods and lifestyles and should therefore be treated equally.\n\nCognitive justice is a critique on the dominant paradigm of modern science and promotes the recognition of alternative paradigms or alternative sciences by facilitating and enabling dialogue between, often incommensurable, knowledges. These dialogues of knowledge are perceived as contributing to a more sustainable, equitable, and democratic world. \n\nThe call for cognitive justice is found in a growing variety of fields, such as ethnobiology, technology and database design, and in Information and communication technology for development (ICT4D).\n\nSouth-African scholar and UNESCO education expert Odora Hoppers proposes cognitive justice in the field of education. She argues that Indigenous knowledges have to be included in the dialogues of knowledge without having to fit in the structures and standards of Western knowledge. When Indigenous knowledges are treated equally, they can play their role in making a more democratic and dialogical science, which remains connected to the livelihoods and survival of all cultures. \n"}

He started his academic career in philosophy and psychology. In 1972 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Edinburgh for his thesis \"Speech and the regulation of behaviour.\" In the 1970s he and Barry Barnes were the major figures of the strong programme, which put forward queries against \"philosophical a priorism\" in the understanding of scientific knowledge. This is an approach, popular in the philosophy of science, that simply precluded inquiries about science by treating successful scientific knowledge as simply true or rational without empirically investigating how such knowledge has come to be accepted as true or rational. Bloor's book \"Knowledge and Social Imagery\" (Routledge, 1976) is one of the key texts of the strong programme.\n\nBloor wrote extensively on the Kuhn/Popper debate, and is a representative figure of the sociology of scientific knowledge. In the 1980s when French scholars like Bruno Latour developed the actor-network theory (partially based on the strong programme), David Bloor strongly disagreed with the ANT camp when they argued that human and non-humans should be treated in an equivalent manner, going so far as to write an article entitled \"Anti-Latour\".\n\nHe was awarded the John Desmond Bernal Prize by the Society for Social Studies of Science in 1996 in recognition of his distinguished contribution to the field.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19150744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19150744", "title": "Epistemic conservatism", "text": "Epistemic conservatism\n\nEpistemic conservatism is a view in epistemology about the structure of reasons or justification for belief. While there are various forms, epistemic conservatism is generally the view that a person's believing some claim is a reason in support of the claim, at least on the face of it. Others formulate epistemic conservatism as the view that one is, to some degree, justified in believing something simply because one believes it.\n\nExpanding the thesis, epistemic conservatism implies that it is unreasonable to revise or alter our personal beliefs and ideologies without good reasons to do so. This action of revising would cause an unnecessary use of resources/energy by the individual, and it would not offer the individual any epistemic value. Epistemic conservatism sees an epistemic value in just holding one’s beliefs stable.\n\nThere have been some critics of the thesis but several important methodologies assume that this thesis holds true.\n\n‘Properly Formulated Epistemic Conservatism’ (PEC): “If S believes that p and p is not incoherent, then S is justified in retaining the belief that p and S remains justified in believing that p so long as p is not defeated for S.”“Defeat Condition 1 (DC1): If S has better reasons for believing that ∼ p than S’s reasons for believing that p, then S is no longer justified in believing that p.”“Defeat Condition 2 (DC2): If S has reasons for believing that∼p which are as good as S’s reasons for believing that p and the belief that ∼p coheres equally as well or better than the belief that p does with S’s other beliefs, then S is no longer justified in believing that p.”This above thesis hits upon several common themes when discussing epistemic conservatism. PEC addresses the idea that when revising a belief system, individuals would seek to correct the errors piece by piece, rather than completely overhauling their ideologies. In other words, it is ideal to hold on to as many original beliefs as possible.Furthermore, PEC addresses spontaneous beliefs based on memories. It is hard to justify memory beliefs given that they are not drawn through distinct experiences, but regardless if they are/aren’t supported, individuals would still have the intuition that they are justified in holding these beliefs. According to PEC, as long as a specific memory belief is not defeated for the individual, the individual would be justified in holding this belief in virtue of previously holding the memory belief. As for forgotten evidence, PEC also makes sense of this phenomenon. An example would be where someone learned about relativity theory and came to hold the belief “E=mc^2”. After a long time, this person might have lost evidence supporting this specific belief, but we are intuitively drawn to claiming that they are still justified. PEC allows for this because the individual is justified in holding “E=mc^2” because they hold that belief.\n\nIn his objections, Foley describes a situation where epistemic conservatism makes irrational beliefs rational, where a contradiction exists. In his example, an individual believes “x”, however they possess better reasons to believe “~x”. In terms of PEC, the individual is justified in believing “x” as long as “x” is not defeated for them. In Foley’s example, “x” is defeated for the individual so Defeat Condition 1 was met, thus PEC leads to the individual not being justified in believing “x”, thus no contradiction exists.\n\n“Detective Jones has definitively narrowed down the suspects in a crime to two individuals, Lefty and Righty. There are good reasons to think that Lefty did it, but there are equally good reasons to think that Righty did it. There is conclusive reason to think that no one other than Lefty or Righty did it.”In this example, Feldman questions what Detective Jones would do in the situation, as the intuition points out that Jones can not believe that Righty did the crime and Lefty did not and vice versa. He supposes that Jones came upon the belief that Lefty did it first, possibly getting Lefty’s evidence first. Feldman draws the conclusion that epistemic conservatism forces our intuition away, forcing us to have Jones believe that Lefty did it. However, PEC allows for this because Jones’s belief that Lefty is the culprit is defeated since he now has equal evidence to believe that Righty committed the crime. By having the two equal beliefs of “Lefty is the culprit” and “Righty is the culprit”, Defeat Condition 2 was met. With PEC, Jones should withhold his belief from either of the two, thus PEC does not disagree with our natural intuitions.\n\n"}

Although at the time they were not considered formal schools or sects of Buddhism, they are now regarded as important schools in the history of Chán Buddhism. Most Chán lineages throughout Asia and the rest of the world originally grew from or were heavily influenced by the original five houses of Chán.\n\nThe period of Daoxin ( 580–651) and Daman Hongren ( 601–674) came to be called the East Mountain Teaching, due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huamgmei. The term was used by Shenxiu, the most important successor to Hongren.\n\nShenxiu (神秀 606?–706) was the most important successor to Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period.\n\nAccording to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, Huineng (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chán history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor. Shenhui, a successor to Huineng claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu. The most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was Guifeng Zongmi\n\nShenhui's influence is traceable in the Platform Sutra, which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng, but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Shenhui himself does not figure in the Platform Sutra; he was effectively written out of Chán-history.\n\nFrom the East Mountain Teachings descend the Five Houses of Chán, via various lineages.\n\nThe five houses were each defined by a unique method of teaching. Each school's methods were significantly different from the others, though it was not unheard of for teachers from one school to use the methods of another.\n\nThe Guiyang school (潙仰宗 Guíyáng, Jpn. Igyō) was the first established school of the Five Houses of Zen. Guiyang is named after master Guishan Lingyou (771–854) (Kuei-shan Ling-yu, Jpn. Isan Reiyū) and his student, Yangshan Huiji (807-883, or 813–890) (Yang-shan Hui-chi, Jpn. Kyōzan Ejaku).\n\nGuishan was a disciple of Baizhang Huaihai, the Chinese Zen master whose disciples included Huangbo Xiyun (who in turn taught Línjì Yìxuán, founder of the Linji School). After founding the Guiyang School, Yangshan moved his school to what is now modern Jiangxi.\n\nThe Guiyang school is distinct from the other schools due to its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery in the school's kōans and other teachings.\n\nOver the course of Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Guiyang school, along with the Fayan and Yunmen schools were absorbed into the Linji school. Chán master Hsu Yun, however, attempted to revive absorbed lineages. The attempt was successful regarding the Guiyang school, Hsuan Hua being its most known modern representative.\n\nThe Linji () was named after Chán master Línjì Yìxuán, who was notable for teaching students in ways that included shouting and striking in an attempt to help students reach enlightenment. The Linji school is the predominant Chinese Chán school.\n\nThe Caodong school was founded by Dongshan Liangjie and his Dharma-heirs in the 9th century. Some attribute the name \"Cáodòng\" as a union of \"Dongshan\" and \"Caoshan\" from one of his Dharma-heirs, Caoshan Benji; however, the \"Cao\" could also have come from \"Cáoxī\" (曹溪), the \"mountain-name\" of Huineng, the Sixth Ancestor of Chan. The sect emphasized sitting meditation, and later \"silent illumination\" techniques.\n\nIn 826 Korean Seon Master Doui, a student of Sixth Ancestor of Chan Huineng, brought Chan/Seon (Korean Zen)to Korea and founded the \"Nine Mountain Seon Monasteries\" which adopted the name Jogye order.\n\nIn 1227 Dōgen Zenji, a former Tendai student, studied Caodong Buddhism and returned to Japan to establish the Sōtō school. The Caodong school is still a respectable Chinese Chán school and is second only to Linji in number of monks and temples.\n\nThe Fayan school (法眼宗) was named after Chinese Chán Master Fayan Wenyi (Fa-yen Wen-i), who lived from 885 to 958.\n\nThe Yunmen school was named for Yunmen Wenyan.\n\nOver the course of Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Guiyang, Fayan, and Yunmen houses were gradually absorbed into the Linji house. Caodong was transmitted to Japan in the 13th century from Ven. Rujing of Tiantong Temple to Ven. Dōgen leading to the creation of the Sōtō Zen school.\n\nBoth Linji and Caodong are still practiced in China today. Ven. Sheng-yen is an example of a modern Linji and Caodong teacher. Ven. Hsu Yun revived the Guiyang school, Fayan school and the Yunmen school in China.\n\n"}

It deals with the value and need of friendship. The writing itself is one long piece of prose without any divisions whatsoever.\n\nFirst Perez discusses friendship on the level of individuals. This relationship is then explored as a model and foundation of political and social life.

{"id": "25589416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25589416", "title": "Gestalt Practice", "text": "Gestalt Practice\n\nGestalt Practice is a contemporary form of personal exploration and integration developed by Dick Price at the Esalen Institute. The objective of the practice is to become more fully aware of the process of living within a unified field of body, mind, relationship, earth and spirit.\n\n\"Gestalt\" is a German word that denotes form, shape or configuration, and connotes wholeness. Practice is an ongoing program or process of development. Gestalt Practice is an ongoing process of integrating human awareness across a broad spectrum of consciousness.\n\nInitially, Gestalt was used as a psychological term in Gestalt psychology. Then Fritz Perls, Laura Perls and Paul Goodman applied it to psychotherapy when they developed Gestalt therapy, upon which Gestalt Practice was partially based. Alan Watts, who was a mentor of Dick Price, suggested combining practices from the cultures of East and West. The writings of Nyanaponika Thera and the nearby presence of Zen Roshi Shunryu Suzuki were sources of Buddhist meditation practice for Price. Gestalt Practice was the term he used to describe his combination of these Eastern and Western traditions. This term distinguished the practice Price taught from both Gestalt therapy and Buddhist practice.\n\nThis form of awareness practice is different from Gestalt therapy, because it is not a “cure” for psychological symptoms, and it relies upon the interaction between two equal partners, namely an \"initiator\" of awareness work and a \"reflector,\" rather than a patient and a therapist. Some aspects of Gestalt Practice are derived from the theory of Gestalt therapy. However, as Dick Price conceived of Gestalt Practice, if a \"patient\" wants to do Gestalt work with a \"therapist\" then they belong in Gestalt therapy. In keeping with this approach, eclectic techniques of meditation, physical exercise, environmentalism, contemplation and spiritual practice are incorporated into Gestalt Practice, along with some typical Gestalt awareness experiments borrowed from the Gestalt therapy model.\n\nGestalt Practice is an amalgam of awareness practices. Lao Tzu was one of the most significant Asian influences on Price. Otherwise, the primary influences upon the development of Gestalt Practice were Fritz Perls, Wilhelm Reich, Alan Watts, Nyanaponika Thera, Shunryu Suzuki, Frederic Spiegelberg, Rajneesh, Joseph Campbell, Gregory Bateson, and Stanislav Grof, as well as many other scholars who were in residence at Esalen Institute during the two decades Price's lead the Institute.\n\nPrice worked with Perls for approximately four years at Esalen, between 1966 and 1970. Then Perls told Price that it was time for him to start teaching Gestalt on his own. Price was impressed with the similarities between Gestalt and mindfulness meditation, which he used with insights from Eastern religions and altered state research to develop Gestalt Practice.\n\nGestalt practitioners teach mindfulness skills, using a wide variety of methods not limited by the psychotherapeutic model. All Gestalt Practice techniques emphasize experience over analysis. Besides the standard Gestalt exercises that characterized Gestalt therapy, Dick Price widened the approach by incorporating novel techniques from such disciplines as meditation, shamanism, compassion practice and spiritual contemplation. Thus, Gestalt Practice became a personalized form of consciousness exploration beyond the limits of psychotherapy. A partial list of the modalities used in Gestalt Practice includes the following:\n\nGestalt Practice work may involve the reporting of present awareness, and the integration of awareness through intrapsychic dialogue between aspects of personality. This kind of work, borrowed from Gestalt therapy, is often practiced as a shared experiment between two partners working together as a \"dyad.\" Phenomenological techniques like these are based upon the belief that subjective experience is worthy of direct attention, without the interference of preexisting ideas or interpretations.\n\nSomatic awareness may be the focus of Gestalt exercises. Awareness of breathing is emphasized because it promotes immediate experience of the body. Dramatic interventions, typical of body-oriented Reichian therapy or Bioenergetics, generally are not used in Gestalt Practice. However, an initiator’s awareness naturally may be directed toward areas of tension or holding. A scan of body feelings and sensations, similar to forms of Buddhist meditation can enhance awareness practice. And movement exercises such as T'ai chi ch'uan, Yoga, dance, art, hiking, chanting, singing and massage may be used to integrate awareness of the body.\n\nInterpersonal relationship practices may be used in Gestalt Practice to clarify communications, improve relationship skills, and enhance empathy. A neutral moderator may assist with interpersonal encounters, although this is not necessary, in keeping with the Gestalt Practice principle of equality among participants.\n\nDreamwork is a common Gestalt awareness practice, in which enactment and integration of dream elements are favored. An initiator of Gestalt dreamwork intentionally re-experiences their dream as if it were happening in the present. The initiator then assumes the role of various dream elements, and enters into a dialogue with whatever is encountered in the dream. This approach is borrowed from the Gestalt therapy model. However, in contrast to Gestalt therapy, alternative sources of dream interpretation, including intuitive experiences are welcomed in Gestalt Practice.\n\nMeditation practices, derived from many different contemplative traditions, may be used by Gestalt practitioners. Buddhism provides many useful models for mindfulness and compassion practice; and some of these have been adapted to complement the objectives of Gestalt Practice.\n\nTaoism, as it was expressed by Lao Tzu in the Tao Te Ching, provides a non-judgmental backdrop for non-intervention with an initiator’s process, allowing whatever happens in a Gestalt work session to unfold naturally in the present moment. In addition, Taoism reinforces the reverence for nature that is typical of Gestalt Practice.\n\nThese techniques, and many others beyond the ambit of therapy, are regularly used in Gestalt Practice, with the same objectives of enhanced awareness, spiritual growth, and respect for the natural environment.\n\nGestalt Practice is most often taught in groups, with an experienced reflector serving as group leader. However, after participants have learned the basics of Gestalt, they frequently choose to do awareness practice work together on their own, outside of a group, without a leader. In this way, a Gestalt Practice group functions as the model for a Gestalt community. Indeed, Gestalt Practice, as Price conceived it, quickly evolves into a congregational awareness practice that transcends the confines of any meeting room.\n\nPrice led Gestalt groups at Esalen for fifteen years until his death in 1985. His wife and collaborator at Esalen, Christine Stewart Price, carried on the Gestalt Practice tradition by developing her own form of awareness practice, which she calls Gestalt Awareness Practice or GAP. Christine Price now teaches GAP in the United States, Europe and Japan. Christine and Tibetan Buddhist practitioner Gail Stewart also offer workshops, in which they teach Gestalt Practice methods and theory to experienced practitioners. In 2013, Christine Stewart Price founded a new facility, called Tribal Ground Circle, dedicated to continued teaching and development of the Gestalt Practice legacy.\n\nGestalt Practice influenced many people at Esalen. Prominent among them was a student of Dick Price named Steven Harper, who incorporated aspects of Gestalt Practice, along with principles of ecopsychology, into his own unique wilderness practice.\n\nContemporary American forms of psychoanalysis, such as relational psychoanalysis and intersubjective psychoanalysis, have had an impact upon Gestalt Practice, leading to the development of Relational Gestalt Practice by Dorothy Charles. She teaches this practice at Esalen, and in Japan, Spain and Greece.\n\n\n"}

The practice uses modifications of yoga's 24 foundational yoga poses, accompanied by a customized use of supportive language. HeavyWeight students employ props to support obese and overweight bodies. These props can include blocks, chairs and other devices to accommodate for the extra body weight, weaker joints and diminished strength of the obese. HeavyWeight Yoga's practice uses classroom lessons, yoga teacher training, and instructional DVDs for overweight and obese people which have been created by the founder of the style, Abby Lentz.\n\nThe practice of HeavyWeight Yoga relies upon slower pacing to encourage those who practice it. It avoids classic full inversion poses, modifying them so larger people can practice yoga. It is also appropriate for beginners of anyone who has a limited range of motion.\n\nHeavyWeight Yoga does not include practices which enable students to lose weight. The language of the practice such as \"belly well\" or \"energetic swipe\" is designed to create yoga experience for obese people.\n\nTwo unique techniques of HeavyWeight Yoga are movements to help a student regain flexibility. One of the modifications, the Belly Well, separates the legs to create a space for the body. The modification allows the student to lengthen their spine deeper or more stretch their hamstrings more fully. It can also be combined with an “Energetic Swipe,” which moves the flesh out of the way. This enables an obese yoga student to lower a forward bend or to deepen a twist. \n\nModifications in HeavyWeight Yoga have been customized by certified teachers in order to accommodate students recovering from surgeries such as joint replacements.\n\nAbby Lentz began practicing yoga in the 1970s. She is a trained Kripalu teacher. Lentz started her yoga teaching practice in 2004 and developed HeavyWeight Yoga the same year.\n\nResearch by the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine showed that when a group of obese women over age 50 practiced yoga for eight weeks, each experienced a 39 to 47% reduction in pain and stiffness while treating osteoarthritis in their knees.\n\nIn the documentary \"All of Me\", a movie about Weight Loss Surgery patients that aired as part of the PBS Independent Lens series, HeavyWeight Yoga poses are taught in a class of WLS patients to aid in recovery and post-surgical lifestyle. Lentz spoke on a KLRU-TV Civic Summit panel after the movie was broadcast, to explain how yoga affects the obese and overweight student's recovery.

In particular, it has been very successful in the areas of Software Agents and Agent-based simulation.\n\nThe agent paradigm uses the concept of \"agent\" as the basis to develop complex software systems. The field is fairly fragmented with different approaches on how to apply agents and perspectives on the agent concept itself. In this context, INGENIAS emerged as an integrative approach able to support the simultaneous use of different works. This use is based in the facilities to develop new version of its modeling language. The addition, modification, or deletion of concepts just requires modifying its meta-models and then regenerating the development tools using INGENME. This allows researchers focusing on the theoretical tasks of deciding what are the relevant concepts, relationships and attributes of their work, as the infrastructure generates the support tools for their application.\n\nThis flexibility has facilitated that INGENIAS addressed new extensions over the years. Two of them are of particular relevance. INGENIAS development process has been one of the few processes of agent-oriented methodologies in having their development process formally specified with SPEM, a language of the Object Management Group (OMG). Currently, there is one development process based on the Unified Process and another based on Scrum.\nIt also incorporated research on requirements elicitation from an organizational perspective. This work adopts the Activity Theory framework from Social Sciences to develop a modeling language for requirements with a holistic perspective of organizations and their systems, as well as several semi-automated processes for the elicitation and validation of these requirements.\n\nThe continuous revision of the INGENIAS modeling language and the tools for its application have made of it one of the most popular methodologies in the literature and actually applied by researchers and engineers.

See \"Doxastic Definition of Intellectual Humility.\"\n\nThere is widespread agreement among philosophers and psychologists that intellectual humility is important and valuable in some way, especially if one is going to engage with deep disagreements in a productive way. However, there is little consensus about the precise nature of intellectual humility. For example, some philosophers emphasise the importance of a disposition to own one’s particular limitations (e.g. the limitations of one’s knowledge and perspective), while others focus on the connection between humility and a low concern for status. Meanwhile, psychologists such as Justin Barrett and Peter Hill are working on better understanding the science behind intellectual humility, and on developing accurate measures that can tell us more about how to quantify humility.\n\nDrs. Ian M. Church and Peter L. Samuelson proposed a doxastic account of intellectual humility. They considered intellectual humility as a virtue, one of valuing one’s own beliefs \"as he or she ought.” \n\nWith this “as he or she ought” as the guiding principle, Church and Samuelson proposed: “Prima facie, humility is the virtuous mean between arrogance, on the one hand, and self depreciation or diffidence on the other.\" \n\nPeople are intellectually arrogant when they erroneously evaluate their intellectual capacity higher than warranted (“smarter than average). This results in the intellectually arrogant person being more closed-minded and biased than the intellectually humble person.\n\nPeople who are intellectually diffident are those who fail “to appropriately recognize or appreciate their intellectual achievements.” Such a person is less inclined to speak out when he or she encounters wrong information.\n\nDrs. Church and Samuelson cite several advantages of this treatment of intellectual humility as a virtue. By adopting such an approach, one is better equipped to counter a natural tendency to overestimate one's strengths, and underestimate one’s weakness, thus countering confirmation bias. 2 Church and Samuelson further propose that by being open to the viewpoint of others, one positions oneself for growth and learning.\n\nThe doxastic definition of intellectual humility does not necessarily [missing verb] that one abandon[s] one’s beliefs, only that one [is/be] open to new and alternative viewpoints.\n\n1 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Self Knowledge” \n2 Intellectual Humility: An Introduction to the Philosophy and Science, Bloomsbury Academic, Ian M.

When Francis Sparshott stepped down as chairman of that department in 1970, Graff was appointed to succeed him.

He is best known for his contributions to philosophy of language and epistemology, which often draw upon and have influence in other fields including linguistics and cognitive science. He has also written for a popular audience at the \"New York Times\" philosophy blog \"The Stone\". In his more recent work, he has brought tools from philosophy of language and epistemology to bear on questions of political philosophy, especially in his 2015 book \"How Propaganda Works\", which grew out of some blog essays at \"The Stone.\"\n\nStanley graduated from Corcoran High School in his hometown of Syracuse, New York. He studied in Lünen, Germany, from 1985 to 1986 as part of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange, after which he enrolled in the State University of New York in Binghamton, NY, where he studied philosophy of language under Jack Kaminsky. In 1987 he transferred to Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, but returned to the State University of New York in 1988, this time at the Stony Brook campus. There, he studied philosophy and linguistics under Peter Ludlow and Richard Larson. Stanley received his BA in May 1990, and went on to receive his PhD from MIT in January 1995 with Robert Stalnaker as his thesis advisor.\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Stanley accepted a position at University College, Oxford, as a stipendiary lecturer. He returned from England shortly thereafter to New York to teach at Cornell University. In 2000, he left Cornell and became an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

This house slave is ignorant of geometry. The subsequent discussion shows the slave capable of learning a complicated geometry problem. In this way, Socrates shows Meno that learning is possible. Indeed, the dialogue earlier demonstrated Meno's failure to benefit from Socratic teaching.\n\nBy drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of how to find twice the area of a square. \nSocrates notes that before he questioned the slave, who had been picked haphazardly from Meno's entourage, the boy would have thought himself able to speak \"well and fluently\" on the subject of a square double the size of a given square. Without Socratic questioning, the slave boy would have remained confident in his ignorance and not have \"attempted to look for, or learn, what he thought he knew (though he did not [know]).\" Socrates comments that this \"numbing\" he caused in the slave did him no harm. \n\nSocrates then draws a second square figure on the diagonal so that the slave can see that by adding vertical and horizontal lines touching the corners of the square, the double of its area is created. He gets the slave to agree that this is twice the size of the original square and says that he has \"spontaneously recovered\" knowledge he knew from a past life without having been taught.

He was the founder of Dhaka's first Bengali newspaper, \"The Azad\".\n\nKhan was born in Hakimpur, 24 Parganas district of Bengal Presidency, British India (in present-day West Bengal) in 1868. He did not have a British education but studied at Calcutta Madrasah (now Aliah University). He entered the journalism profession at a very young age before becoming involved in politics.\n\nEarly in his career, he worked at newspapers \"Ahl-i-Hadith\" and \"Mohammadi Akhbar\". Between 1908 and 1921, he worked as the editor of the \"Mohammadi\" and the \"Al-Islam\". He published the \"Zamana\" and the \"Sebak\" between 1920 and 1922. Sebak was banned and Akram Khan was arrested on the basis that his anti-government editorials supported the Non-cooperation Movement and the Swadeshi movement.\n\nFrom October 1936, Akram Khan began publishing the newspaper \"The Azad\", which generated support for the Muslim League in Bengal.\n\nBefore joining politics, while as a student of Calcutta Alia Madrasa, Khan formed a movement in favour of teaching all subjects in Bangladesh. Akram Khan was also one of the founding members of the Muslim League in 1906. He was involved in the Khilafat and Non-cooperation Movement from 1918 to 1924. He was elected secretary of the All India Khilafat Committee at the conference held at Ahsan Manzil in Dhaka in 1920, which was attended by other eminent Khilafat Movement leaders like Abul Kalam Azad, Maniruzzaman Islamabadi and Mujibur Rahman. Akram was responsible for collecting funds for the Ottoman caliphate. During 1920–1923, he organised public meetings in different parts of Bengal to propagate the cause of the Khilafat and the Non-cooperation Movement. As a believer in Hindu-Muslim amity, Akram Khan supported Chitta Ranjan Das's Swaraj Party in Kolkata in 1922, and also the Bengal pact in 1923. But due to the communal riots of 1926–1927 and other contemporary political developments, Akram Khan lost his faith in Indian nationalist politics and left both the Swaraj Party and Congress.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1935, Khan was deeply involved in the Krishak Praja Party. However, he left peasant politics in 1936 and became an activist for the Muslim League. He was a member of the central working committee of the League until 1947. After the partition of India in 1947, he opted for East Bengal and settled in Dhaka. He was the President of Muslim League (East Pakistan) until he retired from politics in 1960.\n\nAkram Khan was also involved in the Bengali Language Movement of 1952. He was also a founding member of Pakistan's Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body formed in 1962.\n\nKhan died on 18 August 1969.

The life of a Sufi or a seeker of God is meaningless without Mushahada because his goal is to remain ever-present in the vision of God. The inverse of Mushahada is Hijab i.e. when the Divine Face is veiled which is considered a punishment for a Sufi. \"Divine Love leads to Mushahida (the observation of Divinity) and possesses the Essence of the true mystic knowledge but the intellect has superficial knowledge only\".\n\nMushahida is the 'unity of vision (of Allah)' which takes over the seekers of Allah through the spiritual beneficence of their Murshid.

All perception appears to be Allah.\n\nAccording to a tradition related to the famous mystic Bayazid Bastami, he was asked about his age.

This empowers one's hair as the home of the dakinis and therefore can never be cut. The term is specifically used to refer to lamas and practitioners (male or female) who are “tantric specialists” and may technically be applied to both married householder tantric priests (\"khyim pa sngags pa\") and to those ordained monastics whose principal focus and specialization is vajrayana practice. However, in common parlance (and many western books on Tibetan Buddhism), “ngakpa” is often used only in reference to non monastic Vajrayana priests, especially those in the Nyingma and Bonpo traditions.\n\nIn Bhutan, and some other parts of the Himalayas, the term \"gomchen\" is the term most often used to refer to this type of Vajrayana priest, with \"ngakpa\" being reserved only for the most accomplished adepts amongst them who have become renowned for their mantras being particularly efficacious.\n\nTraditionally, many Nyingma ngakpas wear uncut hair and white robes and these are sometimes called \"the white-robed and uncut-hair group\" (Wylie: gos dkar lcang lo'i sde).\n\nMatthieu Ricard defines ngakpa simply as \"a practitioner of the Secret Mantrayana\" . Gyurme Dorje defines ngakpa (mantrin) as \"a practitioner of the mantras, who may live as a householder rather than a renunciate monk.\" \n\nTibetan Buddhism contains two systems of ordination, the familiar monastic ordinations and the less well known Ngagpa or Tantric ordinations. Ngagpa ordination is non-monastic and non-celibate, but not \"lay.\" It entails its own extensive system of vows, distinct from the monastic vows.\n\nNgakpas often marry and have children. Some work in the world, though they are required to devote significant time to retreat and practice and in enacting rituals when requested by, or on behalf of, members of the community.\n\nThere are family lineages of Ngakpas, with the practice of a particular Yidam being passed through family lineages. However, a ngakpa may also be deemed as anyone thoroughly immersed and engaged in the practice of the teachings and under the guidance of a lineage-holder and who has taken the appropriate vows or samaya and had the associated empowerments and transmissions. Significant lineage transmission is through oral lore.\n\nAs scholar Sam van Schaik describes, \"the lay tantric practitioner (\"sngags pa\", Skt. \"māntrin\") became a common figure in Tibet, and would remain so throughout the history of Tibetan Buddhism.\" \n\nKunga Gyaltsen, the father of the 2nd Dalai Lama, was a non-monastic ngakpa, a famous Nyingma tantric master. His mother was Machik Kunga Pemo; they were a farming family. Their lineage transmission was by birth.\n\nLabrang Monastery, one of the major Gelug monasteries in Amdo, has a Ngagpa college () located nearby the main monastery at Sakar village.\n\n\n"}

In addition to delivering services, outreach has an educational role, raising the awareness of existing services.\n\nOutreach is often meant to fill in the gap in the services provided by mainstream (often, governmental) services, and is often carried out by non-profit, nongovernmental organizations. This is a major element differentiating outreach from public relations. Compared with staff providing traditional services, Dewson et al. (2006) notes that outreach staff may be less qualified, but are more highly motivated.\n\nRhodes (1996) distinguishes between three types of outreach: domiciliary (undertaken at individual homes), detached (undertaken in public environments and targeting individuals), and peripatetic (undertaken at public or private environments and targeting organizations rather than individuals).

The term was frequently used at the end of the Cold War, when many Western nations significantly cut military spending (such as Britain's Options for Change defence review).\n\nWhile economies do undergo a recession after the end of a major conflict as the economy is forced to adjust and retool, a \"peace dividend\" refers to a potential long-term benefit as budgets for defense spending are assumed to be at least partially redirected to social programs and/or a decrease in taxation rates. The existence of a peace dividend in real economies is still debated, but some research points to its reality.\n\nA political discussion about the peace dividend resulting from the end of the Cold War involves a debate about which countries have actually scaled back military spending and which have not. The scale back in defense spending was mainly noticeable in Western Europe and in the Russian Federation. The United States, whose military spending was rapidly reducing between 1985 and 1993 and remained flat between 1993 and 1999, has dramatically increased it after September 11, 2001 to fund conflicts like the War on Terror, the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq.\n\n\"Peace dividend\" can also refer to the improved economy in Northern Ireland after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n"}

Yūnus Qūnawī [alternatively, Qūnavī, Qūnyawī], (), (Turkish: Sadreddin Konevî), (1207-1274 CE/605-673 AH), was one of the most influential thinkers in mystical or Sufi philosophy. He played a pivotal role in the study of knowledge—or epistemology, which in his context referred specifically to the theoretical elaboration of mystical/intellectual insight. He combined a highly original mystic-thinker, Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn 'Arabī (1165-1240 CE/560-638 AH), whose arcane teachings Qūnavī codified and helped incorporate into the burgeoning pre-Ottoman intellectual tradition, on the one hand, with the logical/philosophical innovations of Ibn Sīnā (Lat., Avicenna), on the other. Though relatively unfamiliar to Westerners, the spiritual and systematic character of Qūnawī's approach to reasoning, in the broadest sense of the term, have found fertile soil in modern-day Turkey, North Africa and Iran not to mention India, China, the Balkans and elsewhere over the centuries.\n\nLittle is known about Qūnawī's personal life. As a young boy, Ṣadr al-Dīn was adopted by Ibn 'Arabī, whose pupil he was. Of Persian descent, he nevertheless lived and taught in the city of Konya (modern-day Turkey where he is known as Sadreddin Konevî). There he drew very close to Mawlāna Jalāl-e Dīn Rūmī and participated in his spiritual circle.\n\nA master of ḥadīth, people came to Konya from distant lands just to study under him. But while he was reputed for his profound understanding of the Quran and Ḥadīth, he knew the ancient Peripatetic philosophy intimately, no doubt thanks chiefly to Ibn Sīnā, who commented extensively on the works of Aristotle. However, Qūnawī himself may have studied an Arabic translation of Aristotle's \"Metaphysics,\" being one of a handful of truly insightful, post-Avicennan critics of Aristotle, even if he was not a full-fledged commentator in the spirit of Ibn Rushd.\n\nQūnawī's overall influence appears more strategic than wide. Moreover, some of his students found fame. He instructed Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, who went on to author a commentary, now well-known, on Suhrawardi's \"Ḥikmat al-Ishrāq\". Another student of Qūnawī's, the Sufi poet Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi, was instrumental in introducing Ibn 'Arabī into the Persian language.\n\nAfter visiting the grave of Ibn 'Arabī a spell after his teacher and father-in-law had died, Qūnavī described a mystical experience he had about his teacher, Ibn 'Arabī, thus:\n\nHis recollection of this dream seems to indicate not just continuing deference to his teacher, but also what he saw as the practical end of reason. Though a different intellectual breed than his deceased mentor, Qūnavī too was a practising mystic, not just a thinker and teacher. In other words, he was a mystic who excelled in formal sciences like ḥadīth studies, Qurānic exegesis (ijtihād), dialectical theology (kalām), jurisprudence (fiqh), and philosophical sciences; and he corresponded with contemporaries like Nāsīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī, whose mathematical and astronomical discoveries have become integral to the science we know today.\n\nQūnavī's significance arises from his firm place in Islam's \"post-Avicennan\" (or, more precisely, post-Falsafah) period, of which Latin European Scholastics (themselves struggling with the problematics posed by Avicenna) were likely oblivious. And yet, the intellectual current to which he belonged provided the context for, among other developments, the development of systematic reason and the elaborate philosophical tradition that emerged in Iran, including the prodigal Sadr al-Din Shirazi, also called Mulla Sadra.\n\nAlthough Qūnavī was single-mindedly devoted to the same general philosophical framework as Ibn 'Arabī's 'Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmī assured us that, despite the pupil's frustrated attempts to follow in his spiritual footsteps,[34] without a proper study of Qūnavī's works the true intention of Ibn 'Arabī regarding the so-called doctrine of Waḥdat al-Wujūd (a doctrine progeny has ascribed to Ibn 'Arabī) could not be discerned in any manner conforming to both reason and religious law (Jāmī 556). His relationship with the aging teacher notwithstanding, Qūnavī had to stake out his own personal connection to higher knowledge. At times, it seems, he distanced himself from Ibn 'Arabī altogether due to the emphasis on personal witness above the interpretation of others’ experience regardless of their social or spiritual station. Al-Munāwī (b. 1265) quoted him as saying that his teacher had striven to lead him to a level where God manifested Himself through flashes of manifestation to all seekers, but that he failed (NJK 222). Mystics describe a manifestation of this kind as a “flash,” because the “direct witnessing of the essence” resembles the light, speed, and evanescence of any ordinary flash or lightning. \n\nAl-Qāshānī likened the “flash” to “the illumination appearing to a person that beckons and summons to the Presence of Proximity to the Lord for a journey within God.” Ibn 'Arabī referred to the deep tranquility felt by the saintly “friends of God,” the awliyā’, who take their repose in it. Because tranquility did not always occur to them, they could only take furtive glances at the manifestation, as if in a flash (Hakim 660-61).\n\nParadoxically, then, his relationship with Ibn 'Arabī provided Qūnavī with a sound justification for seeking a separate path to spiritual enlightenment, on the one hand, and for developing the proper terms with which to express overarching truths, on the other, which truths paradoxically were accessible only through personal experience, not anyone else's.\n\nQūnavī considered it his life's task to complete what Ibn Sīnā had begun with his Ishrāqī conception of knowledge. First, he shared with Ibn Sīnā and Ibn 'Arabī the goal of representing the intellectual/spiritual journey in communicable fashion. For any kind of knowledge or noetic discovery to be understood, it must be capable of being passed on to others (pupils, speculatively minded peers, etc.), rather than hoarded in the abstract ether of the mind, as it were. Whatever its technical complexities, it had to be didactically meaningful within a specific time and place, though without losing sight of the root object of knowledge.\n\nHe worked out his principles in several treatises. Their most concise and substantial statement consists of a theoretical introduction to his magnum opus, \"I'jāz al-bayān,\" the main body of which consists of a mystical exegesis of the \"Sūrat al-Fātiḥah,\" the opening chapter of the Quran. In that introduction, Qūnavī plotted the transition from the demonstrative logic of Avicenna's “theological science”, 'ilm ilāhī), to a different kind of logic one might call an “exegetical grammar,” as more or less taught by Ibn 'Arabī.\n\nTo the followers of Ibn 'Arabī, “exegetical grammar” was vastly more suited to the paradoxical movements of the spirit, “dialogue” with God, and in a purely epistemological sense, the true “knowledge of the realities,” an expression that Qūnavī took to be chiefly of Avicennan inspiration. Anxious to preserve the transcendence of the Divine, but without expunging human activity or initiative, Qūnavī understood God's knowledge of Himself to be the root of all knowledge. On the surface, this formulation and the logical corollaries flowing from it appear to seal man's incapacity to discover the “realities of things” on his own (i.e., by his own inborn faculties).\n\nIn a representative sense, human knowledge may be said to rest on the relation between two distinct, irreducible “realities”: subject and object. Given this subject-object distinction and the limitations of our own faculties, how could we ever know the “realities of things”? This theme permeates virtually all of Qūnavī's works. In his Introduction, he discussed several passages from Ibn Sīnā's posthumous \"al-Ta'liqāt\" (notebook). The only source he cared to mention for Ibn Sīnā's cogitations on the “realities,” the \"Ta'liqāt\" contained an unusually candid remark to the effect that man was incapable of knowing the realities of things. He took up this selfsame issue with Naṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī (d. 672/1274) in a fascinating philosophical correspondence, where \"tashkīk\" (\"systematic ambiguity,\" a concept key to later philosophy) figures. In that debate, our thinker sought to demonstrate under what conditions man may know God, a goal he shared with both philosophers and mystics.\n\nIn a larger sense, Qūnavī was able to deepen the transformation of philosophical reason begun by his predecessors by virtue of a simple, incontrovertible fact: the mechanical logic of Peripatetic philosophy could not quite overcome the distinction between subject and object (the two most elementary “realities” in every act of knowing) except by correspondence, concomitance, etc. Central to his project, on the other hand, was divine self-revelation. On this matter, Ibn 'Arabī had applied notoriously convoluted reasoning, often by association and in fragmentary outbursts. But like him, Qūnavī viewed divine self-revelation or -manifestation as the unfolding of a “book” penned in the form of constructed speech.\n\nIn short, self-revelation is the reality that underlies all realities. To elaborate the principles of its unfolding, he made thorough use of the demonstrative logic championed by both the falsāsifah (Islam's Hellenized philosophers, like Ibn Sīnā) and many Islamic theologians. But the new synthesis he was so keen to elucidate for \"theological science,\" or 'ilm ilāhī, had to be properly anchored to a logos exhibiting the same characteristic concreteness as that familiar to him from divine speech, “God’s communications” to man (e.g., the \"Qur’ān\"). He thus derived from traditional logic a mystical type of exegetical grammar, with its own “scale” or standard for theorization, one that bears his special imprint.\n\nIn his official biographical account of Konya's intellectual elite, Aflākī portrayed a close-knit community of mystics and scholars of a surprisingly uninhibited spiritual mien in Konya. And yet, incessant migrations to Anatolia had given this frontier capital a distinctly cosmopolitan character, making it the envy of every seeker of knowledge—Muslim, Greek and Armenian—but also innumerable foes. \n\nThis was about the time when Qūnavī's father, Majd al-Dīn Isḥāq, began his career as a statesman and, reflecting mysticism's pervasiveness, acquired the status of a revered spiritual figure. On his return journey from a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, Isḥāq was accompanied by Muḥyiddīn Ibn 'Arabī, with whom he struck a deep friendship. When Isḥāq died, his companion reportedly became Ṣadr al-Dīn's stepfather by marrying the widowed mother. Although we have no direct confirmation of this marriage from the writings of Ibn 'Arabî or Qūnawî we do know that Qūnawî became Ibn 'Arabî's close disciple and was given permission to teach all of his works and Anatolia's medley spiritual and cultural character at last began to take firmer shape.\n\nTo all, language was as primordial as it was central to all spiritual and mental activity. We have only to consider the linguistic innovations of mystic-poets like Rūmī, who contributed to the secular development of a highbrow literary form of Persian. Qūnavī's peculiar bent for Arabic linguistics, on the other hand, placed him comfortably in the lap of Arabic high culture, even if his mystical \"exegetical grammar\" must not be collapsed with conventional Arabic grammar.\n\nIn part, Arabic provided Qūnavī with uninterrupted links with the traditional centers of learning (Damascus, Aleppo, Cairo, etc.), where the religious sciences were taught almost exclusively in the Arabic language. Numerous schools and colleges had earlier been built by the Ayyūbids in Syria and Egypt, where Arabic was studied by people who congregated from all over the Islamic world.\n\nIn his landmark work, \"al-Nafaāt al-ilāhīyah\", Qūnavī noted how the matter of \"al-kitābah al-ūlā al-ilāhīyah\" (the primary divine writing, a key feature of his doctrine) came to him in an earlier version in the City of Damascus. Damascus, at the time, had fostered a broad intellectual fraternity that was felt across the traditional lines of jurisprudence, even if the religious sciences were more deep-rooted and variegated there than in Konya. Specialized fields like ḥadīth studies, where Qūnavī was an authority and a teacher, exhibited fewer rigid doctrinal standards of admission. One of the most prestigious centers, established earlier in the twelfth century, was the Dār al-Ḥadīth al-Ashrafīyah, whose the first shaykh was celebrated Shāfi'ī muḥaddith Ibn al-Ṣāliḥ al-Shahrazūrī (d. 643/1245). Unlike Ibn 'Arabī, who prayed as a Mālikī, Qūnavī was steeped in Shāfi'ī jurisprudence, whose practitioners were abundantly represented in the schools. But while spheres of influence were more or less evenly distributed in the higher echelons of academic scholarship in centers like the Ashrafīyah, some scholars exerted an intellectual influence disproportionate to their numbers—one prominent example being Abū Shāma, the official chronicler of Damascus who kept a close liaison with the Mālikī circles from the Maghreb and Ibn 'Arabī himself.\n\nThe Mālikīs present a special case, because their small numbers in the schools belied their pervasive influence especially in the Quranic sciences. Their numerical preponderance in iqrā’ (Quran recital) and naḥw (grammar) managed to sway the general interest even more toward Arabic philology. In view of his special relationship with Ibn 'Arabī, Qūnavī had easy access to their exegetical sources. Apart from themes characteristic of Ibn 'Arabī, however, there is little evidence of anything peculiarly Mālikī or Maghrebi in the works of Qūnavī, including in grammar. His affiliations remained close to the traditional eastern centers of learning, where the Mālikīs were underrepresented. That said, Damascus was not the only place to which Qūnavī paid regular visits. He also traveled to Aleppo and Cairo, where he had a faithful following.\n\nMore intriguing is how Qūnavī's spiritual bond with Rūmī, a scholar in his own right but the self-professed opponent of bookish scholars, developed to the point of mutual admiration—according to Aflākī—as Qūnavī continued to produce works rarely equaled in the “Arabic sciences” (Huart 281-82).\n\nAs the primary vehicle of human expression, language has the capacity to convey the most profound experiences available to human beings. For Qūnavī, its “devices of conveyance” (adawāt al-tawṣīl) disclosed “incorporeal and immaterial meanings,” which he explored at a certain remove from the original experience that presumably lay at the core. He may not have differed markedly from Rūmī in this respect, but he was not a “literary practitioner” (i.e., a poet) after the manner of Rūmī, nor was he even a grammarian by profession.\n\nThe challenge was to take the demonstrative science of traditional philosophy toward an exegetical grammar that could act as a quintessential language of experience, where knowledge implied the obligation to instruct in the intricacies of spiritual peregrination, but without substituting this derived knowledge for direct personal experience. This model remained legitimate so long as the central fact and semantic unity of divine speech was maintained.\n\nWhat we find in the mystical reflections of Ibn 'Arabī and Qūnavī alike are encoded utterances embodying an asymmetrical division between two components of instructive knowledge. Philosophically, they consist of the mawḑū' (subject) and the maṭlūb (object of inquiry); in theological dialectics and religious sciences they are generally known as aṣl (root) and far' (branch). Thus, in Qūnavī's view the idea was not merely to posit the “root” but to know it and to determine the precise modalities of our knowledge of it. A simple, unreflective cognizance of pregiven religious fundamentals, in the manner advocated by the Salafi-minded Ibn Taymīyyah, was still knowledge; yet nothing could disentangle it from the mundane influences that normally impinge upon the human faculty of comprehension.\n\nThe central question posed in the “theological science” envisioned by Ibn Sīnā was that of “existence.” In the form of a syllogism, the theological knowledge it imparted consisted of indemonstrable premises and a conclusion. Indemonstrables were given elements in any syllogism (“givens” were posited through the senses, imagination, intellect, etc.). As a science, this grand concept of theology assembled all the pregivens derived in the lower sciences that came under its own jurisdiction, because theological science was the very ground of all sciences.\n\nFurthermore, Ibn Sīnā saw existence as something that required more than just a natural awareness of things. In his \"Nafaḥāt ilāhiyyah,\" Qūnavī admitted that in that banal sense one could argue the awareness of existence was simply posited by way of intuition as the “first cognizance,” for which there was no demonstrable proof or true definition and which has merely an indistinct unity. However, this was not the biggest issue, he insisted. The difficulty arose with the “second cognizance,” namely, knowledge of the “reality distinguishable in itself from other realities”—in other words, the uniqueness of the reality.\n\nThis constituted the locus of the classical philosophical dilemma that preoccupied Qūnavī. The goal of knowledge was “knowledge of the realities of things.” One may either deny this knowledge to man, on the grounds that his natural faculties were imperfect, or affirm it at the risk of according him absolute knowledge. Contrasted to the second cognizance stood the first, which consisted of the “awareness of existence” and the perception of its “thingness.” His demarcation between this indistinct thingness and singular reality corresponded to the theological division of “subject” (mawḍūc) and “object of inquiry” (maṭlūb)—what is given and what is sought by way of knowledge. The realities, in the plural, consisted of the branches, the manifold qualities of the divine essence, by which God manifests Himself.\n\nBehind this structural view or formulation remained the vexing question: Should what is sought in the quest for knowledge be considered nothing but the original knowing subject revealed? Because the shay’ (thing) is given as the subject, like mawjūd (existent), the “cause of its knowledge is the predominance of that precept by which there is unity with the [thing] known, whatever it may be.” This “unity” between knower and known is what any claim to a knowledge of the reality ultimately had to rest upon; but it is a unity which indicated that we knew the reality in the manner in which it has revealed itself to the other reality, that of the knower, and is not a simple identity of two entities.\n\nAt any rate, it is the knower's radical otherness that renders any simple unity impossible. How then could we expect man, in his finitude and imperfection, to know not merely the “realities of things,” but God his Creator and the ultimate Reality? However, unity can be rendered viable, in a didactic sense, through the notion of the “consonance” between the two realities by way of their predominant attributes. This is possible only by virtue of “pre-existing knowledge.” Hence, in philosophy, the process of discovery moves procession-like from what is known to what is unknown. Every “theological science” from Aristotle's to Ibn Sīnā's to Qūnavī's—no matter how formal and however mellifluous or spiritually meager its utterances may be—accepted this rudimentary principle.\n\nTo Qūnavī's credit, he took pains to describe the passage, or supersession, that occurred with the knowledge of the thing as a unique reality by way of a special “unity” through consonance. In other words, knowledge of it in the form of an object of inquiry or “branch.”\n\nThere is more to this than meets the eye. Movement here is not a mechanical passage from one point to the other. The possibility of transmutation, at some given level of commonality between two distinct realities (the knower and the known), is opened up through their consonance, or munāsabah.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "224737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224737", "title": "Sherpa people", "text": "Sherpa people\n\nSherpa is one of the major ethnic groups native to the most mountainous regions of Nepal, as well as certain areas of China, Bhutan, India, and the Himalayas. The term \"sherpa\" or \"sherwa\" derives from the Sherpa language words \"Shar\" (\"east\") and \"Wa\" (\"people\"), which refer to their geographical origin in Tibet.\n\nMost Sherpa people live in the eastern regions of Nepal; however, some live farther west in the Rolwaling Valley and in the Helambu region north of Kathmandu. Tengboche is the oldest Sherpa village in Nepal. Sherpa people also live in China, Bhutan, and the Indian states of Sikkim and the northern portion of West Bengal, specifically the district of Darjeeling. The Sherpa language belongs to the south branch of the Tibeto-Burman languages, and it is a mixed Eastern Tibet (Khamba) and central Tibetan dialects. However, this language is separate from Lhasa Tibetan and unintelligible to Lhasa speakers.\n\nThe number of Sherpas migrating to Western countries has significantly increased in recent years, especially to the United States. New York City has the largest Sherpa community in the United States, with a population of approximately 3,000. The 2001 Nepal census recorded 154,622 Sherpas within its borders. Some members of the Sherpa population are known for their skills in mountaineering.\n\nThe Sherpa were nomadic people who first settled in the Solukhumbu District (Khumbu), Nepal, then gradually moved westward along salt trade routes. According to Sherpa oral history, four groups migrated out of Solukhumbu at different times, giving rise to the four fundamental Sherpa clans: Minyagpa, Thimmi, Sertawa and Chawa. These four groups have since split into the more than 20 different clans that exist today. About 14th centuries, Sherpa ancestors migrated from Kham. Mahayana Buddhism religious conflict may have contributed to the migration in the 13th and 14th centuries. Sherpa migrants traveled through Ü and Tsang, before crossing the Himalaya.\n\nBy the 1400s, Khumbu Sherpa people attained autonomy within the newly formed Nepali state. In the 1960s, as tension with China increased, Nepali government influence on the Sherpa people grew. In 1976, Khumbu became a national park, and tourism became a major economic force.\n\nGautam (1994) concluded that the Sherpa migrated from Tibet approximately 600 years ago, through the Nangpa La pass. It is presumed that the group of people from the Kham region, east of Tibet, was called \"Shyar Khamba\" (People who came from eastern Kham), and the place where they settled was called \"Shyar Khumbu\". As the time passed, the \"Shyar Khamba,\" inhabitants of Shyar Khumbu, were called Sherpa. A recent Nepal Ethnographic Museum (2001) study postulated that present-day Nepal became an integral part of the kingdom of Nepal. Since ancient times, Sherpas, like other indigenous Kirat Nepalese tribes, would move from one place to another place within the Himalayan region surviving as Alpine pastoralists and traders.\n\nGenetic studies shows that much of the Sherpa population has allele frequencies which are often found in other Tibeto-Burman regions, in tested genes, the strongest affinity was for Tibetan population sample studies done in Xizang Tibetan Autonomous Region. Genetically, the Sherpa cluster closest with the sample Tibetan and Han populations. Additionally, the Sherpa had exhibited affinity for several Nepalese populations, with the strongest for the Rai people, followed by the Magars and the Tamang.\n\nA 2016 study of Sherpas in China suggested that a small portion of Sherpas and Tibetans allele frequencies originated from separate ancient populations, which was estimated to have remained somewhat distributed for 11,000 to 7,000 years.\n\nA 2014 study observed that considerable genetic components from the Indian Subcontinent were found in Sherpa people living in China. The western Y chromosomal haplogroups R1a1a-M17, J-M304, and F*-M89 comprise almost 17% of the paternal gene pool in tested individuals. In the maternal side, M5c2, M21d, and U from the west also count up to 8% of people in given Sherpa populations. However, a later study from 2015 did not support the results from the 2014 study; the 2015 study concluded that genetic sharing from the Indian subcontinent was highly limited; a 2017 study found the same.\n\nIn a 2015 study of 582 Sherpa individuals (277 males) from China and Nepal, Haplogroup D-M174 was found most frequently, followed by Haplogroup O-M175, Haplogroup F-M89 and Haplogroup K-M9. The Y-chromosome haplogroup distribution for Sherpas follow a pattern similar to that for Tibetans.\n\nSherpa mtDNA distribution shows greater diversity, as Haplogroup A was found most frequently, followed by Haplogroup M9a, Haplogroup C4a, Haplogroup M70, and Haplogroup D. These haplogroups are also found in some Tibetan populations. However, two common mtDNA sub-haplogroups unique to Sherpas populations were identified: Haplogroup A15c and Haplogroup C4a3b1.\n\nMany Sherpa are highly regarded as elite mountaineers and experts in their local area. They were immeasurably valuable to early explorers of the Himalayan region, serving as guides at the extreme altitudes of the peaks and passes in the region, particularly for expeditions to climb Mount Everest. Today, the term is often used by foreigners to refer to almost any guide or climbing supporter hired for mountaineering expeditions in the Himalayas, regardless of their ethnicity. Because of this usage, the term has become a slang byword for a guide or mentor in other situations. Sherpas are renowned in the international climbing and mountaineering community for their hardiness, expertise, and experience at very high altitudes. It has been speculated that part of the Sherpas' climbing ability is the result of a genetic adaptation to living in high altitudes. Some of these adaptations include unique hemoglobin-binding capacity and doubled nitric oxide production.\n\nOn 18 April 2014, a serac collapsed above the Khumbu Icefall on Mount Everest, causing an avalanche of massive chunks of ice and snow which killed 16 Nepalese guides, mostly Sherpas. The 2014 avalanche is the second deadliest disaster in Everest's history, only superseded by avalanches in the Khumbu Icefall area just a year later, on 25 April 2015, caused by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in Nepal. In response to that tragedy and others involving deaths and injuries sustained by Sherpas hired by climbers, and the lack of government support for Sherpas injured or killed while providing their services, some Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job, and some climbing companies are no longer providing guides and porters for Everest expeditions.\n\nAccording to oral Buddhist traditions, the initial Tibetan migration was a search for a beyul (Buddhist pure-lands). Sherpa belong to the Nyingmapa, the \"Ancient\" school of Buddhism. Allegedly the oldest Buddhist sect in Tibet, founded by Padmasambhava (commonly known as Guru Rinpoche) during the 8th century, it emphasizes mysticism and the incorporation of local deities shared by the pre-Buddhist Bon religion, which has shamanic elements. Sherpa particularly believe in hidden treasures and valleys. Traditionally, Nyingmapa practice was passed down orally through a loose network of lay practitioners. Monasteries with celibate monks and nuns, along with the belief in reincarnated spiritual leaders, are later adaptations.\n\nIn addition to Buddha and the great Buddhist divinities, the Sherpa also believe in numerous deities and demons who inhabit every mountain, cave, and forest. These have to be respected or appeased through ancient practices woven into the fabric of Buddhist ritual life. Many of the great Himalayan mountains are considered sacred. The Sherpa call Mount Everest Chomolungma and respect it as the \"Mother of the World.\" Mount Makalu is respected as the deity Shankar (Shiva). Each clan reveres certain mountain peaks and their protective deities.\n\nToday, the day-to-day Sherpa religious affairs are presided over by lamas (Buddhist spiritual leaders) and other religious practitioners living in the villages. The village lama who presides over ceremonies and rituals can be a celibate monk or a married householder. In addition, shamans (\"lhawa\") and soothsayers (\"mindung\") deal with the supernatural and the spirit world. Lamas identify witches (\"pem\"), act as the mouthpiece of deities and spirits, and diagnose spiritual illnesses.\n\nAn important aspect of Sherpa religion is the monastery or \"gompa\". There are some two dozen gompas scattered throughout the Solukhumbu region. They are communities of lamas or monks (sometimes of nuns) who take a vow of celibacy and lead a life of isolation searching for truth and religious enlightenment. They are respected by and supported by the community at large. Their contact with the outside world is focused on monastery practices and annual festivals to which the public is invited, as well as the reading of sacred texts at funerals.\n\nMinority religions for Sherpa is Hinduism.\n\nMen wear long-sleeved robes called \"kitycow\", which fall to slightly below the knee. \"Chhuba\" is tied at the waist with a cloth sash called \"kara\", creating a pouch-like space called \"tolung\" which can be used for storing and carrying small items. Traditionally, \"chhuba\" were made from thick home-spun wool, or a variant called \"lokpa\" made from sheepskin. \"Chhuba\" are worn over \"raatuk\", a blouse (traditionally made out of \"bure\", white raw silk), trousers called \"kanam\", and an outer jacket called \"tetung\".\n\nWomen traditionally wear long-sleeved floor-length dresses of thick wool called \"tongkok\". A sleeveless variation called \"angi\" is worn over a \"raatuk\" (blouse) in warmer weather. These are worn with colourful striped aprons; \"metil\" aprons are worn in front, and \"gewe\" in back, and are held together by an embossed silver buckle called \"kyetig\".\n\nSherpa clothing resembles Tibetan clothing. Increasingly, home-spun wool and silk is being replaced by factory-made material. Many Sherpa people also now wear ready-made western clothing.\n\nWhen a son marries and has children, the community may help to construct a new house, as the extended family becomes too large for a single home. The neighbors often contribute food, drinks and labor to help the family. Houses are typically spaced to allow fields in between. A spiritual ceremony may be conducted at every building stage as the house must have space for deities, humans and animals. Once constructed, the house is often handed down within a family and not sold. The house style depends on the lay of the land: old river terraces, former lake beds or mountain slopes. There are stone single-story, -story (on a slope), and the two-story houses, with ample room for animals. Many well-to-do families will have an annex shrine room for sacred statues, scriptures and ritual objects. The roof is sloping and is made from local natural materials, or imported metal. There's space in the roof to allow for fire smoke to escape. There may be an internal or external outhouse for making compost.\n\n\"A Sherpa community will most commonly get together for a party, which is held by the host with the purpose of gaining favor with the community and neighbors\". Guests are invited hours before the party will start by the host’s children to reduce the chance of rejection. The men are seated by order of status, with those of lesser status sitting closer to the door and men of higher status sitting by the fireplace, while the women sit in the center with no ordering. It is polite to sit in a space lower than one’s proper place so one may be invited by the host to their proper place. The first several hours of the party will have only beer served, followed by the serving of food, and then several more hours of singing and dancing before people start to drift out. The act of manipulating one’s neighbors into cooperation by hosting a party is known as Yangdzi, and works by expecting the hospitality done by the host with the serving of food and alcohol to be repaid.\n\nOne of the best-known Sherpas is Tenzing Norgay. In 1953, he and Sir Edmund Hillary became the first people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. Norgay's son Jamling Tenzing Norgay also climbed Everest in honor of his father with the mountaineers Ed Viesturs and Araceli Segarra during the disastrous year of 1996.\n\nIn 2001, Temba Tsheri became the youngest Everest climber in the world (holder of the Guinness World Record), then aged 16.\n\nIn 2003, Sherpas Pemba Dorje and Lhakpa Golu competed to see who could climb Everest from base camp the fastest. On 23 May 2003, Dorje reached the summit in 12 hours and 46 minutes. Three days later, Golu beat his record by two hours, reaching the summit in 10 hours 46 minutes. On 21 May 2004, Dorje again improved the time by more than two hours with a total time of 8 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nOn 11 May 2011, Apa Sherpa successfully reached the summit of Everest for the twenty-first time, breaking his own record for the most successful ascents. He first climbed Mount Everest in 1989 at the age of 29.\n\nOne of the most famous Nepalese female mountaineers was Pasang Lhamu Sherpa, the first Nepali female climber to reach the summit of Everest, but who died during the descent. Her namesake, Pasang Lamu Sherpa Akita, has also climbed Everest, and was one of three Nepali women who were the first to reach the summit of K2. Another well-known female Sherpa was the two-time Everest summiter Pemba Doma Sherpa, who died after falling from Lhotse on 22 May 2007.\n\nOn May 20, 2011, Mingma Sherpa became the first Nepali and the first South Asian to scale all 14 of the world's highest mountains. In the process, Mingma set new world record – he became the first mountaineer to climb all 14 peaks on first attempt.\n\nLakpa Tsheri Sherpa is one half of a Nepali duo that was voted \"People's Choice Adventurers of the Year 2012\". In April 2011, Lakpa Tsheri and Sano Babu Sunuwar made the 'Ultimate Descent': a three-month journey in which they climbed Everest, then paraglided down the mountain and proceeded to kayak through Nepal and India until they reached the Indian Ocean.\n\nOn 19 May 2012, 16-year-old Nima Chhamzi Sherpa became the youngest woman to climb Everest; the previous record holder was Nimdoma Sherpa, who summited in 2008, also at 16 years old.\n\nChhurim Sherpa (Nepal) summitted Everest twice in May 2012: 12 May and 19 May. \"Guinness World Records\" recognized her for being the first female Sherpa to summit Everest twice in one climbing season.\n\nIn 2013, 30-year-old Chhang Dawa Sherpa became the youngest mountaineer to summit the 14 highest peaks, the 8000'ers.\nPratima Sherpa 19(2017), has lived her entire life in a maintenance shed on the fourth hole of Royal Nepal Golf Club in Kathmandu, and is the top-ranked female golfer in Nepal.\n\nOn July 26, 2014, Pasang Lamu Sherpa Akita, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, and Maya Sherpa crested the 28,251-foot (8,611-meter) summit of K2, the second highest mountain in the world. In doing so, the three Nepali women have become the first all-female team to climb what many mountaineers consider a much tougher challenge than Everest. The feat was announced in climbing circles as a breakthrough achievement for women in high-altitude mountaineering. Only 18 of the 376 people who have summited K2 have been women.\n\nAnother notable Sherpa is cross-country skier and ultramarathoner Dachhiri Sherpa, who represented Nepal at the 2006, 2010, and 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nSimilarly Cultural and tourism Minister of Nepal Kripasur Sherpa, Major of British Gurkha Army Prem Dorji Sherpa, ambassador of Australia Lucky Sherpa are notable personnels from Sherpa communities.\n\nBir Radha Sherpa has won many titles in Indian reality dance championship awards.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18697639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18697639", "title": "Sufism in India", "text": "Sufism in India\n\nSufism has a history in India evolving for over 1,000 years. The presence of Sufism has been a leading entity increasing the reaches of Islam throughout South Asia. Following the entrance of Islam in the early 8th century, Sufi mystic traditions became more visible during the 10th and 11th centuries of the Delhi Sultanate and after it to the rest of India. A conglomeration of four chronologically separate dynasties, the early Delhi Sultanate consisted of rulers from Turkic and Afghan lands. This Persian influence flooded South Asia with Islam, Sufi thought, syncretic values, literature, education, and entertainment that has created an enduring impact on the presence of Islam in India today. Sufi preachers, merchants and missionaries also settled in coastal Bengal and Gujarat through maritime voyages and trade.\n\nVarious leaders of Sufi orders, Tariqa, chartered the first organized activities to introduce localities to Islam through Sufism. Saint figures and mythical stories provided solace and inspiration to Hindu caste communities often in rural villages of India. The Sufi teachings of divine spirituality, cosmic harmony, love, and humanity resonated with the common people and still does so today. The following content will take a thematic approach to discuss a myriad of influences that helped spread Sufism and a mystical understanding of Islam, making India a contemporary epicenter for Sufi culture today.\n\nMuslims entered India in 711 under the Arab commander Muhammad bin Qasim, by conquering the regions of Sindh and Multan. This historical achievement connected South Asia to the Muslim empire. Simultaneously, Arab Muslims were welcomed along the Hindustani (India) sea ports for trade and business ventures. The Muslim culture of the caliphate began to permeate through India. This trade route linking India to the Mediterranean world and even Southeast Asia lasted peacefully until 900. During this period, the Abbasid Caliphate (750 – 1258) was seated in Baghdad; this city is also the birthplace of Sufism with notable figures such as Ali ibn Abi Talib, Hasan al Basri, and Rabiah.\n\nThe mystic tradition of Islam gained significant ground spreading from Baghdad (Iraq) into Persia, commonly known today as Iran and Afghanistan. In 901, a Turkic military leader, Sabuktigin, established an Afghan kingdom in the city of Ghaznah. His son, Mahmud, expanded their territories into the Indian Punjab region during 1027 The resources and riches annexed from Punjab went into the Ghazni coffers to expand further into India's northwest areas. During the early 11th century, the Ghaznavids brought a wealth of scholars into India's borders, establishing the first Persian-inspired Muslim culture succeeding prior Arab influences.\n\nIn 1151, another Central Asian group, called the Ghurids, overtook the lands of the Ghaznavids – who did very little to monitor their lands in India. Mu’izz al-Din Ghuri, a governor of Turkic origin, initiated a major invasion of India, extending the previous Ghazni territories into Delhi and Ajmer. By 1186, northern India was indistinguishable; a combination of Baghdad's cosmopolitan culture mixed with Persian-Turkic traditions of the Ghaznah court accelerated Sufi intellectualism in India. Scholars, poets, and mystics from Central Asia and Iran became integrated within India. By 1204, the Ghurids established rule in the following cities: Benaras (Varanasi), Kanaug, Rajasthan, and Bihar, which introduced Muslim rule into the Bengal region.\n\nAn emphasis on translation of Arabic and Persian texts (Qu'ran, Hadith corpus, Sufi literature) into vernacular languages helped the momentum of Islamization in India. Particularly in rural areas, Sufis helped Islam spread generously into prior polytheistic populations. Subsequently, the general consensus among scholars remains that there were never any forced mass conversions recorded during this early history time period. Between the late 12th century and 13th century, Sufi brotherhoods became firmly consolidated in northern India.\nSufism came to Kashmir when Sufi Saint, Shai Karman, from the Iranian city of Karman, took up residence in a small village called Sharakaware(baramulla). From Sharakawara, the religion spread to other villages like Pangipora and nawshere.they took initiative to spread the Islamic teaching among common people.\n\nThe period of 1206 – 1526 is labeled as the Delhi Sultanate of Raftaar. This time frame consists of five separate dynasties that ruled territorial parts of India: the Mamluk or slave, Khaljis, Tughlaq, Sayyid, and Lodi dynasty. In history, the Delhi Sultanate is usually given marginal attention compared to the succeeding Mughal Dynasty. At its peak, the Delhi Sultanate controlled all of North India, Afghan frontier, and Bengal. The security of their lands protected India from the Mongol Conquests terrorizing the rest of Asia between 1206 and 1294. The Mongols also succeeded in destroying Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, proving that this reign of violence was no minor feat. When the Mongol invasion penetrated Central Asia, fleeing refugees chose India as a safe destination. \nThis historical move can be deemed a significant catalyst of Sufi thought in India. Scholars, students, artisans, and common people arrived into the protection of Mamluk rulers, the first dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate. Soon the court had an immense influx of diverse cultures, religiosity, and literature from Persia and Central Asia; Sufism was the main ingredient in all mediums. During this medieval period, Sufism spread through various regions, expanding to the Deccan plateau with the succession of the Tughlaq dynasty of 1290 – 1388. During this time, the Muslim rulers of the Sultanate dynasties were not necessarily of orthodox Islam; yet, they were still deemed powerful. Advisors of the dynastic sultans included Muslim religious scholars (ulama) and notably, Muslim mystics (mashai’kh). Although practicing Sufis rarely had political aspirations, the declining ethical reign of the Sayyid and Lodi dynasty (1414 – 1517) required renewed leadership.\n\nDuring 901 - 1151, the Ghaznawids began to build numerous schools called madrasa that were attached and affiliated with masjids (mosque). This mass movement established stability in India's educational systems. Existing scholars promoted the study of the Qu'ran and hadith, beginning in North West India. During the Delhi Sultanate, the intellectual caliber of India's residents increased multiple - fold due to the Mongol invasions. Various intellectuals hailing from regions such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia began to enrich the cultural and literary life of the Delhi capital. Among the religious elite existing during the Sultanate time period, two major classifications existed. The \"ulama\" were noted exclusive religious scholars who had mastered certain Islamic legal branches of study. They were sharia oriented and tended to be more orthodox about Muslim practices. The other group of religious elites were the Sufi mystics, or fakir. This was a more inclusive group that was often more tolerant of non-Muslim traditions. Although the commitment to practice sharia remains a Sufi foundation, early Sufis in India focused on proselytizing through service work and helping the poor. During the Delhi Sultanate, the rise prevailing mystical approach to Islam was not a substitute for madrasa education nor traditional scholarship. The teachings of sufism only built upon the foundations of a madrasa education. The spiritual orientation of Sufism only sought to refine the \"consciousness of the divine, intensify piety, and inculcate a humanistic attitude.\"\n\nOne reason why Islam became more favorable in India was due to the establishment of khanqah. A khanqah is commonly defined as a hospice, lodge, community center, or dormitory ran by Sufis. Khanqahs were also known as Jama'at Khana, large gathering halls. Structurally, a khanqah could be one large room or have additional dwelling space. Although some khanqah establishments were independent of royal funding or patronage, many received fiscal grants (waqf) and donations from benefactors for continuing services. Over time, the function of traditional Sufi khanqahs evolved as Sufism solidified in India.\n\nInitially, the Sufi khanqah life emphasized a close and fruitful relationship between the master-teacher (sheikh) and their students. For example, students in khanqahs would pray, worship, study, and read works together. Sufi literature had more academic concerns besides just the jurisprudential and theological works seen in madrasa. There were three major categories of mystical works studied in South Asia: hagiographical writing, discourses of the teacher, and letters of the master. Sufis also studied various other manuals describing code of conduct, adab (Islam). In fact, the text (trans.) \"Path of God's Bondsmen from Origin to Return\" written by a Persian Sufi saint, Najm al-Din Razi, spread throughout India during the authors' lifetime. Sharing that Sufi thought was becoming increasingly favorable to study in India. Even today, preserved mystical literature has proved invaluable as a source of religious and social history of Sufi Muslims in India.\n\nThe other major function of a khanqah was of a community shelter. Many of these facilities were built in low caste, rural, Hindu vicinities. The Chishti Order Sufis in India, especially, crystallized khanqahs with the highest form of modest hospitality and generosity. Keeping a \"visitors welcome\" policy, khanqahs in India offered spiritual guidance, psychological support, and counseling that was free and open to all people. The spiritually hungry and depressed caste members were both fed with a free kitchen service and provided basic education. By creating egalitarian communities within stratified caste systems, Sufis successfully spread their teachings of love, spirituality, and harmony. It was this example of Sufi brotherhood and equity that drew people to the religion of Islam. Soon these khanqahs became social, cultural, and theological epicenters for people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds and both genders. Through a khanqah's humble services, Sufis presented the true form of Islam and forged a way for voluntary large scale conversions of lower class Hindustanis.\n\nThe Madariyya are members of a Sufi order (tariqa) popular in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, the Mewat region, Bihar and Bengal, as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh. Known for its syncretic aspects, lack of emphasis on external religious practice and focus on internal dhikr, it was initiated by the Sufi saint 'Sayed Badiuddin Zinda Shah Madar' (d. 1434 CE), called \"Qutb-ul-Madar\", and is centered on his shrine (dargah) at Makanpur, Kanpur district, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nShadhiliyya was founded by Imam Nooruddeen Abu Al Hasan Ali Ash Sadhili Razi. Fassiya branch of Shadhiliyya was flourished by Qutbul Ujood Imam Fassi at Masjid al Haram Makkah as its base and was brought to India by Sheikh Aboobakkar Miskeen sahib Radiyallah of Kayalpatnam and Sheikh Mir Ahmad Ibrahim Raziyallah of Madurai. Mir Ahmad Ibrahim is the first of the three Sufi saints revered at the Madurai Maqbara in Tamil Nadu. There are more than 70 branches of Shadhiliyya and in India. Of these, the Fassiyatush Shadhiliyya is the most widely practised order.\n\nThe Chishtiyya order emerged from Central Asia and Persia. The first saint was Abu Ishaq Shami (d. 940–41) establishing the Chishti order in Chisht-i-Sharif within Afghanistan Furthermore, Chishtiyya took root with the notable saint Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236) who championed the order within India, making it one of the largest orders in India today. Scholars also mentioned that he had been a part-time disciple of Abu Najib Suhrawardi. Khwaja Moiuddin Chishti was originally from Sistan (eastern Iran, southwest Afghanistan) and grew up as a well traveled scholar to Central Asia, Middle East, and South Asia. He reached Delhi in 1193 during the end of Ghurid reign, then shortly settled in Ajmer-Rajasthan when the Delhi Sultanate formed. Moinuddin Chishti's Sufi and social welfare activities dubbed Ajmer the \"nucleus for the Islamization of central and southern India.\" The Chishti order formed khanqah to reach the local communities, thus helping Islam spread with charity work. Islam in India grew with the efforts of dervishes, not with violent bloodshed or forced conversion. Chishtis were famous for establishing khanqahs and for their simple teachings of humanity, peace, and generosity. This group drew an unprecedented amount of Hindus of lower and higher castes within the vicinity. Until this day, both Muslims and non-Muslims visit the famous tomb of Moinuddin Chishti; it has become even a popular tourist and pilgrimage destination. Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar (d. 1605), the 3rd Mughal ruler frequented Ajmer as a pilgrim, setting a tradition for his constituents.\nSuccessors of Khwaja Moinudden Chishti include eight additional saints; together, these names are considered the big eight of the medieval Chishtiyya order.\nMoinuddin Chishti (d. 1233 in Ajmer, India) \nQutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (d. 1236 in Delhi, India) \nFariduddin Ganjshakar (d. 1265 in Pakpattan, Pakistan) \nNizamuddin Auliya (d. 1335 in Delhi).\nNasiruddin Chiragh Dehlavi\nBande Nawaz (d. 1422 in Gulbarga, India) \nSyed baqaullah shah kareemisafipur,unnao (1269H1362H) Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind (d. 1357 in Bengal, India\nAlaul Haq Pandavi \nAshraf Jahangir Semnani(d. 1386, Kichaucha India) \n\nThe founder of this order was Abdul-Wahid Abu Najib as-Suhrawardi (d. 1168). He was actually a disciple of Ahmad Ghazali, who is also the younger brother of Abu Hamid Ghazali. The teachings of Ahmad Ghazali led to the formation of this order. This order was prominent in medieval Iran prior to Persian migrations into India during the Mongol Invasion \nConsequently, it was Abu Najib as-Suhrawardi's nephew that helped bring the Suhrawardiyyah to mainstream awareness. Abu Hafs Umar as-Suhrawardi (d. 1243) wrote numerous treatises on Sufi theories. Most notably, the text trans. \"Gift of Deep Knowledge: Awa’rif al-Mar’if\" was so widely read that it became a standard book of teaching in Indian madrasas. This helped spread the Sufi teachings of the Suhrawardiyya. Abu Hafs was a global ambassador of his time. From teaching in Baghdad to diplomacy between the Ayyubid rulers in Egypt and Syria, Abu Hafs was a politically involved Sufi leader. By keeping cordial relations with the Islamic empire, Abu Hafs's followers in India continued to approve of his leadership and approve political participation of Sufi orders.\n\nThis order was founded by Abu'l Jannab Ahmad, nicknamed Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1221) who was from the border between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan This Sufi saint was a widely acclaimed teacher with travels to Turkey, Iran, and Kashmir. His education also fostering generations of students who became saints themselves. This order became important in Kashmir during the late 14th century. Kubra and his students made significant contributions to Sufi literature with mystical treatises, mystical psychology, and instructional literature such as text \"al-Usul al-Ashara\" and \"Mirsad ul Ibad.\" These popular texts regarding are still mystic favorites in India and in frequent study. The Kubrawiya remains in Kashmir - India and within Huayy populations in China.\n\nThe origin of this order can be traced back to Khwaja Ya‘qub Yusuf al-Hamadani (d. 1390), who lived in Central Asia. It was later organized by Baha’uddin Naqshband (b. 1318–1389) of Tajik and Turkic background. He is widely referred to as the founder of the Naqshbandi order. Khwaja Muhammad al-Baqi Billah Berang (d. 1603) introduced the Naqshbandiyyah to India. This order was particularly popular Mughal elites due to ancestral links to the founder, Khawja al-Hamadani \" \nBabur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in 1526, was already initiated in the Naqshbandi order prior to conquering India. This royal affiliation gave considerable impetus to the order.\nThis order has been considered as most orthodox among all sufi orders.\n\nThe Qadiriyyah order was founded by Abdul-Qadir Gilani who was originally from Iran (d. 1166) It is popular among the Muslims of South India.\n\nLess accurate information is known about the following other orders within India: Mujahhidiyyah.\n\nThe Sarwari Qadri order was founded by Sultan Bahu which branched out of the Qadiriyyah order. Hence, it follows the same approach of the order but unlike most Sufi orders, it does not follow a specific dress code, seclusion, or other lengthy exercises. Its mainstream philosophy is related directly to the heart and contemplating on the name of Allah, i.e., the word الله (\"allāh\") as written on own heart.\n\nIslam was not the only religion in India contributing the mystical aspects of Sufism. The Bhakti movement also gained respect due mysticism popularity spreading through India. The Bhakti movement was a regional revival of Hinduism linking language, geography, and cultural identities through devotional deity worship. This concept of \"Bhakti\" appeared in the Bhagavad Gita and the first sects emerged from south India between the 7th and 10th century. The practices and theological standpoints were very similar to Sufism, often blurring the distinction between Hindus and Muslims. Bhakti devotees linked puja (Hinduism) to songs about saints and theories of life; they would meet often to sing and worship. The Brahman Bhaktis developed mystical philosophies similar to those advocated by Sufi saints. For example, the Bhaktis believed that there is a special reality beneath the illusion of life; this reality needs to be recognized to escape the cycle of reincarnation. Moreover, moksha, liberation from Earth is the ultimate goal in Hinduism. These teachings run nearly parallel to Sufi concepts of dunya, tariqa, and akhirah.\n\nSufism helped the assimilation of the Afghani Delhi Sultanate rulers within mainstream society. By building a syncretic medieval culture tolerant and appreciative of non-Muslims, Sufi saints contributed to a growth of stability, vernacular literature, and devotional music in India. One Sufi mystic, Saiyid Muhammad Ghaus Gwaliori popularized yogic practices among Sufi circles. Literature related to monotheism and the Bhakti movement also formed sycretic influences in history during the Sultanate period. Despite the camaraderie between Sufi saints, yogis, and Bhakti Brahmans, medieval religious existed and continue to splinter peaceful living in parts of India today.\n\nOne of the most popular rituals in Sufism is the visiting of grave-tombs of Sufi saints. These have evolved into Sufi shrines and are seen among cultural and religious landscape of India. The ritual of visiting any place of significance is called ziyarat; the most common example is a visit to Prophet Muhammad's Masjid Nabawi and grave in Medina, Saudi Arabia. A saint's tomb is a site of great veneration where blessings or baraka continue to reach the deceased holy person and are deemed (by some) to benefit visiting devotees and pilgrims. In order to show reverence to Sufi saints, kings and nobles provided large donations or waqf to preserve the tombs and renovate them architecturally. Over time, these donation, rituals, annual commemorations formed into an elaborate system of accepted norms. These forms of Sufi practise created an aura of spiritual and religious traditions around prescribed dates. Many orthodox or Islamic purists denounce these visiting grave rituals, especially the expectation of receiving blessings from the venerated saints. Nevertheless, these rituals have survived generations and seem adamant to remain.\n\nMusic has always been present as a rich tradition among all Indian religions. As an influential medium to disperse ideas, music has appealed to people for generations. The audience in India was already familiar with hymns in local languages. Thus Sufi devotional singing was instantly successful among the populations. Music transmitted Sufi ideals seamlessly. In Sufism, the term music is called \"sa'ma\" or literary audition. This is where poetry would be sung to instrumental music; this ritual would often put Sufis into spiritual ecstasy. The common depiction of whirling dervishes dressed in white cloaks come to picture when paired with \"sa'ma.\" Many Sufi traditions encouraged poetry and music as part of education. Sufism spread widely with their teachings packaged in popular songs accessing mass demographics. Women were especially affected; often used to sing Sufi songs during the day and in female gatherings. Sufi gatherings today are known as qawwali. One of the biggest contributors to the musical Sufi tradition was Amir Khusro (d. 1325). Known as a disciple of Nizamuddin Chishti, Amir was known as the most talented musical poet in the early Muslim period of India. He is considered the founder of Indo-Muslim devotional music traditions. Nicknamed \"Parrot of India,\" Amir Khusro furthered the Chishti affiliation through this rising Sufi pop culture within India.\n\nThe massive geographic presence of Islam in India can be explained by the tireless activity of Sufi preachers. Sufism had left a prevailing impact on religious, cultural, and social life in South Asia.The mystical form of Islam was introduced by Sufi saints. Sufi scholars traveling from all over continental Asia were instrumental and influential in the social, economic, and philosophic development of India. Besides preaching in major cities and centers of intellectual thought, Sufis reached out to poor and marginalized rural communities and preached in local dialects such as Urdu, Sindhi, Panjabi versus Persian, Turkish, and Arabic. Sufism emerged as a \"moral and comprehensive socio-religious force\" that even influenced other religious traditions such as Hinduism., Their traditions of devotional practices and modest living attracted all people. Their teachings of humanity, love for God and Prophet continue to be surrounded by mystical tales and folk songs today. Sufis were firm in abstaining from religious and communal conflict and strived to be peaceful elements of civil society. Furthermore, it is the attitude of accommodation, adaptation, piety, and charisma that continues to help Sufism remain as a pillar of mystical Islam in India.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14236076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14236076", "title": "The Question Concerning Technology", "text": "The Question Concerning Technology\n\nThe Question Concerning Technology () is a work by Martin Heidegger, in which the author discusses the essence of technology. Heidegger originally published the text in 1954, in \"Vorträge und Aufsätze\".\n\nHeidegger initially developed the themes in the text in the lecture \"The Framework\" (\"Das Gestell\"), first presented on December 1, 1949, in Bremen. \"The Framework\" was presented as the second of four lectures, collectively called \"Insight into what is.\" The other lectures were titled \"The Thing\" (\"Das Ding\"), \"The Danger\" (\"Die Gefahr\"), and \"The Turning\" (\"Die Kehre\").\n\nThe question concerning technology, is asked, as Heidegger notes, “so as to prepare a free relationship to it”. As further noted, the relationship will be free “if it opens our human existence to the essence of technology”. This stems from the fact that “Only the true brings us into a free relationship with that which concerns us from out of its essence”. Thus, questioning uncovers the questioned in its (true) essence as it is; enabling it to be “experienced within its own bounds”. Heidegger's questioning builds a way by seeking “the true by way of the correct”. This is akin to the Aristotelian way of advancing “from what is more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature” \n\nHeidegger begins the question by noting that “We ask the question concerning technology when we ask what it is”. This stems from following an ancient doctrine to which “the essence of a thing is considered to be what the thing is”. He starts from the correct or clear definition that “Everyone knows ; the two statements that answer our question”. These are “Technology is a means to an end [and] a human activity”. The reason granted is that “to posit ends and procure and utilize the means to them is a human activity”. If technology is a means to a human end, this conception can therefore be “called the instrumental and anthropological definition of technology”. This further means that one has to ask “What is the instrumental itself?”. This entails questioning the purview of instrumentality in which means and ends are subsumed. As noted “Within what do such things as means and end belong?”.\n\nA means can be seen as that through, and by which an end is effected. As pointed out, it is that “whereby something is effected and thus attained”. In essence, it can be seen as a cause, for “Whatever has an effect as its consequence is called a cause”. But an end is also a cause to the extent that it determines the kind of means to be used to actualize it. As noted, “The end in keeping with which the kind of means to be used is determined is also considered a cause”. This conceptualization of instrumentality as means and ends leads the question further into causality. As noted “Wherever ends are pursued and means are employed, wherever instrumentality reigns, there reigns causality”.\n\nTo question causality, Heidegger starts from what “For centuries philosophy has taught”. As noted, it has claimed that “there are four causes”. These are traditionally enumerated as the “ \"causa materialis,\" the material, the matter out of which\" something is made. The \"“causa formalis,\" the form, the shape into which the material enters”. The “ \"causa finalis,\" the end,in relation to which [the thing] required is determined as to its form and matter\" : and the \"“causa efficiens,\" which brings about the effect that is the finished [thing]”. As concluded, “What technology is, when represented as a means, discloses itself when we trace instrumentality back to fourfold causality. To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a silver chalice. Each element works together to create the chalice in a different manner:\n\nThus four ways of owing hold sway in the sacrificial vessel that lies ready before us. They differ from one another, yet they belong together. ... The four ways of being responsible bring something into appearance. They let it come forth into presencing. They set it free to that place and so start it on its way, namely into its complete arrival.\nWhen these four elements work together to create something into appearance, it is called \"bringing-forth\". This bringing-forth comes from the Greek \"poiesis\", which \"brings out of concealment into unconcealment\". This revealing can be represented by the Greek word \"aletheia\", which in English is translated as truth. This truth has everything to do with the essence of technology because technology is a means of revealing the truth.\n\nModern technology, however, differs from \"poiesis\". Heidegger suggests that this difference stems from the fact that modern technology \"is based on modern physics as an exact science\". The revealing of modern technology, therefore, is not bringing-forth, but rather \"challenging-forth\". To exemplify this, Heidegger draws on the Rhine River as an example of how our modern technology can change a cultural symbol.\n\nTo further his discussion of modern technology, Heidegger introduces the notion of \"standing-reserve\". Modern technology places humans in standing-reserve. To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a forester and his relationship to the paper and print industries, as he waits in standing reserve for their wishes.\n\nHeidegger once again returns to discuss the essence of modern technology to name it \"Gestell\", which he defines primarily as a sort of enframing:\n\nEnframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing that holds sway in the essence of modern technology and that it is itself not technological.\n\nOnce he has discussed enframing, Heidegger highlights the threat of technology. As he states, this threat \"does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology\". Rather, the threat is the essence because \"the rule of enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth\". This is because challenging-forth conceals the process of bringing-forth, which means that truth itself is concealed and no longer unrevealed. Unless humanity makes an effort to re-orient itself, it will not be able to find revealing and truth.\n\nIt is at this point that Heidegger has encountered a paradox: humanity must be able to navigate the dangerous orientation of enframing because it is in this dangerous orientation that we find the potential to be rescued. To further elaborate on this, Heidegger returns to his discussion of essence. Ultimately, he concludes that \"the essence of technology is in a lofty sense ambiguous\" and that \"such ambiguity points to the mystery of all revealing, i.e., of truth\".\n\nThe question concerning technology, Heidegger concludes, is one \"concerning the constellation in which revealing and concealing, in which the coming to presence of the truth comes to pass\". In other words, it is finding truth. Heidegger presents art as a way to navigate this constellation, this paradox, because the artist, or the poet as Heidegger suggests, views the world as it is and as it reveals itself.\n\nMartin, Heidegger (1977). “The Question Concerning Technology, and Other Essays”\n\nAristotle, (1984). “Complete Works of Aristotle, Vol. 1 ”\n"}

{"id": "15393769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15393769", "title": "Zen master", "text": "Zen master\n\nZen master is a somewhat vague English term that arose in the first half of the 20th century, sometimes used to refer to an individual who teaches Zen Buddhist meditation and practices, usually implying longtime study and subsequent authorization to teach and transmit the tradition themselves.\n\nUntil the Tang Dynasty, the term \"Chánshī\" (禅师; Dhyana Master) was regularly used for a monk who was a master of chan, or meditation, versus those who specialized in Dharma (scriptural teachings) and Vinaya (discipline and moral precepts). This included several important figures who were later not considered to be part of the \"Chán school\" per se, such as Tiantai Master Zhiyi.\n\nIn contemporary China, the term \"Chán\" (禪), being simply one of many terms for forms of meditation, is not limited to the Chán school alone. Neither the majority of monastics nor lay people are formally tied to a given \"school\" of Buddhist practice, which is different from the situation in Japan. It is only those senior and experienced practitioners who receive such transmission into the Chán school. Most temples belong to the Chán school in name, but also embrace other teachings including those of Tiantai, Pure Land, Huayan, and Yogacara schools, often under the umbrella term \"Chinese Buddhism\" (中國佛教). This has been the norm for the past 1000 years, since the Song Dynasty.\n\nWhile there are no official organizations to regulate the use of honorary titles, \"chánshī\" is used as a title of respect for an adept, typically a monk, who specializes in Chán. \"Chánzōng Dàshī\" (禅宗大師; Great Master of the Chán School) is a similar and more specific honorary term, though rather rare. The same is true for the simple title \"Dàshī\" (大師; Great Master) which is rarely used to address a Dharma teacher (and any master of a specific craft or trade); the term is often bestowed posthumously by followers and students, although there are some exceptions (e.g. Hsing Yun).\n\nThe more common term when addressing a Buddhist master is \"Shīfu\" (師父; Master), which is also used for any monk or nun as a matter of respect. Strictly speaking, this term, which includes the relational term for \"father\" (父), refers more to one's own teacher or preceptor. The term \"Făshī\" (法師; Dharma teacher) is more generic, and is used both by lay Buddhists and also by Buddhists monastics themselves. The general term \"Lǎoshī\" (老師; Teacher) is also used to address a master as one's teacher, but this term is a general one, so much so that it is used for a teacher of any subject.\n\nThere is no standard official title for \"Zen Master\" across the various Zen traditions in Japan. Various titles may be used:\n\nIn Sōtō Zen, the title \"Dai-Osho\" is the highest priestly rank in a clear monastic hierarchy. It is only surpassed by \"Zenji\" which is only applied to Dōgen and Keizan (the founders of the school), and to the current or former abbots of the two head temples of the sect. To supervise training monks, further qualifications are required:\n\nIn Rinzai too, further training is needed to be qualified as a supervisor. The common transmission does not include \"inka shōmei\". Ideally \"inka shōmei\" is \"the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation\", but practically it is being used for the transmission of the \"true lineage\" of the masters (\"shike\") of the training halls. Training halls are temples which are authorised for further training after being qualified as a temple priest.\n\nAccording to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of \"roshi\" is equivalent to \"Zen master\" and \"shike\":\nThere are only about fifty to eighty of such \"inka shōmei\"-bearers in Japan:\nAccording to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto,\nThe \"shike\" is not married. The shike...\nThe shike is also the head of the sect (subschool of the Rinzai-school, with its own head temple). They appoint and dismiss the priests, and appoint the titles in the ranking system. Yet, \"the position as abbot [at Myōshinji] is based on election, each elected period lasting four years\".\n\nMugai Nyodai (1223 – 1298 CE), of Japan, was the first female Zen master in the world.\n\nSunim is the Korean title for a Buddhist monk or Buddhist nun of any tradition, and does not denote any specific rank or qualification. It is considered respectful to refer to senior monks or nuns in Korea as \"Kun sunim\", and this polite way of expressing the title can also denote some sort of realization on the part of the individual being addressed. In most Korean temples, a middle-aged monk assumes the role of a \"juji sunim\", who serves administrative functions. The eldest sunim is typically seen as a symbolic leader of the younger sunims.\n\nIn Korean Soen, Inka (In'ga) typically refers to the private acknowledgement of dharma transmission from a teacher to their student. \"Transmission\" is used to refer to the public ceremonial version of the same acknowledgement. Both are considered equal in authority and \"realization\". A monk with either In'ga or the public \"transmission\" is qualified to hold the post of Soen Sa, or \"Zen Master\" for a temple, and give transmission to their own students (either, In'ga or public \"transmission\"). The majority of Zen Masters in Korea have only received, and only give In'ga, with the formal transmission ceremony being far more rare.\n\nIn the Kwan Um School of Zen, founded by Korean Zen teacher Seung Sahn in America and Europe, a Zen master can be referred to as a \"Soen Sa Nim\" (\"Soen\" or \"Son\" being Korean for Chan, or Zen). Seung Sahn himself is usually referred to as \"Dae Soen Sa Nim\" (the honorific \"Dae\" means \"great\").\n\nKwan Um School of Zen is unique in the fact that it clearly distinguishes two \"levels\" of Zen teachers. \"Lower\" level is referred to as \"Ji Do Poep Sa Nim\", or Dharma master. Ji Do Poep Sa Nim is a person who has received only Inka (which in Kwan Um School of Zen is given during public ceremony as well). He/she is allowed to teach, but only within the school - if a Dharma master decides to leave the school, his/her title and teaching authority is considered void. A Ji Do Poep Sa Nim also cannot give Inka to other individuals.\n\nWhen a Ji Do Poep Sa Nim has his or her realization \"confirmed\" by several (typically three) Zen masters from outside the school, he/she becomes eligible for \"full\" transmission and the title of Zen master (Soen Sa Nim), which is given during another public ceremony. A Soen Sa Nim can give both Inka and transmission to other individuals and keeps his/her title and teaching authority if he/she decides to leave the school.\n\n\"Zen master\" has been used to refer to individuals hailing from any number of countries and traditions. It is not an exact translation of any title from the countries from which Zen traditions emanate, where titles vary widely, even in different traditions from the same country. Its usage has diminished among contemporary American Zen teachers and practitioners.\n\nThe term has entered popular culture and has been used to refer to any number of public figures in sports and entertainment, denoting a person who demonstrates detachment and control in stressful situations. It was sometimes adopted by figures in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s and 1980s who had little or no actual Zen training (\"Zen Master Rama,\" \"Osho\",) presumably to generate positive associations or legitimacy.\n\n\n\n"}
