{"id": "12", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12", "title": "Anarchism", "text": "Anarchism\n\nAnarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary, cooperative institutions, rejecting unjust hierarchy. These institutions are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations. Anarchism holds capitalism, the state, and representative democracy to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.\n\nWhile opposition to the state is central, anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations. Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.\n\nAnarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.\n\nThe word \"anarchism\" is composed from the word \"anarchy\" and the suffix -ism, themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. \"anarchy\" (from , \"anarchos\", meaning \"one without rulers\"; from the privative prefix ἀν- (\"an-\", i.e. \"without\") and , \"archos\", i.e. \"leader\", \"ruler\"; (cf. \"archon\" or , \"arkhē\", i.e. \"authority\", \"sovereignty\", \"realm\", \"magistracy\")) and the suffix or (\"-ismos\", \"-isma\", from the verbal infinitive suffix , \"-izein\"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as Maximilien Robespierre did the Hébertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word \"anarchist\" or \"anarchism\" in describing themselves or their beliefs.\n\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, the term \"libertarianism\" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only, referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism.\n\nThe earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote: \"A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation\". Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics as well as their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics. Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote: \"The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and [...] the first anarchist society was that of the apostles\". In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate, where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.\nThe French Renaissance political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie wrote in his most famous work the \"Discourse on Voluntary Servitude\" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term \"anarchist\" first entered the English language in 1642 during the English Civil War as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents. By the time of the French Revolution, some such as the Enraged Ones began to use the term positively in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing \"revolutionary government\" as oxymoronic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word \"anarchism\" had lost its initial negative connotation.\n\nModern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.\nAs part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought. According to Peter Kropotkin, Godwin was \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\" while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke.\n\nGodwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism. He argued in \"Political Justice\" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.\n\nHis aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people's \"mental enslavement\" the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.\n\nThe French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work \"What is Property?\", published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is \"Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order\". In \"What is Property?\", Proudhon answers with the famous accusation \"Property is theft\". In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed \"property\" (\"propriété\"), where owners have complete rights to \"use and abuse\" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called \"possession\", or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. However, Proudhon later added that \"Property is Liberty\" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.\n\nThe anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as \"libertarian\". Unlike Proudhon, he argued that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". In 1844, the post-Hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published in Germany the book, \"The Ego and Its Own\", which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism. French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included Anselme Bellegarrigue, Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and Proudhon himself.\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, liberals and nationalists along with anarchists to prevent further revolt. In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal \"El Porvenir\" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas. The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became President of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Federal Democratic Republican Party. According to George Woodcock: \"These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's\". According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\": \"During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralised, or \"cantonalist,\" political system on Proudhonian lines\".\n\nIn 1864, the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the First International) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William Batchelder Greene had been members of the First International. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF) Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International, which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property. At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.\n\nAnarchist historian George Woodcock reports: \"The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers\". In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.\n\nThe Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included Louise Michel, the Reclus brothers (Élie Reclus and Élisée Reclus) and Eugene Varlin (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the \"implementation of the binding mandate\" in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. George Woodcock states that \"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel\".\n\nThe anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to \"replace the privilege and authority of the State\" with the \"free and spontaneous organization of labour\". In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.\nIn response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event. On 3 May, a fight broke out in Chicago when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890, a second attempt—this time international in scope—to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.\n\nIn 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which were important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.\n\nIn 1881, the Spanish Workers Federation was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement—anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour, CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular, \"[t]he anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organisations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina [...] it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions\".\nSome anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because \"we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda\". Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself once boasted that \"the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion\". Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885, \"The Science of Revolutionary Warfare\", a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.\n\nBy the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, \"propaganda of the deed\" to refer to individual bombings, regicides and tyrannicides. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal \"expropriations\". Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it \"[t]he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (\"propaganda by the deed\") and the anarchist burglars (\"individual reappropriation\") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt\". France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.\n\nHowever, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts as soon as 1887. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in \"Le Révolté\" that \"a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite\". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without \"the individual dynamiter\".\n\nState repression (including the infamous 1894 French \"lois scélérates\") of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed in the first place to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and—following the suppression of the 1871—Paris Commune the execution and exile of many \"communards\" to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts.\n\nNumerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar Alexander II of Russia, President Sadi Carnot of France, Prime Minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo of Spain, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, King Umberto I of Italy, President William McKinley of the United States, King Carlos I of Portugal and King George I of Greece. McKinley's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine. In the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.\n\nExpelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new \"socialist\" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example and communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the General Confederation of Labour and Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) left the organisations and joined the Communist International.\n\nThe revolutionary wave of 1917–1923 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic, the anarchists Gustav Landauer, Silvio Gesell and Erich Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures. In the Italian events known as the \"biennio rosso\", the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana \"grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus \"Umanita Nova\", its daily paper) grew accordingly [...] Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces.\" In the Mexican Revolution, the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Magón.\n\nIn Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the \"Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\", was supported. Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America. Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and Benito Mussolini's fascists. Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation \"Arditi del Popolo\", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as \"the preventive counter-revolution\". In France, where the far-right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.\n\nAnarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II. In Germany, the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, labelled him as one of \"those Jewish subversives\". Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, Oranienburg. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.\n\nIn Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. However, the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in 1939 in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republicans cause from the Soviet Union. According to Noam Chomsky, \"the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the Republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because Stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against Adolf Hitler. That failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves\". The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia and parts of Levante. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes. Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed \"came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history\". Spanish Communist Party-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri, who volunteered to fight against Francisco Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party. The city of Madrid was turned over to the Francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist Melchor Rodríguez García.\n\nAnarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France. The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District. In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy. Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the \"Fraye Arbeter Shtime\" detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, \"Die Freie Gesellschaft\", which survived until 1953. In 1956, the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded. In 1955, the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation. The Syndicalist Workers' Federation (SWF) was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of Solidarity Federation's earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain (AFB). Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.\n\nAnarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as Albert Camus, Herbert Read, Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, Allen Ginsberg, George Woodcock, Leopold Kohr, Julian Beck, John Cage and the French Surrealist group led by André Breton, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.\n\nAnarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day. Anarcho-pacifism became a \"basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War\". The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's , \"Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)\".\n\nA surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts. In 1968, in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.\n\nIn the United Kingdom in the 1970s, this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid-20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those \"who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits\" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are \"much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous, feminist, ecological and cultural-critical ideas\" and who by the turn of the 21st century formed \"by far the majority\" of anarchists.\n\nSince the 1980s, anarchism has grown into a strong political force in Latin America, with the development of Fejuve (1979), CIPO-RFM (1980s), Zapatistas (1994), Horizontilidad (2001) and the Oaxaca Uprising (2006). Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight (G8) and the World Economic Forum (WEF). Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as black blocs—other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999. According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, \"contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism [...] One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally\".\nInternational anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association and International Libertarian Solidarity. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.\n\nAnarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria (DFNS), more commonly known as Rojava, a \"de facto\" autonomous region in northern Syria. Abdullah Öcalan—a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) who is currently imprisoned in Turkey—is an iconic and popular figure in the DFNS whose ideas shaped the region's society and politics. While in prison, Öcalan corresponded with (and was influenced by) Murray Bookchin, an anarcho-communist theorist and philosopher who developed Communalism and libertarian municipalism. Modelled after Bookchin's ideas, Öcalan developed the theory of democratic confederalism. In March 2005, he issued his \"Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan\", calling upon citizens \"to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies, which he called 'democracy without the state'\".\n\nAnarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty, i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, \"recognising equality of entitlement\". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools—those created since the mid-20th century and after.\n\nBeyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate, and usually temporary, \"necessary evil\" but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was \"anarchism without adjectives\", a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the \"bitter debates\" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.\n\nMutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a \"positive anarchy\" where order arises when everybody does \"what he wishes and only what he wishes\" and where \"business transactions alone produce the social order.\" Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers' movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.\n\nMutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive \"just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount\". Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a \"third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property\".\n\nSocial anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or coercion. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for personal property) and emphasises cooperation and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].\n\n[[Collectivist anarchism]], also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.\n\nHowever, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed \"according to need\" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively \"uphold[ing] the wages system\". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]], but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]—although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.\n\n[[File:Kropotkin2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Kropotkin]] was influential in the development of [[anarcho-communism]]]]\n[[Anarcho-communism]] (also known as anarchist-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, [[market (economics)|markets]], money, [[private property]] (while retaining respect for personal property) and capitalism in favour of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \"[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]\".\n\nSome forms of anarchist communism such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]] are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.\n\nAnarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French Revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections. To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e. established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and the [[Free Territory]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of [[Revolutionary Catalonia|anarchist Catalonia]] before being crushed by the combined forces of the [[Francoist Spain|regime that won the war]], Hitler, Mussolini, Communist Party of Spain repression (backed by the Soviet Union) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend—through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine—anarcho-communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.\n\n[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|[[International Workers' Day|May Day]] 2010 demonstration of Spanish [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in Bilbao, Basque Country]]\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement. Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"—rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet \"Anarcho-Syndicalism\". The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish CNT played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.\n\n[[Individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it instead refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.\n\nIn 1793, William Godwin, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote \"[[Political Justice]]\", which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin was a philosophical anarchist and from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present \"necessary evil\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.\n\n[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Stirner]] (here in a sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]) is usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist]]\nAn influential form of individualist anarchism, called \"egoism\", or [[egoist anarchism]], was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German [[Max Stirner]]. Stirner's \"[[The Ego and Its Own]]\", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were \"[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]\" in the mind and he held that society does not exist, but \"the individuals are its reality\". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]], non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. \"Egoism\" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and [[homosexual]] activist [[John Henry Mackay]].\n\n[[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, \"The Peaceful Revolutionist\", was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] [...] William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\". [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books \"[[Walden]]\", a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, as well as his essay, \"[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]\", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Benjamin Tucker later fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication \"[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]\".\n\nFrom these early influences, individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals, [[free love]] and [[birth control]] advocates (see [[anarchism and issues related to love and sex]]), individualist [[naturist]]s and [[nudist]]s (see [[anarcho-naturism]]), [[freethought]] and [[anti-clerical]] activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and [[individual reclamation]] (see [[European individualist anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism in France]]). These authors and activists included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Emile Armand]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Henri Zisly]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], [[Adolf Brand]] and [[Lev Chernyi]] among others.\n\n[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lawrence Jarach]] (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right), two prominent [[Contemporary anarchism|contemporary anarchist]] authors: Zerzan is known as prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] while Jarach is a noted advocate of [[post-left anarchy]]]]\nAnarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.\n\n[[Insurrectionary anarchism]] is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises [[insurrection]] within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organisations such as [[labour unions]] and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small [[affinity group]] based organisation. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.\n\n[[Green anarchism]] (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]. Writing from a green anarchist perspective, [[John Zerzan]] attributes the ills of today's social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization. While [[Layla AbdelRahim]] argues that \"the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies, whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence\". Thus, according to her, civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics. Language and literacy, she claims, are some of these technologies.\n\n[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that \"as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist\". Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].\n\n[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see [[non-violence]]). It developed mostly in the Netherlands, Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War. Christian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines anarchism and Christianity. Its main proponents included [[Leo Tolstoy]], Dorothy Day, Ammon Hennacy and [[Jacques Ellul]].\n\n[[Religious anarchism]] refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of (organized) religions, but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to [[organized religion]]. Many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism, most notably Christianity as Christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy. Non-Christian forms of religious anarchism include [[Buddhist anarchism]], [[Jewish anarchism]] and most recently [[Neopaganism]].\n\n[[Synthesis anarchism]] is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the [[anarcho-communists]] [[Voline]] and [[Sébastien Faure]]. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global [[International of Anarchist Federations]].\n\n[[Platformism]] is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda's \"Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\". The document was based on the experiences of [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The \"Platform\" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.\n\n[[Post-left anarchy]] is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional [[left-wing politics]]. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general also presenting a critique of organisations and [[morality]]. Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist [[Situationist International]], post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.\n\n[[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-left anarchy, [[postmodernism]], [[autonomism]], [[postcolonialism]] and the [[Situationist International]].\n\n[[Queer anarchism]] is a form of [[socialism]] which suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the [[LGBT community]], mainly [[heteronormativity]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]] and [[biphobia]]. Anarcho-queer arose during the late 20th century based on the work of Michel Foucault \"[[The History of Sexuality]]\".\n\n[[Left-wing market anarchism]] strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labour positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.\n\n[[Anarcho-capitalism]] advocates the elimination of the state in favour of [[self-ownership]] in a [[free market]]. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from [[Austrian School]] economics, study of [[law and economics]] and [[public choice theory]]. There is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as [[Anarchism and capitalism|incompatible]] with capitalist forms.\n\n[[Anarcho-transhumanism]] is a recently new branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism, typically drawing from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[left-libertarianism]] or [[Libertarian socialist|libertarian socialism]] and combines it with [[transhumanism]] and [[post-humanism]]. It can be described as a \"liberal democratic revolution, at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives. Reason, science, and technology provide one kind of control, slowly freeing us from ignorance, toil, pain, disease and limited lifespans (aging)\". Some anarcho-transhumanists might also follow [[technogaianism]].\n\n[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|left|Which forms of violence (if any) are [[anarchism and violence|consistent with anarchist values]] is a controversial subject among anarchists]]\n\nAnarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and as such disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[syndicalism]]/[[trade unionism]] and [[capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.\n\nPhenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism) and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.\n\nOn a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].\nIntersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.\n\n[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]\nAn important current within anarchism is [[free love]]. Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women, see for example marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. The most important American free love journal was \"[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]\" (1883–1907), edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]], but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's \"[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]\" (1872–1890, 1892–1893). \"[[Free Society]]\" (1895–1897 as \"The Firebrand\"; 1897–1904 as \"Free Society\") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The publication advocated free love and women's rights and critiqued \"[[Comstockery]]\"—i.e. censorship of sexual information. Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.\n\nIn New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman \"has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public\". Before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based [[German language]] journal \"Der arme Teufel\" (English: The Poor Devil). In Argentina, anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called \"\" (English: \"The Woman's Voice\"), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897 and was revived briefly in 1901.\n\nIn Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand. He proposed the concept of \"la camaraderie amoureuse\" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]]. In Germany, the [[Stirnerism|Stirnerists]] Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. [[Mujeres Libres]] was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], Mercedes Comaposada and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a \"double struggle\" for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. Lucía Sánchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her [[lesbian]]ism. She was published in a variety of literary journals while working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment.\n\nMore recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual \"[[The Joy of Sex]]\". The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as \"Théorie du corps amoureux. Pour une érotique solaire\" (2000) and \"L'invention du plaisir. Fragments cyréaniques\" (2002).\n\n[[File:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Anarchism in Spain|Catalan anarchist]] pedagogue and [[Freethought|free thinker]]]]\nFor English anarchist William Godwin, education was \"the main means by which change would be achieved\". Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness. For Godwin, education had to have a \"respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion\", a \"pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives\" and a \"concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school\". In his \"[[Political Justice]]\", he criticises state sponsored schooling \"on account of its obvious alliance with national government\". Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established. Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called \"[[The False Principle of our Education]]\" in which Stirner names his educational principle \"personalist\", explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create \"free men, sovereign characters\", by which he means \"eternal characters [...] who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment\".\n\nIn the United States, freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-Christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to \"Liberty\" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of \"Freethought\" and, for a time, \"The Truth Seeker\". E.C. Walker was co-editor of \"[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]\" and many anarchists were \"ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as \"Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\", \"Freethought\" and \"The Truth Seeker\" appeared in \"Liberty\"... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself\".\n\nIn 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established \"modern\" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools' stated goal was to \"educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting\". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in \"freedom in education\", education free from the authority of church and state. Murray Bookchin wrote: \"This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally\". La Escuela Moderna and Ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of \"[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]\" in the United States, Cuba, South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper \"[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]\", founded in 1901. Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate. Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. He thought that \"[e]ducation is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself [...] Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary\". For him, \"without compulsion, education was transformed into culture\".\n\nA more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921. Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach. In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.\n\n\nCriticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Anarchism| ]]\n[[Category:Anti-capitalism]]\n[[Category:Anti-fascism]]\n[[Category:Far-left politics]]\n[[Category:Libertarian socialism]]\n[[Category:Political culture]]\n[[Category:Political ideologies]]\n[[Category:Social theories]]"}

He is married to Paola Bučan, a famous Croatian cellist and teacher who, until her retirement in 2014 was a tenured professor at the \"Conservatorio di Musica\" in Perugia (Italy).\n\nHe was a disciple of Goffredo Petrassi – alongside other distinguished musicians such as Ennio Morricone, Aldo Clementi, and Sergio Cafaro. Although he was initially influenced by neoclassical poetics, he later evolved towards the use of the harmonic language of the late Renaissance period, which he has used with originality in order to build his own musical research which directly influenced his later compositional processes.\n\nHe started composing when only 12 years old. His career is effectively in two distinct and different periods – the first being up until 1967 during which time he gained a wide national and international success. From 1968, as consequence of the evolution of both his thought and his social involvement, he abstained from composing, a period which lasted for the next twenty years. During that time he devoted himself to a grassroots cultural practice and set up the Metacultural Centre, located at Cantalupo in Sabina (Rieti, Italy). In 1988 he began to compose again with renewed enthusiasm, starting on a new and different compositional phase.\n\nAs a musical critic he has written essays about his master, Goffredo Petrassi along with several other important texts about music; among them \"Musica/Società\" (Einaudi, 1975) stands out, going beyond purely musical issues and authoritatively examines and explores the fields of social and political analysis.\n\nHe has taught new didactics of composition at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome and he has been director of the Research and Experimental Centre \"Musica in Sabina\". Among his many disciples are Jesús Villa-Rojo, Luca Lombardi, Celestino Dionisi, Giuliano d'Angiolini, Derek Healey, James Clifford Brown, Claudio Pietro, Jorge (Manuel Rosado Marques) Peixinho, Armando Santiago, Oliver Wehlmann, Massimo Fornetti, Alessandro De Rosa, Emanuele Pappalardo and many more.\n\nHis non compositional writings cover a number of other fields, especially pedagogy and grassroots didactics, but also philosophical reflections such as those expressed in \"Metacultural Hypothesis: an hypothesis for survival\" (1999).\n\nHe has a considerable and deep-seated interest in natural sciences which have led him to becoming something of an authority in entomology and especially in coleopterology.\n\nHe has written a rich collection of poetry, especially in German, his mother tongue.\n\nHis deep interest in the global problems affecting contemporary society have led Boris Porena, together with the Metacultural Centre, to formulate the Metacultural Hypothesis (MCH), also known as \"the Hypothesis\".\n\nThis Hypothesis has known several formulations.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery one of our acts or thoughts, being a possible communication object, has in itself a cultural component which must be relativised with regard to the culture which has produced it.\n\nBut also:\n\nMCH coincides with the interruption of the principle of non contradiction.\n\nAnd even in a third form:\n\nGiven any proposition \"p\", it is always possible either to find or to build a local cultural universe LCU within which \"p\" becomes 'true'\n\n\n\nHis rich musical production, which comprises hundreds of works, has been accurately catalogued by prof.

Morris\n\nCharles William Morris (May 23, 1901 – January 15, 1979) was an American semiotician and philosopher.\n\nA son of Charles William and Laura (Campbell) Morris, Charles William Morris was born on May 23, 1901, in Denver, Colorado.\n\nMorris briefly attended the University of Wisconsin, and later studied engineering and psychology at Northwestern University, where he graduated with a B.S. in 1922. That same year, he entered the University of Chicago where he became a doctoral student in philosophy under the direction of George Herbert Mead. Morris completed his dissertation on a symbolic theory of mind and received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1925.\n\nAfter his graduation, Morris turned to teaching, first at Rice University, and later at the University of Chicago. In 1958 he became Research Professor at the University of Florida. His students included semiotician Thomas A. Sebeok. In 1937 Morris presided over the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association, and was Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nMorris was an instructor of philosophy for six years from 1925 to 1931 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. After leaving Rice, he was associate professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago from 1931 to 1947. Morris became a lecturing professor at Chicago in 1948, occupying the position until 1958 when he received an offer for a special appointment as a Research Professor at the University of Florida, where he remained until his death.\n\nDuring his time at Rice University, Morris wrote and defended his philosophical perspective known as neo-pragmatism. He also worked on and published \"Six Theories of Mind\". At the end of his term at Rice, Morris returned to the University of Chicago. In the early 1930s, the University of Chicago's philosophy department was unstable, but in the midst of change and difficult economic times, Morris felt that philosophy would serve as a torch that would light the way to saving world civilization. Morris had hoped to create an institute of philosophy at the University of Chicago, but his efforts to convince the university president of such a venture were unsuccessful.\n\nMorris's development of a behavioral theory of signs—i.e., semiotics—is partly due to his desire to unify logical positivism with behavioral empiricism and pragmatism. Morris's union of these three philosophical perspectives eventuated in his claim that symbols have three types of relations: \nHe later called these relations \"semantics\", \"pragmatics\", and \"syntactics\". Viewing semiotics as a way to bridge philosophical outlooks, Morris grounded his sign theory in Mead's social behaviorism. In fact, Morris's interpretation of an interpretant, a term used in the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce, has been understood to be strictly psychological. Morris's system of signs emphasizes the role of stimulus and response in the orientation, manipulation, and consummation phases of action. His mature semiotic theory is traced out in \"Signs, Language, and Behavior\" (1946). Morris's semiotic is concerned with explaining the tri-relation between syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics in a dyadic way, which is very different from the semiotics of C. S. Peirce. This caused some to argue that Morris misinterpreted Peirce by converting the interpretant into a logically \"existent\" thing.\n\nToward the end of his life in 1976, Morris sent two instalments of his work to the Institute for American Thought (IAT) at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Three years later in 1979, Morris's daughter, Sally Petrilli, arranged to have additional installments of his work sent to IUPUI. In 1984 Italian philosopher Ferruccio Rossi-Landi added to the Morris collection at IUPUI by sending his correspondence with Charles W. Morris. Among the vast Morris collection at the IAT are 381 titles of books and journal articles regarding pragmatism, logical empiricism, poetry, ethics, and Asian studies.\n\nIn 1925, Morris married Gertrude E. Thompson, with whom he had a daughter, Sally Morris Petrilli. In 1951, he married his second wife, Ellen Ruth Allen, a psychologist.\n\nCharles William Morris died on January 15, 1979 in Gainesville, Florida.\n\nWhile on sabbatical from the University of Chicago in 1934, Morris traveled abroad, visiting Europe and meeting working philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and members of the Vienna Circle, like Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and Moritz Schlick. Morris was greatly impressed with the logical positivist (logical empiricist) movement. While presenting a paper in Prague at the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy, he discussed his hopes for a union of pragmatism and positivism. Sympathetic to the positivist's philosophical project, Morris became the most vocal advocate in the United States for Otto Neurath's \"Unity of Science Movement\".\n\nDuring the 1930s, Morris helped several German and Austrian philosophers emigrate to the United States, including Rudolf Carnap in 1936. As a part of the \"Unity of Science Movement\", Morris worked closely with Neurath and Carnap to produce the \"International Encyclopedia of Unified Science\". As co-editor of the \"Encyclopedia\", Morris procured publication in America from the University of Chicago Press. His involvement with the \"Encyclopedia\" spanned for ten years when the project lost momentum in 1943. Both Morris and Carnap found it difficult to keep the \"Encyclopedia\" alive due to insufficient funds. In the latter part of the 1940s, Morris was finally able to secure funding that allowed the project to last until its final publication in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1089443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1089443", "title": "Christianity and Hellenistic philosophy", "text": "Christianity and Hellenistic philosophy\n\nChristianity and Hellenistic philosophies experienced complex interactions during the first to the fourth centuries.\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout the Hellenic world, an increasing number of church leaders were educated in Greek philosophy. The dominant philosophical traditions of the Greco-Roman world then were Stoicism, Platonism, and Epicureanism. Stoicism and, particularly, Platonism were readily incorporated into Christian ethics and Christian theology.\n\nChristian assimilation of Hellenic philosophy was anticipated by Philo and other Greek-speaking Alexandrian Jews. Philo's blend of Judaism, Platonism, and Stoicism strongly influenced Christian Alexandrian writers like Origen and Clement of Alexandria, as well as, in the Latin world, Ambrose of Milan.\n\nOne early Christian writer of the 2nd and early 3rd century, Clement of Alexandria, demonstrated Greek thought in writing, \n\nThe Church historian Eusebius suggested, essentially, in his preparation for the Gospel that Greek philosophy, although in his view derivative, was concordant with Hebrew notions. Augustine of Hippo, who ultimately systematized Christian philosophy, wrote in the 4th and early 5th century, \n\nJohn Burnet (1892) noted\n\nCommentary from Sir William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology (1870, p. 620).\n\nIt was not until the fusion of Platonic and Aristotelian theology with Christianity that the concepts of strict omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence became commonplace. The Platonic Theory of Forms had an enormous influence on Hellenic Christian views of God. In those philosophies, Forms were the ideals of every object in the physical world, and objects in the physical world were merely shadows of those perfect forms. Platonic philosophers were able to theorize about the forms by looking at objects in the material world, and imagining what the \"Perfect\" tree, or \"Perfect\" man would be. The Aristotelian view of God grew from these Platonic roots, arguing that God was the Infinite, or the Unmoved mover.\n\nHellenic Christians and their medieval successors then applied this Form-based philosophy to the Christian God. Philosophers took all the things that they considered good, Power, Love, Knowledge and Size, and posited that God was \"infinite\" in all these respects. They then concluded that God was omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and omnibenevolent. Since God was perfect, any change would make him less than perfect, so they asserted that God was unchanging, or immutable.\n\nAnselm of Canterbury, a priest, monk, and philosopher defined God as the \"Being than which no greater can be conceived.\" Almost 200 years later, Thomas Aquinas, in his \"Summa Theologiae\", article 3, wrote succinctly: \"By 'God', however, we mean some infinite good\".\n\nWith the establishment of the formal church, the development of creeds and formal theology, this view of God as Omni-Everything became nearly universal in the Christian World.\n\nAnselm of Canterbury composed the ontological argument for the existence of God, which he believed to be irrefutable. In essence, he argued that because God is, by definition, the being than which no greater can be conceived, and it is more perfect to exist than not to exist, God must exist. Conceiving God not to exist would be not conceiving God at all, as it would conceive a being less than perfect, which would not be God. Therefore, the argument proceeded, God could not be conceived not to exist.\n\nThe ontological argument is a defining example of the fusion of Hebrew and Greek thought. Philosophical realism was the dominant philosophical school of Anselm's day, and stemmed from Platonism. It held, in contrast to Nominalism, that things such as \"green\" and \"big\" were known as universals, which had a real existence in an abstract realm, as described by Plato. Accordingly, if a concept could be formed in the human mind, then it had a real existence in the abstract realm of the universals, apart from his imagination. In essence, if God could be imagined, God existed.\n\nThe ontological argument reflected the classical concept of \"perfections\". Size, intelligence, beauty, power, benevolence, and so forth: all the qualities are called perfections. What is more intelligent is more perfect as regards intelligence, what is more beautiful is more perfect as regards beauty, and so forth. Because existence was more perfect than non-existence and God was, by definition, perfect, God existed by definition.\n\nThe Platonic concepts of realism, perfection and a god that defined as infinite thus became incorporated into Christian medieval philosophy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12859904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12859904", "title": "Connexive logic", "text": "Connexive logic\n\nConnexive logic names one class of alternative, or non-classical, logics designed to exclude the so-called paradoxes of material implication. (Other logical theories with the same agenda include relevance logic, also known as relevant logic.) The characteristic that separates connexive logic from other non-classical logics is its rejection of Aristotle's Thesis, i.e. the formula,\n\n\nas a logical truth. Aristotle's Thesis asserts that no statement follows from its own denial. Stronger connexive logics also accept Boethius' Thesis,\n\n\nwhich states that if a statement implies one thing, it does not imply its opposite.\n\nConnexive logic is arguably one of the oldest approaches to logic. Aristotle's Thesis is named after Aristotle because he uses this principle in a passage in the \"Prior Analytics\".\nIt is impossible that the same thing should be necessitated by the being and the not-being of the same thing. I mean, for example, that it is impossible that B should necessarily be great if A is white, and that B should necessarily be great if A is not white. For if B is not great A cannot be white. But if, when A is not white, it is necessary that B should be great, it necessarily results that if B is not great, B itself is great. But this is impossible. \"An. Pr\". ii 4.57b3.\nThe sense of this passage is to perform a \"reductio ad absurdum\" proof on the claim that two formulas, (A → B) and (~A → B), can be true simultaneously. The proof is,\n\n\nAristotle then declares step 4 to be impossible, completing the \"reductio\". But if step 4 is impossible, it must be because Aristotle accepts its denial, ~(~B → B), as a logical truth.\n\nAristotelian syllogisms (as opposed to Boolean syllogisms) appear to be based on connexive principles. For example, the contrariety of A and E statements, \"All S are P,\" and \"No S are P,\" follows by a \"reductio ad absurdum\" argument similar to the one given by Aristotle.\n\nLater logicians, notably Chrysippus, are also thought to have endorsed connexive principles. By 100 C.E. logicians had divided into four or five distinct schools concerning the correct understanding of conditional (\"if...then...\") statements. Sextus Empiricus described one school as follows.\nAnd those who introduce the notion of connexion say that a conditional is sound when the contradictory of its consequent is incompatible with its antecedent.\nThe term \"connexivism\" is derived from this passage (as translated by Kneale and Kneale).\n\nIt is believed that Sextus was here describing the school of Chrysippus. That this school accepted Aristotle's thesis seems clear because the definition of the conditional,\n\n\nrequires that Aristotle's Thesis be a logical truth, provided we assume that every statement is compatible with itself, which seems fairly fundamental to the concept of compatibility.\n\nThe medieval philosopher Boethius also accepted connexive principles. In \"De Syllogismo Hypothetico\", he argues that from, \"If A, then if B then C,\" and \"If B then not-C,\" we may infer \"not-A,\" by modus tollens. However, this follows only if the two statements, \"If B then C,\" and \"If B then not-C,\" are considered incompatible.\n\nSince Aristotelian logic was the standard logic studied until the 19th Century, it could reasonably be claimed that connexive logic was the accepted school of thought among logicians for most of Western history. (Of course, logicians were not necessarily aware of belonging to the connexivist school.) However, in the 19th Century Boolean syllogisms, and a propositional logic based on truth-functions, became the standard. Since then, relatively few logicians have subscribed to connexivism. These few include E. J. Nelson and P. F. Strawson.\n\nThe objection that is made to the truth-functional definition of conditionals is that there is no requirement that the consequent \"actually follow\" from the antecedent. So long as the antecedent is false or the consequent true, the conditional is considered to be true whether there is any relation between the antecedent and the consequent or not. Hence, as the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce once remarked, you can cut up a newspaper, sentence by sentence, put all the sentences in a hat, and draw any two at random. It is guaranteed that either the first sentence will imply the second, or vice versa. But when we use the words \"if\" and \"then\" we generally mean to assert that there is some relation between the antecedent and the consequent. What is the nature of that relationship? Relevance (or relevant) logicians take the view that, in addition to saying that the consequent cannot be false while the antecedent is true, the antecedent must be \"relevant\" to the consequent. At least initially, this means that there must be at least some terms (or variables) that appear in both the antecedent and the consequent. Connexivists generally claim instead that there must be some \"real connection\" between the antecedent and the consequent, such as might be the result of real class inclusion relations. For example, the class relations, \"All men are mortal,\" would provide a real connection that would warrant the conditional, \"If Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal.\" However, more remote connections, for example \"If she apologized to him, then he lied to me,\" (suggested by Bennett) still defy connexivist analysis.\n\n"}

It is a film adaptation of Carl Sagan's 1985 novel of the same name; Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan wrote the story outline for the film.\n\nJodie Foster portrays the film's protagonist, Dr. Eleanor \"Ellie\" Arroway, a SETI scientist who finds strong evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact. The film also stars Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichtner, John Hurt, Angela Bassett, Rob Lowe, Jake Busey and David Morse.\n\nCarl Sagan and Ann Druyan began working on the film in 1979. Together, they wrote a 100+ page film treatment and set up \"Contact\" at Warner Bros. with Peter Guber and Lynda Obst as producers. When development stalled on the film, Sagan published \"Contact\" as a novel in 1985 and the film adaptation was rejuvenated in 1989. Roland Joffé and George Miller had planned to direct it, but Joffé dropped out in 1993 and Warner Bros. fired Miller in 1995. Robert Zemeckis was eventually hired to direct and filming for \"Contact\" lasted from September 1996 to February 1997. Sony Pictures Imageworks handled most of the visual effects sequences.\n\nThe film was released on July 11, 1997. \"Contact\" grossed approximately $171 million in worldwide box office totals. The film won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and received multiple awards and nominations at the Saturn Awards.\n\nDr. Ellie Arroway works for the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Guided into science and communication by her now-deceased father, she listens to radio emissions from space, hoping to find evidence of alien life. David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S. R. Hadden's company, which allows her to continue the project at the Very Large Array in New Mexico.\n\nFour years later, with Drumlin seeking to close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a sequence of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz to attempt to take control of the facility. Arroway's team then discover a second signal and find a video buried in the new signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's ionosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.\n\nThe project is put under tight security and its progress followed worldwide. Arroway learns that when the original frames of the Hitler video combined with the modified version shows that the signal also contains more than 63,000 pages of indecipherable data. The reclusive S. R. Hadden secretly meets on his airplane home with Arroway to provide the means to decode the pages, found when they are arranged in three dimensions rather than two-dimensional pages. The pages reveal schematics for a complex machine that is determined to be some kind of transport for a single occupant.\n\nThe nations of the world fund the construction of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious terrorist destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and dozens of others.\n\nA cancer-stricken Hadden, now in residence on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway that his company had secretly made a second machine in Japan and that Arroway will be the one to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, a sphere surrounded by a dodecahedron, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Pensacola, Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just her first step to joining other spacefaring species.\n\nArroway falls unconscious as she begins traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In an online private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to increase the number of dishes at the VLA from 27 to 72.\n\n\nCarl Sagan conceived the idea for \"Contact\" in 1979. The same year, Lynda Obst, one of Sagan's closest friends, was hired by film producer Peter Guber to be a studio executive for his production company, Casablanca FilmWorks. She pitched Guber the idea for \"Contact\", who commissioned a development deal. Sagan and Ann Druyan (who later became his wife) wrote a 100+ page film treatment, finishing in November 1980. Druyan explained: They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact.\n\nSagan incorporated Kip Thorne's study of wormhole space travel into the screenplay. The characterization of Dr. Ellie Arroway was inspired by Dr. Jill Tarter, head of Project Phoenix of the SETI Institute; Jodie Foster researched the lead role by meeting her. Tarter served as a consultant on the story, realistically portraying struggling careers of women scientists from the 1950s to 1970s. The writers debated whether Arroway should have a baby at the film's end. Although Guber was impressed with Sagan and Druyan's treatment, he hired various screenwriters to rewrite the script. New characters were added, one of them a Native American park ranger-turned-astronaut. Guber suggested that Arroway have an estranged teenage son, who he believed would add more depth to the storyline. Guber said: Sagan and Druyan disagreed with Guber's idea and it was not incorporated into the storyline. In 1982, Guber took \"Contact\" to Warner Bros. Pictures and with the film's development stalled, Sagan started to turn his original idea into a novel, which was published by Simon and Schuster in September 1985. The film adaptation remained in development and Guber eventually vacated his position at Warner Bros. in 1989.\n\nGuber became the new president of Sony Pictures Entertainment and tried to purchase the film rights of \"Contact\" from Warner, but the studio refused. Coincidentally, in 1989, Obst was hired as a new executive at Warner and began to fast track the film, by hiring more writers. Roland Joffé was eventually hired to direct, using a screenplay by James V. Hart. Joffé almost commenced pre-production before he dropped out and Obst then hired Michael Goldenberg to rewrite the script, who finished his second draft in late 1993. Goldenberg's second draft rekindled Warner Bros.' interest in \"Contact\" and Robert Zemeckis was offered the chance to direct, but he turned down the opportunity in favor of making a film based on the life of Harry Houdini. Zemeckis recalled: \n\nIn December 1993, Warner Bros. hired George Miller to direct and \"Contact\" commenced pre-production. Miller cast Jodie Foster in the lead role, approached Ralph Fiennes to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting Linda Hunt as the President of the United States. In addition to having aliens put on a laser lighting display around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth to the center of the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite \"Contact\" in an attempt to portray the Pope as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller's direction pre-production lasted longer than expected. The studio fired the director, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller's insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting. Robert Zemeckis, who previously turned down the director's position, decided to accept the offer. Warner Bros. granted Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege. The director cast Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss; McConaughey dropped out of the lead role in \"The Jackal\" to take the role in \"Contact\". Despite being diagnosed with myelodysplasia in 1994, Sagan continued to be involved in the production of the film. For the cast and main crew members, he conducted an academic conference that depicted a detailed history of astronomy.\n\nDuring the development of \"Contact\", the production crew watched Stanley Kubrick's \"\" (1968) for inspiration.\n\nPrincipal photography began on September 24, 1996, and ended on February 28, 1997. The first shooting took place at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico. \"Shooting at the VLA was, of course, spectacular but also one of the most difficult aspects of our filming,\" producer Steve Starkey said. \"It is a working facility, so in order for us to accomplish shots for the movie, we had to negotiate with the National Science Foundation for 'dish control' in order to move the dishes in the direction we needed to effect the most dramatic shot for the story.\" After arduous first weeks of location shooting in New Mexico and Arizona, production for \"Contact\" returned to Los Angeles for five months' worth of location and sound stage shooting that used a total of nine soundstages at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, and Culver Studios. All together, the art department created more than 25 sets.\n\nIn an attempt to create a sense of realism for the storyline, principal CNN news outlet commentators were scripted into \"Contact\". More than 25 news reporters from CNN had roles in the film and the CNN programs \"Larry King Live\" and \"Crossfire\" were also included. Ann Druyan makes a cameo appearance as herself, debating with Rob Lowe's character, Richard Rank, on \"Crossfire\". In January 1997, a second unit was sent to Puerto Rico for one week at the Arecibo Observatory.\n\nOther second unit work took place in Fiji and Newfoundland, Canada. Also essential to the production were a host of technical consultants from the SETI Institute, the California Institute of Technology, the VLA and a former White House staff member to consult on Washington D.C. and government protocol issues. Sagan visited the set a number of times, where he also helped with last-minute rewrites. Filming was briefly delayed with the news of his death on December 20, 1996. \"Contact\" was dedicated to Sagan: \"For Carl\" comes on the screen at the fade.\n\nCinematographer Don Burgess shot the film in anamorphic format using Panavision cameras as well as using large format 65mm and VistaVision for special effects shots. The sound designers used Pro Tools software for the audio mixing, which was done at Skywalker Sound.\n\nDesigning \"Contact\"s visual effects sequences was a joint effort among eight separate VFX companies. This team included Sony Pictures Imageworks, Peter Jackson's Weta Digital, George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic, and Effects Associates, with Pixar's RenderMan used for CGI rendering. Weta Digital, in particular, was responsible for designing the wormhole sequence. Jodie Foster admitted she had difficulty with blue screen technology because it was a first for the actress. \"It was a blue room. Blue walls, blue roof. It was just blue, blue, blue,\" Foster explained. \"And I was rotated on a Lazy Susan with the camera moving on a computerized arm. It was really tough.\"\n\nNews footage of then-President Bill Clinton was digitally altered to make it appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of \"The Jackal\". Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. \"Clinton gave his Mars rock speech,\" the director explained, \"and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open.\"\n\nOne notable feature of \"Contact\" is its use of digital color correction. This approach helped solve continuity errors during the location shooting at the Very Large Array in New Mexico. \"The weather killed us, so we were going back in and changing it enough so that the skies and colors and times of day all seem roughly the same,\" visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston commented.\n\nThe opening scene is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, beginning with a view of Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film \"Powers of Ten\" (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from \"The Day After Tomorrow\" (2004).\n\nOne sequence, with young Ellie running upstairs to try to retrieve her father's medicine, appears to have Ellie running just behind a camera as they move into the bathroom, but the shot resolves to show that this had been part of the medicine cabinet's mirror reflection, pulling back to have Ellie open it. This sequence is noted as one of the film's most impressive visual effects due to the seamlessness of the transition. According to Carin-Anne Strohmaier, the first assistant film editor, the shot was created through three different plates, digitally manipulated in CGI to create the effect: one plate was from the cameraman leading Ellie, the second of Ellie opening the cabinet door (which was a blue screen instead of a miror), and the third of the reflection of Ellie and her dad when the door closes. Initially, they had planned to use an effect similar to bullet time from \"The Matrix\" to show Ellie's father stopped in time as he dies, but as the movie was being filmed, they found that this approach would not fit the casting or direction the film was going, but they still wanted something that the audience would recognize as off-putting and without having to show Ellie's dad, leading to the development of this mirror sequence.\n\nThe decoding of the extraterrestrial message, with its architectural drawings of the machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effects shots, using a combination of model and miniature shots and digital computer work. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that \"The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable.\" He continued that \"it had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real.\" The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a conceptual design he had originally created to appear as the \"Time Displacement Device\" in in a scene that did not make the final cut.\n\nEarly conceptual designs of the Pod itself were based, as it existed in the novel, on one of the primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.\n\nThe climactic scene depicting the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near the core of the galaxy. Ralston said that \"the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream.\" To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied.\n\nThe Hitler newsreel also required digital manipulation.\n\nThe original score was composed by Alan Silvestri, most of which was released on August 19, 1997, by Warner Bros. Records. The full score is approximately an hour long, 44 minutes of which is on the CD, including every major cue. The CD track entitled \"Good to Go\" features a slightly different opening—a brief brass motif that is not in the film—but all other cues are identical in orchestration to the mix in the film.\n\nThe Region 2 Special Edition DVD release contains a 5.1 isolated score track, which presents the complete score (this feature, as with many isolated scores, is not mentioned in most product descriptions of the DVD).\n\n\"Contact\" often suggests that cultural conflicts between religion and science would be brought to the fore by the apparent contact with aliens that occurs in the film. A point of discussion is the existence of God, with several different positions being portrayed. A description of an emotionally intense experience by Palmer Joss, which he describes as seeing God, is met by Arroway's suggestion that \"some part of [him] needed to have it\"—that it was a significant personal experience but indicative of nothing greater. Joss compares his certainty that God exists to Arroway's certainty that she loved her deceased father, despite her being unable to prove it.\n\n\"Contact\" depicts intense debate occurring as a result of the apparent contact with aliens. Many clips of well-known debate shows such as \"Crossfire\" and \"Larry King Live\" are shown, with participants discussing the implications of the message, asking whether it is proof of the existence of alien life or of God, and whether science is encroaching upon religious ground by, as one believer puts it, \"talking to your god for you.\" The head of a religious organization casts doubt on the morality of building the machine, noting: \"We don't even know whether [the aliens] believe in God.\" The first machine is ultimately destroyed by a religious extremist, in the belief that building it was detrimental to humankind.\n\nAlthough the revelation at the end of the film that Arroway's recording device recorded approximately 18 hours of static is arguably conclusive proof of the fact of—if not the experience of—her \"journey\", several coincidences and indications throughout the film cast doubt on its authenticity. Director Robert Zemeckis indicated: \"The point of the movie is for there always to be a certain amount of doubt [as to whether the aliens were real].\" These indications consist mostly of visual cues during the \"journey\" that echo Ellie's experiences earlier in the film (which Ellie believed to be the result of the aliens \"downloading [her] thoughts and memories\"), but the timing of the message's arrival and its eventual decoding are also highly coincidental: the message was first received shortly before Arroway and her team were to be ejected from the VLA facility and was successfully decoded only by S.R. Hadden (Arroway's only sponsor, who was close to death from cancer) after weeks of failed attempts by the team at the VLA.\n\nAt the end of the film, Arroway is put into a position that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.\n\nZemeckis stated that he intended the message of the film to be that science and religion can coexist rather than being opposing camps, as shown by the coupling of scientist Arroway with the religious Joss, as well as his acceptance that the \"journey\" indeed took place. This, and scattered references throughout the film, posit that science and religion are not nominally incompatible: one interviewer, after asking Arroway whether the construction of the machine—despite not knowing what will happen when it is activated—is too dangerous, suggests that it is being built on the \"faith\" that the alien designers, as Arroway puts it, \"know what they're doing.\"\n\n\"Contact\"s release in July 1997 rekindled public interest in Sagan's 1985 novel. The book remained on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list from July 27 to September 21, 1997.\n\n\"Contact\" premiered on July 1, 1997, at the Westwood Theater in Los Angeles, California. The film was released in the United States on July 11, 1997, in 1,923 theaters, earning $20,584,908 in its opening weekend. \"Contact\" eventually grossed $100,920,329 in the US and $70,200,000 in foreign countries, reaching a worldwide total of $171,120,329.\n\n\"Contact\" was released on LaserDisc, VHS and the (then new) DVD format in December 1997. Among the special features, the DVD contains three separate audio commentaries by director Zemeckis and producer Starkey, another by visual effects supervisors Ken Ralston and Stephen Rosenbaum, along with one by star Jodie Foster. \"Contact\" was released on Blu-ray Disc on October 6, 2009.\n\nOn the basis of 63 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 62% of critics gave positive reviews, with an average score of 6.8/10. Metacritic calculated an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 23 reviews, denoting \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert said \"Contact\" was on par with Steven Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977) as Hollywood's most cinematic study of extraterrestrial life. \"Movies like \"Contact\" help explain why movies like \"Independence Day\" leave me feeling empty and unsatisfied,\" Ebert commented. On December 21, 2011, Ebert added \"Contact\" to his \"Great Movies\" collection.\n\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the film carried a more philosophical portrait of the science fiction genre than did other films, but still managed \"to satisfy the cravings of the general public who simply want to be entertained\". Internet reviewer James Berardinelli said \"Contact\" is \"one of 1997's finest motion pictures, and is a forceful reminder that Hollywood is still capable of making magic.\" Berardinelli felt the film was on par with Stanley Kubrick's \"\" (1968) to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" largely enjoyed the first 90 minutes of \"Contact\" but felt that director Robert Zemeckis was too obsessed with visual effects rather than cohesive storytelling for the pivotal climax.\n\nRita Kempley, writing in \"The Washington Post\", did not like the film's main premise, which she described as \"a preachy debate between sanctity and science.\"\n\nA meteorite was found in Antarctica in 1984, thought to be from Mars. Twelve years later, a paper by a NASA scientist was published in the journal \"Science\", proposing that the meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria (later, a disputed interpretation). The announcement made headlines around the world and the following day, on August 7, 1996, the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, made remarks about the news at a press conference that were, in places, sufficiently generic in nature to allow fragments of his videotaped statement to be included in \"Contact\", implying that Clinton was speaking about contact with extraterrestrial life, congruent with the film's story:\n\nLater in the film, a separate fragment of generic remarks by President Clinton, speaking about Saddam Hussein and Iraq at a different press conference in October 1994, was lifted out of context and inserted into \"Contact\":\n\nOn July 14, 1997, three days after the film opened in the United States, Warner Bros. received a letter from White House Counsel Charles Ruff protesting against the use of Clinton's digitally-composited appearance. The letter made no demands, but called the duration and manner of Clinton's appearance \"inappropriate\". No legal action was planned; the White House Counsel simply wanted to send a message to Hollywood to avoid unauthorized uses of the President's image. Zemeckis was reminded that official White House policy \"prohibits the use of the President in any way ... (that) implies a direct ... connection between the President and a commercial product or service.\"\n\nA Warner Bros. spokeswoman explained that \"we feel we have been completely frank and upfront with the White House on this issue. They saw scripts, they were notified when the film was completed, they were sent a print well in advance of the film's July 11 opening, and we have confirmation that a print was received there July 2.\" However, Warner Bros. did concede that they never pursued or received formal release from the White House for the use of Clinton's image. While the Counsel commented that parody and satire are protected under the First Amendment, press secretary Mike McCurry believed that \"there is a difference when the President's image, which is his alone to control, is used in a way that would lead the viewer to believe he has said something he really didn't say.\"\n\nShortly after the White House's complaint, CNN chairman, president, and CEO Tom Johnson announced he believed that in hindsight it was a mistake to allow 13 members of CNN's on-air staff (including Larry King and Bernard Shaw) to appear in the film, even though both CNN and Warner Bros. are owned by Time Warner. Johnson added that, for \"Contact\", the CNN presence \"creates the impression that we're manipulated by Time Warner, and it blurs the line.\" CNN then changed their policies for future films, which now requires potential appearances to be cleared through their ethics group.\n\nDirector George Miller, who had developed \"Contact\" with Warner Bros. before Zemeckis' hiring, unsuccessfully sued the studio over breach of contract policies.\n\nDuring filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the previous week. Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled \"First Contact\". Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published \"Contact\" and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.\n\nIn February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres dismissed Coppola's claim. Although Torres agreed that Sagan violated some terms of the contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, taking it to the California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola's claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over \"Contact\".\n\nThe scene where the NASA scientists give Arroway the \"cyanide pill\" caused some controversy during production and when the film came out. Gerald D. Griffin, the film's NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill \"just in case,\" and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all he or she would have to do is cut off their oxygen supply. However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills and they did it for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie as it seemed more suspenseful that way and it was also in line with Sagan's beliefs and vision of the film. Along with being NASA Technical Consultant for the project, Griffin had a cameo in the role of \"Dynamics\" in Mission Control. He had previously been technical advisor for Ron Howard's 1995 film \"Apollo 13\". While working for NASA during the Apollo Program, he had been the actual flight director for that mission, among others, and during the 1980s was the director of the Johnson Space Center.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1576865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1576865", "title": "D. H. Th. Vollenhoven", "text": "D. H. Th. Vollenhoven\n\nDirk Hendrik Theodoor Vollenhoven (1 November 1892, Amsterdam – 6 June 1978, Amsterdam) was a Dutch philosopher.\n\nVollenhoven was born in Amsterdam, son of Dirk Hendrik Vollenhoven and Catharina Pruijs. His father was a custom-house officer of telegraphy in Amsterdam. In 1911, Vollenhoven registered in two faculties at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, the Faculty of Theology and the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, and obtained his PhD in philosophy (\"cum laude\") in 1918. He was a pastor of the Reformed Churches, first in Oostkapelle, 1918-1921, then in The Hague, 1921-1926. He was appointed professor of philosophy at the Vrije Universiteit in 1926, and retired in 1963. On 10 October 1918 he married Hermina Maria Dooyeweerd (1892-1973). They had five children, two girls and three boys.\n\nVollenhoven was a person who combined direct clarity with deep insight. He had an analytical mind that mastered many distinctions. He was pious, modest, obliging, and dedicated in his many tasks. In the faculty of Arts and Philosophy he gave, from 1926 till 1954, all the courses in philosophy: history of philosophy, general systematic philosophy, logic, and theoretical psychology (the latter was considered to be a philosophical discipline at the time), and also the mandatory introduction to philosophy for first-year students of all the faculties.\nWhile preparing his dissertation on the influence of philosophy on mathematics and the natural sciences, Vollenhoven preached practically every Sunday, thereby becoming a well-known figure in the Reformed Churches. A year before gaining his PhD both his father and his supervisor and tutor, J. Woltjer, died. G.H.J.W.J. Geesink stepped in to supervise the completion of the thesis (now with restricted topic), entitled: “The philosophy of mathematics from a theistic standpoint.” The Amsterdam mathematician, Gerrit Mannoury, whom Vollenhoven had critically described as being “the most consequential formalist and communistic pragmatist,” responded sympathetically to the dissertation by saying that Vollenhoven had taken a path “that had not been blazed by anyone before,” and that he did this “neither as theologian nor as mathematician, but as one who cherished his faith, yet without despising thought.”\n\nIn the parsonage in Oostkapelle, and later in The Hague, Vollenhoven performed his duties conscientiously, but he also continued his study of philosophy. In 1920 he received a scholarship and leave of absence to study psychology under Felix Krueger for five months in Leipzig. In the early 1920s Neo-Kantianism was the dominant school in the Netherlands. In philosophy Vollenhoven sought the reconciliation of thought and being, mediated theistically, with the priority given to being. In about mid-1922 this was radicalized: knowing (and thought) is a part of being. Neo-Kantianism, contrariwise, took its departure from thought and justified this in humanistic fashion. In other words, Vollenhoven rowed against the main current of his time. His many commitments and interests led to his becoming overworked. In (mid-)January 1923 he suffered a mental collapse, the recuperation took up most of that year.\n\nIn the meantime Vollenhoven’s brother-in-law, chess mate, and former study chum Herman Dooyeweerd became active in philosophy. He visited Vollenhoven in Oostkapelle to discuss how he might work his way into philosophy more methodically. When both lived in The Hague, their discussions became more intense and searching, and an enduring partnership in philosophy developed that lasted a life-time. Yet their personalities were very different: Vollenhoven, with his analytical disposition, was the organizer, systematic thinker, and man of detailed historical overviews; Dooyeweerd, with his musical talent (he was a fine pianist), was a jurist by training, who sought the grand design. Vollenhoven had worked his way into the problems of mathematics, the natural sciences, biology, psychology, epistemology, and theology, while Dooyeweerd had a good command of sociology, economics, and jurisprudence. From the end of 1923 on, both advanced a “reformed philosophy” (what they referred to as “Calvinistic philosophy,” now usually called Reformational philosophy). They were simultaneously appointed to university chairs at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam in 1926, Dooyeweerd in the Juridical Faculty, Vollenhoven in the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy as the successor of Geesink.\n\nAs professor, Vollenhoven was exacting but also exploratory and eager to pursue new avenues. Towards his students he was pastorally mild and sympathetic, which won him popularity and respect. In 1929 he became president of the university’s alumni organization and in 1930 an honorary member of the student fraternity. Also in 1930 the Calvinistic Student Movement (in Dutch: CSB) was formed, which often called on Vollenhoven for advice and invited him as speaker. From about this time more intense contact took place with Klaas Schilder. Schilder was a Reformed theologian, who played a dominant role in the split in the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1944, a development much lamented by Vollenhoven.\n\nAfter his illness in 1923, Vollenhoven began openly to criticize the dogma of the immortality of the soul. This was first initiated by A. Janse, a self-taught elementary school principal with whom Vollenhoven struck up a friendship. In “The first questions of psychology” (1929), a published lecture, Vollenhoven explained that the soul, as usually understood, is not an immortal substance but rather the psyche as a function of the human being, which operates within an aspect (or “law-sphere”) of reality. He took the soul itself to be the central unity of the heart of the human being. Vollenhoven had no enemies, but he did gain his first opponents in this connection among psychologists, in particular Jan Waterink, who defended the distinct reality of body, soul, and spirit.\n\nThe syllabus for the introductory course to philosophy, entitled \"Isagôgè Philosophiae\" (1930), was the first document to summarize the new “Reformational philosophy.” (Vollenhoven always referred to it as “Calvinistic philosophy,” a term he first used in his inaugural address of 1926.) It attracted many and led to the formation of a distinct school in philosophy. In his Vice-Chancellor’s oration, given during his term (1932-1933) as Vice-Chancellor of the university, he discussed “The necessity of a Christian logic.” Vollenhoven criticized the so-called “neutrality” of logic. The latter uses logic as mere instrument of analysis, guided by the epistemological subject, rather than viewing logic as contributing substantively to the understanding through its principles. When shortly afterwards Vollenhoven’s book appeared, \"Calvinism and the Reformation of Philosophy\" (1933), this clarified his program, but it also elicited criticism (from H.H. Kuyper, V. Hepp), especially regarding Vollenhoven’s opposition to scholasticism. In response Vollenhoven displayed perseverance without becoming polemical: “We must not seek conflict but work constructively.”\n\nWhile Vollenhoven and Dooyeweerd worked in close cooperation, each retained his independence. Dooyeweerd defended Reformational philosophy from the standpoint of a transcendental critique. This critique sought to expose the dependence of thought, particularly theoretical thought, on religion. Vollenhoven was keener on setting out the viable religious presuppositions of any understanding of reality.\n\nFor example, in ontology Vollenhoven opposed the notion of a concept of being that encompasses God, cosmos, and the human being. Vollenhoven’s primary distinction was that of the Trinity, who \"is\", the law for the cosmos that \"holds\", and the created cosmos, which is entirely \"sustained\" by God. In connection with the cosmos, different fundamental aspects (“law-spheres”) are distinguished—fifteen of which have been made explicit—in which creatures function. As to the human being, outwardly its functions are “structured throughout,” inwardly there is the direction-determining soul or heart, “out of which are the issues of life.” The law, which in a generic sense forms a boundary limit for created reality, involves a three-fold specification: (i) there is the \"creation command\" (the “let there be …” of Genesis 1) relevant to “the origination, structure, whereby is implicit its modal diversity [of law-spheres], and the internal development of each kingdom”; (ii) the \"love command\", which “concerns the [moral] direction of human life in its relation to God and fellow human being”; and (iii) the \"positive laws\", which “bridge the love command and the concrete situation” in need of regulation “in light of society’s purpose, historical phase, and geographical location.”\n\nSince “knowing is a part of being,” the theory of knowledge presupposes ontology, hence analysis needs to proceed from created reality and respect its being law-bound. Theology, in turn, is dependent on revelation, rather than on logically drawn conclusions about the being of God. The latter procedure ignores the boundary that defines our human limitation.\n\nAs to the history of philosophy, Vollenhoven concentrated on developing a problem-historical method. A philosopher finds himself in a network of relations with his contemporaries and predecessors. This is reflected in his philosophical position, on the one hand in how he deals with current problems of his time and attempts to supersede them, on the other hand in evidencing preference for how a specific tradition of thought treats the problems that recur in all thought. The discussion of current problems is usually conducted in terms of a uniformity of style, focusing on those features that are taken to be normative or involving a view of truth or of law that is deemed fitting for such contemporary discussions. Seen from a greater range of time, the distinct styles of what were contemporary approaches give rise to historically distinct periods, in temporal succession, that Vollenhoven refers to as “time-currents” in philosophy (e.g., Hellenism, Neoplatonism, Waning Middle Ages, the Age of Enlightenment, Positivism, Existentialism, Postmodernism). \nOn the other hand, the treatment of recurring problems centers on ontology and its influence on the variety of views concerning the world (or the cosmos, which may include the world of the gods, such as in Gnosticism) and concerning anthropology, often seen as reflecting the structure of the world. Vollenhoven finds that the ontologies that predominate in cosmology and anthropology are either monistic or dualistic, each kind giving rise to a variety of traditional “types of ontology” (e.g., Priority theory, Interactionism, Parallelism, Platonizing or Aristotelian hylomorphism). \nIn summary any philosopher’s position can be situated in the crossing of a time-current and a type of ontology, which at the same time brings together and characterizes the philosophical conception of problems relevant for that position. The overall aim of the problem-historical method is to make visible the lay-out of currents and types, and thereby the basic problems of thought throughout the whole history of philosophy, from Hesiod to Martin Heidegger.\n\nVollenhoven hoped to publish a multi-volume history of philosophy, in cooperation with two of his former students, S. U. Zuidema and K. J. Popma. Many course notes had become syllabi between 1926 and 1948. In 1950 the first volume of the \"History of Philosophy\" appeared, covering the period of ancient philosophy prior to Plato and Aristotle. At first the work was well received. But despite its 600 pages, the book remained a grand torso. Several philosophers convened (H.J. Pos, Willem Jacob Verdenius, D. Loenen, Ms. C.J. de Vogel) to respond and together they aggressively criticized the book, particularly seizing on its ontological take-off point and problem-historical method. They also successfully advised against the federal funding of the second volume of this project. Vollenhoven was forced to seek other means. He was able to publish his problem-historical results in the philosophy articles he wrote for the Oosthoek encyclopedia, in its 4th and 5th editions.\n\nIn 1935 Vollenhoven founded the “Association for Calvinistic Philosophy,” with \"Philosophia Reformata\" as its academic journal, \"Mededelingen\" to report its internal affairs, and \"Correspondentiebladen\" for exploratory discussions. Vollenhoven, who was the chairperson, opened the first meeting with the words: “[What] brings us together here is something glorious. It is not philosophy, for that is not what comes first in our lives. Rather it is the bond to God’s Word, for by grace we have learned to desire to live solely through Christ, [hence] religion, as concern of the heart, has become the center of our whole existence.” Of philosophy, as then current, Vollenhoven said: “[It] knows nothing of a God as understood in the Scriptures; nothing of a heart that can only find rest in Him; nothing of world history, which lies anchored in the first and second Adam; also very little of the difference between life terrains, the distinction of which appears so necessary in daily life.”\n\nOn 18 November 1938 the curators of the \"Vrije Universiteit\" received a formal complaint from the theological faculty (H. H. Kuyper, V. Hepp, J. Waterink, G. Ch. Aalders, also F. W. Grosheide, and even D. Nauta, but not C. van Gelderen), charging Vollenhoven with departing from the Reformed confession, on two counts: (i) the denial of “the duality of human existence, namely as a material, mortal body and as a immaterial, immortal soul;” (ii) the denial that the Son of God had “an impersonal human nature”—the view of the Son of God having a “personal” human nature, as held by Vollenhoven, was considered to be “an error reminding one of Nestorius.” The first point is confused. Vollenhoven never denied the distinction of body and soul; what he denied was the view that is popular in the Protestant scholastic tradition concerning this distinction. A separate committee was formed to look into the matter. But World War II intervened, and the matter was dropped. The second point is based on a passage in Vollenhoven’s \"Calvinism and the Reformation of Philosophy\", which is vague and thus capable of being read as “Nestorian.” Prior to the charge, Vollenhoven had already openly regretted his formulation and promised to revise it, should a second edition of the book appear. He himself had no Nestorian leanings. Vollenhoven also argued that the expression “impersonal human nature” does not occur in the main confessions of the church in connection with Christology. So to consider the denial of this to be heresy is actually out of order. But the theological faculty, seeing its scholasticism threatened, sought to undercut Vollenhoven’s popularity and growing influence and used the concern for the confession to that end. He was forced to publicly recant his “error” and give a full explanation in a published article. To date, the university has not exonerated (the memory of) Vollenhoven of blame and its treatment of him.\n\nFollowing World War II, Vollenhoven put into operation the initiative to designate specific chairs for the promotion of Reformational philosophy at public universities in the Netherlands by providing for capital and an organizational base, and also by appointing suitable persons to carry this out. Vollenhoven was now well-known. During the war he had become the chairman of the \"Algemeene Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Wijsbegeerte\" [General Dutch Association for Philosophy]. He remained in office until the 10th World Congress of Philosophy had taken place in Amsterdam in August 1948. In 1947 the Foundation for Special Chairs in Calvinistic Philosophy came into existence, with Vollenhoven as chairman. Among the persons appointed to chairs, some were former students of Vollenhoven. At the Vrije Universiteit itself, S. U. Zuidema was appointed, in part to relieve Vollenhoven of the introduction to philosophy course, which, with the growth of the student population after the War, had become quite demanding. He could now apply himself almost entirely to the history of philosophy. He chose to remain the chairperson of the Association for Calvinistic Philosophy till 1963, the year that he retired.\n\nVollenhoven had followers in North America and South Africa. In North America, H.E. Runner, who had done post-graduate work under Vollenhoven, took the initiative of setting up “The Association for Reformed Scientific Studies,” which in 1967 opened the doors of the Institute for Christian Studies in Toronto. In South Africa, Hendrik G. Stoker and J.A.L. Taljaard together cooperated with Vollenhoven and Dooyeweerd in encouraging students to do post-graduate work at the Vrije Universiteit. In 1961 Vollenhoven gave numerous lectures in North America and two years later he lectured extensively in South Africa.\n\nUpon retiring in 1963, Vollenhoven was succeeded by four persons: Hendrik van Riessen, J. van der Hoeven, A.W. Begemann, and C.A. van Peursen. Van Riessen also succeeded Vollenhoven as chairperson of the “Association for Calvinistic Philosophy” (later “Calvinistic” gave way to “Reformational,” still later to “Christian”). After giving his valedictory address on “Plato’s realism,” Vollenhoven continued to give private monthly lectures to specialists in his problem-historical work. Vollenhoven died at the age of 85, having been a widower for the last five-and-a-half years of his life.\n\n\n"}

Ford\n\nDavid Frank Ford (born 23 January 1948, Dublin) is an academic and public theologian. He has been the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge since 1991. His research interests include political theology, ecumenical theology, Christian theologians and theologies, theology and poetry, the shaping of universities and of the field of theology and religious studies within universities, hermeneutics, and inter-faith theology and relations. He is the founding director of the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme and a co-founder of the Society for Scriptural Reasoning.\n\nFord was raised as an Anglican in the Church of Ireland in Dublin. His father died when he was 12 years old and he was raised by his mother, Phyllis Mary Elizabeth Ford.\n\nFor his undergraduate education, he studied at Trinity College Dublin, where he was active in politics, debate and journalism. He was elected a scholar in classics in 1968. After completing his degree, he interviewed for jobs at British Steel Corporation and Rolls-Royce, but then was offered a scholarship to St John's College at the University of Cambridge and decided to study theology for a few years before going into business. He earned his bachelor's degree in theology at Cambridge and went on to earn his Master of Sacred Theology degree at Yale Divinity School; he also did graduate work at the University of Tübingen. He gained his doctorate at Cambridge, writing his dissertation on Karl Barth and biblical narrative under the direction of Donald MacKinnon and Stephen Sykes. The result was the book \"Barth and God's Story\" (1981). Ford later received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Birmingham.\n\nFrom 1976–1991 Ford was a lecturer (later senior lecturer) at the University of Birmingham. Living in the inner city, his theology was shaped by a multi-faith experience, and he also became involved in a local Anglican church in the evangelical tradition. As his housemate was involved in renovating derelict houses, he lived in some of those houses and became a house manager for one of them. In the university's theology department, he became close to theologian Daniel W. Hardy and went on to marry Hardy's daughter.\n\nIn 1991 he moved to Cambridge to become the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. He is the first professor in this post who is not in the Anglican ministry. He helped found and chairs the management committee of the Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies at Cambridge. He is a member of St John's College, a fellow of Selwyn College, and a foundation member of Trinity College.\n\nHe is highly regarded for his scholarship, wit and humour. He is a sought-after lecturer and preacher and serves as an advisor to the bishops of the Anglican Communion. His books have met with wide appeal; his \"The Modern Theologians: An Introduction to Christian Theology in the Twentieth Century\" (Blackwell, 1997), now in its third printing, is the leading textbook on modern Christian theology in the English-speaking world, China and Korea. His \"Theology: A Very Short Introduction\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), part of the Very Short Introductions series, has been translated into many languages, including Chinese, Korean, Indonesian, Romanian, and Kurdish.\n\nWhen Ford came to Cambridge in 1991, the theology department focused almost exclusively on Christianity. Ford assisted in the realisation of a development plan which included a new building, a new Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies, new endowed research posts, and the development of the Cambridge Theological Federation (the university's consortium of Anglican, Methodist, and United Reformed seminaries). The university went on to add two new posts in Islamic studies, a new post in New Testament, and a new endowed post in theology and natural science. A Roman Catholic institute and institute for Orthodox Christian theology were added to the consortium of seminaries. The Centre for Jewish-Christian Relations was established in 1998, followed by the Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations in 2006.\n\nFord was introduced to interfaith dialogue in the early 1990s while on sabbatical at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, where his father-in-law, Hardy, director of the centre, introduced him to Jewish theologian Peter Ochs. Hardy and Ford participated in meetings of the early \"textual reasoning\" group founded by Ochs at the American Academy of Religion, reading the Tanakh, Bible, and Quran together with Christian and Muslim scholars. In 1996 Ford, Hardy and Ochs founded the Society for Scriptural Reasoning; Ford has been an active promoter of scriptural reasoning in subsequent papers and lectures.\n\nIn 2002 Ford became the founding director of the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme. Among his activities are lectures at international conferences on Muslim-Christian relations. In October 2007 he helped launch a letter by 138 Muslim scholars to 25 Christian leaders, including the Pope, the Orthodox Patriarchs, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the heads of the world alliances of the Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist and Reformed churches, calling for peace and reconciliation between Christians and Muslims for the survival of the world. The following month, he was one of the signatories on a Christian response seeking Muslim forgiveness.\n\nIn 2008 the Sternberg Foundation awarded Ford its Gold Medal for Inter-Faith Relations.\n\nIn November 2012 he was awarded the Coventry International Prize for Peace and Reconciliation (http://coventrypeaceprize.org.uk/)\n\nFord is active both within the university and in public life. He has been a trustee for the Center of Theological Inquiry at Princeton since 2007 and a member of the board of advisors for the John Templeton Foundation since 2008. Other professional memberships include the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature.\n\nHe is an editorial board member of \"Modern Theology\", the \"Scottish Journal of Theology\", \"Teaching Theology and Religion\", the \"Irish Theological Quarterly\", and the \"Journal of Anglican Studies\". He is an editorial advisory board member for the \"Current Issues in Theology\" series published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2008 Ford was an academic member of the World Economic Forum Council of 100 Leaders for West-Islamic World Dialogue. He is an external advisor for the Centre for Christian Studies in Hong Kong (since 2006), a trustee for the Golden Web Foundation, a developer of a global multimedia publishing system with a focus on pre-modern world history, heritage and culture (since 2006), and a consultant for L'Arche Communities, a federation of over 100 communities for people with severe mental disabilities (since 1993).\n\nIn 2011 he was one of 1,750 signatories to a letter to US President Barack Obama urging US intervention in the Libyan civil war.\n\nHe is married to Rev. Deborah Ford, daughter of the late Daniel W. Hardy. She is an assistant chaplain at Addenbrooke's Hospital, part of the Cambridge University Hospital system. They have three children, Rebecca, Rachel and Daniel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4790683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4790683", "title": "Engineering ethics", "text": "Engineering ethics\n\nEngineering ethics is the field of applied ethics and system of moral principles that apply to the practice of engineering. The field examines and sets the obligations by engineers to society, to their clients, and to the profession. As a scholarly discipline, it is closely related to subjects such as the philosophy of science, the philosophy of engineering, and the ethics of technology.\n\nAs engineering rose as a distinct profession during the 19th century, engineers saw themselves as either independent professional practitioners or technical employees of large enterprises. There was considerable tension between the two sides as large industrial employers fought to maintain control of their employees.\n\nIn the United States growing professionalism gave rise to the development of four founding engineering societies: The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (1851), the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) (1884), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) (1880), and the American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME) (1871). ASCE and AIEE were more closely identified with the engineer as learned professional, where ASME, to an extent, and AIME almost entirely, identified with the view that the engineer is a technical employee.\n\nEven so, at that time ethics was viewed as a personal rather than a broad professional concern.\n\nWhen the 19th century drew to a close and the 20th century began, there had been series of significant structural failures, including some spectacular bridge failures, notably the Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster (1876), Tay Bridge Disaster (1879), and the Quebec Bridge collapse (1907). These had a profound effect on engineers and forced the profession to confront shortcomings in technical and construction practice, as well as ethical standards.\n\nOne response was the development of formal codes of ethics by three of the four founding engineering societies. AIEE adopted theirs in 1912. ASCE and ASME did so in 1914. AIME did not adopt a code of ethics in its history.\n\nConcerns for professional practice and protecting the public highlighted by these bridge failures, as well as the Boston molasses disaster (1919), provided impetus for another movement that had been underway for some time: to require formal credentials (Professional Engineering licensure in the US) as a requirement to practice. This involves meeting some combination of educational, experience, and testing requirements.\n\nIn 1950, the Association of German Engineers developed an oath for all its members titled 'The Confession of the Engineers', directly hinting at the role of engineers in the atrocities committed during World War II.\n\nOver the following decades most American states and Canadian provinces either required engineers to be licensed, or passed special legislation reserving title rights to organization of professional engineers. The Canadian model is to require all persons working in fields of engineering that posed a risk to life, health, property, the public welfare and the environment to be licensed, and all provinces required licensing by the 1950s.\n\nThe US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety, safeguarding of life, health, or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education, and government need not be licensed . This has perpetuated the split between professional engineers and those in private industry. Professional societies have adopted generally uniform codes of ethics.\n\nEfforts to promote ethical practice continue. In addition to the professional societies and chartering organizations efforts with their members, the Canadian Iron Ring and American Order of the Engineer trace their roots to the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse. Both require members to swear an oath to uphold ethical practice and wear a symbolic ring as a reminder.\n\nIn the United States, the National Society of Professional Engineers released in 1946 its Canons of Ethics for Engineers and Rules of Professional Conduct, which evolved to the current Code of Ethics, adopted in 1964. These requests ultimately led to the creation of the Board of Ethical Review in 1954. Ethics cases rarely have easy answers, but the BER's nearly 500 advisory opinions have helped bring clarity to the ethical issues engineers face daily.\n\nCurrently, bribery and political corruption is being addressed very directly by several professional societies and business groups around the world. However, new issues have arisen, such as offshoring, sustainable development, and environmental protection, that the profession is having to consider and address.\n\nCodes of engineering ethics identify a specific precedence with respect to the engineer's consideration for the public, clients, employers, and the profession.\n\nMany engineering professional societies have prepared codes of ethics. Some date to the early decades of the twentieth century. These have been incorporated to a greater or lesser degree into the regulatory laws of several jurisdictions. While these statements of general principles served as a guide, engineers still require sound judgment to interpret how the code would apply to specific circumstances.\n\nThe general principles of the codes of ethics are largely similar across the various engineering societies and chartering authorities of the world, which further extend the code and publish specific guidance. The following is an example from the American Society of Civil Engineers:\n\n\nThe paramount value recognized by engineers is the safety and welfare of the public. As demonstrated by the following selected excerpts, this is the case for professional engineering organizations in nearly every jurisdiction and engineering discipline:\n\n\nResponsibility of engineers\n\nThe engineers recognize that the greatest merit is the work and exercise their profession committed to serving society, attending to the welfare and progress of the majority.\nBy transforming nature for the benefit of mankind, engineers must increase their awareness of the world as the abode of humanity, their interest in the universe as a guarantee of overcoming their spirit, and knowledge of reality to make the world fairer and happier.\nThe engineer should reject any paper that is intended to harm the general interest, thus avoiding a situation that might be hazardous or threatening to the environment, life, health, or other rights of human beings.\nIt is an inescapable duty of the engineer to uphold the prestige of the profession, to ensure its proper discharge, and to maintain a professional demeanor rooted in ability, honesty, fortitude, temperance, magnanimity, modesty, honesty, and justice; with the consciousness of individual well-being subordinate to the social good.\nThe engineers and their employers must ensure the continuous improvement of their knowledge, particularly of their profession, disseminate their knowledge, share their experience, provide opportunities for education and training of workers, provide recognition, moral and material support to the schools where they studied, thus returning the benefits and opportunities they and their employers have received.\nIt is the responsibility of the engineers to carry out their work efficiently and to support the law. In particular, they must ensure compliance with the standards of worker protection as provided by the law.\nAs professionals, the engineers are expected to commit themselves to high standards of conduct (NSPE). [1] 11/27/11\n\nA basic ethical dilemma is that an engineer has the duty to report to the appropriate authority a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions. According to first principles, this duty overrides the duty to a client and/or employer. An engineer may be disciplined, or have their license revoked, even if the failure to report such a danger does not result in the loss of life or health.\n\nIn many cases, this duty can be discharged by advising the client of the consequences in a forthright matter, and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice. In very rare cases, where even a governmental authority may not take appropriate action, the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public. As a result, whistleblowing by professional engineers is not an unusual event, and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases, overruling duties to employers and confidentiality considerations that otherwise would have prevented the engineer from speaking out.\n\nThere are several other ethical issues that engineers may face. Some have to do with technical practice, but many others have to do with broader considerations of business conduct. These include:\n\nSome engineering societies are addressing environmental protection as a stand-alone question of ethics.\n\nThe field of business ethics often overlaps and informs ethical decision making for engineers.\n\nPetroski notes that most engineering failures are much more involved than simple technical mis-calculations and involve the failure of the design process or management culture. However, not all engineering failures involve ethical issues. The infamous collapse of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, and the losses of the Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter were technical and design process failures.\n\nThese episodes of engineering failure include ethical as well as technical issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10763613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10763613", "title": "Enneagram of Personality", "text": "Enneagram of Personality\n\nThe Enneagram of Personality, or simply the Enneagram (from the Greek words [, meaning \"nine\"] and [, meaning something \"written\" or \"drawn\"]), is a model of the human psyche which is principally understood and taught as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. Although the origins and history of many of the ideas and theories associated with the Enneagram of Personality are a matter of dispute, contemporary Enneagram claims are principally derived from the teachings of Oscar Ichazo and Claudio Naranjo. Naranjo's theories were partly influenced by some earlier teachings of George Gurdjieff. As a typology the Enneagram defines nine personality types (sometimes called \"enneatypes\"), which are represented by the points of a geometric figure called an enneagram, which indicate connections between the types. There are different schools of thought among Enneagram teachers, therefore their ideas are not always in agreement.\n\nThe Enneagram of Personality has been widely promoted in both business management and spirituality contexts through seminars, conferences, books, magazines, and DVDs. In business contexts it is generally used as a typology to gain insights into workplace interpersonal-dynamics; in spirituality it is more commonly presented as a path to higher states of being, essence, and enlightenment. Both contexts say it can aid in self-awareness, self-understanding and self-development. \n\nThere has been limited formal psychometric analysis of the Enneagram and the peer-reviewed research that has been done has not been widely accepted within the relevant academic communities.\n\nThe origins and historical development of the Enneagram of Personality are matters of dispute. Wiltse and Palmer have suggested that similar ideas to the Enneagram of Personality are found in the work of Evagrius Ponticus, a Christian mystic who lived in 4th century Alexandria. Evagrius identified eight \"logismoi\" (\"deadly thoughts\") plus an overarching thought he called \"love of self\". Evagrius wrote, \"The first thought of all is that of love of self (\"philautia\"); after this, [come] the eight.\" In addition to identifying eight deadly thoughts, Evagrius also identified eight \"remedies\" to these thoughts.\n\nG. I. Gurdjieff is credited with making the enneagram figure commonly known (see Fourth Way enneagram). He did not, however, develop the nine personality types associated with the Enneagram. Oscar Ichazo is generally recognized as the principal source of the contemporary Enneagram of Personality which is largely derived from some of Ichazo's teachings, such as those on ego-fixations, holy ideas, passions and virtues. The Bolivian-born Ichazo began teaching programs of self-development in the 1950s. His teaching, which he calls \"Protoanalysis\", uses the enneagram figure among many other symbols and ideas. Ichazo founded the Arica Institute which was originally based in Chile before moving to the United States and coined the term \"Enneagram of Personality\".\n\nClaudio Naranjo is a Chilean-born psychiatrist who first learned about the Enneagram of Personality from Ichazo at a course in Arica, Chile. He then began developing and teaching his own understanding of the Enneagram in the United States in the early 1970s, influencing others including some Jesuit priests who adapted the Enneagram for use in Christian spirituality. Ichazo disowned Naranjo and the other teachers on what he felt were misinterpretations and uses of the Enneagram. Among Naranjo's early students there are also differing understandings of Enneagram theory. Numerous other authors, including Helen Palmer, Don Richard Riso, Richard Rohr and Elizabeth Wagele, also began publishing widely read books on the Enneagram of Personality in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe enneagram figure is usually composed of three parts; a circle, an inner triangle (connecting 3-6-9) and an irregular hexagonal \"periodic figure\" (connecting 1-4-2-8-5-7). According to esoteric spiritual traditions, the circle symbolizes unity, the inner triangle symbolizes the \"law of three\" and the hexagon represents the \"law of seven\" (because 1-4-2-8-5-7-1 is the repeating decimal created by dividing one by seven in base 10 arithmetic). These three elements constitute the usual enneagram figure.\n\nThe table below offers some of the principal characteristics of the nine types along with their basic relationships. This table expands upon Oscar Ichazo's ego fixations, holy ideas, passions, and virtues primarily using material from \"Understanding the Enneagram: The Practical Guide to Personality Types\" (revised edition) by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson. Other theorists may disagree on some aspects. The types are normally referred to by their numbers, but sometimes their \"characteristic roles\" (which refers to distinctive archetypal characteristics) are used instead. Various labels for each type are commonly used by different authors and teachers. The \"stress\" and \"security\" points (sometimes referred to as the \"disintegration\" and \"integration\" points) are the types, connected by the lines of the enneagram figure, that are believed by some to influence a person in more adverse or relaxed circumstances. According to this theory, someone classed as a One type, for example, may begin to think, feel and act more like a Four type when stressed, or more like a Seven type when relaxed.\n\nMost, but not all, Enneagram of Personality theorists teach a person's basic type is modified, at least to some extent, by the personality dynamics of the two adjacent types as indicated on the enneagram figure. These two types are often called \"wings\". A person of the Three personality type, for example, is understood to have points Two and Four as their wing types. The circle of the enneagram figure may indicate that the types or points exist on a spectrum rather than as distinct types or points unrelated to those adjacent to them. A person may be understood, therefore, to have a core type and one or two wing types which influence but do not change the core type.\n\nFor some Enneagram theorists the lines connecting the points add further meaning to the information provided by the descriptions of the types. Sometimes called the \"security\" and \"stress\" points, or points of \"integration\" and \"disintegration\", some theorists believe these connected points also contribute to a person's overall personality. From this viewpoint, therefore, at least four other points affect a person's overall personality; the two points connected by the lines to the core type and the two wing points. The earlier teachings about the connecting lines are now rejected or modified by many Enneagram teachers, including Claudio Naranjo who developed them.\n\nEach of the personality types is usually understood as having three \"instinctual subtypes\". These subtypes are believed to be formed according to which one of three instinctual energies of a person is dominantly developed and expressed. The instinctual energies are usually called \"self-preservation\", \"sexual\" (also called \"intimacy\" or \"one-to-one\") and \"social\". On the instinctual level, people may internally stress and externally express the need to protect themselves (self-preservation), to connect with important others or partners (sexual), or to get along or succeed in groups (social). From this perspective, there are twenty-seven distinct personality patterns, because people of each of the nine types also express themselves as one of the three subtypes. An alternative approach to the subtypes looks at them as three domains or clusters of instincts that result in increased probability of survival (the \"preserving\" domain), increased skill in navigating the social environment (the \"navigating\" domain) and increased likelihood of reproductive success (the \"transmitting\" domain). From this understanding the subtypes reflect individual differences in the presence of these three separate clusters of instincts.\n\nIt is believed people function in all three forms of instinctual energies but one may dominate. According to some theorists, another instinct may also be well-developed and the third often less developed.\n\nWhile Enneagram teachings have attained some degree of popularity, they have also received criticism including accusations of being pseudoscience, subject to interpretation and difficult to test or validate scientifically. They have also been criticized as \"an assessment method of no demonstrated reliability or validity\". The scientific skeptic Robert Todd Carroll included the Enneagram in a list of pseudoscientific theories that \"can't be tested because they are so vague and malleable that anything relevant can be shoehorned to fit the theory\".\n\nThe Enneagram has also received criticism from some religious perspectives. In 2000, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Doctrine produced a draft report on the origins of the Enneagram to aid bishops in their evaluation of its use in their dioceses. The report identified aspects of the intersection between the Enneagram and Roman Catholicism which, in their opinion, warranted scrutiny and seen as potential areas of concern, stating, \"While the enneagram system shares little with traditional Christian doctrine or spirituality, it also shares little with the methods and criteria of modern science... The burden of proof is on proponents of the enneagram to furnish scientific evidence for their claims.\" Partly in response to some Jesuits and members of other religious orders teaching a Christian understanding of the Enneagram of Personality, a 2003 Vatican document called \"Jesus Christ, the Bearer of the Water of Life. A Christian Reflection on the 'New Age'\" said that the Enneagram \"when used as a means of spiritual growth introduces an ambiguity in the doctrine and the life of the Christian faith.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50207230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50207230", "title": "Environmental inequality in Europe", "text": "Environmental inequality in Europe\n\nEnvironmental racism is a term used by Vincze (2013) for \"the practice of environmental injustice within a racialized context\", in which \"socially marginalized communities and minority groups\" are subjected to disproportionate exposure of environmental hazards, denial of access to sources of ecological sustenance such as clean air, water, and natural resources, or infringement of environmentally related human rights. \nAccording to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, environmental justice is \"the fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations and policies\". \nAs applied to Western Europe, patterns of \"environmental racism\" have been postulated in particular toward Romani communities.\nAccording to Trehan and Kocze (2009), \"EU accession for the post-socialist countries has resulted in a de facto centre and periphery within Europe itself, thus exacerbating the already marginal economic and political position of Roma in Europe whose communities continue to subsist as internal colonies within Europe.\" This peripheral position, in which segregated Romani settlements and their inhabitants become viewed as de-territorialized zones \"beyond the pale\" of government responsibility and European Union citizenship, has been identified by some scholars as an aggravating factor in the prevalence of environmental hazards (such as proximity to industrial facilities and illegal or toxic waste dumps). This practice has been identified in relation to the lack of basic services such as water, housing, sanitation and access to education affecting marginalized Romani communities.\n\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, socialist governments have generally prioritized industrial development over environmental protection, in spite of growing public and governmental environmental awareness in the 1960s and 1970s. Even though public concern over the environmental effects of industrial expansion such as mine and dam construction grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s, policy makers continued to focus on privatization and economic development. Following the market transition, environmental issues have persisted, despite some improvements during the early stages of transition. Throughout this time, significant social restructuring took place alongside environmental changes.\nAccording to K. Harper et al, \"in the case of Roma in CEE [Central and Eastern Europe], spaces inhabited by low-income Roma have come to be 'racialized' during the post-socialist era, intensifying patterns of environmental exclusion along ethnic lines\". Romani peoples have inhabited Central and Eastern Europe for six hundred years and have traditionally worked or been employed as agricultural day laborers, musicians, tinsmiths (tinkers), and blacksmiths. In the words of K. Harper et al, \nThe interwar period and the post-socialist period, in their schema, were marked by downward mobility and increased spatial segregation of Roma communities in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. It is in the context of these cycles that patterns of environmental exclusion have come into being. More than 50 years after the social dislocations of World War II and the communist regime change, poor Roma settlements throughout the region are located on the outskirts of villages, separated from the majority population by roads, railways or other barriers, and disconnected from water pipelines and sewage treatment.\n\nIn analyzing environmental marginalization of Romani communities in Romania, anthropologist Enikő Vincze writes that \"Environmental racism functions at the intersection of polluting the natural milieu, and of marginalizing social categories inferiorized by racial identification.\" Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, Romani people themselves are often treated as environmentally problematic subjects. Slovak authorities have been criticized by Romani rights activists over the alleged practice of \"targeting Romani communities for forced evictions under the pretext of environmental law\" by defining them as \"waste dumps\".\n\nIn Central Europe, there have been documented cases within popular culture whereupon Romani populations are characterized as ecologically irresponsible. In Slovakia, the region near the transportation corridor between Prešov and Poprad is an important foraging area for Romani communities who collect mushrooms and berries during the summer for trade and direct consumption. The activity is particularly significant due to the poor living conditions of many Romani in the area, who frequently take part in the illegal harvesting of state and private agricultural lands. In 2006, a \"popular magazine\" published an article titled \"Grasshoppers: While Roma from Tatra Region Make Money on Forests, Bears are Getting Hungry\". In the article, it was alleged that due to Romani foraging, Slovak bears could not find sufficient food to survive the winter. Similarly, K. Harper et al write that Romani people in Hungary are viewed by majority culture as a group that \"lacks environmental awareness\" while simultaneously being \"dissociated from any timeless connections to land\":Contemporary environmental discourses tend to portray marginalized and indigenous people in either of two ways: as noble savages or as environmental profligates (Krech, 1999). Unlike indigenous people, however, the Roma in Hungary are not associated with a timeless, revered 'environmental ethic'—perhaps because they were excluded from owning land (Csalog, 1994). In fact, the most destitute Roma have been chided for their short-sighted use of environmental resources: heating the house with forest wood and parts of the house itself (Ladányi and Szelényi, 2006 ...), engaging in extremely hazardous scrap metal processing and allegedly overharvesting snowdrop flowers to sell in the city. While many observers acknowledge the structural inequalities and histories underlying Roma communities' rural and post-industrial indigence, the fact remains that non-Roma widely see the Roma as a group that profoundly lacks environmental awareness.\n\nAccording to a report by RAXEN, overall housing quality for Romani persons in Lithuania is of poor quality and \"often located in disadvantaged places in terms of infrastructure.\" At the Romani settlement of in Vilnius, RAXEN has documented concerns regarding the quality of access to utilities such as water and heating, stating:\n\nThe issue of Roma housing quality is most evident in the Kirtimai settlement, where dwellings do not meet standards in terms of heating, outdoor toilets, water pumps and limited access to public transportation. The Kirtimai settlement was equipped with basic amenities such as water, electricity and waste collection in 2001, and further – perhaps final – developments were carried out in early 2004.\n\nThe settlement is located on the outskirts of Vilnius, spatially isolated within an industrial area in close proximity to Vilnius International Airport. An estimated 500 persons inhabit the settlement, which has been described by RAXEN as arguably \"ghettoised and discriminated against with regard to housing opportunities\". With regards to the nationwide status of utilities access for Lithuanian Romani persons, RAXEN has concluded that \"In general, a significant portion of the Roma lives in sub-standard dwellings, and there are Roma families throughout the country who have no access to public utilities (mainly sanitary facilities, water, and electricity).\"\n\nWhile Romani settlements in Poland are distributed throughout the country and less segregated than many areas of Central and Eastern Europe, geographical isolation remains a concern with regards to the access of environmental means of sustenance. According to a report by RAXEN,\n\nThe majority of Roma settlements [in Poland], e.g. in the region of Małopolska are outside other settlements and are deprived of potable water, sewage and roads that allow for ambulance access. The problem also concerns roadblocks to obtaining settlement permits, especially in city centres, which necessarily results in them moving to the outskirts, away from infrastructure that allows for decent living conditions.\"\nAccording to the study, Romani persons throughout Poland, especially those from the Bergitka subgroup, face ongoing issues with regards to accessing water and utilities which has been attributed to detrimental health conditions and persistently high rates of tuberculosis.\n\nIn 2013, an estimated 80–120 persons of Romanian Romani origin were living in two shantytowns in Wrocław.\n\nThe settlements, which had no heated homes, running water, electricity, or sewerage, were constructed using materials salvaged from dumps. These settlements had historical ties to a settlement that existed between 1993 and 1997, when the first Romanian Romani came to Wrocław from the city of Făgăraş in search of employment. Residents at the settlement were employed in scrap metal collection. At the former Kamieńskiego Street shantytown, there was documentation of waste disposal concerns, raw sewage dumping, and burning of plastic causing pollution.\n\nAfter receiving a municipal order to evacuate the Kamieńskiego Street shantytown in April 2013, residents wrote a letter to the mayor of Wrocław, Rafał Dutkiewicz. The letter reads:\n\nWe feel residents of this city [sic]. We have nowhere to move to. Could we count on support and advice on where else we could settle down? We realize that we might be cumbersome neighbors to the inhabitants of Kamieńskiego St., because there are many of us here and we often ask them for help … If there were any jobs for us, we would gladly take them and dedicate ourselves to the development of and work for the city of Wrocław. What we only ask is, please give us a chance. We want to stay in Wrocław and integrate with the city's society. (Żuchowicz, 2013, p. 2)\n\nCiting begging, trespassing, complaints from neighbors, disturbance to the area, and littering, alongside health and sanitation initiatives previously delivered by the city, the Social Affairs Department rejected residents' requests, concluding that clearing of the site was required. In the words of Jupowiecka, the response letter stated that the Roma presence produced an actual epidemiological hazard, and could no longer be tolerated\". According to Kostka in 2014, \"In Poland this is an unprecedented case, without jurisprudence, and can potentially have a huge impact on the Polish legal system and the image of Poland across Europe (Nomada 2013).\" On July 22, 2015, the Kamieńskiego Street settlement was demolished.\n\nIn the region of Małopolska, there have been documented cases of communities lacking clean drinking water, electricity, and sanitation. These issues have been noted by OSCE observers in the villages of Maszkowice, Jazowsko, Koszary, Krosnica, and Czarna Góra. In Maszkowice and Jazowsko, there have been documented allegations by local residents of theft of garden vegetables and unauthorized wood harvesting by Romani residents.\n\nIn Ostrava, Romani communities have been residing in living accommodations situated on top of an abandoned mine where methane gas exposure and subsidence are serious concerns. Ostrava has one of the largest Romani communities in the Czech Republic.\nThe neighbourhood of Slezska Ostrava of Hrusov, also in Ostrava, was formerly a middle class neighbourhood whose residents left between 1950 and 1970 to live in better apartments. In 1980, a highway overpass was built nearby. In 1997, severe flooding took place, following which the area was declared uninhabitable due to the dangers of flooding. Since then, a new housing project, \"Coexistence Village\" has been facilitated, in which a grassroots movement saw ethnic Czech and Romani communities collaboratively build new houses for themselves together to create desegregated housing.\n\nIn Slovakia, many Romani were settled by the fourteenth century. In 1927, a new Act on Nomadic Roma came into place, whose statutes dictated that nomadic Romani were not to settle in locations of their choosing, but as selected by the mayors of villages. During the Second World War, thousands of Slovak Romani were transported to extermination camps in Nazi Germany.\n\nFollowing the war, Romani were largely left out of postwar land redistribution schemes. One of the first laws created by the postwar government was the 'Directive on Governing Certain Conditions of Gypsies,' which states that \"In villages where they [Roma] have dwellings in proximity to public, state-owned and other roads, the dwellings will be removed, placed separately from the village on distant places selected by the village.\" The implications of this law was that Romani communities, recently liquidated by the Nazi Holocaust and without resources to purchase land, were now subject to the settlement plans of non-Romani decision-makers.\n\nAfter initially treating Romani as \"non-workers existing 'outside the class system'\", socialist governments created policies that led to the rapid integration of Romani communities into the industrial labour force. In spite of official socialist policies of equality, social divisions and social stratification remained. Romani communities experienced poverty emerging from the market transition, as well as significant vulnerability to environmental issues and harms associated with industrialization.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s, research was conducted by the Slovak government determining that there were 1,305 segregated Romani shantytowns throughout Slovakia. In 1965, after failed attempts at economic and social integration, the Slovak government began to attempt more drastic policies aimed at assimilation of the Romani body politic. Directed primarily at Romani settlements in Eastern Slovakia, these policies sought to create employment for all able-bodied Romani, particularly Roma males; termination of Romani shantytowns and resettlement into modern housing; and programs to support Romani students accessing formal education. In spite of these policies, shantytowns only decreased in number slowly; after the resettlement program was terminated as a result of post-socialist funding shortages, shantytowns began to grow again, largely due to economic conditions. By 2004, there were an estimated 320,000 Romani individuals living in Slovakia in 1,575 \"integrated and segregated settlements.\"\nAs these settlements have grown, impoverished Romani communities became more visible, land has become scarce, and tensions with non-Romani communities have risen. The environmental implications of this scenario have been that these communities have been marginalized onto environmentally problematic parcels of land, where patterns of environmental issues entail exposure to hazardous waste and chemicals, vulnerability to floods, limited access to potable water, and discriminatory waste management practices. The rapid growth of these settlements in a context where freedom of settlement and movement is restricted due to discrimination from the majority population has complicated property rights and entitlements and hence the legal ability to participate in land-based decision-making.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, 150 people were evicted from their homes in the district of Nižné Kapustníky (Kosice). Further evictions were planned for 200 people from the Pod Hrádkom neighbourhood of Prešov under similar legal circumstances. According to the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC), these evictions are part of a growing trend in the Slovak Republic in which authorities are justifying evictions by designating Romani settlements as \"communal waste\". Over 400 mayors of towns and villages in Slovakia have joined a movement by the name of Zobudme sa! (Let's Wake Up!) which, according to the ERRC, \"aspires to coordinate a targeted programme of demolition aimed at Roma settlements by defining them as waste dumps\".\n\nThe region of Slovenské Rudohorie has a long industrial history, which includes gold, silver, copper, and other metal mining and processing, and has been listed as being one of the ten most polluted regions in Slovakia.The region and mine tailings is contaminated with mercury, acidic water from sulfide, and lead.\n\nIn the village of Rudňany, there has been a Romani settlement situated on top of the abandoned factory site of Zabíjanec since the 1970s; after the site's closure in 1965 it was likely settled with the \"silent approval\" of socialist authorities. As of 2011, 640 persons lived there, in conditions severely contaminated by heavy metals. Children at Zabíjanec are at particularly high risk of health effects, such as neurological damage.\n\nBy 2003, the number of industrial workers in the mines and processing plants had decreased from 2,500 at the start of the 1990s to 150. In 2010, 1,700 out of Rudňany's 3,775 inhabitants were Romani, who are highly segregated from the majority population. Many also live in the Pätoracké shantytown; according to Filčák, approximately 570 Romani were living there in 2011. These Romani communities largely settled in the area during the 1950s to work as miners.\n\nIn the 1970s, subsidence of structures above the mine shafts, along with encroaching contaminated mine waste compelled authorities to relocate residents from Pätoracké to new homes in Spišská Nová Ves and Smižany. However, the Romani shantytowns were not relocated, nor were new Romani migrants prevented from settling in the area. In 2007, in response to a sinkhole incident in 2001, 257 residents were relocated to new apartments, which while outside the landslide and subsidence danger zones, are still surrounded by dumps of mine waste, while also continuing to be ethnically segregated. As of 2009, over 300 people remained in the danger zone, living in a shantytown without sewers, sewage treatment, running water, or garbage collection. Meanwhile, residents from the main village of Rudňany municipality regularly dispose of household waste in an unauthorized dump 300 meters below the Pätoracké settlement.\n\nThe Romani settlement in Krompachy has 400 residents, largely former employees of the nearby copper smelter. Separated from the town of Krompachy by a road and a stream, the settlement is located at the foot of a hill next to the smelter. Only several apartments in the settlement are occupied by non-Romani families, most of whom left the area over time. The Krompachy smelter has been producing electrolytic copper in Slovakia since 1937, and is the only facility of its kind in the country. According to measurements taken by the Slovak Academy of Sciences, the area is highly contaminated with arsenic, lead, zinc, and copper, and there is unsubstantiated evidence to suggest that contamination may be more severe in the Romani settlement than in the town proper.\n\nIn a Romani neighbourhood in the town of Trebišov, there is a slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant. These facilities are the source of odours and waste which is stored in open containers in an unfenced location that is frequented by Romani people in search of food. Due to the rapid rate of decay of this unrefrigerated waste, especially during the summer, it poses a significant health risk for those who consume it, while also attracting insects and rats.\n\nThe Romani shantytowns of Hermanovce, Jarovnice, and Svinia are located within several kilometres of each other within the upper Svinka River Watershed; all three have histories of being subject to flooding. Jarovnice, which has an unofficial population of 5,000, is one of the largest shantytowns in Slovakia. Residents do not have access to safe, potable water. Water quality in all three settlements has been problematic, particularly with regards to increasing nitrates contamination from industrial fertilizers used by agricultural activity in the region. In 1998, 47 people died in floods in the region; 45 of the victims were Romani, and 42 of them were from Jarovnice. One person from Svinia died, and 500 people from the shantytown had to be evacuated. In Hermanovce, there is a Romani shantytown of 300 persons located on low-lying land with a high water table in between forks of the Svinka River; meanwhile, the village dump is located in close proximity above the shantytown, and is not lined to prevent leachate contamination, causing seepage into the community. According to Filčák, the construction of a landfill \"in close proximity to the Roma settlements, without involvement of the affected people is almost a 'classical' example of the environmental injustice in both distributional and procedural aspects\".\n\nIn the words of Anna Husarova, a Romani woman from Jarovnice, the location of these settlements in relation to flood vulnerability has a historical context:[After the war] survivors had to settle next to forests, in the middle of fields or on riverbanks. These were the only places where they were allowed to settle down and start over. They built huts and began to call them flats. No attention was paid to them, and they were given no help.Other Romani settlements in Chminianske Jakubovany, Petrova, and Markovce have also experienced vulnerability to flooding.\n\nIn Hungary, the proximity of Romani settlements to garbage dumps along with a lack of access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure has been an ongoing concern. In a Romani shantytown in Heves, the recycling of car batteries from an unauthorized dump for income caused the death of one child and serious disabilities among a number of residents. In Hungary, it is believed that environmental health conditions contribute to the low life expectancy of Romani people, whose life expectancy is on average 10–15 years lower than for non-Romani.\nAccording to the European Roma Rights Centre, in Ózd-Bánszállás, Hungary, a situation exists where hundreds of Romani persons living in a segregated neighbourhood do not have reliable clean water access and must use three contaminant-risk pumps. According to the ERRC report,The town won a Swiss development grant some three years ago to improve water infrastructure but Roma neighbourhoods seem to have been omitted from this development plan. The young mayor is a member of the far-right Jobbik party.According to 2010 data from Hungary's National Development Agency, 4.7% of predominantly Romani settlements did not have access to a public water supply (relying instead on makeshift wells and open water sources such as streams), and that a further 11.1% had access to public wells, but no access to tap water or sewerage. According to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 30% of Romani households in Hungary did not have access to a \"piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities\".\n\nAnother region facing environmental issues is Sajószentpéter. A town of 14,000 near Miskolc in northeastern Hungary, it was a minor industrial center for the majority of the 20th century, namely in the production of coal and glass. During the market transition from socialism, both the factory and the mine were closed down, causing the entire population of the town to lose its employment within the span of several months, without new economic development since.\n\nA Romani settlement in Sajószentpéter is located separately from the town in a nearby wetland, and is connected by a bridge. Several issues of environmental injustice have been identified, such as illegal dumping in the Romani settlement by non-Romani as well as residents, as well as unequal access to green space, water distribution, sewerage, and housing quality.\n\nFollowing the formation of a grassroots community organization in the Romani settlement called the Sajó River Association for Environment and community Development (SAKKF), Romani and youth-led initiatives in partnership with outside activists have seen the development of ongoing environmental-justice oriented projects. One project that resulted from these initiatives was the Romani youth-led photography exhibit, 'This is also Sajószentpéter' ('Ez is Sajószentpéter'), which was held at Central European University in June 2007.\n\nAccording to the UNECE pilot country reports on Equitable Access to Water (2013), 32% of Romani households in Ukraine have indoor water access, while 18% derive their water from open-air sources such as streams.\n\nAccording to a 2014 report by the Romani women's rights organization \"Chiricli\", two large Romani settlements in Kiev were identified as having severely substandard living conditions. One of the settlements, situated in Holosiivo, was situated on top of a former dump. This site is reportedly known to have formerly interned \"radioactive substances dangerous to human health\". In addition to potential hazards regarding the radioactive history of the site, the settlement was approximately forty minutes away from the nearest source of water, so residents had to use water from a nearby sewage-contaminated stream.\n\nSerious issues regarding access to clean water and sanitation for Romani communities (\"tabors\") in Zakarpats'ka oblast have been documented.\n\nNear the village of Myrcha, 35 kilometres northeast of Uzhorod, there is an isolated Romani settlement of 150 persons located next to a forest. The community does not have access to clean drinking water. Residents derive their drinking water from rainfall collection; during drier months, the residents have no choice but to collect water from a stream that allegedly \"smells like chemicals\", according to residents interviewed by the European Roma Rights Center. Authorities for the main village of Myrcha have cited legal and logistical challenges as barriers to providing water infrastructure to the settlement. In the words of the mayor, when interviewed by Szilvasi and Novrotskyy about improving water access for the Romani \"tabor\":\n\nWe want to help them, but the problem is the Ukrainian law, the tabor is beyond the village, we first need to include them in the cadaster (…) this [building the well] would need a geological investigation as well and involve much bureaucracy. The paper work would be greater than the work itself, and precludes us from even starting such a project.\n\nOutside Berehove, an estimated five to six thousand Romani persons live in a settlement with limited to no access to clean drinking water, and with no access to sewerage. There are three public taps available, however they are usually either turned off or non-functional. According to Szilvasi and Novrotskyy, a major part of the problem is the alleged corruption of the \"baron\" system, whereby unelected individuals from the Romani community are designated by municipal authorities to steward the water and sanitation infrastructure. Barons are granted significant sums of money for their role, with no system of oversight in place to ensure that services are delivered. The payouts are not tied to any quantitative water consumption by residents of the Romani community, resulting in a system where barons are effectively paid to neglect water and sanitation infrastructure.\n\nIn Uzhorod, several thousand Romani persons live at five separate settlements throughout the city. Water and sanitation access varies, with some houses and neighborhoods having better services than others. Between 2013 and 2016, three of the tabors received new access to formal water utilities, although access often does not reach all houses due to limited infrastructure and low water pressure. Issues of water affordability for some residents persist, and the lack of reliable access has been documented as an ongoing fire hazard.\n\nNear Muchaceve, a Romani settlement of five thousand persons was serviced by a high-risk water supply that was contaminated and subject to major leakage. Following a hepatitis epidemic in the community in 2013, tests were ordered to track the origin of the outbreak. The water supply was confirmed as the source of the pathogens and was promptly shut off. No replacement water source was provided by the municipality. By 2016, a new above-ground pipe was constructed \"with the support of international donors\" to supply the settlement. In contrast to nearby Muchaceve, which receives water services 24 hours a day, the Romani settlement only receives water for four hours a day.\n\nIn Chop, both the Romani as well as majority-culture communities face issues regarding water resource sustainability. The city of Chop, as of 2016, is currently experiencing a dispute involving the Ukrainian national railway company, Ukrainian Railways. The state-owned corporation owns the entire water distribution infrastructure of Chop, and is responsible for its maintenance. Persistent issues of water contamination, leakage, and corrosion have reportedly been seriously neglected, prompting the municipality to attempt to take over ownership of the waterworks system. The Romani settlement on the outskirts of the city has particularly limited access to water; even the houses that are connected to the utility receive such low-pressure in the pipes that residents rely on carrying water by hand from nearby wells.\n\nAccording to a 2014 report by \"Chiricli\", the situation for Romani persons within Ukraine's \"Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) Zone\" (Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast) was dire. Most Romani residents did not have reliable access to water, electricity, or food. According to one woman from Makiivka, Romani residents would sometimes not be able to access water for as long as five days.\n\nAccording to \"Chiricli\", most Romani homes in Crimea, including the city of Simferopol, did not, as of 2014, have access to water or electricity.\n\nIn 2015, Romani refugees in Kharkiv from Sloviansk were reportedly directed to live in severely damaged, previously abandoned housing with no water or electricity.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 66% of Romani households in Moldova did not have access to a \"piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities\".\n\nPersistent patterns of environmental racism exist throughout Romania, affecting the Romani minority (not to be confused with the majority ethnic Romanian population). These issues exist within a context of severe poverty. According to scholar Florin Botonogu, \"Despite the clear provisions of the Romanian law forbidding human settlements close to garbage pits or other pollution sources, there are many communities in Romania situated in such an environment.\" Romanian scholar Catalin Berescu has in 2010 written that an estimated 2,000 shanty towns exist throughout Romania, inhabited by approximately 1 million individuals, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Romani. According to Berescu, the development of shantytowns has been a relatively recent phenomenon, only becoming visible since the fall of Communism.\n\nIn the opinion of Botonogu,\n\nMaybe labeling this situation as racism, as nobody forces them to stay there, is not that obvious, but the fact that in the whole country only Roma communities live in these conditions and the tolerance of the cities to the huge health risks, child labour and general misery represents, for sure, a different treatment by the local authorities towards these groups. Truth is that they have no other option; they have been denied any other job or place to settle.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 72% of Romani households in Romania did not have access to a \"piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities.\"\n\nIn Pata Rât, Cluj County, Romani persons scavenge from a dump as their primary source of income. As of 2013, it was estimated that 1,500 people were living at the site in extreme poverty; in the 1960s, only four families were documented as living there. Today, there are a total of four separate settlements at the Pata Rât dump; 42% of residents were moved to the site by local authorities. The overwhelming majority of residents are from the Romani minority, many of whom work at the site in slave-like conditions of indentured or bonded labour while the Romanian government and private contractors maintain ownership of the waste. Journalists are unwelcome at the site, where filming is strictly prohibited.\n\nAccording to Enikő Vincze, \"the formation of the Cluj landfill as a space of precarious and stigmatized housing and labour, is a site of environmental racism\". Predominantly Romani neighbourhoods from throughout the city of Cluj have been evicted and relocated to the dump since 2002. Many different Romani subgroups, further divided by family lines, have been settled into an area near the dump on Cantonului Street, causing inter-community tensions and violence. In 2010, 300 residents of Coastei street were evicted and resettled at the dump near a chemical waste site. The newly vacated neighbourhood was subsequently transferred, for free, to the Archbishop of Feleac and Cluj for the purpose of constructing a campus for students of Orthodox Theology at the Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj.\n\nIn spite of the traumatic nature of the relocation, the Romani community of Coastei Street, which was well integrated in the city and closely connected with urban services, engaged in organized efforts to maintain their social connections to Cluj (such as sending their children to their old schools in the city, and by organizing to ensure access to public transit). With support from NGO's such as the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC), Working Group of Civil Organizations (gLOC), and Amnesty International, these efforts, which included protests in Cluj, culminated in the formal acquisition of land at Pata Rât. On January 7, 2014, Cluj-Napoca County Court (Tribunal) ruled that the eviction and relocation from Coastei Street was illegal, ordering city authorities to compensate the Romani community for damages, and to also provide compensation for the inadequate housing situation caused by the relocation.\n\nIn 2004, authorities in the city of Miercurea Ciuc relocated 100 Romani persons to a site with 12 shacks next to a sewage treatment plant, despite sanctions from the Romanian National Council for Combating Discrimination and the European Court for Human Rights. The relocated persons at the settlement were only granted access to four public toilets in the settlement, and only one source for potable water. Insufficient barriers allowed children to access industrial equipment near the site, posing safety hazards. The plant also emits toxic gases, where warning signs posted surrounding the site explicitly state \"Attention! Toxic gas.\" Medically unconfirmed reports from residents claim that two infants have died as a result of the gases.\n\nThe settlement was only accessible by dirt road, with no public transportation. By 2010, 150 persons were living at the site. The settlement was originally mandated to be temporary in nature, yet by 2010 it had been there for five years. At another settlement near Miercurea Ciuc, 25 people were documented in 2010 as living at or near a garbage pit near a stray dog facility, outside city limits. The inhabitants of this unnamed settlement did not have access to public transportation for sending their children to school; the sole source of employment was scavenging through garbage; and many of the inhabitants were documented as not having identity cards, making it impossible to access social insurance and subsidized health care.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, hundreds of Romani from the Craica ghetto of Baia Mare were forcibly relocated by local authorities to a former chemical laboratory at a decommissioned chemical factory. Many observers viewed the relocation as an effort by Mayor Cătălin Cherecheș to gain popularity among racist elements of the electorate leading up to elections nine days later. This incident followed the 2011 construction of a six foot high wall, also instigated by Cherecheş, to encircle a Romani neighbourhood in Baia Mare. Cherecheş has stated that living conditions would be favourable to the Romani at the chemical plant compared to Craica, despite the former factory having a reputation among Romanians as a \"plant of death\" due to its status as the second-most polluting chemical facility in the country.\n\nWithin several hours of arriving on site, 22 Romani children and two adults began to exhibit symptoms of chemical poisoning, resulting in a major response by emergency personnel and evacuation of the sick to hospital. It is believed the poisoning was caused by containers of chemical substances which had been abandoned at the property. Shortly afterwards, on June 3, the mayor's mother, Viorica Cherecheş, also a physician and the director of a local hospital, arrived on scene with a police presence, and ordered the relocated Romani to collect, without any safety equipment, all of the remaining chemical containers.\n\nAccording to Marian Mandache, executive director of the Romani rights organization Romani CRISS, it is suspected that the action was to remove evidence of wrongdoing. On June 7, 36 Romani and non-Romani NGO's signed a letter to Romanian Prime Minister Victor Pona regarding the relocation, and held a protest outside the Romanian parliament.\n\nIn 2007, the city of Dorohui-Centrul Vechi displaced 14–15 Romani families following the demolishment of a housing complex. These individuals were then planned to be relocated to a social housing facility located close to a wastewater treatment plant and an industrial estate. Also in 2007, with funding from the European Commission (which has a financing policy that prohibits exclusionary forms of segregation) plans were developed to construct 20 houses for Romani within an industrial zone in Constanța, with no access to nearby schools, limited transportation, and no community facilities. Similar resettlements of Romani residents to environmentally problematic locations have taken place in Piatra Neamt, Episcopia Bihor, Bucharest, and Salaj Silmeul Silvaniei, of which the former two cases had residents located near and on top of garbage dumps, respectively.\n\nAccording to Babourkova, Romani communities in Bulgaria have, in post-socialist times, been subject to \"environmental injustices\" such as unequal access to infrastructure, housing, and utilities. Bulgarian electricity distribution was privatized between 2000 and 2005. Prior to the collapse of socialism, access to electricity was near-universal; inequalities in distribution began to emerge following privatization. A number of Romani settlements throughout Bulgaria do not have any electrical services. Meanwhile, 89% of Romani persons in Bulgaria do not have access to clean water.\n\nIn the Fakulteta district of Sofia, a Romani ghetto estimated at 60,000 residents (the official figure is 15,000), housing is predominantly substandard, public transit is minimal, water supply and sewerage is limited, and the electrical network is inadequate and subject to frequent failures. In the poorest section of Fakulteta, Glavova mahala, only one water outlet exists for 200 families. Until June 2003, medical services in the community were \"non-existent\". Because the city of Sofia does not provide garbage collection services, residents regularly burn their garbage and children have been documented burning old tires, causing them to be exposed to toxic gases which may contain carcinogens such as dioxins. Another concern is the illegal dumping of solid and hazardous waste. Construction firms regularly dump potentially toxic waste in Fakulteta to skirt disposal regulations; a former green space in the settlement has been converted into an illegal disposal site.\n\nIn the Romani settlement of Stolipinovo in Plovdiv, residents had their electricity shut off by the private Austrian utility company EVN Group in February 2002, due to the community's cumulative failure to pay utility bills since the early 1990s. Following the shutdown, protests and confrontations with police ensued, and the entire settlement had its electrical access reduced to the hours of 7pm to 7am, causing significant challenges for food storage and preparation. Babourkova argues that this incident is \"a clear-cut case of distributional injustice towards the Roma population of Stolipinovo leading to a disproportionate health burden for local residents\".\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, \"Slovenia is a highly developed country and enjoys a GDP per capita above the average in the European Union\", with nearly 100% access to clean water. However, also according to Amnesty International, an estimated 20 to 30 percent of southeastern Slovenian Romani settlements do not have access to clean water. Due to the lack of precise, comprehensive information, it is believed that this statistic under-represents the prevalence of water access issues for Slovenian Romani. In the Romani settlement of Dobruška vas in Škocjan, residents have reported having to drink water from a stream contaminated by sewage and waste from a slaughterhouse, and a local pediatrician from Novo Mesto has testified that children from the settlement experience extremely high rates of illnesses such as diarrhea and Rotavirus.\n\nIn the words of \"UN Expert on Human Rights – Water and Sanitation\" Catarina de Albuquerque, speaking on June 1, 2010 regarding the situation for Slovenian Romani:\n\nThe consequences of this lack of access to water and sanitation are devastating for these communities. ... In one community with no access to water, the people drink from a polluted stream, or have to walk for 2 hours to obtain safe water. They collect the water in jerry cans to haul back to their homes. ... The situation is reminiscent of situations I have witnessed in much poorer countries and astonishing to observe in a country where so much has been achieved for the vast majority of the population.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 35% of Romani households in Croatia did not have access to a \"piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities\".\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, 17% of Romani persons lack access to electricity and 25.8% do not have household access to drinking water. Scrap metal collection is a dominant economic activity, despite its known health hazards. In Lukavac, northern Bosnia, a Romani settlement was subject to severe flooding in 2014, and residents did not receive government funding to rebuild. One severe example of environmental inequality in Lukavac, where Romani persons lack adequate access to energy resources, is the practice of coal theft. Young Romani men climb onto moving freight trains departing from the Lukavac coal mine in an attempt to push coal off the tops of the roofless cars by hand. After the coal falls to the ground, the men then collect the coal into 50 kilogram bags which are then sold in town for two Euros apiece. According to nearby residents, several individuals collecting coal have died in accidents involving trains as a result of this practice.\n\nAn unplanned Romani settlement called Gazela (Karton City) was located in Belgrade, Serbia near a railway underneath the Gazela Bridge, one of the main highway access points to the city. It was dismantled in 2010.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, a national government-supported environmental campaign took place under the name \"We clean Serbia\". The campaign identified so-called \"wild dumps\" (open-air landfills with poor environmental controls) as the most significant pollution source in Belgrade, and sought to address ecological issues surrounding these dumps.\n\nAs part of the \"We clean Serbia\" campaign, the city government of Belgrade displaced 17 Romani slums that were on or near the dumps, which were formally classified as \"unhygienic settlements\". These informal settlements, where residents worked as waste pickers, were largely the direct result of the Yugoslav wars—especially the Kosovo war—as most of the residents came to inhabit these settlements as internally displaced persons (IDP's), refugees, or repatriated refugees. An estimated 75% of recycled materials in Serbia are gathered by informal waste pickers; however, this activity is illegal.\n\nOver 2,800 slum residents were displaced, half of whom were settled into initially \"temporary\" shipping containers on the outskirts of Belgrade; the other half were evicted from Belgrade altogether. The container settlements have been criticized by economic anthropologist Eva Schwab, who has argued that social services provided to residents are tied to problematic \"contracts of use\" which require residents not to store scavenged materials near their containers, and to be employed by the Public Utility Service for its own recycling programmes. Under this system, Romani who do not comply are denied social services (such as education for their children) and face removal from their dwelling. Municipal governments in Belgrade have also complained of poor infrastructure in the container settlements and have documented failure of low-quality water pipes, which has resulted in flooding that has caused significant disruption for neighbouring communities.\n\nAs of 2007, close to 1,000 persons in Belgrade were inhabiting the Romani settlement of Deponija (which means \"dumping site\" in Serbian). The settlement had been established in the 1970s situated on top of a former dump, which was officially shut down, gradually, in the 1980s. Polluting factories surround the settlement. The primary livelihood of residents was recycling from garbage trucks hired to dump in the community, an activity which frequently led to the unintended accumulation of non-recyclable waste in the settlement. The community lacked clean water, sewage treatment, and utility connections.\n\nSituated near the city of Nikčić is one of the most populous Romani settlements in Montenegro. The settlement is isolated from the city, yet located between a steel production facility which emits hazardous pollutants and an iron ore mine. According to a 2017 European Roma Rights Centre report, \"The air and land in the settlements is permanently contaminated by iron ore dust from passing trucks.\"\n\nKonik 2 is a camp for internally displaced persons from Kosovo of Romani origin, situated on the outskirts of the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica. In spite of oversight from the UNHCR and Italian Red Cross, as of 2014 the camp lacked basic access to safe, clean drinking water and sanitation, and has been serviced by only one water tap.\n\nIn the Romani settlement of Prilep in Macedonia, there is no working sewage system. A similar situation exists in a Romani settlement in Tetovo, where there is no clean water, electricity or sewerage, and high rates of disease.\n\nAs of 2016, along the Vardar River in central Skopje, Macedonia, there is a Romani settlement of approximately two hundred persons who do not have safe access to clean drinking water. Sewerage and sanitation services do not exist, and garbage accumulation is a concern. The pump used to provide water from the Vardar River had previously been used for agricultural purposes, and has repeatedly tested positive for contaminants.\n\nFor thirty years until 2003, 700 mostly Romani families in the town of Veles, Macedonia, were exposed annually to 62,000 tons of zinc, 47,300 tons of lead, and 120,000 tons of sulphur dioxide from a nearby smelting plant. Despite opposition from experts advising the project, the smelter was built 300 meters from the houses of 60,000 people. Frequently, newborns in the town were diagnosed with cancer, respiratory or blood issues, lung disease, and heart disease. In 2005, Veles pediatrician Rozeta Bosilkova stated \"My patients do not respond well to any treatment, even for the common cold. This is because their defence mechanisms have been badly eroded.\" According to the Association for the Protection of Future Generations of Veles, the children of two families were tested with lead levels between five and seven times normal concentrations.\n\nDue to concerns over food contamination, in 2001 the mayor of Veles requested that all agricultural and cattle farming operations be shut down. In 2005, one doctor working in the town described the situation as resembling a \"horror film\", stating \"Babies are being born with entire organs missing. The deformities are frightening.\"\n\nFollowing proposals to re-open the smelter in 2006 by Metrudhem DOOEL Skopje, a series of protests and court battles took place. In 2014, the City of Veles deleted the plant from its Detailed Urban Plan, effectively shutting down the operation permanently, which was legally possible due to the plant having been closed for three years prior. Severe pollution from 1.7 million tons of slag remain; as of 2016, the Macedonian firm Ekocentar has won a contract to mine the slag for zinc, lead, and cadmium.\n\nAccording to the European Roma Rights Centre, as recently as 2015 there was a large Romani settlement built above waste landfill on the outskirts of Tirana in Municipality 11 situated next to a \"poisonous Tirana city lake\". In absence of a reliable water system, residents obtained water from a private seller. During the frequent absences of this service, residents would obtain water from the lake, in spite of health concerns regarding its toxicity. Following an alleged robbery of a German tourist by a Romani individual from the area, the settlement was evicted in 2015.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Development Program's 2011 Regional Roma Survey, 30% of Romani households in Albania did not have access to a \"piped, public water supply and remained dependent on water where the quality was not tested by the competent public authorities\".\n\nDuring the 1999 war in Kosovo, Romani communities did not align militarily with Serbian or Albanian forces during the ethnic-based conflict. As a result, four-fifths of the Romani people in Kosovo were violently expelled from their homes. NATO did not intervene. In total, 100,000 Romani Kosovars were displaced. 50,000 fled to the European Union; however, due to their legal status as internally displaced persons, they were not legally allowed to freely leave the territories of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe UNHCR relocated five hundred displaced Romani from Mitrovica to a camp in northern Kosovo located on top of an abandoned lead tailings site at the former Trepča mining complex in Kosovska. In 2005, the World Health Organization stated that \"the worst environmental disaster for children in the whole of Europe\" was happening, declaring the camps unfit for human habitation and in need of immediate evacuation.\nPrior to the war, the Romani community in Mitrovica was economically active. According to Skender Gushani of the Association for the Protection of Roma Rights Mitrovica \n\nWe [the Romani of Mitrovica] had shops, a market, restaurants, our own local government council with representatives, and we maintained our culture and traditions. We didn't have to go to town for anything because here we had everything we needed. In our neighbourhood we had technical equipments , car repair shops and masons ... 6000 of us had jobs at Trepca, the battery factory of Zvecan, where we smelted lead. There were also some among us, about 20 of us, who are well-educated and worked in the local government council.According to Avdula Mustafa, an activist with the Roma and Ashkalia Documentation Center, the UNHCR promised that the refugee camps in Kosovska were only temporary, and would be closed within 45 days. However, the UNHCR added a second and third camp, indicating no intention of relocating from the site. The names of the three camps were Cesmin Lug, Kablare, and Osterode. These camps were located on or near 500 tonnes of toxic waste. Across the River Ibar, there is a further 100 million tonnes of toxic slag, a legacy of mining and smelting activities at the Trepča complex whose operations spanned from 1927 to 2000.\n\nAt these new settlements, living conditions were severely substandard. Constructed by the UNHCR in collaboration with Action by Churches Together, houses on the toxic sites were built with lead-painted boards, no working sewerage system, and no reliable sources of running water. Residents lived in fear of violence from neighboring non-Romani communities, restricting their freedom of movement and ability to leave the camps.\n\nIn 2000, the World Health Organization conducted the first round of blood tests of residents in the camps. Blood lead levels were so high that the WHO recommended immediate evacuation of the camps, as well as fencing off the sites to prevent future exposure. In 2005, the WHO conducted further tests which determined that levels of lead in the blood of children from the camps were the highest ever recorded among humans.\n\nTests for lead poisoning among 60 children were administered by Dr. Miljana Stojanovich, a doctor working for the Institute of Public Health in Mitrovica, who later stated \"I haven't heard of results like this from anywhere else in the world...such high lead-levels in blood from such a small area.\" The tests determined that most children had blood lead levels higher than 65 micrograms per deciliter, the highest Dr. Stojanovich's instruments could measure. Test samples sent to a lab in Belgium were re-taken in order to verify if such levels were even possible; the results confirmed that children tested held the highest concentrations of blood lead in medical literature. 10 micrograms per deciliter is the threshold at which brain damage begins, including IQ loss, according to Dorit Nitzan, Director of WHO Serbia, who has stated that the camps constitute \"one of the most serious public health disasters in modern Europe\".In spite of concerns over lead exposure, the UNHCR decided to keep the camps open. Shortly after receiving the 2000 test results, the UN built a jogging track and basketball court between two of the settlements, naming the area the \"Alley of Health\". Signs in poorly translated English posted at the site by the UNHCR readALLEY OF HEALTH – LENGTH OF ALLEY – 1500 METERS – INHALE THE ODOUR OF HEALTH – THERE ARE CHALLENGES AWAITING FOR YOU – WIN – SPIRIT IS HEALTHY IN HEALTHY BODYIn the opinion of Ilija Elezovich from the Kosovo Health Authority during a 2005 interview, \"the danger is so great that it threatens to destroy one full generation of Roma children ... they [UNHCR] made a catastrophic mistake by building these camps. Nobody cared about the danger of this location. This is very tragic for everybody, but especially for the Roma inhabitants.\"\n\nAccording to a 2008 and subsequent 2009 interview with Avdula Mustafa, the UNHCR responded to intense international attention toward the case by publicly promoting a plan to move residents to a former French military barracks. However, this proposed site was only 50 meters away from one of the original settlements, and thus of minimal improvement in terms of environmental health effects. Romani activists such as Mustafa have speculated that the UNHCR was attempting to pressure residents into returning to their former homes, despite grave fears over their personal safety. Concern related to these allegations grew following withdrawals of international assistance including emergency medications used to mitigate lead poisoning among children and pregnant women. By 2005, 29 deaths had been recorded in the camps. By 2012, that number had risen to approximately 100, most of them children. In 2012, 100 families were moved off the contaminated site, but 40 families remained.\n\nThe UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has granted itself diplomatic immunity claiming it cannot be held legally accountable for its actions. However, a lawsuit was initiated by the European Roma Rights Centre in 2006 with the European Court of Human Rights. All children conceived in the camps have irreversible brain damage.\n\nThe systematic targeting and genocide of Romani and Sinti communities in Germany during the Holocaust was not officially recognized until 1982. Despite having a recorded presence in German-speaking territories since 1419, many Romani and Sinti were denied or stripped of citizenship following the war. In absence of comprehensive reparation or conciliation processes, Romani and Sinti in Germany have experienced ongoing violence, harassment, and marginalization within a broader context of environmental discrimination. The relationship between postwar socio-economic exclusion of Romani and Sinti communities with environmental marginalization has been documented by scholars such as Alphia Abdikeeva as early as 2002. According to Abdikeeva, Heuss, and Kawczyński, \"most of the so-called 'Sinti settlements' were formed after the war, when German Sinti and Roma who returned to their hometowns from concentration camps were resettled in city and town slums, usually in the least attractive area, in conditions which posed serious environmental and health risks\".\n\nAs of 2004, several hundred Sinti families resided on the outskirts of Heidelberg in a settlement by the name of Henkel Terosonstrasse, in a chemically contaminated area outside city limits. Most residents were unemployed; both the land and groundwater were believed to be contaminated. Across the street from the site is a chemical plant operated by Henkel Chemical Company. In spite of health concerns, as of 2004 no studies on health and environmental effects had been conducted.\n\nSince 1995, authorities in Berlin have operated a user-fee camping facility for seasonal Sinti workers on the Dreilinden property. The facility houses up to 200 persons and is a source of concern due to its location on the outskirts of Berlin, constructed along 100 meters of railway line. Housing conditions are poor, while utilities and infrastructure is minimal.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, authorities selected a former toxic waste dump as the location for a new Sinti settlement by the name of Georgwerderring on the outskirts of Hamburg, in spite of the site having been deemed unfit for human habitation during the mid-1970s. Home to at least 200 persons, residents were not informed of the site's history. As of 2004, there were concerns that rising groundwater may have forced toxins to the surface and contaminated the land and air, sparking fears among some medical experts that birth defects, stillborns, and certain illnesses could be dramatically on the rise. As of 2004, the settlement was isolated, poorly served by public transportation, and located in close proximity to the new Hamburg city dump posing further ongoing health concerns.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Kistnersgrund Sinti settlement was constructed in Bad Hersfeld, Hesse. Located on the outskirts of the city, it was situated on top of a garbage dump. Following a hepatitis outbreak in the early 1980s, authorities relocated the community to a new settlement called Haunewiese, where residents have experienced substandard housing conditions.\n\nAir pollution in the United Kingdom has been identified as an issue disproportionately affecting minority ethnic and racial groups, particularly those who identify as Black-British African. According to a UK Government report, \"Nationally, for those who live in areas overlapping the motorway and A road network in England, on average ethnic groups not classified as White–British are exposed to 17.5 per cent higher concentrations of PM10 ... Across the different areas individuals identified as Black or Black-British African are exposed to the highest levels of PM10 of up to almost 30 per cent higher than White British.\n\nRomani and Travellers in the UK have been identified as experiencing unequal burdens of negative environmental living conditions. In Wales, Romani and Traveller sites have been documented as being frequently located near scrap metal facilities, which is a major source of employment. Romani and Travellers frequently burn scrap as a way of cleaning metals for recycling which can be a cause for health concerns. Throughout the United Kingdom, many public Romani and Traveller encampment and housing sites are, according to Staniewicz, \"located in polluted environments, far away from local services, next to sewage works or under flyovers. Pitches are often overcrowded and facilities are well below the standard expected of social housing.\"\n\nIn general, Romani and Traveller sites are rural and segregated from areas that would normally be considered residential areas; it is common for these sites to be environmentally disadvantaged by being located near motorways, railroads, and garbage dumps, quarries, waterways, electrical transmission lines, or surrounded by industrial zones, all of which have been identified as environmental health concerns. As of 2004, seventy percent of local authority (LA) Irish Traveller sites in England were identified as having at least two or more environmental hazards, while twenty-three percent of such sites were identified as being subject to four or more environmental hazards.\n\nAccording to Steger, \"A high percentage of Gypsy and Traveller communities in the United Kingdom (UK) are located in areas that are fully unsuitable for living and raising families. In addition to the environmental health risks posed by living in highly polluted areas, such communities also tend to be on the outskirts of towns making access to public services, transportation, and employment difficult, if not impossible.\" The United Kingdom Department of Health supported a 2004 study that identified Romani and Travellers as being subject to disproportionate health needs compared to other ethnic minority groups in the UK, yet receiving substantially less health services.\n\nOne location of particular concern has been Barry's Council's Gander site in West London, inhabited by Irish Travellers. As of 2004, the site was situated near a highway and next to an aggregate concrete factory, which was built in 1999, prior to the Travellers being moved onto the site by local authorities. One survey determined that approximately half the residents felt that the site was unhealthy; since moving to the site, residents have reported skin rashes and abnormalities, asthma, and breathing difficulties among infants. One observer has statedMaybe the asthma has a connection with the factory because you couldn't even see through the windscreen [on her car] with the dust on it. The general health of the Travellers on site is pretty good ... a lot of them are registered with the medical centre.Communication between factory management and Traveller residents over health concerns and industrial operations plans has been described as being insufficient. The settlement was subject to irregular or nonexistent garbage collection services, poor sewerage, rat infestations, and fire hazards. Residents asked for either the factory to be shut down, or for themselves to be relocated to a different area of Gander. At one meeting at the site in 2001, residents expressed a readiness to leave their traditional nomadic lifestyle by moving into houses, citing restrictive laws on travelling, frequent evictions, allegations of constant police harassment, and deteriorating health conditions at the Barry site.\n\nDr. Colm Powers, who conducted a comprehensive report in 2004 on the social and health situation of Irish Travellers in England, has argued that pressure on Travellers to abandon their nomadic lifestyle constitutes a pressing human rights issue. According to Powers, the pressure to settle is twofold, stemming from the perceived criminalization of travelling, combined with the arguably poor quality of camping locations. Powers argues the process of settling into permanent housing is a traumatic experience for many Travellers, who can experience cultural challenges and further social marginalization. In the view of Powers,These twin pressures [of criminalization and poor camping sites] gives support to the painful and disturbing process of cultural breakdown that leads to assimilation into the most marginalised and excluded sections of society. Nomadism is usually recognised by settled society as the sole (or salient) ethnic qualifier for Travellers, so its criminalisation and eradication erroneously signals the cultural assimilation of Travellers and Gypsies. This 'blindness' to the depth, complexity and strength of Traveller culture leaves 'settled' Travellers with little sensitive health and welfare support when they are forced into settled accommodation and it is most needed. The inability or unwillingness of many institutional support agencies to engage actively, supportively and sensitively with settled Travellers is creating a well of discontent among many young settled Travellers that is already evident in the high levels of criminalisation particularly in the settled Irish Traveller population\n\nIn 2015, community secretary Eric Pickles was found by a high court ruling to be in breach of the 2010 Equality Act. According to Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, Pickles had \"unlawfully discriminated\" against Romani communities seeking to establish camping sites in Green Belt lands by systematically delaying and overturning their development proposals. According to Romani activists, \"local councils have consistently failed to earmark land for potential sites in local plans, and many Gypsies and Travellers have bought land, including in the green belt, to develop sites for themselves\". Yet, according to Justice Gilbart, Pickles had created a policy in 2013–2014 that systematically turned down development appeal requests by \"Romani Gypsies\" and \"Travellers\". This policy was found by Justice Gilbart to be a protocol \"which discriminated against a racial group\".\n\nThe planning minister, Brandon Lewis, responded to the ruling by stating \"The government's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the green belt. Today's judgment does not question that principle.\"\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission responded to the ruling by stating \"We have a duty to protect everyone from discrimination and ensure that the law is applied fairly, consistently and equally for all. We understand the need to be sensitive about green belt development but this should not be used to single out individuals for unlawful discrimination. Planning decisions should be taken on the merits of an application, not the characteristics of the applicant.\"\n\nPreviously, Eric Pickles, a Conservative cabinet minister, had been accused in 2011 of allowing his department to release a statement which referred to Traveller camps on green belt lands as a \"blight\". During an interview on ITV, Pickles stated of the camps that \"We inherited a situation where the number of illegal sites had gone up four-fold and what we expect them to do is obey the law like you and I do,\" he said, continuing \"It does not give people the right to come on to a green belt...and to trash it.\" Joseph P. Jones, chairman of the Gypsy Council and Yvonne MacNamara, director of the Irish Traveller's Movement respectively, have responded with public statements expressing their view that Pickles' comments were discriminatory and hostile in nature, with Jones stating that Pickles' statements constituted an example of how the Romani and Traveller communities are often treated by dominant culture as \"toxic waste\". According to Jones, the UK government had been applying a discriminatory standard by denying Romani and Traveller development applications, while simultaneously having a history of approving construction of towns such as Milton Keynes, Basildon New Town, and New Ash Green, the latter two of which were, in the words of Jones, \"built for the total strangers of the London overflow, on the open countryside or green belt\". In the opinion of Jones,We [Romani and Travellers] have been constantly pushed out on the periphery of society, through the failures those in local political positions to identify and provide accommodation. This is not new, ever since the Caravans Sites Act of 1960 the Gypsy/Traveller population have constantly seen the goal posts moved, heard those in power, saying this is not the right place for your type. But we never seem to get any directions to a place that is.\n\nThe eviction of Dale Farm in Essex, a camp settlement formerly home to approximately 1,000 Romani and Travellers on Green Belt land has been highlighted as a case of racially motivated marginalization. The camp, located on a former scrap metal yard, had been inhabited by Romani and Travellers since the 1960s; however, despite ownership of the land, residents were denied zoning permits to develop the property. Illuzzi argues that in 2011, \"expulsions and legal battle over the status of Dale Farm in the UK highlighted yet another confrontation over the illegality of Roma/Traveller behavior when they legally purchased 'green belt' land and were denied permits from the town council to build on that land. Town councils continue to work against allowing Traveller settlements in or near their towns.\" The evictions were completed in 2011 and involved violent clashes with police.\n\nInstances of racialized marginalization within an environmental context have been documented in the United Kingdom dating back to the late 1800s. According to Mayall, the district of Mitcham was subject to spatial segregation of transient populations, including Romani and Traveller groups (referred to as \"Gypsies\"):\nAs we have noted, certain locales appear to lend themselves to housing a transient population: Mitcham on the borders of South London and Surrey was one such place. By the late 19th century Surrey was a main centre for Gypsies, itinerants and vagrants with an estimated (though probably exaggerated) 10,000 in the county alone, many of whom had been expelled from London through a combination of 'the Metropolitan Police, land agents, sanitary authorities, and building developments.' (Mayall, 1988, pp 158-9).\nSmith and Greenfields note the link between poverty, upper-class departure (for the United States context, see white flight) and the demographic presence of Romani and Traveller communities in Mitcham, as well as the economic prominence of environmentally polluting 'dirty industries' within the community. In the words of Smith and Greenfields,\n\nMitcham had long been one of the poorest parishes in Surrey and records of Gypsies camping in the area date back to the 1700s. Between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries the area declined in respectability as several landowning families departed and its population grew significantly as outward migration from London increased the population of poor and displaced residents (Smith, 2005, p 67). Of these, Gypsies and itinerants formed a significant minority: the 1881 census records 230 Gypsies and vagrants camping on Mitcham Common … [Mitcham] contained an abundance of market gardens which provided regular seasonal employment with the locality becoming an important site for industry in the early to mid-20th century, particularly the 'dirty industries' such as paint making, chemical works and bone boiling, which had been expelled from inner London by the 1845 Health Act. The importance of Gypsy labour to the area's industry in this period is revealed by Montague, who notes that … when Purdom's [paint and varnish] factory was originally established production had been seasonal, taking place mainly in the winter months when Gypsy and other casual labour employed on the physic gardens during the rest of the year was available at very low rates. (Montague, 2006, p 79)\n\nBy 1909, over 190 vans were documented as being situated at Mitcham Common, along with numerous others at sites nearby, in spite of efforts to displace nomadic residents through by-laws such as the Mitcham Common Act of 1891. In the words of Smith and Greenfields, the urban area of Mitcham became a district whereGypsies had moved into the small terraced houses that were known locally as 'Redskin Village' (in reference to the dark colouring of its inhabitants) by the 1920s. According to Montague, by the 1930's the area had become one of the most disreputable and notorious in the district and was 'associated in the public mind with some of the worst slums in the emerging township' (Montague, 2006, p 113).\n\nAt 7am on March 30, 1933, an explosion took place at the W.J. Bush & Co essential oils distillery adjacent to 'Redskin Village', killing a twelve year-old boy and seriously injuring twenty-three others. According to the Merton Memories Photographic Archive, \"the explosion brought this community ['Redskin Village'] to an end\", although the distillery re-opened and continued operations until 1968, closing after 200 years in the same location. Images taken of the explosion provide early photographic documentation of an event involving an ethnic minority community in the UK affected by an industrial disaster.\n\nTravellers in Ireland have a documented history of experiencing racism within an environmental context, particularly with regards to hazardous working conditions in the metal recycling sector. According to research conducted in 2010 by the \"All Ireland Traveller Health Study\", approximately 2,700 Irish Travellers lacked access to running water, out of a total Traveller population of 36,224 in the Republic of Ireland and 3,905 in Northern Ireland. In the same survey, nearly a quarter of Traveller respondents stated that they felt either \"unhealthy or very unhealthy\" in their places of residence.\n\nAccording to a 2008 report on Traveller housing conditions by the Centre for Housing Research, 82.5% of housing locations (namely group housing facilities and caravan or halting sites) were found to be situated with \"some form of environmental hazard nearby\". Out of 40 halting sites and group housing facilities evaluated, 33 were found to be near such hazards, which were listed as electricity pylons, telephone masts, dumps, major roads, and industrial pollution. Likewise, sixteen of the locations had no designated green space (and of the remaining 19 sites, only five had green space in active use), thirty-one had no functional emergency equipment, thirty-eight had no communal phone access, and twenty-one did not have provisions for horses.\n\nAs a distinct ethnic group, Travellers in Ireland are subject to racism, in spite of their physical appearances. According to Canadian sociologist Jane Helleiner, \"some of the first challenges to a model of Southern Ireland as ethnically homogeneous and free of racism came from activists concerned with the status of Travelling People ... The identification of Travellers as an ethnic group has been a central premise of the human rights and community development work of Traveller advocacy organizations from at least the 1980s, and these groups by naming the discrimination and exclusion experiences by Travellers as a form of Irish racism have been influential in injecting the term into Irish political discourse (McVeigh 1996: 9).\" According to Helleiner, \"For some activist-scholars ... anti-Travellerism is understood as a form of 'racism without race'—i.e., a form of inferiorized difference that does not invoke biological inferiority, but rather notions of undesirable cultural difference (see Anthias citing Balibar 1995: 294).\"\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Galway City began to experience significant economic growth. According to Helleiner (2000), \"In the early 1950s the central government prompted internationally financed industrial development in the Galway region, and by the mid-1960s the city was specifically targeted for investment and provided with industrial estate (Ó Cearbhill and Cawley 1984: 258-9) ... Galway City has continued to see tremendous economic, demographic, and spatial growth associated with international investment in industry and service sectors and a vigorous tourist trade.\" However, according to Helleiner, social and economic inequalities have persisted in the region.\n\nTravellers continue to engage in informal and self-employed labour, particularly metal recycling and car scrapping, as this type of employment supports \"an independent and nomadic way of life\". During the 1980s Travellers increasingly gravitated toward casual labour that allowed for greater autonomy than formal labour, motivated in part by the racist conditions of formal labour markets in Ireland. For employment, Travellers scavenged from the Galway city dump as well as industrial and commercial refuse bins for scrap metal. Work in the scrap metal trade at the Galway City dump has been described by Helleiner as being exclusively performed by women, working in unsanitary conditions amidst piles of garbage. In the words of Helleiner, \"None of the men engaged in this dangerous activity.\n\nThe work at the dump was organized by informal means, as described by Helleiner: \"Gaining and keeping a regular position at the dump depended on having close kinship or affinal ties to those already established.\" Also, scrap metal collection involved logistical challenges of transporting product, and the need for capital investments such as vehicles. In spite of the health risks (including cleaning the metal by burning off non-metallic material) and capital investments entailed in this work, Travellers were economically disadvantaged by fluctuations in prices set from scrap metal merchants. According to Helleiner Travellers were in a vulnerable position in this exchange as the prices for scrap were set by larger forces of demand and supply and bore no relationship to the amount of labour involved. There were few ways for Travellers to alter the terms of trade to their advantage. Most, for instance, had little withholding power as they lacked sufficient space on which to stockpile scrap in anticipation of higher prices ... This particular form of 'self-employment,' then, was dependent upon unequal exchanges over which Travellers had little independent control.\n\nAt 4:24 AM, October 10, 2015, Dublin emergency services responded to a fire that swept through a trailer at the Carrickmines halting site on Glenamuck Road South. Ten Travellers, five children and five adults, perished in the blaze. Fourteen were left homeless. Substandard housing conditions have been cited as potential contributing causes of the fire. Immediate attempts by survivors to stop the blaze were impossible due to the water at the closest fire hydrant having been shut off by local authorities several months prior. Following the tragedy, plans were made to rehouse the survivors at a site adjacent to Rockville Drive. At first, survivors of the fire received public shows of respect. However, claiming not to have been consulted by their local council, residents of the neighbourhood opposed the resettlement, and protested by blockading excavation machinery from the site. According to a close non-Traveller family friend of the survivors who organized the funeral, From Dublin to Wexford, the courtesy from people was just absolutely, it was like a state funeral. Every village that we passed through, people come out, they raised their cups, you know, it was so much respect shown for the family all the way down and, you know, it wasn't ignored, the family couldn't believe that people actually come out and respected them in this manner, but that was all taken away the minute we hit Wexford town because it was in lockdown even down to the local car parks, for the first time in my life, I got an insight on what it was like to be a Traveller.\n\nThe Irish Minister for Equality Aodhán Ó Ríordáin responded to the protest by tweeting, \"This disgusting behaviour is not reflective of all settled people.\" The Minister for the Environment, Alan Kelly, also commented on the incident, condemning the protest as \"wrong\". The survivors were not resettled at the Rockville Drive site. Instead, the survivors were re-housed at an isolated location adjacent to a decommissioned garbage dump in immediate proximity to a high voltage power station, described by actor and Irish traveller John Connors as a place \"that no one could object to\".\n\nIn August 2017, the survivors returned to their former living site, and were reportedly pleased with the halting site-style redevelopment carried out by the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, according to a family friend. As of August 2017, inquests into the fire deaths are currently underway, and survivors have called for a full inquiry into the tragedy.\n\nIn France, categories of minority and race are not officially recognized, nor are they recorded in census or socio-demographic data, which can make instances of environmental racism difficult to identify. Only nationality and country of birth are recorded, and only for first-generation migrants; persons born abroad in France are mostly from North and Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a smaller presence from Eastern Europe.\n\nAccording to a 2008 study by Lucie Laurian titled \"Environmental Injustice in France\", \"towns with high proportions of immigrants tend to host more hazardous sites, even controlling for population size, income, [and] degree of industrialization of the town and region\". In the case of towns which have the highest percentage of residents who are born abroad, there is a significantly higher likelihood for there to be polluted sites nearby. As stated by Laurian,\n\nAs of 2008, there were 279 halting sites designated for French Travellers (Yenish), a distinct ethnic group in France. In a RAXEN interview with the National Association of Catholic Travellers, environmental issues were cited as a factor in the segregated conditions found at most Traveller halting sites, which one resident likened to \"Indian Reservations\". According to the Association,\n\nSimilar issues exist for Romani communities in France. Most reside in shantytowns and other forms of substandard housing, frequently located far outside city centers without access to social services, health care, utilities, or clean drinking water. These settlements are often situated on brownfield sites, near highways or other industrialized transportation infrastructure, or squatting on agricultural or forest lands.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Romani communities in France may be experiencing environmental discrimination through exposure to e-waste contamination. According to a 2010 investigative report by \"The Ecologist\" written by Carolyn Lebel, some Romani people in France have been compelled by \"poverty and discrimination\" to become involved with the scavenging of electronic waste (e-waste), handling an unknown quantity of the 750,000 tonnes of French e-waste that annually disappears into informal disposal and recycling networks.\n\nDue to allegedly discriminatory employment regulations in France, many Romani find it impossible to gain formal employment. As a result, many have turned to clandestine recycling operations of e-waste in slums outside large French cities. At these sites, e-waste is broken into various types of metals, such as aluminum, copper, iron, and lead. Copper is extracted from cables by burning them in open fires, while car batteries are melted down for lead and refrigerators are sent through car crushers without removing cooling agents, which can release up to four tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere per unit.\n\nAccording to the observations of Dr. Bernard Moriau, \"[The Romani] would work directly above these clouds of black smoke\", in reference to Romani people he witnessed working in a forest in the Val d'Oise region near Paris. In 2008, contamination from cancer-causing heavy metals was found in an evicted Romani camp near Lyon; likewise, this finding was preceded by a 1998 study in Bordeaux, Annecy, and Toulouse. The study, conducted by Doctors of the World and local NGOs, identified abnormal lead exposure in fifty percent of children at the camps. Furthermore, one-quarter of the children examined were identified as having lead poisoning. In a 2010 case, 19 children at a site in Lyon were found to have high blood lead levels.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jean-Claude Guiraud, thousands of children in France living at or near illegal recycling sites are at risk of lead exposure, which, according to Guiraud \"can cause permanent damage to all the organs including the brain\". In spite of these statistics, the issue, as of 2010, has received little attention from authorities in France.\n\nSince 2004, there has been criticism of Romanian and Bulgarian EU citizens who allegedly out-compete French locals in the wild mushroom picking industry. Eastern European harvesters, a large number of whom are believed to be ethnic Romani, have removed significant quantities of porcini and milk cap (\"Lactarius deliciosus\") mushrooms for export to Spain, allegedly emptying forests of mushroom supplies. These predominantly Romani pickers have been accused of harvesting improperly, allegedly causing permanent damage to the forest ecosystem and destroying future mushroom yields.\n\nAccording to Thomas Kuyper, \"professor of fungal ecology and diversity at Wageningen University in the Netherlands\", there is no scientific evidence of improper harvesting methods causing damage to future mushroom yields. Kuyper suggests that the allegations were a result of xenophobia rather than evidence-based observations, and that there is a history of similar accusations in Germany and the Netherlands in response to migrant harvesters. In Slovakia in 2006, accusations were published claiming that Romani mushroom harvesters in the Tatra region were responsible for an alleged lack of forage for bears.\n\nLarge numbers of predominantly Romani workers have been reportedly harvesting without proper licenses (although no documentation exists as to the exact number of whom are ethnic Romani). According to Jean Louis Traversier of the French Forest Service, an estimated 80 percent of 2013 mushroom harvests in the southeastern Drôme and Ardèche regions were both legally and illegally picked by Bulgarian and Romanian nationals who had crossed into the region from Spain.\n\nQuality control concerns have been raised by vendors about the traceability of supplies, with fears that unregulated sourcing may pose a health risk for consumers of the mushrooms. According to facts provided by Traversier, a legal harvest in 2004-2005 involving a Spanish company was followed in later years by unauthorized picking. In the words of journalist Alissa J. Rubin, in 2013\n\nWhile supplying a high-priced culinary delicacy, wages for illegal mushroom harvesters are extremely low. In describing the issue of illegal harvesting, Traversier expressed concern for the well-being of the pickers, stating that he felt many of the Romani harvesters were \"picking to survive\".\n\nAccording to Szilvasi and Zaharieva, a majority of the 17,929 persons in 2015 who were recorded living in unauthorized camps (which are associated with Romani and Traveller residence) throughout France do not have reliable access to clean water. As of 2016, in Paris there were 21 Romani encampments with a documented lack or absence of water and sanitation services.\n\nAccording to an ERRC report, the management of a French Traveller (gens du voyage) halting site in Besançon was documented raising water rates above regular prices, which is illegal under French law. This instance is part of a larger issue with equality in water access at Traveller halting sites, where there have been reports of water access being cut off for persons who miss a payment, a practice which has been illegal under French law since 2015.\n\nAt least 6400 Romani persons in Portugal are estimated to not have access to reliable, formal access to clean drinking water. Due to the non-participation of some municipalities in the UNECE survey that calculated this statistic, the actual number is unknown and believed to be higher.\n\nAccording to research in 2011 by Lydia Gall, a lawyer for the European Roma Rights Centre, Romani in Portugal are subject to an \"appalling\" housing situation without access to roads or drinking water. In many cases, Romani communities are located in geographically segregated locations, such as behind hills and on the outskirts of cities without access to transportation; in some cases, segregation has been further entrenched by the construction of walls to separate Romani settlements from surrounding neighbourhoods. Several cases of environmental injustice have been identified, such as in Bragança, Rio Maior, Beja, and Vidigueira.\n\nIn Bragança, in the far north of the country, Gall has described how \"a community was kicked out of its camp by the authorities, who told them they could live in the garbage dump\".\n\nIn Rio Maior, 85 kilometres north of Lisbon, Gall has described a scenario in which \"14 gypsy [Romani] families were placed in precarious wooden houses, on top of a hazardous coal mine and separated from the rest of the population by a dense forest\".\n\nAccording to Gall, one \"extreme\" case of discrimination can be found in Beja, 180 kilometres south of Lisbon, where Romani are settled in social housing constructed \"with a separation wall, far from the urban centre and near a dog pound, whose sewage containing animal excrement runs through the housing project, with obvious consequences for the health of the inhabitants\".\n\nIn Vidigueira, 160 kilometres south of Lisbon, a Romani settlement had its sole source of potable water shut off by the police.\n\nBy 2013, an estimated 500 persons of predominantly African immigrant and Romani origin were residing in the Terras do Lelo (Terras da Costa) shantytown in Lisbon, with no access to sewerage, clean drinking water, or legal electricity. In 2008, the slum residents had been scheduled for relocation to new homes with better living conditions, however plans were put on hold as a result of the Portuguese financial crisis. In the words of Miguel Bemba da Silva, a resident of Zaïrean origin who worked informally hauling jerrycans of water throughout the community, \"Water is what we miss ... It's better to do this than going around thieving.\"\n\nIn 2013, with funding from the Portuguese NGO the Gulbenkian Foundation, local architects Tiago Saraiva and Ricardo Morais designed a community kitchen with water access that was completed in 2014. As of 2015, the shantytown continued to exist, and also began to receive increasingly formal government recognition with proposals to implement a playground and a library. Water access via the communal kitchen is now funded by the Portuguese government.\n\nRacism within an environmental context has been documented in Spain, with North African and Romani ethnic communities being particularly affected, as well as migrant agricultural workers from throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Southeast Europe.\n\nAs of 2007, there were an estimated 750,000 Romani (primarily Gitano Romani) living in Spain. According to the \"Housing Map of the Roma Community in Spain, 2007\", 12% of Romani live in substandard housing, while 4%, or 30,000 people, live in slums or shantytowns; furthermore, 12% resided in segregated settlements. According to the Roma Inclusion Index 2015, the denial of environmental benefits has been documented in some communities, with 4% of Romani in Spain not having access to running water, and 9% not having access to electricity.\n\nEfforts to relocate shantytowns (\"chabolas\"), which according to a 2009 report by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights were disproportionately inhabited by Romani persons, gained momentum in the late 1980s and 1990s. These initiatives were ostensibly designed to improve Romani living conditions, yet also had the purpose of being employed to vacate plots of real estate for development. In the words of a 2002 report on the situation of Romani in Spain, \"thousands of Roma live in transitional housing, without any indication of when the transition period will end\", a situation which has been attributed to the degradation of many transitional housing projects into ghettoes. In the case of many such relocations, Romani people have been moved to the peripheries of urban centers, often in environmentally problematic areas. In the case of Cañada Real Galiana, diverse ethnic groups including non-Romani Spaniards and Moroccans have been documented as experiencing issues of environmental injustice alongside Romani communities.\n\nThroughout southern Spain, migrant workers from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and South East Europe employed in the agricultural sector have experienced housing and labour conditions that involve racism within an environmental context, producing food for larger European society while facing extreme deprivations.\n\nIn Murcia, lettuce pickers have complained of having to illegally work for salary by volume for employment agencies, instead of by the hour, meaning they are required to work more hours for less pay, while also experiencing unsafe exposure to pesticides. Workers have alleged that they have been forced to work in fields while pesticide spraying is active, a practice which is illegal under Spanish work safety laws.\n\nBeginning in the 2000s in the El Ejido region of Andalusia, African (including large numbers of Moroccan) immigrant greenhouse workers have been documented as being faced with severe social marginalization and racism while simultaneously being exposed to extremely difficult working conditions with significant exposure to toxic pesticides. The El Ejido region has been described by environmentalists as a \"sea of plastic\" due to the expansive swaths of land covered by greenhouses, and has also been labeled \"Europe's dirty little secret\" due to the documented abuses of workers who help produce large quantities of Europe's food supply.In these greenhouses, workers are allegedly required to work under \"slave-like\" conditions in temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius with nonexistent ventilation, while being denied basic rest facilities and earning extremely low wages, among other workplace abuses. As of 2015, out of 120,000 immigrant workers employed in the greenhouses, 80,000 are undocumented and not protected by Spanish labour legislation, according to Spitou Mendy of the Spanish Field Workers Syndicate (SOC). Workers have complained of ill health effects as a result of exposure to pesticides without proper protective equipment.\n\nFollowing the killing of two Spanish farmers and a Spanish woman in two separate incidents involving Moroccan citizens in February 2000, an outbreak of xenophobic violence took place in and around El Ejido, injuring 40 and displacing large numbers of immigrants. According to Angel LluchFor three days on end, from 5 to 7 February, racist violence swept the town with immigrants as its target. For 72 hours hordes of farmers wielding iron bars, joined by youths from the high schools, beat up their victims, chased them through the streets and pursued them out among the greenhouses. Roads were blocked, barricaded and set aflame.\n\nAccording to a 2006 report by the Secretariado General Gitano, a wall reportedly surrounded a predominantly Romani neighbourhood in El Ejido, Andalusia, isolating residents from basic services. In the words of the report,In 1998, the town council erected a wall in a neighbourhood where many Roma families were living. This wall almost completely isolated the Roma as they were deprived of easy access to public transport and other services. Seven years later, this wall, which was to be provisional, still existed.\n\nIn Galicia, a 2007 study determined that segregated Romani settlements faced disproportionately high exposure to environmental burdens, findingAround 10 per cent of these [segregated Romani settlements] are located near rubbish heaps, a percentage that is relatively high given that these heaps are currently being dismantled in Spain. Two out of 3 of these sites are located in places where flooding is a serious risk. Forty one per cent of the sites are also in close proximity to heavy car and train traffic. It is also important to add that in 60 per cent of these sites the number of inhabitants is currently increasing, while the population is decreasing in only 15 per cent of them.\n\nIn the late 1980s, under the \"Plan for the Eradication of Shanty-towns in Malaga\", the transitional housing site of Asperones was constructed for Romani in Malaga. Constructed in close proximity to a former garbage landfill and a cemetery, conditions in the settlement have been described as harmful for its residents, with one 2002 report on the housing situation of Romani in Spain referring to Asperones as \"one of the most conflict-ridden and isolated settlements in Malaga\". As of 2015, 1000 residents continued to live in the \"transitional\" settlement, and 50% have been described as having to rely on scrap metal collection for income.\n\nIn 2002, 16 Romani families in El Cascayu were relocated under a transitional housing scheme to what has been described by the organization SOS Racismo as a discriminatory, isolated, and environmentally marginalized housing location. According to SOS Racismo,\n\n... the last housing units built within [the] eradication of marginalization plan in El Cascayu, where 16 families will be re-housed, is a way of chasing these families out of the city. They will live in a place surrounded by a 'sewer river,' a railroad trail, an industrial park and a highway. So far away from education centres, shops, recreational places and without public transport, it will be physically difficult for them to get out of there.\n\nOn the outskirts of Madrid, 8,600 persons inhabit the informal settlement of Cañada Real Galiana, also known as La Cañada Real Riojana or La Cañada Real de las merinas. It constitutes the largest shantytown in Western Europe. The settlement is located along 16 kilometres of a 75 metre-wide, 400 kilometre-long environmentally protected transhumance trail between Getafe and Coslada, part of a 125,000 kilometre network of transhumance routes throughout Spain. Certain areas of the unplanned and unauthorized settlement are economically affluent, working-class, or middle-class and are viewed as desirable areas for many (particularly Moroccan immigrants who have faced discrimination in the broader Spanish rental market). However, much of the Cañada Real Galiana is subject to severe environmental racism, particularly in the Valdemingómez district of the settlement.\n\nIn the mid-1990s the Madrid government pursued initiatives to eliminate the shantytowns surrounding the city. One such shantytown settlement, Los Focos, was the largest in Spain, and also composed predominantly of ethnic Romani (of Spanish nationality). During this time, the municipal government, under the conservative Popular Party, set out to initiate plans for the relocation of Los Focos to Cañada Real Galiana, where 100 single-storey houses were to be constructed in immediate proximity to the Madrid garbage incinerator, a dump, and an illegal pig farm. In the opinion of Gonick,In such physical proximity, relocated bodies and the city's refuse would face certain, constant coexistence. The blatant disregard for the health and safety of this population betrays the state's racialized vision of their urban futures: like sacks of garbage, these residents represented blight on the city, to be discarded out of sight. Such alliances between bodies and filth are of course ancient tropes in the production of spaces of value and inequality (Douglas 1966; McClintock 1995).\n\nNegative publicity led to a cancellation of the relocation program, although by that point, residents were already starting to be relocated to Valdemingómez. Currently, Valdemingómez is a low-income yet highly multi-ethnic shantytown. Located south of Highway E-901 and east of Highway M 50, Valdemingómez is named after the waste processing, incineration, and dumping facilities which it is adjacent to, and is a site of extreme social marginalization. An estimated 4,500 trucks a day pass through the main road of the settlement daily en route to the dump and recycling facilities, raising concerns over safety, particularly for children. There are no sidewalks, traffic lights, or pedestrian crossings along the road, and several children have been killed by trucks.\n\nIn 2003, a significant number of Spanish Romani were displaced by the demolition of the Las Barranquilas and El Salobral shantytowns, and subsequently relocated to Valdemingómez. According to Rubio, the primary economy of Las Barranquilas and El Salobral was the illegal drug trade; the relocation of Romani residents has resulted in an influx of drug traffic to Valdemingómez. Nearby is the separate settlement of El Gallinero (which is not part of Cañada Real Galiana, despite its proximity) which is composed of migrant Romani from Romania; El Gallinero was settled following a fire which destroyed their previous homes in a distinct district of Valdemingómez. El Gallinero, which has a population of 400 residents (half of whom are children, many of whom do not attend school) lacks adequate street lighting and access to clean water, and significant numbers of its inhabitants are faced with addictions issues.During a 2007 effort by the Madrid government to demolish Cañada Real Galiana, violent clashes between police and residents took place. Mainstream news publications such as ABC, the official Spanish state media company RTVE, and El Mundo published stories which sensationalized the conditions of the settlement, arguably exaggerating the scale of the drug trade and other criminal activities there, while also making unfounded claims implying potential terrorist activity among residents, allegedly portraying the settlement as a site of \"racial difference with dangerous others\".\n\nIn the context of the 15 M movement and an increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible housing market, many people in Spain identified with the struggles of Cañada Real Galiana residents, and activism surrounding the community received significant support from individuals and groups of diverse backgrounds from within Spanish society. Following a series of protests and social activism, a process of court battles took place over the continuing demolitions, centered on Article 47 of the Spanish Constitution which guarantees the right to housing. In 2013, a landmark decision at the European High Court of Human Rights was delivered in favour of Cañada Real Galiana residents, effectively ending the demolitions and protecting the existence of the settlement under Spanish constitutional law.\n\nFollowing the decision, as part of an effort to improve the situation in the settlement, the regional government of Madrid negotiated with municipalities neighbouring Cañada Real Galiana to conduct a formal census of the settlement. Contrary to earlier mainstream media reports that the settlement was overwhelmingly Moroccan, sixty percent of residents were found to be non-Romani Spaniards, with the remainder being a diverse group consisting of other ethnicities; also, the population of the settlement was determined to be 8,600 residents instead of 40,000 as some sources had earlier claimed. While environmental racism and environmental inequality continue to be major issues in the settlement for many residents in certain neighborhoods, the census revealed an arguably complex picture of the social situation in Cañada Real Galiana.\n\nRomani and migrant populations in Italy experience documented practices of racism and segregation within a context of environmental concerns and environmental inequality. Among migrant populations in Italy, environmental inequality has been documented in relation to agricultural labor through exposure to pesticides, low wages, and poor working conditions.\n\nWith regards to the Romani presence in Italy, legal scholar Jennifer Illuzzi uses a term called the \"state of exception\" to argue that liberal Italian legal contexts have historically created scenarios in which \"Romanies are under intense scrutiny, but juridically invisible\". Illuzzi argues that as a result of the \"state of exception\", contemporary Romani communities in Italy become easily subjected to criminalization, denial of citizenship or national status, and social exclusion, notably in places such as government-implemented Nomad Camps.\n\nIn Italy today, many Romani settlements (including Nomad Camps) exist within segregated contexts where both environmental concerns (such as lack of clean water access, toxic waste exposure, and proximity to highways and industrial areas) and issues of criminalization are present. In Campania, Romani residents have been involved in the mass burning of waste and have been housed in extreme proximity to a hazardous waste site that has been likened by one government official to Chernobyl in terms of cleanup requirements and risk to human health.\n\nIn Rome, over 4,000 Romani persons (not to be confused with Romans) live in encampments authorized by the Italian national and Roman municipal governments. As of 2013, 40,000 Romani persons were living in camps throughout Italy. In response to the Italian government's alleged \"Nomad Emergency\" in 2008, in which a federal decree was passed stating that Romani communities were causing a \"situation of grave social alarm, with possible repercussions for the local population in terms of public order and security\", an emergency \"Nomad Plan\" was devised by the municipal government of Rome. The European Commission also granted legal passage for the Italian government to move forward with plans to systematically fingerprint Romani communities.\n\nUnder the \"Nomad Emergency\" decree, special funds were allocated by the government to close informal Romani settlements and encampments in Rome, and to resettle a maximum of 6,000 Romani persons into 13 authorized camps. According to Amnesty International, \"The decree was later declared unfounded and unlawful by the Council of State in November 2011 and by the Supreme Court in April 2013.\" By 2013, living conditions in these camps had deteriorated severely due to overcrowding and a lack of utilities and other basic infrastructure. As of 2010, six of the camps were located far from residential areas, situated outside Rome's Grande Raccordo Anulare, the city's orbital highway. As of 2013, one camp, Castel Romano, was inaccessible by public transportation, and was located along a notably dangerous motorway, the . Another camp, Nuovo Barbuta, was situated between a railroad, Rome's orbital highway, and the runway of Ciampino airport. As of 2013, due to a lack of public transportation, residents of the Nuovo Barbuto camp had to walk long distances along an unpaved shoulder of a busy road in order to leave the camp; furthermore, they were subject to air and noise pollution from the nearby airport.\n\nIn 2015, 378 residents, most of whom were Romani, were documented residing at the Ex Cartiera housing shelter under extremely substandard, cramped, and unhygienic conditions. Prior to its closure in 2016, it was cited by the European Roma Rights Centre for being located in an isolated area of a heavy industrial district known as via Salaria 971, located in immediate proximity to both a municipal solid waste treatment facility and a high-volume highway.\n\nIn Milan, the Social Emergency Shelter (SES) housed predominantly Romani residents in via Lombroso 99 district until 2016, located in an \"old industrial area, alongside a busy railway track\". Families housed in the facility lived in shipping containers, with 16 to 27 persons residing in each container. In 2010 another authorized settlement, Triboniano Camp, was \"squeezed between a railway track, cemetery, and container storage\" in an industrial area of Milan.\n\nIn Italy, an estimated 11.6 million tons of waste are illegally disposed of each year. According to ex-Camorra member Carmine Schiavone, millions of tons of waste from factories in northern Italy have been illegally disposed of in the region north of Naples for decades, allegedly with Mafia and Camorra involvement and the complicity of government authorities and police. In 2004, the area surrounding Acerra was labeled by British medical journal \"The Lancet Oncology\" as a \"triangle of death\" where the incidence of two-headed sheep has been recorded.\n\nAccording to Italian environmental organization Legambiente, in 2012 the total financial value of the illegal garbage industry in Italy was estimated at over 16 billion euros. Over the course of testimony delivered to a secret parliamentary investigative committee in Rome on October 7, 1997 (made public in 2013), Schiavone alleged that nuclear waste from East Germany was also secretly transported to the region, along with other wastes containing dioxin, asbestos, and tetrachloroethylene. Campania has since shifted from being a dumping destination and is now a transit point for the export of hazardous waste to China, and, according to Gen. Sergio Costa, commander of the Naples region for Italy’s environmental police, the Balkans and Eastern Europe.\nAs of 2014, 5,281 contaminated sites and suspected waste dumps have been located by American military investigators. Meanwhile, the region's 500,000 inhabitants have been disproportionately affected by medical ailments; according to Antonio Merfella of the Italian Cancer Research Institute in Naples, the region of Campania has the highest rate of infertility in Italy; in the province of Naples, lung cancer among non-smokers is increasing, while tumors in general have increased 47 percent among males. The region has also become known for disproportionate cases of autism. Concerns over the safety of food production in the fertile agricultural region (much of which is still believed to be uncontaminated) persist.\n\nMany of the most seriously affected people in the region are Romani residents from settlements near Giugliano and the greater Naples area which have been subjected to extreme exposure of pollution and toxic waste. According to \"Los Angeles Times\" journalist Tracy Wilkinson, Romani boys in 2008 were hired throughout the region by the Camorra to set fires to piles of waste, creating significant quantities of toxic smoke over vast swathes of land.\n\nOne of the contaminated Romani camps in Giugliano was unofficial, populated by 500 persons most of whom were migrants from the former Yugoslavia. Built in 1991 and home to 85 families, it was documented in 2010 as a series of camps located \"northwest of Naples, at the outer limits of the urban centre, on the external ring-road following the State Highway 162,\" surrounded by industrial lands. Originally situated on open farmland, the so-called \"spontaneous\"-status unauthorized settlement became surrounded by industries and disposal sites that were later owned by the Government of Campania, which developed a 24-hour surveillance and barricade system surrounding the camp, contracted to the private security firm Falko Security S.R.I.S. According to Raffaella Inglese in \"Mapping the Invisible\", environmental justice concerns for residents in 2010 entailed noise pollution produced by the neighbouring factories, air pollution from the same factories and [an] ex-centre for refuse collection; pollution from the burnt refuse; the danger of the roads being very near their homes and the areas in which their children play; the dirt and run-off from the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste in the immediate vicinity and the necessity to wash themselves outside which is dangerous for children.\n\nAnother environmentally toxic camp, Masseria del Pozzo, was also located in the Giugliano region. This camp, established in March 2013, was an official settlement forcibly created following the eviction of other camps in the Giugliano region, including a previous site that was contaminated by hazardous waste. The Masseria del Pozzo camp was home to approximately 260 persons in March 2016. In 2014, the population of the camp was estimated to be 500 persons, with approximately 200–400 children, according to various residents. According to the European Roma Rights Centre, the community had resided at various camps within the Naples region for the past 25 years and \"almost all of the [former] inhabitants of the camp are residing lawfully in Italy; they generally have permanent resident status in Italy and some are Italian citizens\".\n\nThe settlement was located next to the Masseria del Pozzo toxic waste dump where persistent issues of hazardous biogas leaks from the landfill caused severe health concerns, and was also surrounded by at least three other hazardous landfill sites such as Resit and Novambiente, as well as lands contaminated by illegal toxic sludge disposal. In the words of \"Der Spiegel\" journalist Walter Mayr, \"500 Roma live in shacks and caravans at the foot of what is probably Europe's nastiest landfill, stuffed with, among other things, toxic sludge and dioxin. It is a place where, in the opinion of the responsible government commissioner, a 'sarcophagus like in Chernobyl' would be necessary to protect the public.\"\n\nResidents of the former settlement reported mysterious deaths and disabilities among children and youths, as well as pneumonia and other sicknesses among children. According to former camp resident Giuliano Seferovic, authorities originally informed residents that they would only be placed at the location for a month; this promised timeframe extended to two months, and then nearly a year by the time of the interview. In a video interview with Mario De Biase, Government Commissioner for Reclaims (Land Reclamation), De Biase discusses the issue of toxic gases:\n\nIn the words of former resident Rashid Osmanic, interviewed while living in the camp, With biogas here we all die, no guns, no weapons, nothing! So we die. Two or three years here, and we all die, children get diseases.\nFollowing the announcement of the planned closure of the settlement, Romani rights organizations such as Associazione 21 luglio and the European Roma Rights Centre condemned plans to forcibly relocate the community to a new segregated camp, with Associazione 21 luglio expressing particular concern over the potential creation of a larger segregated \"mega-camp\" where further social marginalization could take place. On June 21, 2016, the entire camp was forcibly evicted without written notice and relocated to a new camp in an industrial area near Giugliano. The new site is located at a former fireworks factory, which was destroyed in a 2015 explosion. According to human rights observers, the secluded site, which is surrounded by wild vegetation on three sides and a wall, is contaminated with what appears to be asbestos and unidentified potentially explosive substances, and is littered with sharp objects that pose a danger to children. Residents were not given any say in selecting a new site, and faced homelessness if they did not move to the new camp, which does not have any housing, sewerage, electricity, or adequate water supply. As of February 2016, the Ministry of Interior and Region Campania have secured funding for a new permanent, segregated replacement site with 44 prefabricated dwellings. No funding has been committed for integration measures such as education, health, employment, or community programs, prompting the European Roma Rights Centre to describe the plan as \"a long term plan for segregation\".\n\nIn both Southern and Northern Italy, large numbers of migrant workers from Africa and Asia produce agricultural goods within a context of severe social and environmental marginalization, lacking access to clean water, utilities, housing, and wage security while facing exposure to harsh working conditions and harmful pesticides. As of 2015, the Italian Association for Legal Studies on Immigration (ASGI) estimated that there were likely close to 500,000 regular and irregular foreign agricultural workers in Italy, of whom 100,000 were believed to be at risk of severe marginalization with regards to living conditions and social mobility.\nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, there is \"a causal link between labour exploitation of migrant workers and the measures adopted by the Italian government with the stated view of controlling and regulating migration flows\". The report focused on the Latina and the Caserta areas where large numbers of workers are of Indian (mostly Punjabi) and African origin respectively, the latter of whom are mostly from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. In Calabria, immigrant fruit pickers for the orange juice industry have been identified as subject to notably exploitative social conditions.\n\nWhile some migrant agricultural workers are paid well and welcomed as economic contributors for helping fill jobs that established Italians are often reluctant to perform, the average wage in Italy for migrant agricultural workers is only 33 dollars a day. In the Latina area alone, 61% of agricultural employers were found by Italian regulatory inspectors to be in contravention of social security and employment laws. In Caserta, migrant agricultural workers partake in the tomato, fruit, dairy, watermelon, and orange industries, often under exploitative or substandard employment conditions. In particular, the fast-growing and lucrative Italian tomato industry, which sources 60 percent of processed tomatoes consumed in the UK and half the entire European Union supply, producing a total export value of 1.5 billion Euros in 2014, has been identified as a significant source of workplace abuse. While 70% of Italy's tomato production is generated from the areas of Puglia and Emilia Romagna, severe abuses of tomato pickers have been documented throughout Italy, including most provinces.\n\nOn January 7, 2010, there was an outbreak of violence in the citrus-producing town of Rosarno, Calabria in the aftermath of a drive-by shooting that targeted two migrants. Following the shooting, hundreds of migrants marched through the town to protest their living conditions, an event that ultimately led to confrontations with riot police and the torching of vehicles. According to Amnesty International, \"The clashes were followed by a \"migrant manhunt\" carried out by some local residents. In a number of separate incidents during the following days, two migrants were reportedly beaten with iron bars, five deliberately run over by a car and a further two injured by shot-gun pellets. In total, 53 persons were hospitalised, including 21 migrants, 14 local residents and 18 police officers.\" Following the incident, a mass detention of migrants remaining in Rosarno ensued. In the words of one worker from Ghana,\n\nIn Rosarno we were working from morning to night, picking oranges, for 25 euros a day; but we had to pay 5 euros for transport, so we had only 20 euros left. There were some abandoned factories where one would build a shelter with some cardboard – one was called the Ghana ghetto. That day [i.e. the day of the clashes, 7/8 January 2010] we decided to go and buy something in town. Some boys were shot by Italians. We decided to do a demonstration about that, because that was not the first time. That's where all the problems started. There were fights between blacks and whites. But we did not want to fight the Italians; we wanted to go to the Comune [the local administration]. No Italian would pick oranges for 25 euros.A major issue for migrant workers in the Rosarno citrus industry are health concerns stemming from exposure to chemicals such as pesticides. According to healthcare worker Dr. Luca Corso of the outreach medical organization Emergency, which assists immigrants who are frequently denied access to Italian hospitals, many workers have shown signs of ailments caused by working in orchards where tree spraying is active. In the words of Dr. Corso,We've started to see, particularly since the beginning of January, some cases that can be linked to working activities; mainly the improper use of pesticides and fungicides used during this season. It's mostly cases of irritative phenomenon, for example contact dermatitis in exposed areas (hands and face) or conjunctivitis...because the eyes are exposed.According to Nino Quaranta, founder of agricultural rights advocacy group SosRosarno, an underlying issue for low wages is the economic challenge confronting many smaller-scale farmers. Most are small independent operators who are often unable to recover costs due to the current price of oranges, which has been affected by international competition and a price crash, thereby compelling them to seek the cheapest labor possible. Contributing to this pressure, market monopolization has been identified by local agriculture advocates as an aggravating factor. According to Pietro Molinaro of the Calabrian Organisation of Producers, \"The problem this area has faced for some years is that the big multinational drinks companies underpay for the juice. They put pressure on the small local processing plants that press the juice.\"\n\nRomani communities in Greece face severe, widespread issues of social and geographic segregation, including denial of access to environmental means of sustenance such as land, electricity, and clean water, as well as exposure to pollution and other ecological issues. Similar issues exist for predominantly Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants, especially those working in the agricultural sector. In some cases, Romani communities have been identified for actions resulting in environmental damage, such as unauthorized waste incineration and negligently starting forest fires. According to Pavlou and Lykovardi,The persistence of extreme socio-spatial segregation of Roma and its underlying causes has resulted in acute social exclusion. The spatial segregation of habitats is a pattern closely connected to their socio-economic exclusion which leads them to seek and find unoccupied and isolated areas in order to set up temporary or long-term encampments with makeshift shacks ... the consequences of their marginalisation become the reasons – and legitimising arguments – for their perennial segregation and exclusion in a persistent vicious circle of stereotyping, state inertia and local hostility.\n\nThe 2004 Athens Olympics has also been cited as an event which has contributed to environmental marginalization of Romani communities. An estimated 2,700 Romani persons in Greece have either been dislocated from or denied access to housing as a result of policies related to preparation for the Games.\n\nIn 2008, inhabitants of a Romani settlement in Athens reportedly burned rubber, tires, and other garbage in significant quantities, causing serious pollution in the settlement and exacerbating hostile relations with neighbouring communities, including allegations of Romani slum dwellers discharging firearms at authorities attempting to extinguish the fires. Informal recycling industries partaken by Romani have been identified as a health concern. In July 2008, unauthorized fires in Romani settlements, started for cleaning scrap metal by burning, were identified by authorities as being the source of major wildfires which caused significant economic damage as well as severe air quality issues for neighbouring Athens.\n\nAs of 2013, there was active waste scavenging by Romani persons at the Fyli landfill in Athens. In May 2013, following a previous action by police to guard the landfill from trespassers, an influx of unspecified numbers of Romani and immigrants led to the site being temporarily closed by Regional Governor Yiannis Sgouros. Sgouros stated that the closure, reportedly largely symbolic in nature, was in response to what had been described by news publication \"Ekathimerini\" as a \"dangerous situation\" at the landfill, requesting the government to halt \"an unchecked influx of people\". In the words of Sgouros, \"The situation at the landfill is out of control. People, garbage trucks, bulldozers and trash are all in the same space with the constant risk of an accident.\" In April 2011, two persons of Pakistani ethnicity were murdered by Romani individuals armed with rifles at the Fyli dump. Three Pakistani individuals were also injured, and Romani dwellings were set on fire in retaliation for the killings. According to police, the incident was part of an ongoing conflict between Pakistani and Romani groups over access to recyclables at the landfill.\n\nOn the Greek island of Kalymnos, Romani persons scavenge waste and set fire to the local landfill to help clear debris, according to Kalymnos deputy mayor Mikes Rigas. In an interview at the landfill site, Rigas acknowledged the issue, statingLook, we have a problem more generally with Roma individuals who come and gather materials from here and set fires, of course in the summer with the heat, fires start by themselves with the amount of material and plastic that there is. I don't want to say it is only them causing the problem, but they are part of it.Smoke from the landfill, which has been likened to a \"volcano\", is a cause for health and quality of life concerns among locals, yet the fires have also been identified as a means by which excessive buildup of garbage has been averted. Both non-Romani and Romani workers on Kalymnos, especially younger persons, increasingly rely on waste scavenging and recycling as a means to survive. According to legally employed scrap recycler Giannis Velis, who is ethnic Romani, people from the local community, both Romani and non-Romani, set fire to the garbage in order to ensure the waste does not build up.\n\nIn 2000, a Romani settlement near Spata was temporarily relocated by local government authorities to a location situated on an isolated hilltop five kilometres from the town. The site is only accessible by a rough track. Shortages of water, no garbage collection services, poor water quality, inadequate sewerage, and outbreaks of hepatitis A have been reported at the settlement. As of 2009, the settlement had not been relocated. There have been unverified reports that the location is potentially contaminated with toxic waste, as it may have been the site of toxic waste dumping prior to settlement.\n\nAs of 2009, 1,700 people inhabited a Romani shantytown settlement in the Alan Koyou area of central Komotini. The community, which was surrounded by piles of garbage, was only serviced with two water taps, and experienced a hepatitis A outbreak in 2007 which resulted in the hospitalization of 60 children. Efforts to relocate the community to a site with healthier conditions in Kikidi have encountered opposition from residents there.\n\nAspropyrgos, a municipality near Athens, is one of the largest industrial areas in Greece, containing hundreds of factories, warehouses, and other industrial facilities including an oil refinery which caught fire in 2015, severely injuring six workers. One environmentally problematic site was the Aspropyrgos Romani settlement, which was located on a garbage dump in an industrial sector of the community. Between July 2000 and February 2001, homes of Greek and Albanian Romani were demolished to ostensibly make way for potential Olympic developments, even though the area had been turned down for development by the International Olympic Committee in 1999. The destruction of the community was referred to by municipal authorities as a \"cleaning operation\".\n\nOn July 7, 2015, a major fire occurred at a private scrap metal warehouse nearby. Shortly after the blaze came under control by firefighters, groups of Romani persons entered the still-burning structure to scavenge for scrap metal. According to news reports, those entering the fire scene to collect scrap were \"jeopardizing their lives\" and in danger of sustaining burns and respiratory problems. Police had to be called to the scene to prevent Romani scrap collectors from entering the fire zone until firefighters could fully extinguish the blaze.\n\nIn the municipality of Nea Alikarnassos, efforts to relocate a Romani settlement to make way for Olympic developments were halted by the Magistrate's Court of Heraklion, which ruled twice, in 2000 and 2001 respectively, that the relocation plans were \"abusive\", and that relocations could only take place under the condition that the new settlement location be provided with adequate housing and infrastructure to ensure a decent standard of living for its inhabitants. As of 2009, the settlement continued to occupy the area it had been situated for twenty years, between an industrial area and a major roadway. As of 2009, the settlement did not have electricity, sewerage, garbage collection, or clean water infrastructure.\n\nIn one instance, tree-planting has been documented as a proposed means to conceal the presence of Romani settlements during the lead-up to the Olympics. In Lechaina, Western Peloponnese, plans to relocate 35 Romani families next to the highway between Patras and Pyrgos (which is also the primary highway to Ancient Olympia) were abruptly placed on hold as a result of direct intervention from the Director of the Town Planning and Environment Directorate of the Western Greece Region. In the words of Alexandridis,The Director informed Mr. [Dmitris] Hadjigiannis [the mayor of Lechaina] that because the suggested plot of land was within visual range of the national highway, the settlement's establishment should not go ahead as foreign visitors on their way to Olympia should not see the Gypsies living there. Mr. Hadjigiannis, thinking that this was a joke, called the Ministry of Interior, where the official with whom he spoke not only agreed with the rational [\"sic\"] of the Director of the Town Planning Directorate but also suggested that an alternative could be the appropriate landscaping of the settlement so that a small hill be created between the settlement and the national highway, upon which trees could be planted so that no visual contact between the settlement and drivers on the national highway could be established.\n\nAs of 2009, the resettlement had not taken place.\n\nEthnic Pakistani and Bangladeshi agricultural workers in Greece have been subjected to well-documented cases of marginalization and violence within an environmental context, producing food and economic revenue for the Greek economy while themselves facing precarious living conditions and workplace environmental hazards, such as extremely harsh temperatures inside greenhouses. On the Peloponnese, thousands of undocumented ethnic Bangladeshi workers work harvesting potatoes and strawberries for extremely low-subsistence wages, often finding themselves working \"under conditions akin to modern-day slavery\", according to a report by Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn 2013, 28 workers on a strawberry farm in Nea Manolada (Manolada) were shot and wounded for demanding six months of unpaid wages. Approximately 200 workers were owed nearly 150,000 Euros, according to seasonal worker Liton Khan. In the words of Khan at the time, \"We want our money, and we want justice. In the summer we slave away in greenhouses at temperatures up to sixty degrees Celsius.\"\n\nIn court, the owner of the farm, Nikos Vaggelatos, and the head foreman were acquitted, while two other men were convicted of aggravated assault. The two convicted were initially sentenced to fourteen years seven months, and eight years seven months, respectively, however they were later released on appeal. The ruling sparked widespread outrage among anti-racist and immigrant-rights supporters and activists; in the words of far-left Syriza Party MP Vassiliki Katrivanou, \"[the ruling] sends the message that a foreign worker can die like a dog in the orchard\".\n\nIn Nea Manolada, hundreds of South Asian workers have settled into informal agricultural settlements under severely substandard living conditions. Due to the Greek economic crisis, the migrants have arguably become increasingly important to the economy, performing vital agricultural jobs that are generally not performed by Greek citizens, many of whom face unemployment. Bangladeshi workers near Nea Manolada live in camps made of plastic and other scavenged materials, lacking water, sanitation, and adequate cooking facilities. In the words of a migrant worker and camp-dweller named Doulak, \"We can't go back to Bangladesh, we don't have enough food or work there. Here at least we have enough to survive.\"\n\nEjaz Ahmed, a translator working with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), has stated that migrant agricultural workers in Nea Manolada are reportedly faced with many restrictions to freedom of movement, such as not being allowed to sit in the town square, being barred from cafes, not being permitted to go swimming at nearby beaches, and denied the option of renting houses. Ejaz further added that workers are reportedly forced to live inside \"chicken coups, warehouses, and derelict buildings\".\n\nOn July 1, 2014, the Pakistani Community of Greece, the Immigrant Workers League and the United Movement Against Racism and the Fascist Threat (KEERFA) held a press conference regarding alleged working conditions. Migrant agricultural workers publicly shared their experiences with workplace or work-related violence and the non-payment of wages.\n\nIn 2014, Nabil-Iosaf Morad, a medical doctor born in Syria, became the first immigrant to be elected mayor in Greece, for the district seat of Lechaina, municipality of Andravida-Kallyni. According to journalist Kostantinos Menzel, Morad's election was politically significant because the municipality of Andravida-Kallyni encompasses Nea Manolada, where the 2013 shooting of migrant workers took place. Morad has stated of undocumented immigrants in the district:I will take care of these people. One of my first official acts will be to set up a counselling center in the town hall for migrants. I expect support from the Bangladeshi embassy. They can bring their complaints and problems to this office. We also want to offer language courses. Their living conditions have to improve.As of 2016, Morad has been the current mayor of the municipality of Andravida-Kallyni.\n\nMigrant agricultural workers of predominantly Pakistani origin held a nearly week-long strike beginning July 3, 2014, in Skala, Peloponnese. The 800 workers participating in the strike were protesting \"many delays in payment, inhumane living conditions and racist treatment by the Greek Police\" according to Kalmouki. Local media reported that the immigrants marched from Skala's city hall to the police station, where they met with police officials and indicated an intention to press charges in relation to allegations of police abuses. This was the second protest by Pakistani agricultural workers in the area, who also held a strike in September 2010.\n\nIn spite of local efforts to improve conditions for agricultural migrant workers and refugees, issues persist due to their undocumented status and lack of formal immigration paperwork, which can only be assigned by the Greek government. According to Doulak, migrants are subjected to regular police harassment due to a lack of documents granting legal status in Greece. According to Doulak, \"The main problem is that we have no papers. We get picked up by the police all the time. And the farmers think that they don't have to pay us, because we're here illegally, we have to live with no electricity or running water.\"\n\nAccording to the report \"Inconvenient Human Rights: Access to Water and Sanitation in Sweden's Informal Settlements\", the Swedish state has, through international law, arguably aligned itself toward a legal responsibility of ensuring clean water access for all persons on Swedish territory. In the words of the report, \"European and international human rights norms have legal significance in Swedish domestic law. Sweden has signed and ratified both the ICESCR [International Covenant on Social and Cultural Rights], the basis for the rights to water and sanitation, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which articulates the rights to life and human dignity.\"While Sweden has a dualist legal system that does not automatically apply international law with domestic policy, \"Sweden has embraced the task of integrating its human rights treaty obligations into Swedish law, principally through amending domestic law – a process called 'transformation.'\" As a result, Swedish authorities are arguably increasingly legally responsible for upholding international human rights standards domestically, including the right to water. In the opinion of Davis and Ryan, lead authors of the report, \"International bodies and human rights experts have repeatedly clarified that these rights extend to informal residents as well as formal settlements.\"\nSweden faces persistent issues regarding non-provision of environmental means of sustenance to persons who have recently arrived from Eastern Europe. These inhabitants, who are predominantly Romani, are EU citizens who have come to Sweden legally. Their experiences with denial of water access can arguably be viewed as part of a larger historical precedent of water, sanitation, and energy resource exclusion policy towards Romani persons in Sweden.\n\nIn the opinion of Davis and Ryan, \"Water and sanitation access for vulnerable EU citizens in Sweden cannot be accurately understood without the backdrop of historic discrimination against Roma populations.\" As detailed by a 2014 Swedish Government report titled \"The Dark Unknown History\" examining Swedish state abuses toward the Romani minority, exclusion encompassed \"invasive and degrading registration processes, forced sterilization, separation of families, limited and difficult access to housing, education and work, and bans on entering the country\". According to Davis and Ryan,\n\nKey players in this discrimination have been the Swedish government, the Church of Sweden, the National Board of Health and Welfare and the police. Over many decades, a major political justification for the control of Roma life was the need to rehabilitate the Roma. The White Paper reports that Roma were characterized as needing to be 'rescued from their inferior way of life and be brought within the framework of social care.' Another major justification for discriminatory practices was the widespread belief that Roma's situation is 'self-inflicted' or 'self-chosen.' Roma's 'nomadic way of life' provided an additional rationale for the refusal to include Roma in the national census, while their 'poor circumstances, meagre housing conditions' and children being taken into care, justified sterilization ... The White Paper concludes that Roma in Sweden in the 20th century and still currently, remain 'subjected to anti-Gypsyism.'\n\nIn Stockholm, Romani settlement was discouraged by authorities during the 1940s when increased numbers of Romani persons began to arrive, by denying access to water and electricity. In the 1950s, a pilot social program was initiated in Stockholm to provide Romani families with housing; however, the poor quality of the housing, exacerbated by a lack of hot water and central heating for 22 out of the sixty families involved, resulted in the program being \"deemed a failure\". In Gothenburg, similar issues have been documented, with interview testimony from Romani resident Sonya Taikon detailing how homeless Romani people in the 1960s had to live without electricity or sanitation, deriving their water \"from a stream in the middle of Gothenburg\".Davis and Ryan argue that these issues are policy-oriented in nature, stating:\n\nwater and sanitation access are central components of discrimination against Roma over the decades. As travelers in the early decades of the twentieth century seeking work, Roma communities necessarily looked for camping places where water and sanitation would be available. And when Swedish municipalities sought to deter Roma groups from settling, controlling their access to water and sanitation is often a means to that end.\n\nContrary to stereotypes that portray Romani marginalization as \"self-chosen\", historical documentation exists of Swedish Romani individuals describing their close affinity with water resources, and of their efforts to gain access to water resources. As described through an oral account from an ethnographic study, one Romani woman\n\nrecalled that in the 1920's, when the family was able to stay long enough in one place, her mechanically-minded father had the know-how to build devices for daily hygiene and washing of clothes. At one point, her father built a square wash basin and toilet. He covered the floor with fir twigs, then cartons and finally rugs so the family would not get cold feet. 'It was so exciting, you never forget,' the woman remembered.\n\nIn the same study, Romani persons interviewed \"described the efforts they made to ensure that they did not disturb Swedish residents so that they could continue to access water. One interviewee recalled that her mother bound the dogs' muzzles to keep them from barking and jeopardizing their permission to obtain water from a local farm.\"\n\nBetween January 2013 and January 2016, \"83 evictions of groups of vulnerable EU citizens holding a right of residence in Romania or Bulgaria\" took place. Of the applications for these evictions, \"an overwhelming number cite the prevalence of, or risk for, sanitation hazards and littering as grounds for eviction\" and are understood within a context of environmental impact concern in which the lack of access to water is cited as a central issue. Locations of evictions where water and sanitation access has been cited as reason for eviction have been tracked through an interactive mapping database developed in collaboration between Södertörn and Northeastern Universities respectively. Most of these cases have occurred in the greater Stockholm and Gothenburg regions respectively, along with cases in Uddevalla, Malmö, Skara, Karlstad, and Uppsala.\n\nOne notable example of water exclusion can be found in northern regions of Sweden, where Romani EU citizens from Eastern Europe come to work as farm laborers in the berry harvesting industry. In one case, living out of informal camps, these workers have described having to travel distances up to 60 kilometres (round trip) to acquire water; using water from gas stations; and constructing makeshift latrines. Conflicts with local residents surrounding water use were alleviated as a result of the local municipality installing water cisterns for the farm workers.\n\nIn many cases, the risk or threat of significant environmental impact is invoked as a reason for eviction, even when very small numbers of individuals are involved and the actual environmental impact may arguably be minimal. In the words of Davis and Ryan:\n\nsanitation hazards are viewed as equally severe regardless of the number of identified respondents to whom the eviction decision is directed, whether it be two or several dozen ... Twenty five of the eviction decisions were directed at six respondents or fewer and had existed anywhere from ten days up to three months. Despite these settlements being significantly smaller than many of the others and not having existed very long, \"extensive inconveniences\" in terms of sanitation costs were still cited in each decision. This was the case in a 2013 decision in Stockholm, where the municipality held that \"the area around the settlement is subjected to great environmental impacts ... The decision only concerned two respondents\".Alongside a similar case from Gothenburg in 2014, Davis and Ryan further highlight a case in Stockholm from 2015 where two persons were legally deemed by the Stockholm Land and Premises Maintenance Office to carry the same burden of environmental impact as the settlement they took up residence, which already had 49 inhabitants. Cases have also been recorded where assumptions of environmental damage and pollution were made, even though evidence to suggest otherwise was documented.\n\nPrivate businesses and individuals, who often provide water and sanitation services out of goodwill, often bear a disproportionate burden of pressures caused by these issues. In the opinion of Davis and Ryan, denial of water access to certain individuals can arguably impact the rights of all members of a community:\n\nwithout access to on-site or nearby sanitation, and without local government support in accessing these necessities the informal camps where vulnerable EU citizens often reside can soon raise legitimate public health and environmental concerns, impinging on the rights of all in the community, creating a crisis for the municipality and incurring even greater city expenses in evictions and site clean-ups.\n\nDespite Sweden’s multiple legal commitments to international and domestic human rights, issues of environmental inequality, in the form of water, sanitation, and electricity access, arguably persist as a continuation of historical patterns of inequality affecting its Romani minority. These issues exist in modern-day parallel with Swedish practices of racism and environmental marginalization toward the Sami Indigenous people and their territories.\n\nThere are between 500,000 and 2.5 million Romani people in Turkey. Most Romani, both itinerant and sedentary, live in Trakya (Thrace) and Marmara regions in the northwest of the country, and generally inhabit settlements that are socio-geographically distinct and isolated from majority populations. Romani in Turkey \"suffer much higher levels of ill-health, have poorer housing, and higher incidences of discrimination on the basis of their ethnicity.\" In at least two cases (the 2010 demolition of Sulukule and the 1970 Bayramiç forest products industry dispute), conflicts surrounding access to land and natural resources has led to the dislocation of entire Romani communities.\n\nIn February 2010, the predominantly Romani community of Sulukule in Istanbul, an ancient neighbourhood included on the UNESCO World Heritage list and Istanbul City Wall Preservation Zone, as well as the oldest Romani settlement in Europe was demolished as part of an urban renewal scheme. Earlier demolitions had taken place in the mid-1960s and in 1982 when the old core of Sulukule was torn down. As a central area of Istanbul, Sulukule was subject to land speculation, while underlying ecological and environmental issues were potentially exploited as part of the arguments for demolition. According to Aslı Kıyak İngin and Pelin TanThroughout the year 2000, Istanbul witnessed the emergence of large-scale urban transformation projects under the headings of \"urban renovation/urban development\" which legitimised 'demolishment' and 'reconstruction' via abstract discourses of urban fear, ecology, cultural heritage and natural disasters. In 2005, the Urban Transformation and Renewal policy of 5366 accelerated the urban renovation/developments and it gave power to the municipalities to declare any district as an urban transformation area and to control what property rights, urban planning and architectural projects could be applied.According to architecture scholar Neyran Turan, notions of \"urban renewal\" as a critical component of ecological sustainability have gained prominence within urban planning discourse in Istanbul. In the words of Turan, \"the 'ecological turn' of Istanbul is currently limited to specific managerial perspectives on urban governance—such as 'resource management,' 'environmental risk,' or 'urban renewal and transformation.'\" A major argument for the demolition and \"urban renewal\" of Sulukule was to replace existing housing stock with purportedly more earthquake-resistant construction; however, the impetus behind the demolition was allegedly influenced by stigma towards its predominantly Romani inhabitants. Some critics have claimed that Renewal Policy 5366 is often selectively applied toward neighbourhoods with large minority or Romani populations. In a June 17, 2008 interview, Mustafa Ciftci, Sulukule Renewal Project Coordinator, stated\n\nIt is not easy to integrate these [Romani] people to society, but we have to accomplish it, in the end these are our people; we have to save them. If it was up to me, as a state policy, I would take all the kids under the age of ten from their parents, put them in boarding schools, educate them and make them members of society. This is the only way.Evicted tenants were offered houses 48 kilometres away in Taşoluk, where high mortgage rates were unworkable for most residents, most of whom were low-income. According to Kıyak and Tan, \"The renewal process as a whole has caused the disintegration of the community by dispersing the existing social fabric, their inability to continue their cultural activities, their severance from social networks of solidarity, and even graver livelihood problems.\" Without access to nearby medical care, education, or transportation to the city centre, the relocated residents left Taşoluk. Many returned to the former Sulukule district, currently renamed \"Karagümrük\", where they subsequently constructed shanties \"on the ruins of their former homes\", according to Demirovski and Marsh.\n\nAccording to Rahmi Ozel, the former attorney of Bayramiç, a series of violent attacks against the Romani community there took place between January 18 and February 22, 1970. Part of a larger conflict surrounding access to forest resources, the attacks were triggered by a dispute over ownership of a logging truck. While no one was killed in the attacks, the events caused significant terror among both Romani and non-Romani members of the community, and led to the expulsion of the Bayramiç Romani. Social and behavioral sciences scholar Gül Ӧzateşler has argued that the attacks, whose timing closely correlated to important dates in the logging industry season reflected insecurities about ethnic Turkish loss of power to Romani persons, who were gaining socioeconomic influence due to their role in the transportation sector of the forestry industry.\n\nIn the 1960s, forestry became an increasingly profitable industry in Turkey, as lumber consumption rapidly increased. Due to increased investment in forestry management and production, Turkey became recognized for its timber industry, to the extent that its supplies were viewed as competitive within a globalized international context. In 1963–1964, new mountain roads near Bayramiç were created to enable timber extraction, coupled with improvements in highway networks. On August 26, 1967, The Regional Administration of Forestry in Bayramiç city and the surrounding Bayramiç district was founded. At the time, 53.8% of provincial territory was covered by timber stands. As a result of these developments, employment in the forestry transportation sector increased from 30 individuals to 200 in Bayramiç during this time.\n\nIn Bayramiç, conflicts over the processing, handling, and transport of timber were commonplace among locals. According to Ӧzateşler, \"The competition was especially acute, as at that time forestry offered the best jobs for many villagers and townspeople. It is no coincidence that the attacks on the Gypsies started in January and stopped at the end of February, before the annual start date of the forestry business in the town, in the month of March.\"\n\nFew cars existed in the Bayramiç region during the 1950s and 1960s; for example, there were only five jeeps in the town during the late 1950s, and animals were used as primary means for transportation. During the late 1950s, timber was the primary economic product exported from the town, and by 1960, there were eight logging trucks stationed in the city. Romani people became involved in logging truck driving beginning in the late 1950s. According to Ӧzateşler, Romani people \"became powerful in a prestigious position\" by becoming logging truck drivers. According to one truck driver from the era, the driving profession was viewed as having higher prestige than a state official. Ӧzateşler states \"it was not easy to find a good driver; experienced drivers therefore had a very strong bargaining position, including a high social status. They were said to be more prestigious even than their own bosses. They were treated as kings in the coffeehouses. When they came in, people would stand up and greet them.\" However, the reason for the success of Romani truck drivers was their willingness to work an extremely dangerous job. In the words of Ӧzateşler, \"They were just doing the dirty job at that time; as it was very tiring and dangerous due to lack of proper roads to the mountain ... one was supposed to be a little mad to be a driver as the risks were considerable.\"\n\nIn 1970, a Leyland truck was purchased by a Romani family in partnership with an ethnic Turkish driver (who later helped start the attacks), and became subject of great interest. As a symbol of wealth, it also became a source of resentment toward the socio-economic success of the Romani community. According to Ӧzateşler, \"All of the Gypsies mentioned the lorry as the object that triggered the attacks.\" One of the individuals responsible for orchestrating the attacks, Huseyin Kiltas, stated \"What it came down to was the Leyland [logging truck].\"\n\nFollowing allegations against Romani truck drivers of sexual harassment toward non-Romani Turkish high school girls, a series of violent attacks took place against the Romani community of Bayramiç. The first attack targeted the muhacir sub-group of Romani, who were engaged in the logging truck driving industry. 38 houses were damaged. This attack then grew into a second assault against all Romani persons in the area, involving 3,000 individuals who stoned Romani houses and beat Romani residents. The crowd marched on the municipal building, which was located on the main avenue leading to the \"neighbourhoods where the Gypsies lived\". When the city's attorney attempted to stop the crowd, he was nearly beaten to death by a gang of 30–40 individuals. The Romani were subsequently forced to leave the city. Many Romani went into hiding, while individuals who employed Romani experienced threats. Some employers chose to risk their own safety and social status by protecting Romani people from the violence. Verbal threats of sexual assault were directed towards Romani women. According to ӦzateşlerIn cases of conflicts and war, the female body is often treated as an arena for masculine honor and prestige along with nationalistic territorial claims ... Gypsies making passes at Turkish girls was seen as a violation of the national border and the territory of Turkish men ... female agency was entirely lacking in this scenario. The actual attackers were men and the supposedly abused women remained anonymous; nobody knew anything about them not even whether they really existed or not.From the perspective of Rana Kocayar, the oldest daughter of the Romani family that had purchased the logging truck, and Bidon Hilmi, a Romani truck driver at the time who was beaten during the violence, the allegations of sexual harassment were a means to cover the primary motives of the attacks, which were an attempt to prevent Romani people from participating in the forestry sector. The violence ended on February 22, 1970 when word spread that one of the key perpetrators, a logging truck driver named Halit Er, was in critical medical condition. His injuries had been caused during an altercation with Romani in Çanakkale, who attacked him due to his role provoking the Bayramiç attacks. Some Romani returned to Bayramiç in the following months and years, while others did not. To date, no one has been prosecuted for inciting or taking part in the violence.\n\nThroughout Russia, mostly in Siberia but also west of the Urals in European Russia, there has been significant industrial development and pollution on Indigenous lands. In many cases, these industrial developments arguably result in disproportionate harm for the Indigenous inhabitants, who in many cases do not benefit proportionally from industrial resource extraction and transportation projects. According to environment and geography scholar Craig ZumBrunnen, two of the most heavily polluted regions in Russia are northeastern European Russia and the Kola Peninsula, which lies in European Russia.The dispossession of Indigenous peoples from their lands throughout Russia for natural resource extraction has a long historical context of racism. According to Indigenous studies scholar Aileen Espiritu, \"As non-European peoples, the Khanty, Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets were seen as inferior races by the Russians, and were therefore exploited for their goods and resources. Forcible Tsarist jurisdiction over Khanty, Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets territory began in the sixteenth century.\" Espiritu expands on the social implications of historical dispossession, writing\nThroughout the eighteenth century, the exaction of exceedingly high \"yasak\" [tribute in furs] payments forced the Yamalo-Nenets and the Khanty to abandon their traditional economy of hunting and fishing in order to trap sables, and later foxes, for Russian officials and traders. The Khanty, Mansi, and Yamalo-Nenets were, therefore, forced to leave their own territories in an attempt to live as they had lived for hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of years (Prokof'yeva, et al. 1956:515) ... These effects on the Khanty, Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets, while serious, were minimal when compared to the imposition of Soviet rule and hegemony.Bolshevik policies from 1917 onwards quickly focused on the transition of Indigenous economies from traditional livelihoods into socialist economies based upon, in the words of anthropologist Debra Schindler, \"the creation of a 'modern,'... urban-industrial settlement system; collectivization of the indigenous production economy; development of natural resources and the industrial development of other branches of the economy; and the introduction of the indigenous population to and their incorporation in 'modern' (Russian) society (1991:70).\" According to Espiritu, the result of these state policies \"based on rigid and dogmatic Leninist ideology\" has led to severe damage for the cultural traditions, identities, and indigenous lifestyles of aboriginal Russian peoples. In the opinion of geography scholar Gail A. Fondahl, Upon assuming power, the Soviet state identified the peoples of the North as exceedingly primitive, and in need of a special policy body to facilitate the transition to socialism (Sergeev 1995; Slezkine 1994). At the same time the Bolsheviks fingered the North as a storehouse of wealth to be exploited for the development of the new socialist state. In the first decade of Soviet power, planners deliberated on balancing aboriginal needs and state aspirations in debates regarding northern development policy, but by the mid-1930s the latter took clear precedence over the former. When development concerns dictated, the state confiscated aboriginal lands and relocated Natives.The drive for increased resource extraction intensified under Joseph Stalin's regime, resulting in particularly deleterious patterns of dispossession for Indigenous peoples in the European North, Siberia, and the Far East. In the opinion of ZumBrunnen, Since the inception of Stalin's forced industrialization campaigns in the 1930s, these extensive, remote, resource-rich regions have been targeted for industrial development, mineral and energy resource extraction and processing which have had particularly disruptive and contaminating effects ... not only did Soviet development plans favor industrialization over traditional forms of economic activities, but all too often these industrial developments have been in conflict with traditional indigenous economic activities, such as reindeer herding, fishing, fur harvesting, and self-sufficient forms of agriculture, domestic animal husbandry, and logging, all of which require healthy ecosystems.\" Many of these issues of environmental degradation and indigenous dispossession have arguably continued from Soviet times into the present day. As described by one observer in 1991, \"In the majority of regions inhabited by [the numerically Small Peoples of the North] the ecological situation has sharply intensified, the systematic destruction of established norms and rules of natural resource use has been allowed (O dopolnitel'nykh 1991).\"\nFor Indigenous peoples in Russia, environmental degradation can often affect deeper cultural and metaphysical sentiments beyond ecological and economic concerns, extending to all aspects of indigenous lifestyles and epistemologies. As argued by Fondahl, \"Northern peoples differed from other citizens of the Russian Federation due to their involvement in activities that required an intimate connection with, and an extensive use of, expansive homelands. If symbolic of primitivism in the eyes of many Soviet citizens, the traditional activities also symbolized a special, harmonic and intense interaction with the natural environments.\n\nFor example, when Soviet planners attempted to \"rationalize\", collectivize, and commercialize traditional Indigenous livelihoods such as reindeer husbandry, their efforts were frustrated by the realization that indigenous peoples worldviews treated such economies as intrinsically tied to non-economically quantifiable values of social and spiritual significance, which ran contrary to Soviet modernization rationale. Reindeer \"conveyed a family's protective spirits, provided not only physical but spiritual nourishment at life-event celebrations, and accompanied the owner on her or his voyage from this world to the next\". These metaphysical Indigenous values were rooted in the working indigenous vocabulary of reindeer husbandry to such an extent that Soviet workers assigned to the field with Indigenous groups frequently had little choice but to learn the Indigenous languages as no corollary terms for these expressions existed in Russian, yet were vital to learning the trade.\n\nThe effect of industry on the well-being of reindeer herding has been a profound concern to many Indigenous people in Russia. Speaking at the Second International Working Seminar on the Problems of Northern Peoples (Prince George, BC, Canada, 1996), V.A. Robbek, Director, Institute of the Problems of Northern Minorities, Yakutsk, Sakha Republic (Yakutia), stated, \"Destroy our reindeer breeding and our traditional lands and you destroy us, the Even, as a people.\"\n\nSimilar views were expressed by another Russian Indigenous commentator in 1996, who statedOur Native lands are being annexed and barbarically destroyed by rapacious petroleum and natural gas, coal, gold, and non-ferrous mining interests without any form of just compensation...and this phenomena is depriving us of our lands and rights to part of the resource wealth, [and] deprives us of our basic right—a right to life (Social...1996).\n\nIn 2014, 70% of Russia's crude oil exports, and 90% of its natural gas exports, went to Europe. According to Henderson and Mitrova of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, European gas output is expected to slip from around 250bcm in 2014 to 225bcm in 2020 and 150bcm in 2030, leaving an import gap of over 310bcm by the end of this decade and over 420bcm by 2030. Much of this gap in demand could potentially be supplied by Russia. In the words of Henderson and Mitrova, \"Gazprom's exports to Non-FSU (Former Soviet Union) countries rose from an initial level of 3.5bcm in 1970 to a peak of 162bcm in 2005, with sales extending across 28 countries in the region\". Record quantities of oil were produced in Russia in 2015, with 534 million tons extracted, an increase of 1.5% over 2014 production levels. In 2015, a record 23 million tons of Russian petroleum products (including liquefied natural gas) were shipped through Arctic waters from Russian ports such as Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, and Varandey, as well as Norwegian ports such as Hammerfest, according to statistics provided by Vardø Bessel Traffic Service Centre in Norway.\n\nMuch of this energy supply was extracted from the traditional territories of Indigenous peoples, raising questions surrounding Indigenous rights, title, and environmental marginalization.\n\nIn 2015, 14.6 million tons of oil were produced from Nenets Autonomous Okrug, a 6.4% increase over 2014 production. There are 14 new oil and gas fields planned for development in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, which lies within northeastern European Russia.\n\nAs of 2003, there were an estimated 6500 Nenets and 5000 Komi individuals residing in Nenets Autonomous Okrug, a majority of whom were engaged in reindeer husbandry. Large-scale degradation of reindeer grazing lands took place between the 1960s and 1980s; after a slowdown in development, the situation began to worsen by the early 2000s. In the words of Peskov and Dallmann, \"In addition to the high unemployment among indigenous peoples, the situation in the reindeer husbandry sector is deteriorating: decreasing numbers of reindeer, misappropriation, absence of appropriate marketing schemes for products. These and other factors provoke a general degradation of indigenous society.\" Peskov and Dallmann identify responsibility on the part of both oil companies as well as the Nenets Autonomous Okrug government, which they claim has not lived up to its legal obligations to protect Indigenous rights. Peskov and Dallmann provide an overall opinion that \"Nenets and Komi in this region have for many centuries maintained a traditional way of life rooted firmly in reindeer husbandry in the area. These are the people who mainly suffer as a result of the attitudes of newcomers to the Arctic natural environment, in spite of all legal guarantees.\"\n\nIn 1870 Nenets people were permanently settled on Novaya Zemlya by the Russian Empire to prevent Norwegian expansion. The traditional Nenets name for the archipelago, which lies within European continental borders, is Edey Ya. According to the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, during the Cold War approximately 500 Indigenous persons were relocated from Novaya Zemlya to make way for nuclear testing. The reindeer living on the island either died or were relocated to the mainland. Between 1954 and 1990, 132 nuclear test explosions, ninety four percent of the aggregate yield of nuclear testing in the former Soviet Union, were conducted on the islands. On October 30, 1961, the Tsar Bomba hydrogen bomb was tested, representing the largest man-made explosion in history.\n\nIn spite of inexplicably high levels of cancer among Arctic Indigenous peoples in Russia during the 1960s and 1970s, comprehensive analysis of cancer statistics in 2004 indicate that overall, Indigenous peoples on the Kola Peninsula and in Nenets Autonomous Okrug (where there is significant radiation contamination) today experience below-average levels of cancer compared to the rest of Russia. However, reports by the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences indicate high rates of chromosomal diseases and birth defects among Indigenous people around Novaya Zemlya which may be linked to nuclear testing. Locals have nicknamed the islands \"the archipelago of death\".\n\nIn 2015, 14.9 million tons of oil were produced from Komi Republic, an increase of 5.4% over 2014 production. The Komi Republic, which lies in northeastern European Russia and is home to the Indigenous Komi people, has 152 hydrocarbon fields, of which 87 produce oil and gas; 65 are currently in commercial production, and 22 are designated as experimental. In 1994, a pipeline fractured near the city of Usinsk, Komi Republic. According to Komineft (Komi Oil) and local government officials, 14,000 metric tons of oil leaked; however, this figure is disputed. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the leak in fact saw 270,000 metric tons spilled. In the words of a press release from the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, \"it was the site of the world's worst ever terrestrial oil spill.\"\n\nThe Pechora, Kolva, and Usa rivers have all experienced significant contamination from oil leaks. 1,900 leaks were documented along Komineft-owned pipelines between 1986 and 1991. Throughout the region, there are also concerns surrounding the accountability of environmental monitoring and cleanup programs.\n\nFor example, in the settlement of Kolva in Komi Indigenous territory, Komi Indigenous people were left to clean up the site of a major oil spill themselves, with minimal assistance from government authorities or oil company workers; the Head of Usinsk District, Alexander Tian, responded to Komi requests for help by allegedly stating \"If you do not want to breathe in oil fumes, you should take a boat out and remove the oil yourself!\" and offered to pay 10,000 rubles (approximately 250 Euros) per barrel recovered—a reimbursement that Kolva residents claim was not honoured. Out of 117 persons cleaning the site, 11 were workers from Rusveitpetro, the owner of the pipeline, a number that some activists felt was inadequate. Later, the inhabitants of Kolva asked for regular water testing over concerns of drinking water contamination. The results of the samples, sent to Syktyvkar, were never released, yet Komi Republic officials insisted that the tests determined the water was safe, leading to allegations of government unaccountability. According to an unidentified source from within the Komi Republic government administration, there were allegations word of the spill was suppressed by Rusveitpetro for a period of possibly several months, and that lawsuits would likely not cover the full costs of cleanup.On April 10, 2016, members of the Komi Izvatas (also known as Komi Izhemtsy) Indigenous subgroup reported to the Committee to Save the Pechora that a large oil spill had taken place on the Yagera River near Ukhta. According to the Committee, 400 metric tons of crude oil reached the Izhma River, reportedly causing concerns of effects on Izvatas livelihoods. On April 26, sixteen days later, a possible source of the leak was identified by the \"Committee to Save Pechora\" at Malyi Voivoizh creek, although government officials could not confirm.\nMany residents of Izhma district believe that cancers are occurring at an increasing rate of incidence due to pollution. Food sources such as fish have allegedly become contaminated, and reindeer have been poisoned by oil spills on their grazing areas. According to Makliuk, most residents of the district live in poverty. They also claim discriminatory hiring processes that give preference to non-local workers, in spite of the enormous revenues generated from their traditional territories. According to one resident, \"we have to live on the disposal dump of [the] oil industry. We can't even sell our houses and move away, because they cost nothing.\"\n\nOn April 11, 2014, the Izhma district council passed a resolution to support a complete shutdown of oil and gas operations in the area. The decision was in part due to concerns over economic effects on reindeer herding; the residents of Izhma, many of whom are Izvata, are part of the only subgroup within the Komi Indigenous people who still practice this livelihood. In particular, concerns were sparked by the discovery of new drilling rigs in close proximity (200 meters) to the village of Krasnobar, which had been installed without prior notice, permission, or consent of Izvata communities or Izhma district administration, in contravention of environmental legislation. 150 people, representing twelve settlements, gathered for the vote, held in Krasnobar village; the Izhma district council voted unanimously in favor.\n\nOn June 5, 2014, a demonstration was held in Ust-Usa Village in Usinsk District, Komi Republic. The demonstration, held in the same region affected by the 1994 spill, followed earlier protests in Izhma and saw the adoption of a \"strongly worded\" resolution by Indigenous groups present. Protesters threatened to boycott future Komi Republic elections if their demands were not met. An excerpt from the declaration reads,\n\nWe, the inhabitants of villages within Usinsk municipal district, have been experiencing the terrible consequences of oil extraction in our land for over four decades. Our rivers, lakes and swamps are being mercilessly polluted. Our ancestral land is being destroyed. We are deprived of the natural resources which are our main source of livelihood. Our constitutional rights to a healthy living environment, to clean air and clean water is being violated systematically. Oil companies, and first of all LUKOIL-Komi, the main operator of oil production within Komi Republic, are brushing off our letters and appeals with dismissals, promises and deceit. Neither have we never received an adequate and constructive response to our repeated enquiries to various authorities, from the municipal district administration to the country's leadership. They do not listen, they don't understand us.Therefore we are gathered here at the rally in the ancient village of Ust-Usa, and we declare that we join the residents of Krasnobor, Shelyayur and other settlements of Izhma district in that we will no longer idly observe the barbaric destruction of our land and the pollution of our rivers. People have come to our ancestral lands, who are not interested in our future and future of our children – they are only interested in the \"black gold\" – our mineral resources. And for its sake they are prepared to turn it into a lifeless space; and they do so\".\"\n\nOn the Kola peninsula in European Russia, Sami people were displaced from their traditional territories during the Cold War. The greatest single displacement took place when Sami fishermen were evacuated from the coastline in order to make way for secretive naval installations. Meanwhile, reindeer herders were dispossessed from their territories along a 200-mile zone adjacent to the border with Finland and Norway. This border was soon closed, effectively shutting communication and movement between Sami peoples in Finland, Norway, and Sweden with those on the Russian Kola.\n\nFurther displacement was caused by the arrival of increased heavy industry and natural resource extraction such as forestry and mining during Soviet times. Hundreds of thousands of workers from other areas of the USSR arrived, many of whom were forcibly interned as workers in the Gulags. This industrialization disrupted reindeer herding livelihoods, and led in part to the settlement of Sami into Soviet-designed urban areas such as Lovozero. Today, most Russian Sami live in extreme poverty and poor housing conditions.Acid rain is a major concern on the Kola peninsula, where it has caused severe damage to thousands of square kilometres of tundra and taiga. The ecological balance of the peninsula has been adversely affected by mining operations, which has contributed to atmospheric pollution, damage to forests and natural meadow lands, and groundwater depletion and pollution.\nAccording to ZumBrunnen, between 1964 and 1986 approximately 11,000 containers of \"dangerous wastes\" were dumped into the Kara and Barents seas. Nuclear waste dumping is believed to have occurred in Arctic waters nearby, and, as of 1997, many ships anchored near shore either stored or contained radioactive waste along the coastlines which had once been inhabited by evacuated Sami fishermen.\n\nAccording to Sami activist Larisa Avdeyeva, the first public Sami protest in Russia took place in 1998, when a Swedish company attempted to establish an open-pit gold mine in the middle of Sami reindeer grazing lands. Today, vast areas of the Kola continue to be ecologically devastated by pollution from smelting, including operations such as the Kola Mining and Metallurgy Combine near the Norwegian border. Many nuclear facilities operate throughout the area, which continues to host numerous nuclear-waste sites. Pressure to expand mining as well as oil and gas production, and plans for new long-distance pipelines, have been growing concerns for Russian Sami.\n\nSome Sami leaders have reported harassment, allegedly at the hands of the Russian government. In one notable case, the head of Russia's Sami parliament, Valentina Sovkina, was reportedly harassed and assaulted on her way to a UN Indigenous conference in New York in 2014, while other Sami leaders reported incidents such as alleged tampering of their passports en route to the event. According to \"SkyNews\" journalist Katie Stallard, \"The Kremlin sees the region as a source of oil, gas and mineral wealth – a crucial part of its energy and security ambitions. Ms Sovkina thinks the authorities are worried the Sami will assert their right to self-determination, and to their share of the natural resources.\"\n\nAs of 2006, 1,600 Sami were living in Russia.\n\nBy 2008, more than 70 billion barrels of oil had been extracted from the Western Siberian province of Khanty-Mansi. Representing 70 percent of Russian oil production at a 2008 rate of seven million barrels a day, vast quantities of energy resources from Khanty-Mansi are destined for Western Europe annually. According to journalist Paul Starobin, the region's Indigenous inhabitants have experienced ongoing social and economic marginalisation, in spite of the economic wealth generated by oil and gas development. In the words of Starobin,\nWhen Siberia's oil lands came under development, native people were forcibly herded into villages and cut off from their hunting and fishing grounds. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the nomads won legal status as \"aboriginal people,\" with the right to roam the oil fields. In spite of their new status ... their lot has hardly improved. Their numbers are small, about 30,000 in all; their languages are nearly extinct; and they are heavily afflicted by the scourges of contemporary Russia—AIDS, alcoholism, and tuberculosis. Some oil-tax money is being invested in medical ships that stop along the rivers to care for patients. But critics say these floating clinics diagnose disease, then leave patients with no means to get treatment.By the early 1970s, oil and gas reserves began to deplete in northeastern Russia, and production started to shift towards Western Siberia. Yet by the late 1980s, it was becoming increasingly visible that much of the wealth generated by oil and gas development was not reaching Indigenous groups. According to Espiritu, by this time the living conditions of many Indigenous people in Siberia was in a precipitous state, and Yamalo-Nenet groups were documented as living in \"squalid\" conditions within close proximity to the city of Salekhard.\nAs part of the rapid ramping up of production of oil and gas during the 1960s and 1970s, proper infrastructure for both the handling of petroleum products, as well as social infrastructure for the influx of workers, was frequently overlooked. Thousands of kilometres of pipelines were built using substandard construction codes for the harsh climate, resulting in vast numbers of leaks and spills. According to a 1997 essay by ZumBrunnen, environmentalists at the time estimated that 35,000 pipeline ruptures were occurring each year, accounting for between one and three percent of Russian oil output (3 to 10 million metric tons annually). Meanwhile, 19 billion cubic meters of gas were being flared in West Siberia annually, releasing polyaromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, carbon, and nitrogen dioxides into the local atmosphere. In 2012, the figure was estimated at 17.1 billion cubic metres.\n\nDue to pollution from the oil and gas developments, reindeer herding, fishing, and hunting became unviable for many Yamalo-Nenets in the area, and many had little choice but to request government assistance. Since the 1980s, fluctuations in energy production in Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenetskiy Autonomous Okrugs have caused many Indigenous Khanty, Mansi, and Yamalo-Nenet peoples who were employed in the energy sector to find themselves out of work, with no viable traditional livelihoods to return to.\n\nIt has been estimated (according to statistics given in an interview by Evgenia Belyakova, Arctic project coordinator for Greenpeace Russia) that the total cost of replacing Russia's ageing pipelines could cost 1.3 trillion Russian rubles (approximately 1.5 billion US dollars), but could be achieved within five years if companies were prepared to absorb a 25% drop in profits at 2015 energy prices.\n\nAccording to Indigenous studies scholar Brian Donahoe, \"Article 69 of the 1993 Russian Constitution explicitly guarantees in principle the 'rights of the indigenous small-numbered peoples in accordance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law and international agreements that the Russian Federation has entered into.\"The \"vague wording\" of laws surrounding indigenous rights in Russia has resulted in Indigenous land use agreements in Russia that are often informal in nature. For example, \"Dmitry Aleksandrovich Nesanelis, the former vice director of the Lukoil-Varandeyneftegaz oil drilling company (Lukoil's daughter company in the Nenets Autonomous Oblast), an anthropologist by training and the person responsible for relations between this company and the indigenous Nenets people, asserted in 2003 that it was in the interests of the state to make these laws so vague as to be unworkable.\"\n\nNesanelis has also spoken of concerns regarding the implications of vague legislation on oil drilling. According to Donahoe, \"As a large multinational corporation, Lukoil is concerned with its public image with respect to the effect its activities have on indigenous peoples and on the environment.\" Nesanelis has stated he would prefer laws that would give energy corporations \"some concrete guidelines about 'what exactly they have to pay, how, and to whom.'\"\n\nWhile some Indigenous leaders such as Vladislav Peskov, president of the Association of Indigenous Small-Numbered Peoples of the Nenets Autonomous Oblast have spoken in favour of informal agreements (Peskov has stated that \"Different people need different things. Some need land, some need money, and the informal agreements with the drillers allow everyone to get what they really want\"), others have voiced concerns about the long-term implications of informal land-use agreements. In the opinion of Donahoe, the informal nature of these agreements privilege short-term benefits over the security of long-term legal protections. In the words of Donahoe, \"Having failed to assert their legal rights when they could have [after 2004, new Russian laws such as the omnibus Federal Law no. 122 have weakened indigenous legal rights, especially Federal Law no. 232 pertaining to changes in Environmental Impact Assessments], they will find in the longer term that their economically and politically more powerful partners can turn the law against them when it behooves them to do so.\"\n\nRussia, an International Labor Organization member, has not ratified ILO 69, an agreement that \"explicitly and unequivocally asserts the right to self-determination for all indigenous peoples\". According to Donahoe, this allows the Russian Federation to \"continue to deny Indigenous peoples true control over their economic resources\". As articulated by Donahoe, Russia is also a member of the United Nations whose charter somewhat vaguely states that one of the purposes of the organization is 'to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples' (Article 1, paragraph 2) ... The United Nations recognizes indigenous peoples of classically colonized lands—namely, colonized lands that lie across an ocean from the colonizing country (the \"salt water test\"; see Magnarella 2001, 2002; Niezen 2003, 138)—but has carefully avoided recognizing indigenous minorities who are not separated from their colonizers by an ocean as 'peoples.' This lack of recognition implicitly denies such indigenous peoples the right to self-determination—one of the arguments Russia uses to justify not complying with UN treaties in the case of the indigenous peoples of Siberia.Indigenous groups whose traditional territories lie in European Russia, such as the Nenets, Komi, and Sami peoples, are affected by this status of non-recognition of the right to self-determination, which, as federal policy implicates all Indigenous groups in Russia in addition to Siberia.\nArguably, some of the implications of non-recognition of Indigenous title may be the existence of laws that allow for socio-environmental marginalization to take place. According to Donahoe, \"The federal government's monopoly over the law can be best illustrated by the negotiations over the new Land Code (Zemel'nyi Kodeks; Federal Law no. 136 of October 25, 2001) and Forest Code (Lesnoi Kodeks; Federal Law no. 200 of December 4, 2006)\" which have allowed for the privatization of timber supplies. Under new iterations of these laws, previously non-commercially exploitable \"forest fund [lesnoi fond]\" lands, which constitute approximately 70 percent of Russia's landmass, have arguably been opened up for private sale. These new laws arguably lack provisions for the recognition of Indigenous rights, resulting in a Forest Code that, in the opinion of Donahoe, \"effectively removes the power of regional governments (republics, oblasti, kraia, okrugi, etc.) to exert [non-federal] control over these lands\".\n\nThe result has been a centralization of power over land management, which has arguably contributed to an unstable legal and economic context for the livelihoods of Indigenous hunters and reindeer herders who \"operate in a virtually noncash economy and could not possibly afford to purchase or lease the extensive tracts of land necessary to migrate seasonally, which is crucial both to reindeer husbandry and to the effective exploitation of animal resources\", according to Donahoe. The privatization of land has widened concerns over access rights, which could potentially have negative effects on Indigenous hunting and grazing.Indigenous groups in Russia have attempted to defend their rights in court. In the opinion of Donahoe, Indigenous groups in Russia have \"demonstrated ingenuity in their attempts to assert their rights to land and resources and to protect against industrial development and extractive activities by using other laws not specifically designed for the protection of indigenous rights\". For example, Indigenous groups have established \"national parks or specially protected nature territories (osobo okhranaemye prirodnye territorii) at the local or regional level or both\", under their rights to do so as outlined in Federal Law no. 33 (March 14, 1995), \"On Specially Protected Nature Territories [Ob osobo okhranaemykh prirodnykh territoriiakh]\".\nIn one case, the Native Assembly of the KMAO (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug) \"asked\" Andrew Wiget and Ol'ga Balalaeva to craft a law that would \"protect the 'folklore' of the indigenous people of Khanty-Mansi more generally\". Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug is an important oil-and-gas-producing region, responsible for the supply of large quantities of energy to Western Europe. It is also an area that has seen significant degradation of Indigenous lands as a result of oil and gas development. According to Donahoe, The idea was that, by protecting folklore, they would also be protecting the environment within which the folklore was embedded. It was especially important that the law should 'link the perpetuation of living folklore traditions to specific communities and landscapes': Understood in its fullest sense, it means that sacred place myths cannot exist without sacred places, nor local legends without the sites to which they are attached. In short, folklore cannot meaningfully endure if separated from the specific enculturated environment that it inhabits. Because the power to deface that environment rests with the non-native, political majority, this is potentially urgent, because KMAO is today the center of Russia's petroleum industry, and in some areas almost 90% of the land surface is licensed for petroleum production (Wiget and Balalaeva 2004, 139-140).After losing \"some of its most important provisions\", KMAO Law no. 37-03, \"On the Folklore of the Native Minority Peoples of the North Living on the Territory of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug\" was passed on May 30, 2003, and came into effect June 18, 2003, with its arguably most important provision intact: \"Native Minority Peoples living on the territory of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug are guaranteed, in the manner established by legislation:...(3) the preservation and protection of the places of the traditional circulation of folklore, and of the natural resources necessary for the perpetuation and development of folklore traditions\" (KMAO Law no. 37-03, Chapter 2, article 5, paragraph 2.3).\n\nRomani in Russia are frequently subject to geographic marginalization due to xenophobia. In 2005, Romani settlements in Arkhangelsk and Kaliningrad became the target of xenophobic political campaigns, in which local politicians used elections platforms that argued for \"'cleaning' their city of 'gypsies' as one of their major promises to be fulfilled after winning the elections ... these politicians openly accused the entire Romani population of earning a living from the drug trade\". Romani were then accused of constructing illegal dwellings. In Kaliningrad, Romani houses were later violently evicted by force. In Arkhangelsk, after obtaining legal permission to rent their parcels of land in Novy Posyolok, the Romani were then accused of not having permission to build houses; in 2006, the entire community was forced to leave the city \"on a train provided for this purpose by the city administration, taking them to the Moscow region, into another illegal situation...but out of the city's political debates\".\n\nAccording to Paris-based Russian human rights organization Anti-Discrimination Centre (ADC) Memorial, there is a \"tendency that market considerations and contempt toward persons regarded as 'Gypsies' coalesce in the actions of municipalities carrying out urban renewal programs, in which the eviction of Roma from city centers—and public view—is an active component of public policy\".\n\nIn Ivanovo Province, the Kolyanovo Romani settlement was located near the disused Ivanovo airport. The residents had been evicted from Ivanovo city 15 years earlier. Following plans to expand the airport, the community became threatened with eviction once again.\n\nOften Romani settlements are denied access to utilities such as natural gas, despite the abundance of natural gas in Russia. For example, in Ryazan Province, the village of Dyaguilevo, with a population of 600 persons, has been established since 1988 in \"extreme poverty\" and, as of 2008, has faced significant issues with obtaining reliable natural gas and electricity service.\n\nAn arguably more extreme case of inequality over access to energy resources can be found in the Roma village of Plekhanovo, located five kilometres outside Tula. As of 2008, the village was inhabited by 3000 individuals, most of whom had been settled there since the 1960s. In March 2016, a violent confrontation took place between residents (including children) and as many as 500 riot police over access to a natural gas pipeline that runs through the village. In spite of the line running through the village, the Romani inhabitants, whose houses were at risk of demolition, had been unable to secure legal access rights to the gas, and had resorted to illegally tapping into the pipeline for domestic use. According to community representative Nadezhda Demetr, \"Instead of helping people register their houses and legalise their gas supplies, the authorities have been demolishing their houses. Since 2005, houses have been demolished without compensation because they don't have any documents.\" Another local Romani community leader, Ivan Grigoryevich, stated to media that \"We have been living in this settlement since the 1960s and we have tried many, many times to get gas into our houses, but we are prohibited by town officials.\"\n\nIn another conflict related to land and natural resource issues, the village of Kosaya Gora (3 kilometres outside Tula) was, as of 2008, threatened with eviction. The village of 400 individuals had been located at its current site since the 1960s, yet the land on which the Romani resided was declared by a court to be located on a \"protected nature reserve area\", according to Romani rights activists.\n\nIn a similar case to Kosaya Gora, residents of a Romani settlement in Chudovo were faced with eviction in 2007. The residents, who had resettled to the area with verbal consent from local authorities after being evacuated from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, had been living in the area since the mid-1990s, later to learn that their houses were declared as falling within a \"sanitary protection zone\" around an unused asphalt plant, and that their homes would be subject to demolition. Without access to documents to demonstrate title to the land, the community could not effectively argue in protection of their claimed property rights.\n\nMigrant workers in Russia frequently experience issues of environmental marginalization as a result of social and economic pressure to live in high-risk, substandard accommodations. According to Anti-Discrimination Centre (ADC) Memorial,Migrant workers, especially families with children, often cannot find accommodation, due to high prices and the unwillingness of landlords to rent their property to migrants, particularly to those who do not have the appropriate documentation. As a result, migrant families are forced to live in places not designed for living, especially for living with children. Companies, who are happy to employ cheap migrant labor, and to save on their accommodation, are often facilitating this process.\n\nAs of 2013, in the Nevsky district of St. Petersburg migrant workers and their families have been documented living in unsafe housing conditions that lacked utilities such as safe drinking water and electricity. Many of the workers were from the former Soviet Republics of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. As of 2013, there was also a shantytown on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, segregated in a remote, difficult to access industrial area, whose residents were Uzbek citizens from Khorezm city. In addition to concerns over health and safety similar to those faced by migrant workers in Nevsky district, this settlement had no waste collection service, and contained large garbage pits.\n\nOther areas of environmental concern have been the settlements of \"Roma-Mugat\" migrants from Tajikistan, such as the settlement at Volodarka village, St. Petersburg. As of 2013, according to ADC Memorial,The living conditions of Mugat-migrants do not correspond to elementary sanitary norms and requirements for security and hygiene. In Mugat settlements, which usually have several hundred inhabitants, there is no water supply, heating or electricity. Improvised settlements are spread on the boundaries of big towns, near household waste dumps, forest strips, [and] industrial areas ... where there is practically no infrastructure water supply, electricity and sewage system .\n\nMany of these \"Central Asian Roma-migrants\" have extremely poor diets, which are often supplemented by scavenged food from dumps. This has caused epidemic proportions of \"tuberculosis, hepatitis, intestinal disorders, and helminthiasis\".\n\nRomani migrants from Hungary often face visible issues of environmental marginalization in Russia. As of 2013, according to ADC Memorial, \"One of the largest Roma-Magyar settlements is situated in the industrial area on the outskirts of Saint-Petersburg. It borders the Saint-Petersburg-Moscow railway line and the household waste dump.\" Within the camp, the houses were made of scavenged materials, and basic services and utilities such as water, sewerage, and garbage collection were nonexistent; for bathing, many residents used water from a nearby marsh. Due to substandard housing and the lack of water distribution, all residents lived in constant risk of fire hazards.\n\n"}

He received his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 1927 and then continued to study medicine at the University of Berlin, where he acquired his first degree in medicine in 1933. In 1934 Neumann and his wife Julia, who had been Zionists since they were teenagers, moved to Tel Aviv. For many years, he regularly returned to Zürich, Switzerland to give lectures at the C. G.

He also lectured frequently in England, France and the Netherlands, and was a member of the International Association for Analytical Psychology and president of the Israel Association of Analytical Psychologists. He practiced analytical psychology in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death from kidney cancer in 1960.\n\nNeumann contributed to the field of developmental psychology and the psychology of consciousness and creativity. He had a theoretical and philosophical approach to analysis, contrasting with the more clinical concern in England and the United States. His most valuable contribution to psychology was the empirical concept of \"centroversion\", a synthesis of extra- and introversion. However, he is best known for his theory of feminine development, a theory formulated in numerous publications, most notably \"The Great Mother\". His works also elucidate the way mythology throughout history reveals aspects of the development of consciousness that are parallel in both the individual and society as a whole.\n\nHis most enduring contributions to Jungian thought are \"The Origins and History of Consciousness\" (1949) and \"The Great Mother\" (1955). Another work, \"Depth Psychology and a New Ethic\", reflects on human destructiveness and the way the human mind relates to its own shadow.\n\nNeumann further developed his studies in feminine archetypes in his \"Art and the Creative Unconscious\", \"The Fear of the Feminine\", and \"Amor and Psyche\".\n\nNeumann also wrote poetry, a novel called \"The Beginning\" (\"Der Anfang\"), and in 1932 conducted a critical study of Franz Kafka's works at a time when Kafka was still a minor figure in the literary world.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father was the politician, jurist, and historian John Doull.\n\nFrom the late 1940s until the mid-1980s, he taught in the Department of Classics at Dalhousie University in Halifax. He was himself educated at Dalhousie as well as at the University of Toronto, Harvard University, and the University of Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nIn 2003, the University of Toronto Press published a substantial volume containing a number of his works together with commentary provided by former colleagues and students. The appearance of this compilation, which also contains biographical details upon which this article is largely based, is perhaps among the reasons that Doull is now rather better known than he was at any point during his life. It contains writings on Greek poetry; the culture of ancient Rome; ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy; and twentieth-century politics; and certain key figures (such as Plato, Augustine, and Hegel) receive particular attention. In general the collection reflects Doull's deep conviction that the western philosophical tradition as a whole remains of great relevance and also his special interest in Hegel, with whose philosophical position Doull was in close agreement. Indeed, his Hegelian views (especially his judgement that Hegel had been successful in his attempt to articulate in the form of self-developing concepts the inner content of the Christian revelation) were no doubt a major reason that he was regarded as outside the philosophical mainstream.\n\nHe studied with Werner Jaeger at Harvard, and during the course of his life met a number of important figures (Gilson for example) in twentieth-century philosophy; but he did not in general show much sign of having been formed philosophically by those he met, or indeed by anyone after Hegel. The Canadian philosopher Charles Norris Cochrane, with whom he studied in Toronto, is perhaps the only notable exception to this.\n\nHe greatly admired the playing of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, with whom he shared, in addition to an extraordinary independence of mind, a vision of Canadian spiritual life (which for Doull encompassed such spheres as politics, art, religion, and philosophy) that combined both a receptivity to the possibilities of the new world and a strong sense of continuity with the European past. Hans-Georg Gadamer expressed surprise at having encountered a person of such comprehensive erudition in North America. Emil Fackenheim called him the only Hegelian. His colleague and friend George Grant said of him: 'Of all the Canadians of my generation, he certainly has the clearest intellect of any I have known. Nothing I would ever have to say about philosophy will compare to his knowledge of it'.\n\nMany of his published articles can be found in the journal Dionysius, of which he was one of the founding Editors and in connection with which he was (together with his fellow Editors A. H. Armstrong and R. D. Crouse) remarkably successful in recruiting as Editorial Advisors many distinguished scholars, among whom were Werner Beierwaltes, Henry Chadwick, Mary T. Clark, Emil Fackenheim, Eugene Fairweather, J. N. Findlay, Hans-Georg Gadamer, George Grant, Malcolm Ross, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, and George Williams. He also published a number of essays in the electronic journal Animus, the tenth Volume of which was devoted to essays on his life and thought.\n\nIn 1989, he was admitted \"honoris causa\" to the degree of \"Doctor Civilis Legis\" (DCL) of the University of King's College in Halifax.\n\nHis papers have been deposited in the James Alexander Doull Archive at the Grenfell Campus of the Memorial University of Newfoundland.\n\n\n\n"}

Due to his contributions to phenomenology and the philosophy of history he is considered one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. Having studied in Prague, Paris, Berlin and Freiburg, he was one of the last pupils of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. During his studies in Freiburg he was also tutored by Eugen Fink, a relationship which eventually turned into a lifelong philosophical friendship.\n\nPatočka attended Jan Neruda Grammar School.\n\nHis works mainly dealt with the problem of the original, given world (\"Lebenswelt\"), its structure and the human position in it. He tried to develop this Husserlian concept under the influence of some core Heideggerian themes (e.g. historicity, technicity, etc.) On the other hand, he also criticised Heideggerian philosophy for not dealing sufficiently with the basic structures of being-in-the-world, which are not truth-revealing activities (this led him to an appreciation of the work of Hannah Arendt). From this standpoint he formulated his own original theory of \"three movements of human existence\": 1) \"receiving\", 2) \"reproduction\", 3) \"transcendence\". He also translated many of Hegel's and Schelling's works into Czech. In his life time, Patočka published in Czech, German, and French.\n\nApart from his writing on the problem of the \"Lebenswelt\", he wrote interpretations of Presocratic and classical Greek philosophy and several longer essays on the history of Greek ideas in the formation of our concept of Europe. Patočka increasingly focused on the idea of Europe during the 1970s. As he was banned from teaching (see below), he held clandestine lectures in his private apartment on the Greek thought in general and on Plato in particular in the late 70s. These clandestine lectures are collectively known as \"Plato and Europe\", and they are published under the same title in English. He also entered into discussions about modern Czech philosophy, art, history and politics. He was an esteemed scholar of Czech thinkers such as Komensky (b.1592) (also known as Comenius) and Masaryk (b.1850). In 1971, he has published a small treatise on Comenius in German titled \"Die Philosophy der Erziehung des J.A. Comenius (Comenius's Philosophy of Education).\" In 1977, his work on Masaryk culminated in 'Two Studies on Masaryk, which was initially a privately circulated typescript.\n\nPatočka's \"Heretical Essays in the Philosophy of History\" is analyzed at length and with much care in Jacques Derrida's important book \"The Gift of Death.\" Derrida was the most recent person who wrote or conversed with Patočka's thought; Paul Ricoeur and Roman Jakobson (who respectively wrote the preface and afterword to the French edition of the \"Heretical Essays\") are two further examples.\nDuring the years 1939–1945, when the Czech universities were closed, as well as between 1951–1968 and from 1972 on, Patočka was banned from teaching. Only a few of his books were published and most of his work circulated only in the form of typescripts kept by students and disseminated mostly after his death. Along with other banned intellectuals he gave lectures at the so-called \"Underground University\", which was an informal institution that tried to offer a free, uncensored cultural education. In January 1977 he became one of the original signatories and main spokespersons for the Charter 77 (Charta 77) human rights movement in Czechoslovakia. For the three months after the Charter was released he was intensely active writing and speaking about the meaning of the Charter, in spite of his deteriorating health. He was also interrogated by the police regarding his involvement with the Charter movement, and on March 3, 1977 he was held by the police for ten hours, who had claimed that he would be allowed to speak in his role as a Charter spokesperson with a high-ranking official (in fact, this was a pretext to keep him from attending a reception at the West German embassy). He fell ill that evening and was taken to the hospital, where his health briefly improved, enabling him to give one final interview with \"Die Zeit \"and to write one final essay entitled \"What We Can Expect from Charter 77.\" On March 11 he relapsed, and on March 13 he died of apoplexy, at the age of 69.\n\nHis brother František Patočka was a microbiologist.\n\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Daniel Epstein, <nowiki>Let us not despair of Europe, let us not despair of ourselves</nowiki>, <nowiki>Eretz Acheret</nowiki> Magazine ...Comment:Is this broken link to be fixed or just here by mistake?<-->\n"}

It is based on the life and writings of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled political and spiritual leader of Tibet. Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, a grandnephew of the Dalai Lama, stars as the adult Dalai Lama, while Tencho Gyalpo, a niece of the Dalai Lama, appears as the Dalai Lama's mother.\n\nThe film according to Roger Ebert was \"made of episodes, not a plot\" and he gave the film three stars out of four. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"emotionally remote\" but praised its look and its musical score. Richard Corliss praised the cinematography and score as well. Barry Norman, chief film critic at the BBC opined that \"Kundun\" was both beautifully and intelligently made.\n\n\"Kundun\" (སྐུ་མདུན་ in Tibetan), meaning \"presence\", is a title by which the Dalai Lama is addressed. \"Kundun\" was released only a few months after \"Seven Years in Tibet\", sharing the latter's location and its depiction of the Dalai Lama at several stages of his youth, though \"Kundun\" covers a period three times longer.\n\nThe film has a linear chronology with events spanning from 1937 to 1959; the setting is Tibet, except for brief sequences in China and India. It begins with the search for the 14th mindstream emanation of the Dalai Lama. After a vision by Reting Rinpoche (the regent of Tibet) several lamas disguised as servants discover a promising candidate: a child born to a farming family in the province of Amdo, near the Chinese border.\n\nThese and other lamas administer a test to the child in which he must select from various objects the ones that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. The child passes the test, and he and his family are brought to Potala Palace in Lhasa, where he will be installed as Dalai Lama when he comes of age.\n\nDuring the journey, the child becomes homesick and frightened, but is comforted by Reting, who tells him the story of the first Dalai Lama–whom the lamas called \"Kundun\". As the film progresses, the boy matures in both age and learning. After a brief power struggle in which Reting is imprisoned and dies, the Dalai Lama begins taking a more active role in governance and religious leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese communists, recently victorious in their revolution, are proclaiming Tibet a traditional part of Imperial China and express their desire to reincorporate it with the newly formed People's Republic of China. Eventually, despite Tibet's pleas to the United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India for intervention, Chinese Communist forces invade Tibet. The Chinese are initially helpful, but when the Tibetans resist Communist reorganization and reeducation of their society, the Chinese become oppressive.\n\nFollowing a series of atrocities suffered by his people, the Dalai Lama resolves to meet with Chairman Mao Zedong in Beijing. While Mao publicly expresses his sympathies to the Tibetan people and the Dalai Lama, and insists that changes must be made as the Dalai Lama sees fit, relations inevitably deteriorate. During their face-to-face meeting on the final day of the Dalai Lama's visit, Mao makes clear his socialist view that \"religion is poison\" and that the Tibetans are \"poisoned and inferior\" because of it.\n\nUpon his return to Tibet, the Dalai Lama learns of more horrors perpetrated against his people, who have by now repudiated their treaty with China and begun guerrilla action against the Chinese. After the Chinese make clear their intention to kill him, the Dalai Lama is convinced by his family and his Lord Chamberlain to flee to India.\n\nAfter consulting the Nechung Oracle about the proper escape route, the Dalai Lama and his staff put on disguises and slip out of Lhasa under cover of darkness. During an arduous journey, throughout which they are pursued by the Chinese, the Dalai Lama becomes very ill and experiences two personal visions, first that their trip to India will be propitious and that, similarly, their eventual return to Tibet will also be propitious. The group eventually makes it to a small mountain pass on the Indian border. As the Dalai Lama walks to the guard post, an Indian guard approaches him, salutes, and inquires: \"Are you the Lord Buddha?\" The Dalai Lama replies with the film's final line: \"I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself.\" Once the Dalai Lama arrives at his new residence, he unpacks his telescope and steps outside. Erecting it and removing his spectacles, he gazes through it toward the Himalayas–and toward Tibet. The film concludes with two lines printed on screen: \"The Dalai Lama has not yet returned to Tibet. He hopes one day to make the journey.\" The words shimmer into a dissolve upon the black screen as the credits begin.\n\nThe project began when screenwriter Melissa Mathison, whose best-known work was \"ET\", met with the Dalai Lama and asked him if she could write about his life. According to Turner Classic Movies, \"he gave her his blessing and his time, sitting for interviews that became the basis of her script\"; it was Mathison's suggestion that Scorsese be brought in as director.\n\nMost of the film was shot at the Atlas Film Studios in Ouarzazate, Morocco; some scenes were filmed at the Karma Triyana Dharmachakra monastery in Woodstock, New York.\n\nAll tracks were composed by Philip Glass. Music was conducted by Michael Riesman. Music was produced by Kurt Munkacsi. The Executive Music Producer was Jim Keller.\n\n\nEven before the film was released, China's leaders hotly objected to Disney's plans to distribute the film, even to the point of threatening Disney's future access to China as a market. Disney's steadfastness stood in stark contrast to Universal Pictures, which had earlier \"turned down the chance to distribute \"Kundun\" for fear of upsetting the Chinese.\" Scorsese, Mathison, and several other members of the production were banned by the Chinese government from ever entering China as a result of making the film. China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling Disney television cartoons. Disney apologized in 1998 for releasing the film and began to \"undo the damage\", eventually leading to a deal to open Shanghai Disneyland by 2016.\n\nThe film did poorly at the box office, taking in less than $6 million in a limited U.S. distribution. \"Kundun\" was nominated for four Academy Awards: for Best Art Direction (Dante Ferretti, art direction and Francesca Lo Schiavo, set decoration), Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins), Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score (Philip Glass). The film holds a 77% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews, indicating generally positive reviews. The critical consensus states: \"Hallucinatory but lacking in characterization, \"Kundun\" is a young Dalai Lama portrait presented as a feast of sight and sound.\"\n\nThe film according to Roger Ebert was \"made of episodes, not a plot\".\nStephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"emotionally remote\" while praising its look and its score: \"The movie is a triumph for the cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has given it the look of an illuminated manuscript. As its imagery becomes more surreal and mystically abstract, Mr. Glass's ethereal electronic score, which suggests a Himalayan music of the spheres, gathers force and energy and the music and pictures achieve a sublime synergy.\" Richard Corliss praised the cinematography and score as well: \"Aided by Roger Deakins' pristine camera work and the euphoric drone of Philip Glass's score, Scorsese devises a poem of textures and silences. Visions, nightmares and history blend in a tapestry as subtle as the Tibetans' gorgeous mandalas of sand.\" \n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying: \"There is rarely the sense that a living, breathing and (dare I say?) fallible human inhabits the body of the Dalai Lama. Unlike Scorsese's portrait of Jesus in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", this is not a man striving for perfection, but perfection in the shape of a man. ... Once we understand that \"Kundun\" will not be a drama involving a plausible human character, we are freed to see the film as it is: an act of devotion, an act even of spiritual desperation, flung into the eyes of 20th century materialism. The film's visuals and music are rich and inspiring, and like a mass by Bach or a Renaissance church painting, it exists as an aid to worship: It wants to enhance, not question.\" David Edelstein called the movie a hagiography whose \"music ties together all the pretty pictures, gives the narrative some momentum, and helps to induce a kind of alert detachment, so that you're neither especially interested nor especially bored.\"\n\nBarry Norman, chief film critic at the BBC opined that \"Kundun\" was \"beautifully and intelligently made, far more impressive, for instance, than the recent \"Seven Years in Tibet\"\". As \"Kundun\" was released in the UK four months after its original release, Norman was able to probe Scorsese about the film's promotion. Writing about his interview with Scorsese, Norman said,\n\nYet it seems to be Scorsese, rather than the studio, who is doing most to promote the film. So I asked him \"Did Disney back you up when it came out? Did they really put themselves behind it to try to sell it?\" Now Scorsese is a decent and diplomatic man, who likes to be fair to everybody, but eventually he said: \"I personally think that, unfortunately, they didn't push the picture.\" For fear of offending China? \"Who knows?\" he said. But, perhaps significantly, he also said: \"The market China represents is enormous, not just for Disney but many other corporations around the world.\"\n\n"}

Although he was not present for the beatification Mass, Pope Benedict XVI noted her \"extraordinary devotion\" to the Holy Face of Christ at the Angelus audience the following Sunday.\n\nShe was born Giuseppina De Micheli in Milan on 11 September 1890. She had been aware from an early age of the Holy Face of Jesus devotion, which had been started almost a century earlier by a French Carmelite nun, Sister Marie of St Peter, of Tours, France. Giuseppina joined the Congregation of the Daughters of the Immaculate Conception in October 1913, and took the name Sister Maria Pierina on 16 May 1914, when she made her vows. She was then sent to the motherhouse in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she remained until 1921. While there, her attachment to the Holy Face devotion grew stronger. After her return to Milan she was eventually elected as the mother superior of her house and began to spread the devotion.\n\nOn the first Friday in Lent 1936 she reported a vision of Christ in which Jesus appeared to her and said: \"“I will that My Face, which reflects the intimate pains of My Spirit, the suffering and the love of My Heart, be more honored. He who meditates upon Me, consoles Me”\". Further reported visions of Jesus and Mary urged Sister Maria Pierina to make a medal with the Holy Face of Jesus. After some effort, she managed to obtain permission to reproduce the photograph of the Shroud of Turin and authorization from the Curia in Milan to proceed with the medal in 1940. This became known as the Holy Face Medal.\n\nOn one side the medal bears a replica of the Holy Shroud of Turin and an inscription based on Psalm 66:2: \"Illumina, Domine, vultum tuum super nos\", i.e. \"May, O Lord, the light of Thy countenance shine upon us\". On the other side of the medal, there is an image of a radiant Sacred Host, the monogram of the Holy Name (\"IHS\"), and the inscription \"Mane nobiscum, Domine\" i.e. \"Stay with us, O Lord\".\n\nThe first medal of the Holy Face was offered to Pope Pius XII who approved the devotion and the medal. She had also reported that Jesus wanted a special Feast on the day before Ash Wednesday in honor of His Holy Face, to be preceded by a Novena (9 days) of prayers. In 1958, Pope Pius XII declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics.\n\nIn 1941 she wrote in her diary: \"I feel a deep longing to live always united to Jesus, to love Him intensely because my death can only be a transport of love with my Spouse, Jesus.\" Sister Maria Pierina died on 26 June 1945 in Milan. Her remains are located at the Holy Spirit Institute in Rome.\n\n\n\n"}

He became one of the representatives of the Warsaw school of Positivism who formed a common front against Messianism together with the Polish Neo-Kantians.\n\nBefore Poland's return to independence, Massonius wrote for the Polish-language St. Petersburg weekly \"Kraj\" and contributed to the Polish-language periodicals \"Głos\", \"Tygodnik Ilustrowany\", \"Wisła\", \"Gazeta Warszawska\" and \"Gazeta Polska\". In 1897-1914 he served on the editorial board of \"Przegląd Filozoficzny\" (The Philosophical Review). In 1906 Massonius was elected to Russia's first National Duma. In 1906-14 he lectured at Warsaw's Flying University, and in 1920-32, as a professor he conducted courses in philosophy and pedagogy at Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, then part of the Second Polish Republic; in these, he focused on epistemology and aesthetics. He became dean of the Humanities Department there. His writings included a collection of philosophical essays, and Polish translations of Western philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Émile Tardieu and Schopenhauer. \n\nOn 21 September 1920, in Poznań, Massonius published an essay \"On Bolshevism\", including observations on the 1847 \"Communist Manifesto\" of Marx and Engels. As one of the first Polish scholars following the 1917 Russian Revolution, he warned that communist ideology was merely a tool that enabled the Bolsheviks to assume the political role of a new ruling class in Russian society. Workers and peasants – Massonius wrote – were to become an embellishment for the commissars corresponding roughly to the former Tsarist governors, heads of administrative districts (\"volosts\"), prosecutors, heads of treasury offices, directors of school departments, and so on.\n\nHe wrote that the new ruling elite, comprising members of the Cheka (Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counterrevolution and Sabotage) and Red Army officers, regarded as the \"right-thinking\", had only one thing in common as in every oligarchy. That is, they all represented communist clubs formed in every Soviet town. These clubs constituted the actual, though unofficial government, or rather the body overseeing the activities of the official government. From the very beginning the aim of the revolutionaries was not to bring about Marxist equality among the classes, but to create a new privileged class of their own. Civil equality was never their goal, it was only an object of subversive political manipulation justifying the means, he explained.\n\n\n\n"}

The term 'ideokinesis' denotes use of such imagery to rehabilitate and precipitate human movement, which Sweigard borrowed from the American piano teacher Bonpensière, who used imagery in his music teaching, and invented the word by combining two words derivivative of Greek: 'ideo' for idea or thought, and 'kinesis' for movement.\n\nFulkerson initiated two developments in the work established by her predecessors. Firstly, she extended the type of imagery used by her students and dancers in both choreographed and improvised dance beyond the anatomical and kinesthetic. This enabled her students and dancers to physicalize and embody a range of images, including entities, animals, and characters. Secondly, she prepared her dancers and students for practice, rehearsal, and performance using a technique comparable to guided meditation, guided imagery, and creative visualization, verbally suggesting images as the members of her ensemble or class lay still, becoming increasingly aware of their body prior to initiating movement. As a consequence, Fulkerson's approach to dance education has been described as a form of movement meditation.\n"}
{"id": "32007296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32007296", "title": "Masahiro Morioka", "text": "Masahiro Morioka\n\nMorioka was born in Kōchi Prefecture, Japan, in 1958 and entered The University of Tokyo in 1977. In the beginning he studied physics and mathematics but he later turned to philosophy and ethics. In graduate school he specialized in bioethics and environmental ethics, a newly emerging field at that time as well as Wittgenstein’s later philosophy. He published two books on bioethics, \"An Invitation to the Study of Life\" and \"Brain Dead Person\", and moved to the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto, in 1988. There he wrote several books including \"How to Live in a Post-religious Age\" and \"Consciousness Communication\"; the former is a philosophical and psychological analysis of Aum Shinrikyo’s sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway that occurred in 1995 and the latter discusses subconscious interactions in the age of computer communications (\"Consciousness Communication\" won The Telecom Social Science award in 1993). He spent one year as a visiting scholar at Wesleyan University, Connecticut, USA, in 1991.\n\nIn 1997, he moved to Osaka Prefecture University where he taught philosophy and ethics. In 2001 he published \"Life Studies Approaches to Bioethics\", in which he discussed brain death and organ transplantation, feminist bioethics and abortion, the disability rights movement, and new forms of eugenics from the perspective of “life studies.” In this book he introduces concepts such as \"the fundamental sense of security\" and \"the reality of a deeply shaken self\", which he discovered through an examination of Japanese bioethics literature written in the 1970s. He published \"Painless Civilization\", mentioned above, in 2003. This is considered by many his most important and influential book to date. His books on men’s studies, also mentioned above, have been frequently referred to in the field of gender studies. He published \"The Cartoon Introduction to Philosophy\" in 2013. He played an important role in the revision of the organ transplantation law in Japan in the years 2000-2009. He asserted that organs should not be harvested from small children who have been declared brain dead but his proposal was ultimately rejected by the Diet.\n\nHe moved to the School of Human Sciences, Waseda University, in 2015.\n\nMorioka defines brain death not as a material process occurring inside the brain but as a human relationship formed between a comatose patient and his/her family members or others who surround him/her. He calls this a \"human relationship oriented analysis\" approach to bioethics. He claims that brain death is not necessarily human death.\n\nIn his 1993 book \"Consciousness Communication\" he distinguished \"consciousness communication\", communication for the purpose of social interaction itself, from \"information communication\", communication used as a tool for conveying information. He predicted that consciousness communication would play a central role in the coming information society, and put forward the concepts of \"community of anonymity\" and \"dream navigator\".\n\nMorioka calls his comprehensive approach to the issues of life, death, and nature \"life studies\". The ultimate goal of life studies is to help people to live their lives without regret. Morioka asserts that the most important aspect of life studies is never to detach ourselves from the problems we are tackling and never to think of ourselves as exceptions; He encourages us to keep our eyes on our own desires and the evil that he believes is deeply engraved in our hearts.\n\nThe fundamental sense of security is one of the central concepts in Morioka’s philosophy. In the book \"Life Studies Approaches\" to Bioethics he describes this as \"a sense of security that allows me to strongly believe that even if I had been unintelligent, ugly, or disabled, my existence in the world itself would have been equally welcomed, and whether I succeed or fail, and even if I become a doddering old man, my existence will continue to be welcomed\". He asserts that this is a precondition of our being able to live our lives without regret.\n\nMorioka asserts that our contemporary civilization is developing in the form of a \"painless civilization\". He asserts that this civilization's limitless penchant for eliminating pain and suffering makes us completely lose sight of the meaning of life that is indispensable to human beings and deprives us of the joy of life in exchange for pleasure, pleasantness, and comfort. He further claims that people in advanced countries know that they are drowning in the tide of their painless civilization but do not know how to escape from it.\n\nMorioka distinguishes between two kinds of desires: the desire of the body and the desire of life. The former is the desire to expand the amount of one's pleasure, property, and stability, and the latter is the desire to dismantle the former, throw away pleasure, property, and stability, and change into a being in a different state of mind and body.\n\nMorioka uses the phrase \"frigid man\" to describe a man who suffers from sexual frigidity caused by \"male frigidity\" and has a (sub-conscious) attraction toward young girls, especially girls wearing school uniforms. Many Japanese adult males suffer from this condition and love to see the images of young girls in the mass media and on the Internet. This is the pathology hidden behind the Japanese male's \"Lolita complex\".\n\nIn Morioka's writings, \"herbivore men\" are timid young Japanese men who are inexperienced and unassertive in love and sex. Just after the publication of Morioka's book, \"Lessons in Love for Herbivore Boys\", 2008, the term \"herbivore men\" became a buzz word in Japan and was reported worldwide.\n\nThe philosophy of life is a new discipline in contemporary philosophy that aims to examine the topics of life, death, and nature from various philosophical angles. It widens the scope of the 19th century's Lebensphilosophie and encompasses contemporary bioethics, environmental philosophy, philosophy of biology, biopolitics, the study of the meaning of human life, and other areas of research.\n\nThis is one of the key concepts in Morioka's philosophy of life. Birth affirmation means to be able to say yes, from the bottom of our hearts, to the fact that we have been born. Morioka distinguishes \"birth affirmation\" from similar concepts such as \"survival affirmation\" and \"affirmation of one's whole life\". He considers \"birth denial\" as the worst form of human evil.\n\nHe criticized and enlarged Kant's idea of dignity and proposed three kinds of dignity in human life, namely, \"dignity of one's life,\" dignity of a one-off life of a human being, \"dignity of the body,\" dignity of having the body, and \"dignity of connected life,\" dignity of being connected to other human beings and non-human creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15872404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15872404", "title": "Mormon views on evolution", "text": "Mormon views on evolution\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) takes no official position on whether or not biological evolution has occurred, nor on the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis as a scientific theory. In the 20th century, the First Presidency of the LDS Church published doctrinal statements on the origin of man and creation. In addition, individual leaders of the LDS Church have expressed a variety of personal opinions on evolution, many of which have affected the beliefs and perceptions of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe LDS Church has no official position on the theory of evolution or the details of \"what happened on earth before Adam and Eve, including how their bodies were created.\" Even so, some general authorities of the LDS Church have made statements suggesting that, in their opinion, evolution is opposed to scriptural teaching. Apostles Joseph Fielding Smith and Bruce R. McConkie were among the most well-known advocates of this position. Other church authorities and members have made statements suggesting that, in their opinion, evolution is not in opposition to scriptural doctrine. Examples of this position include Elders B. H. Roberts, James E. Talmage, and John A. Widtsoe.\n\nWhile maintaining its \"no position\" stance, the LDS Church has produced a number of official publications that have included discussion and personal statements from these various church leaders on evolution and the \"origin of man.\" These statements generally adopt the position, as a church-approved encyclopedia entry states, \"[t]he scriptures tell why man was created, but they do not tell how, though the Lord has promised that he will tell that when he comes again.\"\n\nThere have been three authoritative public statements (1909, 1910, and 1925) and one private statement (1931) given from the LDS Church's highest authority, the First Presidency, that represents the Church's doctrinal position on the origin of mankind. The 1909 and 1925 statements of the First Presidency have been subsequently endorsed by church leaders such as apostle Boyd K. Packer in 1988.\n\nIn February 2002 the entire 1909 First Presidency message was reprinted in the Church's Ensign magazine.\n\nHistorically, the Latter-day Saints were isolated in the western plains when \"The Origin of Species\" was published by Charles Darwin in 1859. Consequently, there was little discussion about evolution among Latter-day Saint communities. The Latter-day Saints were trying to survive and build settlements in Utah and evolution was not a prominent concern for them. George Q. Cannon of the Quorum of the Twelve responded to Darwin in 1861, stated that revelation is superior to science, but considered the possibility of evolution among animals and plants. This was and is not considered doctrine. The building of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 allowed for the Saints to gain access to outside ideas and influences. Because of this new knowledge, LDS schools sought to combat scientific theories such as evolution with faith. Publications helped reaffirm church doctrine; however, views on evolution were mixed. Some believed a belief in evolution was equivalent to atheism, whereas some sought to find common ground between evolution and faith. Due to the many differing opinions that emerged, in the early 1900s, the LDS Church began to officially respond to the theories that had already been discussed for nearly fifty years.\n\nThe first official statement from the First Presidency on the issue of evolution was in 1909, the centennial of Charles Darwin's birth and the 50th anniversary of the publication of \"On the Origin of Species\". Church president Joseph F. Smith appointed a committee headed by Orson F. Whitney, a member of Quorum of the Twelve, to prepare an official statement, \"basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, proclaim[ing] man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity.\" This teaching regarding the origin of man differs from traditional Christianity's doctrine of creation, referred to by some as \"creationism\", which consists of belief in a fiat creation. In addition, the statement declares human evolution as one of the \"theories of men\", but falls short of explicitly declaring it untrue or evil. It states that, \"man began life as a human being, in the likeness of our heavenly father\". Moreover, it states that although man begins life as a germ or embryo, it does not mean that, \"[Adam] began life as anything less than a man, or less than the human germ or embryo that becomes a man\" Supported by signatures from the First Presidency, the statement was published in November 1909.\n\nThe statement did not define the origins of animals other than humans, nor did it venture into any more specifics regarding the origin of man.\n\nIn response to continual questions from church members regarding evolution, as well as problems preceding the 1911 Brigham Young University modernism controversy, in its 1910 Christmas message, the First Presidency made reference to the church's position on science. It stated that the church is not hostile to science and that \"diversity of opinion does not necessitate intolerance of spirit\". The message continues by stating that proven science is accepted with joy, but theories, speculation, or anything contrary to revelation or common sense is not accepted.\n\nIn 1925, in the midst of the Scopes Trial in Tennessee, a new First Presidency issued an official statement which reaffirmed the doctrine that Adam was the first man upon the earth and that he was created in the image of God. There is a short article in the \"Encyclopedia of Mormonism\" which is largely composed of quotes from the 1909 and 1925 statements, and the First Presidency has not publicly issued an official statement on evolution since 1925. It states that men and women are created in the image of the \"universal Father and Mother\", and Adam, like Christ was a pre-existing spirit who took a body to become a \"living soul\". It continues by stating that because man is \"endowed with divine attributes\", he \"is capable, by experience through ages and aeons, of evolving into a God.\" The official statement was initially published in \"Deseret News\" on July 18, 1925 and later published in the \"Improvement Era\" in September 1925. The 1925 statement is shorter than the 1909 statement, containing selected excerpts from the 1909 statement. \"Anti-science\" language was removed and the title was altered from \"The Origin of Man\" to \"Mormon' View of Evolution\". The comment which concluded that theories of evolution are \"theories of men\" in the 1909 official statement was no longer included in the 1925 official statement.\n\nIn April 1931 the First Presidency sent out a lengthy memo to all church general authorities in response to the debate between B. H. Roberts of the Presidency of the Seventy and Joseph Fielding Smith of the Quorum of the Twelve on the existence of pre-Adamites. The memo stated the Church's neutral stance on the existence of pre-Adamites.\n\nThe subject of evolution has been addressed in several official publications of the Church.\n\nThe LDS Church has published several general conference talks mentioning evolution. In the October 1984 conference apostle Boyd K. Packer stated that \"no one with reverence for God could believe that His children evolved from slime or from reptiles\" as well as affirming that \"those who accept the theory of evolution don’t show much enthusiasm for genealogical research.\" In the April 2012 conference, apostle Russell M. Nelson discussed the human body stating \"some people erroneously think that these marvelous physical attributes happened by chance or resulted from a big bang somewhere\". He then compared this to an \"explosion in a printing shop produc[ing] a dictionary\".\n\nThe \"Old Testament Student Manual\", published by the Church Educational System, contains several quotes by general authorities as well as academics from a variety of backgrounds (both members of the Church and non-members) related to organic evolution and the origins of the earth. The 2003 edition states that there is no official stance on the age of the Earth but that evidence for a longer process is substantial and very few people believe the earth was actually created in the space of one week. However, it also includes quote from Joseph Fielding Smith indicating his interpretation of Church doctrine as it pertains to the theory of organic evolution. He asserts that organic evolution is incompatible and inconsistent with revelations from God and that to accept it is to reject the plan of salvation.\n\nDoctrine and Covenants 77:6 mentions \"the seven thousand years of [the earth's] continuance, or its temporal existence\", which has been interpreted by Joseph Fielding Smith and Bruce R. McConkie as a statement suggesting that the earth is no more than about six thousand years old (the seventh thousand-year period being the future millennium).\n\nHowever, in relation to this verse, the manual for seminary teachers explains: \"It may be helpful to explain that the 7,000 years refers to the time since the Fall of Adam and Eve. It is not referring to the actual age of the earth including the periods of creation.\"\n\nSince 1992 at the LDS-owned universities, a packet of authoritative statements approved by the BYU Board of Trustees (composed of the First Presidency of the Church and other general authorities and general auxiliary leaders) has been provided to students in classes when discussing the topic of organic evolution. The packet was assembled due to the large number of questions students had about evolution and the origins of man and is intended to be distributed along with other course material. The packet includes the first three Official First Presidency statements on the origin of man as well as the \"Evolution\" section in the \"Encyclopedia of Mormonism\" which includes elements from the 1909 and 1925 statements as well as the 1931 \"First Presidency Minutes\".\n\nIn 1982, the \"Ensign\", an official periodical of the church, published an article entitled \"Christ and the Creation\" by Bruce R. McConkie, which stated that \"[m]ortality and procreation and death all had their beginnings with the Fall.\" In an earlier edition of the \"Ensign\" published in 1980, McConkie stated that \"the greatest heresy in the sectarian world ... is that God is a spirit nothingness which fills the immensity of space, and that creation came through evolutionary processes.\"\n\nA July 2016 article for young adults acknowledged questions about how the age of the earth, dinosaurs, and evolution fit with church teachings, stating \"it does all fit together, but there are still a lot of questions.\" The article offered no further explanation to how science and LDS teachings fit together, and stated \"nothing that science reveals can disprove your faith\" and told youth \"not to get worried in the meantime.\"\n\nA few months later in the same magazine, the Church published an anonymously authored article stating that \"the Church has no official position of the theory of evolution\". The article continues by stating that the theory of organic evolution should be left for scientific study and that no details about the what happened before Adam and Eve and how their bodies were created have not been revealed, but the origin of man is clear from the teaching of the Church.\n\nA much earlier anonymously authored article from 2004 did not attempt to reconcile church teachings and scientific views of evolution, but stated that not having the answers doesn’t discredit the existence of God, and that God won't reveal more unto us until we prove our faith. An example was provided of how the author avoided a classroom debate on evolution by stating that they knew God existed and created us. The article also quoted past church president Gordon Hinckley giving his own example of how he chose to drop the question and not let it bother him. Subsequent letters from youth stated that the youth viewed themselves as against evolution and supportive of intelligent design. A previous article in the New Era also showed youth viewing evolution as an antagonistic idea to their faith and becoming upset when it was taught and another featured a church seventy using scientific arguments in an attempt to disprove evolutionary natural selection and adaptation.\n\nThe \"Improvement Era\" was an official periodical of the Church between 1897 and 1970. In the April 1910 edition in the \"Priesthood Quorum's Table\" section of that periodical, Genesis 2:7 is cited as well as other scriptures from Genesis and the Pearl of Great Price. The article states that it is unclear whether the mortal bodies of man evolved through natural processes, whether Adam and Eve where transplanted to Earth from another place, or whether they were born on Earth in mortality. The article states that those questions are not fully answered in the Church's current revelation and scripture. The article cites the answer is attributed to the Church's First Presidency.\n\nSome verses in the standard works raise questions about the compatibility of scriptural teachings and scientists' current understanding of organic evolution. One such verse, in Doctrine and Covenants section 77, verse 6, describes the \"temporal existence\" of the earth as 7,000 years old. The verse does not describe the process of creation, but if taken literally, implies that species may have appeared through a process faster than natural selection.\n\nOther scriptural verses suggest that no organisms died before the fall of Adam. In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi teaches: \"If Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end\" (2 Nephi 2:22). In Moses 6:48 in the Pearl of Great Price, the prophet Enoch states: \"Because that Adam fell, we are; and by his fall came death; and we are made partakers of misery and woe.\"\n\nIn the \"Bible Dictionary\" of the LDS Church, the entry for \"Fall of Adam\" includes the following statement: \"Before the fall, Adam and Eve had physical bodies but no blood. There was no sin, no death, and no children among any of the earthly creations.\" Under the entry \"Flesh\", it is written: \"Since flesh often means mortality, Adam is spoken of as the 'first flesh' upon the earth, meaning he was the first mortal on the earth, all things being created in a non-mortal condition, and becoming mortal through the fall of Adam.\n\nAs noted above, the \"Bible Dictionary\" is published by the LDS Church, and its preface states: \"It [the \"Bible Dictionary\"] is not intended as an official or revealed endorsement by the Church of the doctrinal, historical, cultural, and other matters set forth.\"\n\nEvery statement by a President of the LDS Church does not necessarily constitute official church doctrine, but a statement by a church president is generally regarded by church membership as authoritative and usually represents doctrine. Official Church doctrine is however presented and taught by the entire First Presidency as a presidency, usually released in an official letter or other authorized publication.\n\nBrigham Young, the second president of the LDS Church, stated that the LDS Church differs from other Christian churches, because they do not seek to clash their ideas with scientific theory. He continued that whether God began with an empty Earth, whether he created out of nothing, whether he made it in six days or millions of years will remain a mystery unless God reveals revelation about it. Young made the following statement two years later, stating the injustice the fact that the theories of scientists are taught in school, but not the principles of the gospel. He wrote that for this purpose, he created Brigham Young Academy, so that God's revelation could be taught in schools and the books are written by members of the LDS Church.\n\nJohn Taylor was the first President of the LDS Church to comment directly on Darwinian theory. In his 1882 book \"Mediation and Atonement\", Taylor stated that nature and creation is governed by the laws of man and organisms exist in the same form since creation, as contradicted by the ideas of evolutionists. Taylor continued that man did not originate from chaos of matter, but from \"the faculties and powers of a God\".\n\nSoon after the First Presidency's 1909 statement, Joseph F. Smith professed in an editorial that \"the Church itself has no philosophy about the \"modus operandi\" employed by the Lord in His creation of the world.\" However, in the very same month (and in the wake of the evolution controversy that had recently ensued at Brigham Young University), Smith published and signed a statement wherein he explained some of the conflicts between revealed religion and the theories of evolution. He cited the 1911 Brigham Young University modernism controversy, stating that evolution is in conflict with scriptures and modern revelation. He continues that the Church holds \nthat \"divine revelation\" must be the \"standard\" and is \"truth\". Smith mentions that \"science has changed from age to age\", and \"philosophic theories of life\" have their place, but do not belong in LDS church school classes and anywhere else when they contradict the word of God.\n\nA 1910 editorial in a Church magazine that enumerates various possibilities for creation is usually attributed to Smith or to the First Presidency. Included in the listed possibilities were the ideas that Adam and Eve: (1) \"evolved in natural processes to present perfection\"; (2) were \"transplanted [to earth] from another sphere\"; or (3) were \"born here ... as other mortals have been.\" Smith authored an editorial the next year in the Church magazine discouraging the discussion of evolution in Church school stating that members of the Church believe the theory of evolution was \"more or less a fallacy.\" He also stated, however, that the Church \"has no philosophy about the modus operandi employed by the Lord in His creation of the world.\" Yet Smith stated about his views on evolution, \"No Adam, no fall; no fall, no atonement; no atonement, no savior.\"\n\nIn a 1952 speech to students at Brigham Young University, McKay used the theory of evolution as an example while suggesting that science can \"leave [a student] with his soul unanchored\". He stated that a professor that denies \"divine agency in creation\" imposes on the student that life was created by chance. McKay insisted that students should be led to a \"counterbalancing thought\" that \"God is the Creator of the earth\", \"the Father of our souls and spirits\", and \"the purpose of creation is theirs (God and Jesus Christ).\" In the April 1968, at the general conference held by the LDS Church, McKay's son David Lawrence McKay read a message on his father's behalf that was an edited version of the 1952 speech, including the omission of the word \"beautiful\" when describing the theory of evolution. In 1954, McKay quoted the Old Testament while affirming to members of the BYU faculty that living things only reproduce \"after their kind\". He quoted Genesis 1:24 which states, \"Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind, cattle and creeping things, and the beast of the earth after his kind.\"\n\nAt a 1975 church women's conference, Church President Spencer W. Kimball quoted, \"And, I God created man in mine own image, and in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them. [At which point Kimball stated, \"The story of the rib, of course, is figurative.\"] ... and later continued \"we don't know exactly how [Adam and Eve's] coming into this world happened, and when we're able to understand it the Lord will tell us.\"\n\nPrior to becoming president of the LDS Church, Ezra Taft Benson gave an April 1981 general conference address in which he stated that \"the theory of man’s development from lower forms of life\" is a \"false idea\". In 1988, after becoming president of the churh, Benson published a book counseling members of the church to use the Book of Mormon to counter the theories of evolution. He wrote that \"we have not been using the Book of Mormon as we should. Our homes are not as strong unless we are using it to bring our children to Christ. Our families may be corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the book to expose and combat the falsehoods in ... organic evolution. In 1988, Benson published another book that included his earlier warnings about the \"deceptions\" of Charles Darwin. He wrote that educational institutions serve to mislead youth, which explains why the Church advises that youth attend LDS institutions, allowing parents to closely observe the education of their children and clear up \"the deceptions of men like...Charles Darwin.\n\nIn a 1997 speech at an Institute of Religion in Ogden, Utah, Church President Gordon B. Hinckley said: \"People ask me every now and again if I believe in evolution. I tell them I am not concerned with organic evolution. I do not worry about it. I passed through that argument long ago.\" In 1997, Hinckley published his earlier teachings wherein he contrasts \"organic evolution\" with the evolution and improvement of individuals: In the late 1990s, Hinckley recalled his university studies of evolution to reporter Larry A. Witham: \"'Studied all about it. Didn't worry me then. Doesn't worry me now.'\" In 2004, an official church magazine printed a quote from Hinckley from a 1983 speech where he expressed a similar sentiment.\n\nIn the early 1900s, many general authorities, specifically those with science backgrounds, subscribed to the idea of an old earth, yet most of them rejected Darwinism. Joseph Fielding Smith and other general authorities were against the old earth theory as well as Darwin's theory of evolution. Individual leaders of the Church have expressed a variety of personal opinions on biological evolution and as such do not necessarily constitute official Church doctrine.\n\nPrior to becoming president of the LDS Church, Russell M. Nelson stated in a 2007 interview with the Pew Research Center that \"to think that man evolved from one species to another is, to me, incomprehensible. Man has always been man. Dogs have always been dogs. Monkeys have always been monkeys. It's just the way genetics works.\" He also stated in 1987 in a church magazine that he found the theory of evolution unbelievable.\n\nIn 1930, B. H. Roberts, the presiding member of the First Council of the Seventy, was assigned by the First Presidency to create a study manual for the Melchizedek priesthood holders of the church. Entitled \"The Truth, The Way, The Life\", the draft of the manual that was submitted to the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for approval stated that death had been occurring on earth for millions of years prior to the fall of Adam and that human-like pre-Adamites had lived on the earth.\n\nOn 5 April 1930, Joseph Fielding Smith, a junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the son of a late church president, \"vigorously promulgated [the] opposite point of view\" in a speech that was published in a church magazine. In his widely read speech, Smith taught as doctrine that there had been no death on earth until after the fall of Adam and that there were no \"pre-Adamites\".\n\nIn 1931, both Roberts and Smith were permitted to present their views to the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. After hearing both sides, the First Presidency issued a memo to the general authorities of the church which stated while they agree with the idea that \"Adam is the primal parent of our race\", there is no advantage to continuing the discussion and that church members should focus on \"[bearing] the message of the restored gospel to the people of the world\" and that those sciences do not have anything to do with, \"the salvation of the souls of mankind\". They stated that continuation of the discussion would only lead to \"confusion, division, and misunderstanding if continued further.\"\n\nAnother of the apostles, geologist James E. Talmage, pointed out that Smith's views could be misinterpreted as the church's official position, since Smith's views were widely circulated in a church magazine but Roberts's views were limited to an internal church document. As a result, the First Presidency gave permission to Talmage to give a speech promoting views that were contrary to Smith's. In his speech on August 9, 1931, in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, Talmage taught the same principles that Roberts had originally outlined in his draft manual. Over Smith's objections, the First Presidency authorized a church publication of Talmage's speech in pamphlet form. In 1965, Talmage's speech was reprinted again by the Church in an official church magazine. As Talmage points out in the article, \"The outstanding point of difference ... is the point of time which man in some state has lived on this planet.\" With regards to evolution in general, Talmage challenged many of its aspects in the same speech. He said that he does not believe Adam descended from cavemen or lower forms of men, but is divinely created. He did, however, state that were it true that Adam evolved from lower form, it only seems likely that men will continue to evolve into something higher as a part of eternal progression. He continued by stating that, \"evolution is true so far as it means development, and progress, and advancement in all the works of God\", and that the scriptures, \"should not be discredited by theories of men; they cannot be discredited by fact and truth.\" Talmage considered the possibility of pre-Adamites; however, he denied speciation and evolution.\n\nRoberts died in 1933 and \"The Truth, The Way, The Life\" remained unpublished until 1994, when it was published by an independent publisher.\n\nAlthough it is apparent that Roberts and Smith may have had differing views on whether there was death before the fall of Adam, it is evident that they may have had similar views against organic evolution as the explanation for the origin of man. For example, Roberts wrote that \"the theory of evolution as advocated by many modern scientists lies stranded upon the shore of idle speculation. There is one other objection to be urged against the theory of evolution before leaving it; it is contrary to the revelations of God.\" Roberts further criticized the theories of evolution by stating that Darwin's claims of evolution are contrary to the experience and knowledge of man, because the law of nature requires that every organism reproduces of its own kind, and while variation may occur, changes usually revert due to extinction, chromosomal infertility, or by reversion to original species.\n\nIn 1954, when he was President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Smith wrote at length about his personal views on evolution in his book \"Man, His Origin and Destiny\" stating that it was a destructive and contaminating influence and that \"If the Bible does not kill Evolution, Evolution will kill the Bible.\" He further stated that \"There is not and cannot be, any compromise between the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the theories of evolution\" and that \"It is not possible for a logical mind to hold both Bible teaching and evolutionary teaching at the same time\" since \"If you accept [the scriptures] you cannot accept organic evolution.\" In response to an inquiry about the book from the head of the University of Utah Geology Department, church president David O. McKay affirmed that \"the Church has officially taken no position\" on evolution, Smith's book \"is not approved by the Church\", and that the book is entirely Smith's \"views for which he alone is responsible\". Smith also produced personal statements on evolution in his \"Doctrines of Salvation\" including that \"If evolution is true, the church is false\" since \"If life began on Earth as advocated by Darwin ... then the doctrines of the church are false\".\n\nBruce R. McConkie was an influential church leader and author on the topic of evolution having been published several time speaking strongly on the topic. He stated his view in 1982 at BYU that there was no death in the world for Adam or for any form of life before the fall, and that trying to reconcile religion and organic evolution was a false and devilish heresy among church members. In 1984 apostle McConkie disparaged the \"evolutionary fantasies of biologists\" and stated that yet to be revealed \"doctrines will completely destroy the whole theory of organic evolution\" and stated that any religion that assumes humans are a product of evolution cannot offer salvation since true believers know humans were made in a state in which there was no procreation or death. In his popular and controversial reference book \"Mormon Doctrine\", McConkie devoted ten pages to his entry on \"Evolution\". After canvassing statements of past church leaders, the standard works, and the 1909 First Presidency statement, McConkie concluded that \"[t]here is no harmony between the truths of revealed religion and the theories of organic evolution.\" The evolution entry in \"Mormon Doctrine\" quotes extensively from Smith's \"Man, His Origin and Destiny\". McConkie characterized the intellect of those Latter-day Saints who believe in evolution while simultaneously having knowledge of Church doctrines on life and creation as \"weak and puerile\". McConkie included a disclaimer in \"Mormon Doctrine\" stating that he alone was responsible for the doctrinal and scriptural interpretations. The 1958 edition stated that the \"official doctrine of the Church\" asserted a \"falsity of the theory of organic evolution\" along with sentences stating that \"There were no pre-Adamites\", that Adam was not the \"end-product of evolution\", and that there \"was no death in the world, either for man or for any form of life until after the Fall of Adam.\"\n\nThe earliest instance in which science and evolution were used to support LDS doctrine occurred in a series of six published articles in 1895, \"Theosophy and Mormonism\" by Nels L. Nelson. These articles were published in 1904 in \"Scientific Aspects of Mormonism\". Nelson used the ideas of evolution to consider the spiritual and physical development of God and humans. Nelson's view of evolution is spiritual with deliberate use of scientific processes by God rather than as a random, accidental process. Mormon philosopher William Henry Chamberlin's \"Essay on Nature\" (1915) and Frederick J. Pack's \"Science and Belief in God\" (1924) defended the theory of evolution; both attempted to reconcile religion and evolution. In a work, Pack states, \"no warfare exists between 'Mormonism' and true science.\"\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion and questioning among members of the LDS Church concerning the religion, evolution, and the reconciliation between the two. There are a number of current LDS-related publications with articles related to evolution. According to scholar Michael R. Ash, a great number of church members read \"Ensign\" which generally publishes articles with unfavorable views on evolution. Other publications such as \"BYU Studies\", \"FARMS Review of Books\", \"Dialogue\", and \"Sunstone\" represent a pro-evolutionary or neutral stance. The official stance of the Church on evolution is neutral. There are many Church members, including scientists who accept evolution as a legitimate scientific theory.\n\nA 2018 study in \"PLOS One\" researched the attitudes toward evolution of LDS undergraduates. The study revealed that there has been a recent shift of attitude towards evolution among LDS undergraduates. These attitudes have shifted from antagonistic to accepting. The researchers cited examples of more acceptance of fossil and geological records, as well as an acceptance of the old age of the earth. The researchers attributed this attitude change to several factors including primary school exposure to evolution and a reduction in the number of anti-evolution statements from the First Presidency.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41618350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41618350", "title": "New Testament people named John", "text": "New Testament people named John\n\nThe name John (in Greek, ) is prominent in the New Testament and occurs numerous times. Among Jews of this period, the name was one of the most popular, borne by about five percent of men. Thus, it has long been debated which Johns are to be identified with which.\n\nSimon Peter is at times called “Simon, son of John”, though in Matthew the text has \"Simon Bariona\". The latter appears to be untranslated Aramaic, with \"bar\" meaning “son of” and \"Iona\" being Jonah, or according to Bauckham, \"Jôhana‘\", an Aramaized form of \"John\".\n\nJohn the Baptist, son of Zechariah, figures prominently in the beginning of each of the four Gospels. The Synoptic Gospels distinguish him as “the Baptist”, but the Gospel of John omits this epithet, as no other John is therein mentioned by name. John the Baptist was beheaded during the ministry of Jesus, so in most cases he is easily distinguished from other Johns.\n\nFord proposes that Revelation originated as prophecy of John the Baptist, expanded by his followers to produce the book in its current form, but most scholars reject this theory.\n\nJohn, son of Zebedee was one of the Twelve Apostles, along with his brother James. This John is mentioned frequently in the Synoptic Gospels, but always (with a lone exception) in company with his brother James or with Peter or often with both.\n\nIn the first eight chapters of Acts, Peter is always accompanied by a certain John, who is almost certainly his fellow apostle, and is presumably also the John that Paul elsewhere lists with Peter and James as “pillars”. But after the execution of his brother James in 44, this John is never again mentioned.\n\nThere are many early indications that James and John were killed together. The response of Jesus to these two, “The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized,” has been understood since antiquity as foretelling their martyrdom. Indeed, Papias (c. 100) records that James and John “were killed by the Jews”, and early martyrologies record the martyrdom of “John and James the apostles in Jerusalem”.\n\nNevertheless, many ancient sources and many modern scholars identify John the Apostle as the author of some or all of the Johannine books, thereby claiming apostolic authority for them. Thus, John the Apostle is identified with John the Evangelist, probably also John the Elder, and, with still less certainty, John the Revelator, and also with the John who survived to old age in Ephesus.\n\nThis John is mentioned once in passing as present during the trial of Peter and John in Jerusalem, as recorded in Acts: “On the next day, their rulers, elders, and experts in the law came together in Jerusalem. Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest’s family.” Thus, he is probably distinct from John the Apostle, although some scholars (including the 5th Century writer Nonnus, as well as the Gospel of the Nazarenes) have suggested that the Zebedees' fishing business made them known to the high priest, while others conclude that being fishermen (owning multiple boats) is not synonymous with being poor nor precludes priestly connections, and some argue that the other disciple who was known to the high priest and who \"spoke to the servant-girl on duty there and brought Peter\" in mentioned in John 18:15 is likely to be the same disciple who is never mentioned by name in John's Gospel. However, the Sons of Zebedee are both present in chapter 21 in the count of five plus two (where seven is the 'complete' number) unnamed disciples. The Beloved Disciple is named as such separately; the other is likely Andrew. Which would be the reverse of the first followers identified in chapter 1.\n\nPolycrates of Ephesus (c. 190) writes that John the Evangelist “was a priest, wearing the petalon”—i.e., specifically that he had served as High Priest. In this, he seems to identify the Evangelist with this high-priestly John mentioned in Acts. Some modern scholars make the same identification, further citing from the Gospel “the other disciple, who was known to the High Priest.”\n\nAlthough there is no conclusive proof, and early writings such as by Polycrates may be interpretations based on their reading of the gospels, there are many theories - as one example: given that Elizabeth, Mary's kinswoman, was a \"Daughter of Aaron\" (and so had priestly connections), so too would Mary's sister mentioned in John 19:25... and she is mentioned in a way, some suggest, that might indicate she is John's mother.\n\n“John, called Mark” is mentioned several times in Acts. Such use of one Semitic name and another Greek name was a common practice among Jews of the time. He is usually identified with the Mark mentioned in various epistles, and with Mark the Evangelist.\n\nThis John is occasionally proposed as author of some of the Johannine works as well. Tarazi even goes so far as to attribute to him the Gospels of both Mark and John and all the other Johannine books.\n\nFive canonical books of the New Testament are ascribed to John and thus called collectively the \"Johannine literature\":\n\nOnly in Revelation does the text itself name its author as John; the other Johannine works are ascribed to John only through their attached titles and other external references.\n\nWhether or not these attributions have a basis in historical truth—modern scholars vary widely in their opinions about authorship—the question remains of which John each of these attributions refers to. Since antiquity, many have considered the entire Johannine corpus to be the work of a single author, a certain John of Ephesus, whom many identified with the Apostle John, son of Zebedee. On the other hand, this identification and the authorship of individual works have also been disputed since antiquity. Thus, the reputed authors of the Johannine works are conventionally called more explicitly—without prejudice to the issues of actual authorship and of their mutual identification—as follows.\n\nThe author of the Gospel is termed John the Evangelist.\n\nIn the Gospel, the name \"John\" occurs exclusively in reference to John the Baptist, and without that epithet, though “the sons of Zebedee” (named James and John in the Synoptics) are also mentioned once. The Gospel even lacks a list of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe anonymous “disciple whom Jesus loved” is identified in the closing verses as the one whose testimony the Gospel bears: “This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things.” Ancient sources invariably identify this disciple with the Evangelist, and many modern scholars agree, though others consider that John the Evangelist fashioned the testimony of the Beloved Disciple into a Gospel, as Mark did for Peter, or hold on other grounds that the two are not identical.\n\nFurther identification of the Beloved Disciple and/or the Evangelist with John the Apostle has been variously defended and impugned.\n\nSome scholars see the Gospel's “and we know that his testimony is true,” as indicating a second hand, of a hypothetical “John the Redactor” or some group of elders certifying the work. Bauckham, however, argues that this is simply the “\"we\" of authoritative testimony” of the author himself, used also in the Epistles.\n\nAs was an ordinary practice of the time, the Evangelist may have employed an amanuensis. Apocryphal sources of about the 5th century variously name Prochorus, Timothy, or even Papias, and modern scholars have suggested others.\n\nThe short second and third epistles are addressed “From the Elder”. On this basis, the author is termed John the Elder or John the Presbyter (\"presbyter\" being Greek for \"elder\").\n\nPapias (c. 100) refers to a certain “John the Elder, a disciple of the Lord”, one of the “elders” he had listened to, and from whose sayings he drew in his five-book \"Exegesis\", now lost. Papias goes on to refer to him simply as “the Elder”. Most see Papias as referring to the same John, at least, who penned the epistles.\n\nIn later centuries, some saw the address from “the Elder” in the second and third epistles as possibly indicating a different author than the other Johannine works, which cast doubt on their apostolic authority and therefore on their canonicity.\n\nThe author of Revelation is variously termed John the Revelator, John the Divine, John the Theologian, or John of Patmos.\n\nThe text of Revelation identifies its author thus: “I, John, your brother and the one who shares with you in the persecution, kingdom, and endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.” Patmos was an island near Ephesus, and Revelation begins with letters addressed to the seven churches of Asia, which were Ephesus and other nearby cities.\n\nDionysius of Alexandria (c. 250) closely criticized Revelation and concluded that it was starkly different from the Gospel and First Epistle (which Dionysius regarded as both the work of John the Apostle) in grammar, style, content, and anonymity, and thus could hardly be the work of the same author, but must have been written by another John, for “there are two monuments in Ephesus, each bearing the name of John.” Many modern scholars have concurred with this analysis, but others find striking similarities on closer inspection and attribute the stylistic differences to the Evangelist's use of an amanuensis.\n\nThe ancient scholars who accepted Revelation as authentic, however, invariably identified its author as John the Evangelist. Our earliest and most reliable informant is Irenaeus (c. 180), who knew John's personal disciples while in Smyrna. Irenaeus firmly identifies the Revelator with the Evangelist and tells us that he remained with the Church in Ephesus until the time of Trajan (98–117). The Revelator was still publicly active until the close of Domitian’s reign (81–96), as Irenaeus says:\n\nFrom Irenaeus’ ambiguous syntax, some later writers inferred that the exile to Patmos occurred under Domitian, though others explicitly ascribed it to Nero (54–68); modern scholars still debate which is more likely.\n\nClement of Alexandria, a contemporary of Irenaeus, tells an anecdote of John and the young robber captain, which opens with:\n\nSo again the Revelator is identified with the Bishop of Ephesus, about whom ancient sources have much to say.\n\nPatristic sources from as early as the 2nd century widely attest to a certain John, a disciple of Jesus, who lived to old age in Ephesus, and to whom all the Johannine works are ascribed.\n\nWhether such a man existed, which works he wrote, whether this figure has been confused or conflated with a second John, and whether he is identical with John son of Zebedee or any other John in the New Testament are all matters of intense controversy.\n\nIrenaeus (c. 180), who cites from Papias and “the elders” and also personally knew Polycarp of Smyrna, another disciple of John of Ephesus, is widely considered the most reliable authority we have on this John. In our first extant description of all four Gospels, Irenaeus concludes:\n\nHere, John the Evangelist is clearly identified with the Beloved Disciple and located in Ephesus. Elsewhere Irenaeus unmistakably cites this same John as author of the Epistles and Revelation as well. Irenaeus also speaks of the aged John surviving in Ephesus until the time of Trajan (98–117), which would be about 70 years after the Crucifixion.\n\nPolycrates of Ephesus (c. 190) is another especially respected source on John, writing of his own relative and predecessor (following the Philip the Apostle):\n\nPolycrates is in accord with Irenaeus, but seems to additionally identify John with the high-priestly John in Acts.\n\nThe earliest evidence on the identity of this John is from Papias of Hierapolis, a “hearer of John” writing c. 100, whose work survives only in fragments quoted by others. Papias writes:\n\nSo, Papias refers first to John the Apostle, listed with his brother and others of the Twelve, whose words the elders had handed down to him, and then to John the Elder, another disciple of Jesus, who was himself still being heard. Though some have interpreted these as two references to the same John, Bauckham argues that Papias is clearly distinguishing them. Papias then goes on to cite “the Elder” (just as the Second and Third Epistles are addressed from) on the origins of the Gospels of Mark and Matthew at least, and also to cite from the First Epistle and Revelation.\n\nPapias’ account of the origin of the Gospel of John is apparently paraphrased and expanded by Eusebius and is most likely the source for the Muratorian Canon (c. 170) when it says:\n\nThe \"Acts of John\", an apocryphal Gnostic work thought to have been composed around the late 2nd century, paints a rich, full narrative about John that was profoundly influential on later sources. Here we find the first explicit identification with the son of Zebedee, the story of the attempted execution by boiling oil also reported by Tertullian, the manner of John's natural death, and a great deal more. From the 3rd century onward, legends about John abound, with little hope of untangling any truth from the fiction.\n\nIt is clear that John of Ephesus was regarded from the earliest times as a personal disciple of Jesus and a crucial witness to his life, an author of scripture, an apostle, and a great leader among the churches of Asia; whether he was also the son of Zebedee, one of the Twelve Apostles, is much more doubtful. No such identification is explicit in the early sources, apart from the clearly apocryphal, until the middle of the 3rd century. At most, John of Ephesus is occasionally called \"apostle\", but in those cases the term is certainly not confined to the Twelve, and when mentioned with one of the Twelve Apostles, the Evangelist is in fact usually called a \"disciple\" by contrast. Bauckham argues that Papias distinguishes them and that the words of Polycrates even preclude such identification, and echos of this distinction linger in a few later sources. Among the orthodox, Origen is the first to explicitly accept the identification, which requires him to reconcile the tradition of John's natural death with the prophecy of John's martyrdom by seeing the latter fulfilled in his temporary exile to Patmos. On the other hand, after this point the identification was almost universally accepted in antiquity.\n\nOn whether or not John of Ephesus is to be identified with any of the Johns in the New Testament narrative—the son of Zebedee, the high-priestly John, or even John Mark—modern scholars remain divided.\n"}

His first work was on the \"unitas intellectus\", the theory of Averroes on the unity of the soul and intellect.\n\nIn natural philosophy he posed the question of the scope of the subject. Following Averroes, he took “mobile being” as the topic, against the scholastic views of Antonius Andreas and John Canonicus. Pietro Barozzi, Bishop of Padua, in 1489 issued a decree limiting academic discussion, and Vernia had to withdraw from his position. He wrote against Averroes, in \"Contra perversam Averrois opinionem\", attacking his views on the immortality of the soul and the unity of the intellect.\n\nHis students included Agostino Nifo and Pietro Pomponazzi. Both Vernia and Nifo changed allegiance from Averroes to the interpretations of Aristotle in certain Greek commentators, one of whom, Themistius, was being translated by Ermolao Barbaro, a colleague at Padua. As time went on, the commentary \"On the Soul\" by Alexander of Aphrodisias was translated into Latin, by Girolamo Donato, and a translation of the commentary attributed to Simplicius was also circulated.

{"id": "22610326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22610326", "title": "Paradox of the pesticides", "text": "Paradox of the pesticides\n\nThe paradox of the pesticides is a paradox that states that applying pesticide to a pest may end up increasing the abundance of the pest if the pesticide upsets natural predator–prey dynamics in the ecosystem.\n\nTo describe the paradox of the pesticides mathematically, the Lotka–Volterra equation, a set of first-order, nonlinear, differential equations, which are frequently used to describe predator–prey interactions, can be modified to account for the additions of pesticides into the predator–prey interactions.\n\nThe variables represent the following:\n\nThe following two equations are the original Lotka–Volterra equation, which describe the rate of change of each respective population as a function of the population of the other organism:\n\nBy setting each equation to zero and thus assuming a stable population, a graph of two lines (isoclines) can be made to find the equilibrium point, the point at which both interacting populations are stable.\n\nThese are the isoclines for the two above equations:\n\nNow, to account for the difference in the population dynamics of the predator and prey that occurs with the addition of pesticides, variable \"q\" is added to represent the per capita rate at which both species are killed by the pesticide. The original Lotka–Volterra equations change to be as follows:\n\nSolving the isoclines as was done above, the following equations represent the two lines with the intersection that represents the new equilibrium point. These are the new isoclines for the populations:\n\nAs one can see from the new isoclines, the new equilibrium will have a higher H value and a lower P value so the number of prey will increase while the number of predator decreases. Thus, prey, which is normally the targeted by the pesticide, is actually being benefited instead of harmed by the pesticide.\n\nA credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator–prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi–Ginzburg model. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio-dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed, one can use the Arditi–Ginzburg model as the first approximation.\n\nThe paradox has been documented repeatedly throughout the history of pest management. Predatory mites, for example, naturally prey upon phytophagous mites, which are common pests in apple orchards. Spraying the orchards kills both mites, but the effect of diminished predation is larger than that of the pesticide, and phytophagous mites increase in abundance.\n\nThe effect has also been seen on rice, as documented by the International Rice Research Institute, which noted significant declines in pest populations when they stopped applying pesticide.\n\nRecent studies suggest that such a paradox might not be necessarily caused by the reduction of the predator population by harvesting itself, for example, by a pesticide. The host population is reduced at the moment of harvesting, and simultaneously, the intraspecific density effect is weakened. Intraspecific competition accounts for the competition between individuals of a same species. When the population density is high and resources are consequently relatively scarce, each individual has less access to resources to invest energy in growth, survivorship and reproduction. That causes a decrease in the survival rate or an increase in mortality.\n\nIntraspecific competition increases with density. One could expect that a population decrease (due to harvesting, for example) will decrease the population density and reduce intraspecific competition, which would lead to a lower death rate among the prey population.\n\nStudies show also that direct effects on the predator population, through harvesting of the prey, are not necessary to observe the paradox. Harvesting of prey has been shown to trigger a reduction in the predator’s reproduction rate, which lowers the equilibrium predator level. Thus, changes in life history strategy (patterns of growth, reproduction and survivorship) can also contribute to the paradox. \nSeemingly the paradox can be accounted for by the indirect effects of harvesting on the native ecological interactions of prey and predator: reduction of intraspecific density effect for the prey and reduction of the reproductive rate for the predator. The former increases the population recovery of the prey, and the latter decreases the equilibrium population level for the predator.\n\nTo deal with the paradox, growers may turn to integrated pest management (IPM), an ecological approach to pest control that accounts for the interactions between pests and their environment. There is not only one way to practice IPM, but some methods include using mechanical trapping devices or increasing the abundance of natural predators.\n\nIPM is also often touted for its environmental and health benefits, as it avoids the use of chemical pesticides.\n\n"}

Her research focuses on corporate and subject theory, critical theory, psychoanalytically oriented social psychology and gender studies. She is considered a seminal figure in feminist critical theory.\n\nStarting in 1957, Becker-Schmidt studied sociology, philosophy, economics and social psychology at the Goethe University Frankfurt and at the Sorbonne in Paris. From 1964 to 1972 she worked as a research assistant and from 1968 as an assistant professor at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt am Main, where she taught as a lecturer at the Social Sciences Faculty of the University. In 1973 she was appointed to a professorship at the University of Hanover at the Psychological Institute, the post she held until her retirement in 2002.\n\nIn particular, Becker-Schmidt influenced the development of feminist critical theory, especially in the German-speaking countries. Her approach is associated with the so-called Hanoverian approach in feminist-oriented sociology and has had decisive influence on the approach.\n\nShe critiqued the positions of critical theory, especially Adorno and Horkheimer, with regard to their ambivalent attitude to the complex of gender relations and how the critical theorists have been oblivious to feminism. She questioned how gender relations could be made an integral part of critical theory. Muharrem Acikgöz situates Regina Becker-Schmidt in the second generation of the Frankfurt School; she was a student of Adorno's. She distinguishes herself from other feminist critical theorists in her empirical orientation, following Max Horkheimer, who argued that \"larger philosophical questions\" guide empirical research; and empirical research, in turn, guides larger philosophical questions. Her research on female factory workers situates itself in this relation.\n\nBecker-Schmidt conducted empirical research on female factory workers, developing her own social theory based on her findings. Her first project was entitled \"Problems of Mothers who are Wage Laborers\", and consisted of interviews with sixty factory workers, half who were still working and half who had withdrawn from factory work. Her research shed tight on the \"double burden\" faced by women factory workers: the responsibility for domestic work combined with the responsibility for contributing to the income of the family. She developed the concept of \"double socialization\" of women through wage labour and domestic work: the two spheres come from two different social realms with different logics, and are both separated and connected. Her research focused on both the objective demands of work, and the subjective realities of the worker. In each setting, time itself functions differently: in the factory, women must not lose time; while when taking care of children, women must forget about time, other than in remembering to get housework done before work the next day. The two realms are recombined through relationships (assumed to be heterosexual) and in the efforts of women to \"have both\" career and family life.\n"}

Controversies have mainly revolved around LGBT people and condom use.\n\nThe question of Islam and AIDS has arisen in recent years as the HIV/AIDS epidemic has grown stronger, with awareness and efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. Many Muslims view the AIDS epidemic through what is called the “prism of sin”, and as the consequence of sinful behavior, such as prostitution, sex with multiple partners or promiscuity. Awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is growing among the Muslim community and efforts are being initiated to prevent its spread. The Muslim Awareness Programme (MAP), based in South Africa is a faith-based organization that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention strategies based on the moral teachings of Islam. These activities include the promotion of abstinence from all sexual activity outside marriage; refraining from drug use, and instilling faithfulness within marriage. According to most Muslims, the key to combating to the HIV/AIDS epidemic is prevention. In their view, the Islamic position on morality, chastity and the sanctity of marriage needs to be shared with the world. Islam cites sex with multiple partners, sex outside marriage, other promiscuous sexual behaviors and homosexuality as immoral and as a result of this some Muslims consider this behavior the main cause of HIV/AIDS, believing that promoting abstinence, chastity, and intramarital sex is the key to ending or at least containing the epidemic.\n\nAs opposed to the Catholic Church and some other denominations or religions, today, there isn't any central Jewish religious authority that is acceptable by vast majority of religious Jews or by most Jewish religious movements.\n\nOrthodox Judaism links between immoral sexual behavior and AIDS. Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of England, a prominent figure in 20th century Jewish medical ethics maintains in his article \"Halachic Perspectives on AIDS\" that \"... from my reading of Jewish sources, it would appear that under no circumstances would we be justified in branding the incidence of the disease (...) as punishment ... we have not the vision, that would enable us to link, as an assertion of certainty, any form of human travail, grief, bereavement or suffering in general with shortcomings of a moral nature... It is one thing to speak of a consequence, and it is quite another thing to speak of a punishment ... if you warn a child not to play with fire, lest he gets burnt, and the child then gets burnt, then the burning may not be a punishment for not listening, but it certainly is a consequence. ... I think we should declare in very plain and explicit terms indicating that our society violated some of the norms of the Divine Law, and of the natural law, and that as a consequence we pay a price, and an exceedingly heavy price. This certainly is Jewish doctrine ...\"\n\nIn Jewish Orthodox society, having AIDS is considered a mark of disgrace. \n\nConservative and Reform Judaism emphasize the importance of \"bikur cholim\", the responsibility to care for the sick:\n\nMany Christian charities provide services for people living with HIV/AIDS. One example is the \"Drug Resources Enhancement against Aids and Malnutrition\" (DREAM), program promoted by the Christian Community of Sant'Egidio.\n\nJerry Falwell regularly linked the AIDS pandemic to LGBT issues and stated, \"AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals.\"\n\nHinduism has shown support for research aimed at curing HIV/AIDS, and care for those affected by HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe Catholic Church opposes condom use between heterosexual couples because it is an artificial form of contraception that does not rely on the functions of the body (and thus also God's will) itself as to whether a conception will occur or not, and the Church believes it also serves to implicitly and inexcusably encourage premarital and extramarital sexuality (and recourse to abortion if the condom fails).\n\nPope John Paul II strongly opposed the use of artificial birth control, and rejected the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV. Pope Benedict XVI stated in 2005 that condoms were not a sufficient solution to the AIDS crisis, but then in 2009 claimed that AIDS \"cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems.\" The Moscow Patriarchate gave support to Benedict XVI's position. In response to Benedict XVI's statements, the United Church of Christ issued a statement encouraging condom distribution at places of worship.\n\nOn November 20, 2010, when questioned about the rampant HIV spread in Africa, Pope Benedict XVI suggested that the use of condoms in male prostitution is not a moral solution to stopping AIDS, but could represent a first step in assuming moral responsibility \"in the intention of reducing the risk of infection.\" Vatican City clarifies, after Benedict's statement sows confusion, that the position of the Church on condoms has not changed. It is merely a statement that in homosexual relations, where unnatural contraception is not the main concern, condoms can be seen as moral responsibility in preventing HIV infections. On November 23, 2010, Benedict furthermore stated that the concept of condoms as a lesser evil in preventing HIV infections can be applied to women as well. The use of condoms is the first step in taking responsibility and attempting to prevent the infection of one's partner. The Pope does not say anything about condoms being acceptable as unnatural birth control, only as a responsible approach.\n\nIn Thailand, some Buddhist monks encourage the use of condoms for HIV prevention. As part of Mechai Viravaidya's pro-condom campaign, Buddhist monks have offered blessed condoms for couples.\n\nThe work of some Christian ministries has affected the treatment of AIDS. According to the African Health Policy Network, some churches in London claim that prayer will cure AIDS and the Hackney-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reports that several people have stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to a number of deaths. The Synagogue Church Of All Nations advertise an \"anointing water\" to promote God's healing, although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication, and US patent application 2001051133 similarly suggests that intravenous pure distilled water will eradicate HIV through the mercy of God. Other Christian churches actively distribute HIV/AIDS medication.\n"}
{"id": "206530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206530", "title": "Rule by decree", "text": "Rule by decree\n\nRule by decree is a style of governance allowing quick, unchallenged creation of law by a single person or group, and is used primarily by dictators, absolute monarchs and military leaders.\n\nThe expression is also sometimes used when describing actions of democratic governments that are perceived to unduly bypass parliamentarian or popular scrutiny.\n\nRule by decree allows the ruler to arbitrarily create law, without approval by a legislative assembly.\n\nWhen states of emergency such as martial law are in place, rule by decree is common. While rule by decree is easily susceptible to the whims and corruption of the person in power, it is also highly efficient: a law can take weeks or months to pass in a legislature, but can be created with the stroke of a pen by a leader ruling by decree. This is what makes it valuable in emergency situations. Thus, it is allowed by many constitutions, among which is the French Constitution, Argentine Constitution, Indian Constitution, etc.\n\nOne of the first examples of rule by decree was in the ancient Roman Republic when, after the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, his successor, Gaius Octavian (Augustus), general Mark Antony and succeeding pontifex maximus Aemilius Lepidus seized power in the Second Triumvirate, officially recognized by the senate by the Lex Titia decree. The resolution, which gave the three 'triumvirs' authoritarian powers for five years, was enacted and reinstated consecutive in 38 BC. It finally collapsed in 33/32 BC, after the downfall of Lepidus, leading to the Final war of the Roman Republic and the total collapse of republican government.\n\nThe most prominent example in history is the Reichstag Fire Decree. German President Paul von Hindenburg was convinced by Adolf Hitler to issue a decree suspending basic civil rights indefinitely. As a result of this decree, Nazi authorities were able to constitutionally suppress or imprison their opposition, which in turn paved the way for the one-party rule of the Third Reich. The ensuing state of exception, which suspended the Constitution without repealing it, lasted until the end of the Third Reich.\nSome democratic leaders, such as the presidents of Mexico, France and Argentina may rule by decree in national emergencies, subject to constitutional and other legal limitations. In the case of France this power has been used only once, by Charles de Gaulle in 1961 during the Algerian War.\n\nOther modern political concepts, such as the French decrees, Orders in Council in the British Commonwealth and American executive orders are partially based on this notion of decrees, although they are far more limited in scope and generally subject to judicial review.\n\nDuring the Indian Emergency from 1975 to 1977, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had laws passed that allowed her to rule by decree.\n\nIreland's Emergency Powers Act allows the government to rule by decrees called \"Emergency Powers Orders\" in any aspect of national life, if the parliament invokes the emergency clause in Article 28(3) of the Constitution. The Act however allows the lower house to void specific EPOs in a free vote or end the state of emergency at any time.\n\nFrom 23 September (given actual effect from 4 October after the armed disbanding of the Supreme Soviet) to 12 December 1993, rule by decree (ukases) was imposed in Russia by President Boris Yeltsin, during transition from the Russian Constitution of 1978 (which was modelled after the obsolete Soviet Constitution of 1977) to the current 1993 Constitution.\n\nVenezuelan President Hugo Chávez was granted executive power by the National Assembly to rule by decree multiple times throughout his tenure, passing hundreds of laws. Chávez ruled Venezuela by decree in 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Between 2004 and 2006 alone, Chávez declared 18 \"emergencies\" to rule by decree.\n\nChávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, has also ruled by decree multiple times since he was elected in April 2013. President Maduro has ruled Venezuela by decree for the majority of the period from 19 November 2013 through 2018.\n\nItalian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has claimed that there has been an explosion in the use of various types of decrees (decree-law, presidential decrees, executive orders, etc.) since World War I. According to him, this is the sign of a \"generalization of the state of exception\".\n\n"}
{"id": "22180428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22180428", "title": "Rémi Brague", "text": "Rémi Brague\n\nRémi Brague (born 8 September 1947) is a French historian of philosophy, specializing in the Arabic, Jewish, and Christian thought of the Middle Ages. He is professor emeritus of Arabic and religious philosophy at the Sorbonne, and Romano Guardini chair of philosophy (emeritus) at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\n\nEducated primarily at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, Brague began his career as a student of Greek philosophy, interpreted in a distinctly modern key: his doctoral thesis, later published as \"Aristote et la question du monde: Essai sur le contexte cosmologique et anthropologique de l'ontologie\" (1988), developed a phenomenological account of Aristotle's conception of the world. In particular, his goal was to write the book on Aristotle that Heidegger would have written, had he not written \"Being and Time.\" From there, he was led to study Hebrew, in order to read the Old Testament, and Arabic in order \"to read the Jewish philosopher Maimonides' \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" in its original language.\" Since then, most of his work has taken place at the intersection of the three Abrahamic religions, as they developed out of the ancient world, formed themselves in dialogue with one another, and eventually gave rise to modernity. He is the author of numerous books on classical and medieval intellectual history, religion, national identity, literature and law, and is perhaps best known in the English-speaking world for his book \"Europe, la voie romaine\" (1992), translated into English as \"Eccentric Culture: A Theory of Western Civilization\" (2009). His masterwork thus far is his trilogy on the philosophical development of law in the West, \"La Sagesse du monde: Histoire de l'expérience humaine de l'univers\" (1999), \"La Loi de Dieu. Histoire philosophique d’une alliance\" (2005), and \"Le Règne de l'homme: Genèse et échec du projet moderne\" (2015): the first two have been translated as \"The Wisdom of the World: The Human Experience of the Universe in Western Thought\" (2004) and \"The Law of God: The Philosophical History of an Idea\" (2007); the third is forthcoming under the title, \"The Kingdom of man: The Genesis and Failure of the Modern Project. \"\nWhile his intellectual influences are various, Brague has developed some of the chief points of his unique account of Western intellectual history in dialogue with the controversial political theorist Leo Strauss: Brague has said that \"Leo Strauss taught me that when reading a text, you must be open to the possibility that it contains different layers of meaning. All philosophical books written before the Enlightenment aim at both a wider audience and a small elite, able to understand the deeper meaning of the texts.\" This approach informed Brague's understanding of Maimonides and the medieval Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi, among others, but he declared himself unconvinced \"that it applies to the Greek philosophers\" in the way Strauss has taught. \"But Strauss became so convinced of his own way of interpreting texts, that he came to apply it to all sorts of books, even Cervantes\"' Don Quixote\". Strauss taught me to read very carefully. But I don't consider myself a Straussian, nor do the real Straussians consider me as one of them.\" Arguably, Brague's \"Roman\" view of Western Intellectual History (as enunciated in \"Eccentric Culture\") forms a kind of response to Strauss' famous emphasis on the centuries-long tension between Athens and Jerusalem: for Brague, we cannot understand this tension correctly without understanding the historic mediation of both Athens and Jerusalem through Rome. Likewise, Brague's account of Divine Law in the Western intellectual tradition (as presented in \"The Law of God\") reframes the relationship between faith and reason, the secular and the sacred, in response to Strauss' recurrent emphasis on \"the Theological-Political Problem.\"\nBrague is the recipient of numerous awards, including honors by both the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In 2009, he received both the Josef Pieper Prize and the Grand prix de philosophie de l'Académie française, and on Saturday, 28 September 2012, it was announced that Brague, along with Brian E. Daley, would be awarded the 2012 Ratzinger Prize for Theology. In 2013, he was named a Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la Légion d'honneur. \n\nBooks and Edited Volumes in French (and other languages):\n\nBooks in English:\n\nArticles in English:\n\n"}

Sorbière is regarded often by his position on ethics and disclosure about medical mistakes. In 1672 Sorbière considered the idea of being honest and upfront about a mistake having been made in medicine but thought that it might seriously jeopardise medical practice and concluded that it \"would not catch on\".\n\nAfter relocating to the Netherlands, he published a French translation of Thomas More's \"Utopia\" in 1643. He arranged for the publication of Hobbes's \"De Cive\" in Amsterdam in 1647, published a French translation in 1649, published a French translation of Hobbes' \"De Corpore Politico, or the Elements of Law\" in 1652, and helped secure a publisher for Hobbes's own Latin translation of \"Leviathan\" in 1668. His collected \"Lettres et discours de M. de Sorbière, sur diverses matières curieuses\", published in Paris, 1660, are imbued with the spirit of compromise, reconciling science and theology and separating science from metaphysics. His life of Gassendi was prefixed to the collected edition of Gassendi's writings, 1658. Besides Gassendi and Hobbes, he corresponded with Marin Mersenne, François de La Mothe Le Vayer and other prominent thinkers of the day.\n\nIn 1663-1664, Sorbière visited England, where in 1663 he was inducted into the Royal Society. In 1664 he published an account of his stay, \"Relation d’un voyage en Angleterre, où sont touchées plusieurs choses, qui regardent l’estat des sciences, et de la religion.\" (L. Billaine, Paris), in which he offered his comments on how bad the food was, how bad the inns were and imputed to the Royal Society the intention of developing a library. This provoked Thomas Sprat (then spokesman for and historian of the Society) to publish \"Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier's Voyage into England\" (London: 1665) as a reply to Sorbière's perceived insults against both English culture and the Society in particular. In order to avoid further international controversy, Sorbière was held under arrest for four months in France, and Charles II of England prohibited any further responses.\n\nSorbière's conversion from Calvinism to Catholicism, which opened a career to him, has been interpreted in a political light.\n"}
{"id": "2285219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285219", "title": "Symbols of leadership", "text": "Symbols of leadership\n\nLeadership cadres use symbols to reinforce their position power and provide a level of differentiation. Clothing frequently articulates rank or privilege, but accessories and external entities of varying functionality may also serve to mark out leaders - from finger rings to personal aircraft.\n\nPresidential symbols include many various insignia or other devices to denote a president's position. Some symbols follow accepted constitutional or diplomatic standards: flags, sashes, entrance Marches or a medallion or necklace. The use of the symbols mostly occurs for domestic purposes.\n\nExamples of such symbols include the American presidential march \"Hail to the Chief\", and the presidential sashes worn by the presidents of Latin America nations. More practical, semi-symbolic features also abound: bodyguards may lurk semi-overtly; a head of state may use a special aircraft (see for example Air Force One).\n\nEuropean presidents sometimes dress archaically for formal occasions. Such special clothing sets them apart - and may well militate against women aspiring to such high office when tradition expects them to wear (say) knee-breeches.\n\nRuling dynasties often exploit pomp and ceremony with the use of regalia: crowns, robes, orb and sceptres, some of which are reflections of formerly practical objects. The use of language mechanisms also support this differentiation with subjects talking of \"the crown\" and/or of \"the throne\" rather than referring directly to personal names and items.\n\nMonarchies provide the most explicit demonstration of tools to strengthen the elevation of leaders. Thrones sit high on daises leading to subjects lifting their gaze (if they have permission) to contemplate the ruler. Architecture in general can set leaders apart: note the symbolism inherent in the very name of the Chinese imperial Forbidden City.\n\nThe culture and legends about the ruling family may build on myths of divine-right and describe the ruler or the Son of Heaven.\n\nCourt ceremonial highlights symbolic distance between a royal/imperial leader and follower, in a hierarchical system which cultivates a social system and power network at whose centre is the monarch. Bowing and curtseying remain as examples of the self-abasement of hand-sucking, bowing and scraping, prostration, kowtowing and \"proskynesis\" formerly demanded.\n\nSometimes colour plays a special role in advertising monarchical status: thus the once very rare pink/maroon dye color became a symbol reserved for imperial clothing - see purple.\n\nArchaic touches often symbolically recall a glorious historical past: thus horse-drawn carriages replace everyday motor-vehicles for royal state occasions, and courtiers and flunkeys in elaborate dress grant a sense of ancient distance. And monarchs emphasize the remaining traces of their divine right to rule when undergoing anointing at the hands of the Church during coronation ceremonies.\n\nOverlapping with and/or emulating royalty, a ruling class or an aristocracy can devote much of its energy into \"keeping up appearances\" and emphasizing the purity of noble blood by apartness. Symbolism can aid this process cheaply. A coat-of-arms (perhaps in the form of a banner or on note-paper) or the wearing of a sword can incur less expense than maintaining a stately home. The visible presence of servants or slaves reminds underlings of social distance. Patronage, especially of fashion, provides one of the most symbolic attributes of social leaders or would-be leaders. Compare conspicuous consumption.\n\nApart from more elaborate uniform and their distinguishing marks (epaulettes, caps, medals), senior military officers may traditionally carry a baton or affect a similar substitute (such as a swagger stick or cane). Compare staff of office.\n\nBanners, pennants and guidons serve (or served in the past) to identify leaders as rallying-points or field command-posts. Traces of these continue on staff cars or on naval ships, for example: see broad pennant and compare the concept and origin of a flagship.\n\nReligious dignitaries often use vestments to emphasize the overall sacred nature of their organization. But some touches identify leaders and make them more imposing: a bishop's mitre, for example, a cardinal's red hat, a papal tiara or a papal ring. Less flamboyant faiths may use subtler symbolism to set religious leadership, holiness or saintliness apart: the understated dark vestments of the Protestant clergyman, the relatively unobtrusive clerical collar, or even the nakedness of a stereotypical Hindu ascetic fakir.\n\nOwnership of a harem has both practical and symbolic uses for leaders in traditional polygamous societies: harems spread genes and symbolically demonstrate wealth and status. Within such harems whole systems of symbolism may develop: the use of exclusive and inaccessible apartness, veiling, and the employment of eunuchs. Cultures which practise serial monogamy feature harem-analogous symbolism in the flaunting of trophy wives.\n\nItems such as codpieces may suggest the assumed superiority of one gender-role over another: or symbolic leadership (implied by implied potency) within patriarchal structures. A slightly less extreme example, but one more common in modern times, expresses power relationships (and thus leadership symbolism) through the use of the phrase \"wearing the trousers\".\n\nAncient Egyptian pharaohs used a stylised artificial labdanum-soaked goats-hair beard as one of the regalia of rulership: a clear case of associating a male attribute with leadership.\n\nThe suit continues to mark out the managerial class (which pretends to leadership functions) as a whole from ordinary blue-collar or non-suited workers. Suits stand at the apex of a system of dress code details: international standard business attire, with largely symbolic associations; see for example:\n\nAt the top levels of a bureaucratic organisation, senior leaders often attempt to merge the practical with the symbolic, making the perks of office appear functional: they may claim larger cars, smaller computers, an entrance guarded by a (non-digital) personal assistant, a large but uncluttered desk and (especially) a \"corner office\" with an aesthetically uplifting view.\n"}
{"id": "4174355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4174355", "title": "The Symbolic", "text": "The Symbolic\n\nThe Symbolic (or Symbolic Order) is a part of the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan, part of his attempt \"to distinguish between those elementary registers whose grounding I later put forward in these terms: the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real — a distinction never previously made in psychoanalysis\".\n\nLacan's early work was centred on an exploration of the Imaginary, of those \"specific images, which we refer to by the ancient term of \"imago\". ... it set out from their formative function in the subject\". Therefore \"[t]he notion of the \"symbolic came to the forefront in the Rome Report [1953] ... henceforth it is the symbolic, not the imaginary, that is seen to be the determining order of the subject\".\n\nLacan's concept of the symbolic \"owes much to a key event in the rise of structuralism ... the publication of Claude Lévi-Strauss's \"Elementary Structures of Kinship\" in 1949. ... In many ways, the symbolic is for Lacan an equivalent to Lévi-Strauss's order of culture\": a language-mediated order of culture. \"Man speaks, then, but it is because the symbol has made him man ... superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of a nature\". Accepting then that \"language is the basic social institution in the sense that all others presuppose language\", Lacan found in Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistic division of the verbal sign between signifier and signified a new key to the Freudian understanding that \"his therapeutic method was 'a talking cure'\".\n\nFor a decade or so after the Rome Report, Lacan found in the concept of the symbolic an answer to the neurotic problematic of the imaginary: \"It is the task of symbolism to forbid imaginary capture ... supremacy of the symbolic over the imaginary ... supremacy of the symbolic over the real\". Accepting through Lévi-Strauss the anthropological premise that \"man is indeed an 'animal symbolicum'\", and that \"the self-illumination of society through symbols is an essential part of social reality\", Lacan made the leap to seeing \"the Oedipus complex - in so far as we continue to recognise it as covering the whole field of our experience with its signification\" - as the point whereby the weight of social reality was mediated to the developing child by the (symbolic) father: \"It is in the \"name of the Father\" that we must recognize the support of the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified his person with the figure of the law\".\n\nThe imaginary now came to be seen increasingly as belonging to the earlier, closed realm of the dual relationship of mother and child — \"Melanie Klein describes the relation to the mother as a mirrored relationship ... [neglecting] the third term, the father\" — to be broken up and opened to the wider symbolic order.\n\nLacan's shorthand for that wider world was the Other — \"the big other, that is, the other of language, the Names-of-the-Father, signifiers or words [which] ... are public, communal property\". But though it is an essentially linguistic dimension, Lacan does not simply equate the symbolic with language, since the latter is involved also in the Imaginary and the Real. The symbolic dimension of language is that of the signifier, in which elements have no positive existence but are constituted by virtue of their mutual differences.\n\nThe unconscious is the discourse of the Other and thus belongs to the symbolic order. It is also the realm of the Law that regulates desire in the Oedipus complex, and is determinant of subjectivity. \"The unconscious is the sum of the effects of speech on a subject, at the level at which the subject constitutes himself out of the effects of the signifier ... we depend on the field of the Other, which was there long before we came into the world, and whose circulating structures determine us as subjects\" on the symbolic order.\n\nWith the Sixties, the early rush of expectations associated with the concept of the symbolic order had begun to fade, and the symbolic was increasingly seen as \"part\" of the human condition, rather than as a therapeutic cure-all. Lacan's critical attention began to shift instead to the concept of the Real, seen as \"that over which the symbolic stumbles ... that which is lacking in the symbolic order, the ineliminable residue of all articulation ... the umbilical cord of the symbolic\".\n\nBy the turn of the decade, \"(1968–71) Lacan gradually came to dismiss the Oedipus ... as 'Freud's dream'\" — despite his own earlier warning of the dangers if \"one wishes to ignore the symbolic articulation that Freud discovered at the same time as the unconscious ... his methodical reference to the Oedipus complex\".\n\nWhether his development of the concept of \"jouissance\", or 'the \"identification with the \"sinthome\"\" (as the naming of one's Real) advocated in Lacan's last works as the aim of psychoanalysis', will in time prove as fruitful as that of the symbolic order perhaps remains to be seen. Part of Lacan's enduring legacy will surely however remain bound up with the triumphal exploration of the symbolic order that was the Rome Report: \"Symbols in fact envelop the life of man in a network so total that they join together ... the shape of his destiny\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30994", "title": "Theravada", "text": "Theravada\n\nTheravāda (; Pāli, lit. \"School of the Elders\") is the most ancient branch of Buddhism still extant today, and the one that preserved their version of the teachings of Gautama Buddha in the Pāli Canon. The Pāli Canon is the only complete Buddhist canon which survives in a classical Indian language, Pāli, which serves as both sacred language and lingua franca of Theravāda Buddhism. For more than a millennium, Theravāda has focused on preserving the \"dhamma\", and it tends to be very conservative with regard to matters of doctrine and monastic discipline. Since the 19th century, meditation practice has been re-introduced, and has become popular with a lay audience, both in traditional Theravada countries and in the west. \n\nAs a distinct school of early Buddhism, Theravāda Buddhism developed in Sri Lanka and subsequently spread to the rest of Southeast Asia. It is the dominant form of religion in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is practiced by minority groups in India, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, and Vietnam. In addition, the diaspora of all of these groups as well as converts around the world practice Theravāda Buddhism. Contemporary expressions include Buddhist modernism, the Vipassana movement, and the Thai Forest Tradition.\n\nThe name Theravāda comes from the ancestral Sthāvirīya, one of the early Buddhist schools, from which the Theravadins claim descent. The Sthavira nikāya arose during the first schism in the Buddhist sangha, due to their desire to add new Vinaya rules, against the wishes of the majority Mahāsāṃghika group who disagreed with this. According to its own accounts, the Theravāda school is fundamentally derived from the Vibhajjavāda \"doctrine of analysis\" grouping, which was a division of the Sthāvirīya.\n\nAccording to Damien Keown, there is no historical evidence that the Theravāda school arose until around two centuries after the Great Schism which occurred at the Third Council. Theravadin accounts of its own origins mention that it received the teachings that were agreed upon during the putative Third Buddhist council under the patronage of the Indian Emperor Ashoka around 250 BCE. These teachings were known as the Vibhajjavāda. Emperor Ashoka is supposed to have assisted in purifying the sangha by expelling monks who failed to agree to the terms of Third Council. The elder monk Moggaliputta-Tissa was at the head of the Third council and compiled the Kathavatthu (\"Points of Controversy\"), a refutation of various opposing views which is an important work in the Theravada Abhidhamma.\n\nLater, the Vibhajjavādins in turn is said to have split into four groups: the Mahīśāsaka, Kāśyapīya, Dharmaguptaka in the north, and the Tāmraparṇīya in South India. The Tambapaṇṇiya (later Mahāvihāravāsins), were established in Sri Lanka (at Anuradhapura) but active also in Andhra and other parts of South India (Vanavasa in modern Karnataka) and later across South-East Asia. Inscriptional evidence of this school has been found in Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda. According to Buddhist scholar A. K. Warder, the Theravāda.\n\nThe Theravāda is said to be descended from the Tāmraparṇīya sect, which means \"the Sri Lankan lineage\". Missionaries sent abroad from India are said to have included Ashoka's son Mahinda (who studied under Moggaliputta-Tissa) and his daughter Sanghamitta, and they were the mythical founders of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, a story which scholars suggest helps to legitimize Theravāda's claims of being the oldest and most authentic school. According to the Mahavamsa chronicle their arrival in Sri Lanka is said to have been during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura (307–267 BCE) who converted to Buddhism and helped build the first Buddhist stupas. According to S. D. Bandaranayake:\n\nThe first records of Buddha images come from the reign of king Vasabha (65–109 BCE), and after the 3rd century AD the historical record shows a growth of the worship of Buddha images as well as Bodhisattvas. In the 7th century, the Chinese pilgrim monks Xuanzang and Yijing refer to the Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka as \"Shàngzuòbù\" (), corresponding to the Sanskrit Sthavira nikāya and Pali \"Thera Nikāya\". Yijing writes, \"In Sri Lanka the Sthavira school alone flourishes; the Mahasanghikas are expelled\".\n\nThe school has been using the name \"Theravāda\" for itself in a written form since at least the 4th century, about one thousand years after the Buddha's death, when the term appears in the \"Dīpavaṁsa\".\n\nBetween the reigns of Sena I (833–853) and Mahinda IV (956–972), the city of Anuradhapura saw a \"colossal building effort\" by various kings during a long period of peace and prosperity, the great part of the present architectural remains in this city date from this period.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Buddhist Sangha initially preserved the Buddhist scriptures (the Tipitaka) orally as it had been traditionally done, however during the first century BCE, famine and wars led to the writing down of these scriptures. The Sri Lankan chronicle The Mahavamsa records: \"Formerly clever monks preserved the text of the Canon and its commentaries orally, but then, when they saw the disastrous state of living beings, they came together and had it written down in books, that the doctrine might long survive.\"\n\nAccording to Richard Gombrich this is \"the earliest record we have of Buddhist scriptures being committed to writing anywhere\". The Theravada Pali texts which have survived (with only a few exceptions) are derived from the Mahavihara (monastic complex) of Anuradhapura, the ancient Sri Lankan capital.\n\nLater developments included the formation and recording of the Theravada commentary literature (Atthakatha). The Theravada tradition records that even during the early days of Mahinda, there was already a tradition of Indian commentaries on the scriptures. Prior to the writing of the classic Theravada Pali commentaries, there were also various commentaries on the Tipitaka written in the Sinhalese language, such as the Maha-atthakatha (\"Great commentary\"), the main commentary tradition of the Mahavihara monks.\n\nOf great importance to the commentary tradition is the work of the great Theravada scholastic Buddhaghosa (4th–5th century CE), who is responsible for most of the Theravada commentarial literature that has survived (any older commentaries have been lost). Buddhaghosa wrote in Pali, and after him, most Sri Lankan Buddhist scholastics did as well. This allowed the Sri Lankan tradition to become more international through a lingua franca so as to converse with monks in India and later Southeast Asia.\n\nTheravada monks also produced other Pali literature such as historical chronicles (e.g. Mahavamsa), hagiographies, practice manuals, summaries, textbooks, poetry and Abhidhamma works such as the \"Abhidhammattha-sangaha\" and the \"Abhidhammavatara\". Buddhaghosa's work on Abhidhamma and Buddhist practice outlined in works such as the \"Visuddhimagga\" and the \"Atthasalini\" are the most influential texts apart from the Pali Canon in the Theravada tradition. Other Theravada Pali commentators and writers include Dhammapala and Buddhadatta. Dhammapala wrote commentaries on the Pali Canon texts which Buddhaghosa had omitted and also wrote a commentary called the \"Paramathamanjusa\" on Buddhaghosa's \"Visuddhimagga\".\n\nOver much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, there were three subdivisions of Theravāda, consisting of the monks of the Mahāvihāra, Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavana, each of which were based in Anuradhapura. The Mahāvihāra was the first tradition to be established, while Abhayagiri Vihāra and Jetavana Vihāra were established by monks who had broken away from the Mahāvihāra tradition. According to A. K. Warder, the Indian Mahīśāsaka sect also established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravāda, into which they were later absorbed. Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.\n\nWhen the Chinese monk Faxian visited the island in the early 5th century, he noted 5000 monks at Abhayagiri, 3000 at the Mahāvihāra, and 2000 at the Cetiyapabbatavihāra.\n\nThe Mahavihara (\"Great Monastery\") school became dominant in Sri Lanka at the beginning of the 2nd millennium CE and gradually spread through mainland Southeast Asia. It was established in Myanmar in the late 11th century, in Thailand in the 13th and early 14th centuries, and in Cambodia and Laos by the end of the 14th century. Although Mahavihara never completely replaced other schools in Southeast Asia, it received special favor at most royal courts. This is due to the support it received from local elites, who exerted a very strong religious and social influence.\n\nOver the centuries, the Abhayagiri Theravādins maintained close relations with Indian Buddhists and adopted many new teachings from India. including many elements from Mahāyāna teachings, while the Jetavana Theravādins adopted Mahāyāna to a lesser extent. Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravāda in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the \"Mahāyāna Sthaviras\", and the Mahāvihāra tradition as the \"Hīnayāna Sthaviras\". Xuanzang also wrote that the Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna as heretical, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study \"both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna\".\n\nAbhayagiri was an influential university and center for the study of Mahayana from the reign of Gajabahu I until the 12th century. It saw various important Buddhist scholars working in Sanskrit and Pali. These include Upatissa (who wrote the \"Vimuttimagga\"), Kavicakravarti Ananda (authored the \"Saddhammopåyana\"), Aryadeva, Aryasura, and the tantric masters Jayabhadra, and Candramåli.\n\nAkira Hirakawa notes that the surviving Pāli commentaries (\"\") of the Mahāvihāra school, when examined closely, also include a number of positions that agree with Mahāyāna teachings. Kalupahana notes the same for the \"Visuddhimagga\", the most important Theravāda commentary.\n\nIt is known that in the 8th century, both Mahāyāna and the esoteric Vajrayāna form of Buddhism were being practised in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Esoteric Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time. Abhayagiri Vihāra appears to have been a center for Theravadin Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna teachings.\n\nThe trend of the Abhayagiri Vihara being a dominant sect changed in the 12th century, when the Mahāvihāra sect gained the political support of Parakramabahu I (1153–1186), who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanin traditions. The Theravāda monks of these two traditions were defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently, or attempting reordination under the Mahāvihāra tradition as \"novices\" (\"\"). Richard Gombrich writes:\n\nIt seems that part of the reason for these radical moves was that Parakramabahu I saw the Sangha as being divided, corrupt and in need of reform, especially the Abhayagiri. The \"\" laments that at this time Theravada monks had \"turned away in their demeanor from one another and took delight in all kinds of strife\". This chronicle also claims that many monks in the Sri Lankan Sangha had even begun to marry and have children, behaving more like lay followers than monastics. Parākramabāhu's chief monastic leader in these reforms was Mahathera Kassapa, an experienced monk well versed in the Scriptures and the Monastic discipline. \n\nParakramabahu I is also known for rebuilding the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, restoring Buddhist stupas and Viharas (monasteries). He appointed a Sangharaja, or \"King of the Sangha\", a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka, assisted by two deputies. The reign of Parakkamabāhu also saw a flowering of Theravada scholasticism with the work of prominent Sri Lankan scholars such as Anuruddha, Sāriputta Thera, Mahākassapa Thera of Dimbulagala Vihara and Moggallana Thera. They worked on compiling of subcommentaries on the Tipitaka, texts on grammar, summaries and textbooks on Abhidhamma and Vinaya such as the influential Abhidhammattha-sangaha of Anuruddha.\n\nAccording to the \"Mahavamsa\", a Sri Lankan chronicle, after the conclusion of the Third Buddhist council, a mission was sent to Suvarnabhumi, led by two monks, Sona and Uttara. Scholarly opinions differ as to where exactly this land of Suvarnabhumi was located, but it is generally believed to have been located somewhere in the area of Lower Burma, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, or Sumatra. Before the 12th century, the areas of Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia were dominated by Buddhist sects from India, and included the teachings of Mahāyāna Buddhism. In the 7th century, Yijing noted in his travels that in these areas, all major sects of Indian Buddhism flourished.\n\nThough there are some early accounts that have been interpreted as Theravāda in Myanmar, the surviving records show that most Burmese Buddhism incorporated Mahāyāna, and used Sanskrit rather than Pali. After the decline of Buddhism in India, missions of monks from Sri Lanka gradually converted Burmese Buddhism to Theravāda, and in the next two centuries also brought Theravāda Buddhism to the areas of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, where it supplanted previous forms of Buddhism.\n\nThe Mon and Pyu were among the earliest people to inhabit Myanmar. The oldest surviving Buddhist texts in the Pali language come from Pyu city-state of Sri Ksetra, the text which is dated from the mid 5th to mid 6th century is written on twenty-leaf manuscript of solid gold. Peter Skilling concludes that there is firm evidence for the dominant presence of Theravada in \"the Irrawaddy and Chao Phraya basins, from about the 5th century CE onwards\", though he adds that evidence shows that Mahayana was also present.\n\nThe Burmese slowly became Theravādin as they came into contact and conquered the Pyu and Mon civilizations. This began in the 11th century during the reign of the Bamar king Anawrahta (1044–1077) of the Pagan Kingdom who acquired the Pali scriptures in a war against the Mon as well as from Sri Lanka and build stupas and monasteries at his capital of Bagan. Various invasions of Burma by neighboring states and the Mongol invasions of Burma (13th century) damaged the Burmese sangha and Theravada had to be reintroduced several times into the country from Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\nThe Khmer Empire (802–1431) centered in Cambodia was initially dominated by Hinduism; Hindu ceremonies and rituals were performed by Brahmins, usually only held among ruling elites of the king's family, nobles, and the ruling class. Tantric Mahayana Buddhism was also a prominent faith, promoted by Buddhist emperors such as Jayavarman VII (1181–1215) who rejected the Hindu gods and presented himself as a Bodhisattva King.\n\nDuring his reign, King Jayavarman VII (c. 1181–1218) sent his son Tamalinda to Sri Lanka to be ordained as a Buddhist monk and study Theravada Buddhism according to the Pali scriptural traditions in the Mahavihara monastery. Tamalinda then returned to Cambodia and promoted Buddhist traditions according to the Theravada training he had received, galvanizing and energizing the long-standing Theravada presence that had existed throughout the Angkor empire for centuries. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Theravada monks from Sri Lanka continued introducing orthodox Theravada Buddhism which eventually became the dominant faith among all classes. The monasteries replaced the local priestly classes, becoming centers of religion, education, culture and social service for Cambodian villages. This change in Cambodian Buddhism led to high levels of literacy among Cambodians.\n\nIn Thailand, Theravada existed alongside Mahayana and other religious sects before the rise of Sukhothai Kingdom. During the reign of King Ram Khamhaeng (c. 1237/1247 – 1298) Theravada was made the main state religion and promoted by the king as the orthodox form of Thai Buddhism.\n\nDespite its success in Southeast Asia, Theravāda Buddhism in China has generally been limited to areas bordering Theravāda countries.\n\nDuring the pre-modern era, Southeast Asian Buddhism included numerous elements which could be called tantric and esoteric (such as the use of mantras and yantras in elaborate rituals). The French scholar François Bizot has called this \"Tantric Theravada\", and his textual studies show that it was a major tradition in Cambodia and Thailand. Some of these practices are still prevalent in Cambodia and Laos today.\n\nLater Theravada textual materials show new and somewhat unorthodox developments in theory and practice. These developments include what has been called the \"Yogāvacara tradition\" associated with the Sinhalese Yogāvacara's manual (c. 16th to 17th centuries) and also Esoteric Theravada also known as \"Borān kammaṭṭhāna\" ('ancient practices'). These traditions include new practices and ideas which are not included in classical orthodox Theravada works like the Visuddhimagga, such as the use of mantras (such as \"Araham\"), the practice of magical formulas, complex rituals and complex visualization exercises. These practices were particularly prominent in the Siam Nikaya before the modernist reforms of King Rama IV (1851–1868) as well as in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the 19th century began a process of mutual influence of both Asian Buddhists and Hinduists, and a Western audience interested in ancient wisdom. Theravada was also influenced by this process, which lead to Buddhist modernism; especially Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott, founders of the Theosophical Society, had a profound role in this process in Sri Lanka. Simultaneously, \"vipassana\"-meditation was re-invented, and in Theravāda countries a lay vipassana practice developed. This took a high flight in East Asia from the 1950s onwards with the \"vipassana\"-movement, and from the 1970s also in the west, with western students who popularized \"vipassana\"-meditation in the west, giving way to the development and popularisation of mindfulness-practice.\n\nBuddhist revivalism has also reacted against changes in Buddhism caused by colonialist regimes. Western colonialists and Christian missionaries deliberately imposed a particular type of Christian monasticism on Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka and colonies in Southeast Asia, restricting monks' activities to individual purification and temple ministries. Prior to British colonial control, monks in both Sri Lanka and Burma had been responsible for the education of the children of lay people, and had produced large bodies of literature. After the British takeover, Buddhist temples were strictly administered and were only permitted to use their funds on strictly religious activities. Christian ministers were given control of the education system and their pay became state funding for missions.\n\nForeign, especially British, rule had an enervating effect on the Sangha. According to Walpola Rahula, Christian missionaries displaced and appropriated the educational, social, and welfare activities of the monks, and inculcated a permanent shift in views regarding the proper position of monks in society through their institutional influence upon the elite. Many monks in post-colonial times have dedicated themselves to undoing these changes. Movements intending to restore Buddhism's place in society have developed in both Sri Lanka and Myanmar.\n\nOne consequence of the reaction against Western colonialism has been a modernization of Theravāda Buddhism: Western elements have been incorporated, and meditation practice has opened to a lay audience. Modernized forms of Theravādan practice have spread to the West.\n\nIn Sri Lanka Theravadins were looking at Western culture to find means to revitalize their own tradition. Christian missionaries were threatening the indigenous culture. As a reaction to this, Theravadins became active in spreading Buddhism and debating Christians. They were aided by the Theosophical Society, who were dedicated to the search for wisdom within ancient sources. Anagarika Dharmapala was one of the Theravāda leaders with whom the Theosophists sided. Dharmapala reached out to the middle classes, offering them religious practice and a religious identity, which were used to withstand the British imperialists. As a result of Dharmapala's efforts, lay practitioners started to practise meditation and study Buddhism, which had been reserved specifically for the monks.\n\nThe translation and publication of the Pāli Canon by the Pali Text Society made the Pali Canon better available to a lay audience, not only in the West, but also in the East. Western lay interest in Theravāda Buddhism was promoted by the Theosophical Society, and endured until the beginning of the 20th century. During the 1970s interest rose again, leading to a surge of Westerners searching for enlightenment, and the republishing of the Pāli Canon, first in print, and later on the internet.\n\nAn influential modernist figure in Myanmar Buddhism was king Mindon Min (1808–1878). He promoted the Fifth Buddhist council (1871) and inscribed the Pali canon into marble slabs, creating the world's largest book in 1868. During his reign, various reformist sects came into being such as the Dwaya and the Shwegyin, who advocated a stricter monastic conduct than the mainstream Thudhamma tradition. During colonial Burma, there were constant tensions between Christian missionaries and Buddhist monks (which included one of the first Western convert monks, U Dhammaloka). After independence, Myanmar was also the place for the Sixth Buddhist council (Vesak 1954 to Vesak 1956) which was attended by monks from eight Theravada nations to recite the Pali Canon. The Council synthesized a new redaction of the Pali texts ultimately transcribed into several native scripts. In Myanmar, this \"Chaṭṭha Saṅgīti Piṭaka\" (Sixth council Pitaka) was published by the government in 40 volumes.\n\nModern vipassanā meditation practice was re-invented in Myanmar in the 19th century. The \"New Burmese method\" was developed by U Nārada and popularized by his student Mahasi Sayadaw and Nyanaponika Thera. Another prominent teacher is Bhikkhu Bodhi, a student of Nyanaponika. The New Burmese Method strongly emphasizes vipassanā over samatha. It is regarded by traditionalists as a simplification of traditional Buddhist meditation techniques, suitable not only for monks but also for lay practitioners. The method has been popularized in the West by teachers of the vipassana movement such as Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Tara Brach, Gil Fronsdal and Sharon Salzberg.\n\nThe Ledi lineage begins with Ledi Sayadaw. S. N. Goenka is a well-known teacher in the Ledi-lineage. According to S. N. Goenka, vipassana techniques are essentially nonsectarian in character, and have universal application. Meditation centers teaching the vipassanā popularized by S. N. Goenka exist now in India, Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, Middle East and Africa.\n\nWith the coming to power in 1851 of King Mongkut, who had been a monk himself for twenty-seven years, the sangha, like the kingdom, became steadily more centralized and hierarchical, and its links to the state more institutionalized. Mongkut was a distinguished scholar of Pali Buddhist scripture. Moreover, at that time the immigration of numbers of monks from Burma was introducing the more rigorous discipline characteristic of the Mon sangha. Influenced by the Mon and guided by his own understanding of the Tipitaka, Mongkut began a reform movement that later became the basis for the Dhammayuttika Nikaya. Mongkut advocated a stricter adherence to the Vinaya (monastic discipline). He also emphasized study of the scriptures, and rationalism. His son King Chulalongkorn created a national structure for Buddhist monastics and established a nationwide system of monastic education. \n\nIn the early 1900s, Thailand's Ajahn Sao Kantasīlo and his student, Mun Bhuridatta, led the Thai Forest Tradition revival movement. In the 20th century notable practitioners included Ajahn Thate, Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah. It was later spread globally by Ajahn Mun's students including Ajahn Thate, Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah and several Western disciples, among whom the most senior is \"Luang Por\" Ajahn Sumedho.\n\nModern Buddhism in Cambodia was strongly influenced by Thai Buddhism. The Dhammayuttika Nikaya was introduced into the country during the reign of King Norodom (1834–1904) and benefited from royal patronage. The rule of the Khmer Rouge effectively destroyed Cambodia's Buddhist institutions by disrobing and killing monks and destroying temples. After the end of the regime the Sangha was re-established. An important figure of modern Cambodian Theravada is Maha Ghosananda who promoted a form of engaged Buddhism to effect social change.\n\nThe following modern trends or movements have been identified.\n\nAccording to Kate Crosby, for Theravada, the Pali Canon is \"the highest authority on what constitutes the Dhamma (the truth or teaching of the Buddha) and the organization of the Sangha (the community of monks and nuns).\" \n\nThe Sutta and Vinaya portion of the Tipitaka shows considerable overlap in content to the Agamas, the parallel collections used by non-Theravāda schools in India which are preserved in Chinese and partially in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Tibetan, and the various non-Theravāda Vinayas. On this basis, both these sets of texts are generally believed to be the oldest and most authoritative texts on pre-sectarian Buddhism by scholars. It is also believed that much of the Pali Canon, which is still used by Theravāda communities, was transmitted to Sri Lanka during the reign of Ashoka. After being orally transmitted (as was the custom in those days for religious texts) for some centuries, were finally committed to writing in the last century BCE, at what the Theravāda usually reckons as the fourth council, in Sri Lanka. Theravāda is one of the first Buddhist schools to commit the whole complete set of its Buddhist canon into writing.\n\nMuch of the material in the Canon is not specifically \"Theravādan\", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey: The Theravādans, then, may have \"added\" texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period.\n\nThe Pali Tipitaka consists of three parts: the Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Of these, the Abhidhamma Pitaka is believed to be a later addition to the first two pitakas, which, in the opinion of many scholars, were the only two pitakas at the time of the First Buddhist Council. The Pali Abhidhamma was not recognized outside the Theravāda school.\n\nThe Tipitaka is composed of 45 volumes in the Thai edition, 40 in the Burmese and 58 in the Sinhalese, and a full set of the Tipitaka is usually kept in its own (medium-sized) cupboard.\n\nAccording to Kate Crosby:Since much Sutta material overlaps with that found in the Sūtra collections of other Buddhist traditions, it is the Vinaya (monastic discipline) and Abhidhamma that are the most distinctive formal aspects of Theravada Buddhism, unique to Theravada.The Vibhajjavāda school (‘the analysts’), the branch of the Sthāvira school from which Theravāda is derived, differed from other early Buddhist schools on a variety of teachings. The differences resulted from the systematization of the Buddhist teachings, which was preserved in the Abhidharmas of the various schools. The unique doctrinal positions of the Theravāda school are expounded in what is known as the Abhidhamma-piṭaka, as well as in the later Pali commentaries (\"Aṭṭha-kathā\") and sub-commentaries (\"ṭīkā\"). Because of the size of this canonical and commentarial literature the Pali tradition developed a tradition of handbooks and doctrinal summaries, the most influential of which are the \"Visuddhimagga\" and the \"Abhidhammaṭṭhasaṅgaha.\" \n\nThe Pali Abhidhamma is \"a restatement of the doctrine of the Buddha in strictly formalized language ... assumed to constitute a consistent system of philosophy\". Its aim is not the empirical verification of the Buddhist teachings, but \"to set forth the correct interpretation of the Buddha's statements in the \"Sutra\" to restate his 'system' with perfect accuracy\". Because Abhidhamma focuses on analyzing the internal lived experience of beings and the intentional structure of consciousness, the system has often been compared to a kind of phenomenological psychology by numerous scholars such as Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi and Alexander Piatigorsky. \n\nThe Theravāda school has traditionally held the doctrinal position that the canonical Abhidhamma Pitaka was actually taught by the Buddha himself. Modern scholarship in contrast, has generally held that the Abhidhamma texts date from the 3rd century BCE. However some scholars, such as Frauwallner, also hold that the early Abhidhamma texts developed out of exegetical and catechetical work which made use of doctrinal lists which can be seen in the suttas, called \"matikas.\" \n\nIn the 4th or 5th century Buddhaghosa Thera, wrote the first Pali commentaries to much of the Tipitaka (which were based on much older manuscripts, mostly in old Sinhalese), including commentaries on the Nikayas and his commentary on the Vinaya, the \"Samantapāsādikā\". Buddhaghosa wrote as part of the Mahavihara tradition in Sri Lanka, a tradition which came to dominate the island and all of Theravāda after the 12th century.\n\nAfter him many other monks wrote various texts which have become part of the Theravāda heritage. These texts do not have the same authority as the Tipitaka does, though Buddhaghosas \"Visuddhimagga\" is a cornerstone of the commentarial tradition.\n\nAnother important genre of Theravāda literature are shorter handbooks and summaries which serve as introductions and study guides for the larger commentarial works. Two of the more influential summaries are Sariputta Thera's \"Pālimuttakavinayavinicchayasaṅgaha,\" a summary of Buddhaghosa's Vinaya commentary and Anuruddha's \"Abhidhammaṭṭhasaṅgaha\" (Manual of Abhidhamma). \n\nFor many Theravāda Buddhists, the Pali texts and language are symbolically and ritually important, however most people are likely to access Buddhist teachings though vernacular literature, oral teachings, sermons, art and performance as well as films and internet media. According to Kate Crosby, \"there is a far greater volume of Theravada literature in vernacular languages than in Pali.\"\n\nAn important genre of Theravāda literature, in both Pali and vernacular languages are the Jataka tales, stories of the Buddha's past lives. They are very popular among all classes and are rendered in a wide variety of media formats, from cartoons to high literature. The Vessantara Jātaka is one of the most popular of these.\n\nTheravāda Buddhists consider much of what is found in the Chinese and Tibetan Mahāyāna scriptural collections to be apocryphal, meaning that they are not authentic words of the Buddha.\n\nTheravāda traditionally promotes itself as the Vibhajjavāda \"teaching of analysis\". This doctrine says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, application of knowledge, and critical reasoning. However, the scriptures of the Theravadin tradition also emphasize heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. Yet, in its actual praxis, according to Braun, \"the majority of Theravadins and dedicated Buddhists of other traditions, including monks and nuns, have focused on cultivating moral behavior, preserving the Buddha’s teachings (dharma), and acquiring the good karma that comes from generous giving.\" \n\nThe core of Theravāda doctrine is contained in the Pali Canon, the only complete collection of Early Buddhist texts surviving in a classical Indic language. These ideas are shared by other Early Buddhist schools as well as by Mahayana traditions. They include central concepts such as:\n\n\nIn the Pali Nikayas, the Buddha teaches through a method in which experience is explained using various conceptual groupings of physical and mental processes, which are called dhammas. Examples of lists of dhammas taught by the Buddha include the twelve sense 'spheres' or ayatanas, the five aggregates or khanda and the eighteen elements of cognition or dhatus. \n\nExpanding this model, the Pali Abhidhamma concerned itself with analyzing \"ultimate truth\" (\"paramattha-sacca\") which it sees as being composed of \"all possible\" dhammas and their relationships. The central theory of the Pali Abhidhamma is thus known as the \"Dhamma theory\". \n\n\"Dhamma\" has been translated as \"factors\" (Collett Cox), \"psychic characteristics\" (Bronkhorst), \"psycho-physical events\" (Noa Ronkin) and \"phenomena\" (Nyanaponika Thera). Dhammas are defined by the Theravada commentary, the Atthasalini, as:\nDhammas bear their own particular natures (\"sabhāva\"). Alternatively, dhammas are borne by conditions, or according to particular natures.\n\nAccording to Y. Karunadasa, a dhamma, which can be translated as \"a 'principle' or 'element' (\"dharma\")\", is \"those items that result when the process of analysis is taken to its ultimate limits\". However, this does not mean that they have an independent existence, for it is \"only for the purposes of description\" that they are postulated. Noa Ronkin defines dhammas as \"the constituents of sentient experience; the irreducible ‘building blocks’ that make up one’s world, albeit they are not static mental contents and certainly not substances.\" Noa Ronkin also argues that there was gradual shift from the early canonical texts which tended to explain experience in terms of changing processes, to the Abhidhamma tradition which analyzed these processes into distinct mental events. \n\nDhammas are not permanent, discrete and separate entities, they are always in dependently conditioned relationships with other dhammas and always changing, arising and vanishing. It is thus only for the sake of description that they are said to have their \"own nature\" (\"sabhāva\"). Alternatively, Theravāda commentaries sometimes equate the two terms, such as the Visuddhimagga which states that ‘dhamma means sabhava’. According to Peter Harvey, the Theravāda view of a dhamma's \"sabhāva\" is that it refers to an individualizing characteristic (\"salakkhana\") that \"is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma\". Noa Ronkin argues that in Theravāda Abhidhamma, \"\"sabhava\" is predominantly used for the sake of determining the dhammas’ individuality, not their existential status\". Ronkin also adds:the concept of sabhava attests to the Theravadins’ interest in unveiling the nature of conscious experience: this, they presumed, could be carried out by enumerating the possible types of those events constituting one’s experience and by individuating them. To individuate the dhammas the Abhidhammikas had to provide a method for determining what any given dhammic instance of every possible event-type is and what makes it so, and for this purpose they used the concept of sabhava.Thus, while in Theravāda Abhidhamma, dhammas are the ultimate constituents of experience, they are not seen as substances, essences or independent particulars, since they are empty (\"suñña\") of a self (\"attā\") and conditioned. This is spelled out in the Patisambhidhamagga, which states that dhammas are empty of svabhava (\"sabhavena suññam\").\n\nAccording to Ronkin, the canonical Pali Abhidhamma remains pragmatic and psychological, and \"does not take much interest in ontology\" in contrast with the Sarvastivada tradition. Paul Williams also notes that the Abhidhamma remains focused on the practicalities of insight meditation and leaves ontology \"relatively unexplored\". Ronkin does note however that later Theravāda sub-commentaries (\"ṭīkā\") do show a doctrinal shift towards ontological realism from the earlier epistemic and practical concerns.\n\nThe Theravāda Abhidhamma holds that there is a total of 82 possible types of dhammas, 81 of these are conditioned (\"sankhata\"), while one is unconditioned, which is nibbana. The 81 conditioned dhammas are divided into three broad categories, consciousness (\"citta\"), associated mentality (\"cetasika\") and materiality, or physical phenomena (\"rupa\"). Since no dhamma exists independently, every single dhamma of consciousness, known as a citta, arises associated (\"sampayutta\") with at least seven mental factors (\"cetasikas\"). In Abhidhamma, all awareness events are thus seen as being characterized by intentionality and never exist in isolation. \n\nMuch of Abhidhamma philosophy deals with categorizing the different consciousnesses and their accompanying mental factors as well as their conditioned relationships (\"paccaya\"). The mental factors for example, are divided into:\n\n\nAccording Y. Karunadasa, for the Theravada, the two truths theory which divides reality into \"sammuti (\"worldly conventions) and \"paramattha\" (ultimate, absolute truths) is a doctrinal innovation of the Abhidhamma, but it has its origins in some statements from the early Pali Nikayas. This can mainly be seen in the distinction made in the Aṅguttara-nikāya between statements (not truths) that are \"nītattha\" (explicit, definitive) and \"neyyattha\" (requiring further explanation). Karunadasa notes that in the Nikayas, \"no preferential value judgment is made between \"nītattha\" and \"neyyattha\". All that is emphasized is that the two kinds of statement should not be confused.\" Another early source of this doctrine is the Saṅgīti-sutta of the Dīgha-nikāya, which lists four kinds of knowledge: (a) the direct knowledge of the doctrine (\"dhamme ñāna\"), (b) the inductive knowledge of the doctrine (\"anvaye ñana\"), (c) knowledge of analysis (\"paricchede ñana\"), and knowledge of (linguistic) conventions (\"sammuti-ñana\"). However, in the earlier Nikayas, as opposed to the Abhidhamma, \"sammuti\" (linguistic conventions) is not analyzed down into existents called \"paramattha\" (ultimate). In the Theravada Abhidhamma, the distinction does arise, referring to:two levels of reality, namely that which is amenable to analysis and that which defies further analysis. The first level is called sammuti because it represents conventional or relative truth or what is called consensual reality, and the second is called paramattha because it represents the absolute truth or ultimate reality. Thus, in orthodox Theravada Abhidhamma, when a situation is explained in terms of what cannot be empirically analyzed further into smaller components with different characteristics (\"lakkhana\") that explanation is \"paramattha-sacca\" (ultimate truth), and when it is explained in terms of \"what is\" analyzable further due to being dependent on the mind’s synthesizing function (i.e. \"paññatti\"), that explanation is \"sammuti-sacca\" (truth by convention), which exists in a relative or conventional sense due to mental conception (\"attha-paññatti\") and linguistic construction (\"nama-paññatti\"). However, even these ultimate components (i.e. \"dhammas\") are dependently originated, \"necessarily co-existent and positionally inseparable (\"padesato avinibhoga\")\". Unlike in the Sanskrit based Buddhist tradition which refer to the conventional truth as \"samvrti\" (which has the meaning of concealing or covering), the Pali Abhidhamma term \"sammuti\" just means human convention and does not have this connotation of an inferior truth hiding a higher truth. Therefore, as pointed out by K.N. Jayatilleke, the Theravāda version of two truths \"does not imply that what is true in the one sense is false in the other or even that the one kind of truth is superior to the other\". As Karunadasa writes:the distinction between \"sammuti-sacca\" and \"paramattha-sacca\" does not refer to two kinds of truth as such, but to two ways of presenting what is true. Although they are formally introduced as two truths, they are explained as two modes of expressing what is true. They do not represent two degrees of truth, of which one is superior or inferior to the other. Nor do they represent two parallel truths.Because of this, in Pali Abhidhamma, even \"paramattha-sacca\" is explained through concepts, though the ultimate itself is not a product of the mind's conceptual function (\"paññatti\"), it cannot be explained without the medium of \"paññatti\". Furthermore, according to Tse Fu Kuan, the Dhammasaṅgaṇi, \"does not appear to uphold that dhammas are ultimate realities as against conventional constructs like persons.\" This text also states that “all dhammas are ways of designation (\"paññatti\")”, that “all dhammas are ways of interpretation (\"nirutti\")” and that “all dhammas are ways of expression (\"adhivacana\")”. Therefore, the canonical Abhidhamma Pitaka does not uphold the interpretation of the two truths as referring to primary ontological realities (as seen in the later commentarial Theravada and also in Sarvastivada). \n\nThe doctrinal stances of the Theravāda school vis-a-vis other early Buddhist schools is presented in the Pali text known as the Kathāvatthu, \"Points of Controversy\", which said to have been compiled by the scholar Moggaliputta-Tissa (ca. 327 – 247 BCE). It includes several philosophical and soteriological matters, including the following.\n\nTheravadins believe that an awakened arahant (lit. \"worthy one\") has an \"incorruptible nature\", unlike other early Buddhist schools like the Mahāsāṃghika who believed arahants could regress. Theravadins also dispute the idea that an arahant may be lacking in knowledge, or have doubts, or that they could have nocturnal emissions and thus still have some residual fetter of sensuality. They also argued against the Uttarapathaka school's view that a layperson could become an arahant and continue to live the household life.\n\nThe Theravāda school rejected the view of the Lokottaravada schools which held that even the Buddha's conventional speech was supramundane or transcendental. They also rejected the proto-Mahayana docetic view of the Vetulyaka school that the Buddha himself did not teach the Dharma, but that it was taught by his magical creation or \"phantom\" while he himself remained in Tavatimsa Heaven.\n\nAccording to the Theravāda, \"progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' (\"abhisamaya\") does not come 'gradually' (successively – \"anapurva\")\", a belief known as subitism. This is reflected in the Theravāda account on the four stages of enlightenment, in which the attainment of the four paths appears suddenly and the defilements are rooted out at once. The same stance is taken in the contemporary vipassana movement, especially the \"New Burmese Method\".\n\nOn the Philosophy of time, the Theravāda tradition holds to philosophical presentism, the view that only present moment dhammas exist, against the eternalist view of the Sarvāstivādin tradition which held that dhammas exist in all three times - past, present, future.\n\nThe early Theravadins who compiled the Kathāvatthu also rejected the doctrine of momentariness (Skt., \"kṣāṇavāda\", Pali, \"khāṇavāda\") upheld by other Buddhist Abhidharma schools like the Sarvastivada, which held that all dhammas lasted for a \"moment\" which for them meant an atomistic unit of time, that is the shortest possible slice of time. According to Noa Ronkin, the Theravadins meanwhile, used the term \"moment\" (\"khāṇa\") as a simple expression for a \"short while\", \"the dimension of which is not fixed but may be determined by the context\". In the \"Khanikakatha\" of the Kathavatthu, the Theravadins also argue that \"only mental phenomena are momentary, whereas material phenomena endure for a stretch of time\". \n\nRegarding the mechanisms of rebirth, orthodox Theravadins following the Kathavatthu, rejected the doctrine of the intermediate state (\"antarabhāva\") between death and rebirth, holding instead that rebirth is immediate. However, recently some Theravada monks have written in favor of the idea, such as Ven. Balangoda Ananda Maitreya. \n\nThe doctrine of the Bhavanga (\"ground of becoming\", \"condition for existence\") is an innovation of the Theravāda Abhidhamma, where it is a passive mode of consciousness (\"citta\"). According to Rupert Gethin, it is \"the state in which the mind is said to rest when no active consciousness process is occurring\", such as in deep dreamless sleep. It is also said to be a process which conditions the future rebirth consciousness.\n\nOrthodox Theravada's position on the nature of the physical (\"rupa\") is that it is one of the two main dependently originated processes of a person (as part of the mind-body complex called \"nama-rupa\"). However there is no dualism between these two, they are merely clusters of interacting processes, each depending on the other. As noted by Buddhaghosa (Vism. 596), each can only occur \"supported by\" (\"nissaya\") the other, they are like a blind man that carries a crippled man, or two sheaves of reeds which lean on each other and support each other. \n\nRupa is mainly defined in terms of the four \"mahabhuta\", the four 'primary' physical phenomena: solidity (literally 'earth'), cohesion (literally 'water'), heat (literally 'fire') and motion (literally 'air'). In the Pali Abhidhamma, the four primaries began to refer to the irreducible factors or data that make up the physical world. These basic phenomena come together to make up secondary physical phenomena, such as the sense organs. Thus, according to Y Karunadasa, Pali Buddhism does not deny the existence of the external world and thus is a kind of realism. However, Theravada also follows the view that rupa, like all skandhas, is void (\"suñña\"), empty (\"ritta\") and essence-less (\"asara\"). Rupa dhammas are thus not atomic ontological substances and are merely outlined as a pragmatic descriptions of the world of experience. According to Karunadasa, this steers a middle course between the view that \"all is an absolute unity\" (\"sabbam ekattam\") and that it is absolute separateness (\"sabbam puthuttam\"). Also, according to Noa Ronkin, Theravada Abhidhamma:did not incorporate the Northern Buddhist atomistic theory as such into their system. As Karunadasa indicates, the Theravadin canonical texts do not mention the idea of a unitary atom or the term paramanu. Rather, the post-canonical texts employ the term kalapa (literally ‘package’), which corresponds to the collective atom of the Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika, that is, the smallest material unit that contains the eight elements.Furthermore the term kalapa for the collective atom only became standard in the sub-commentarial literature and it is not a singular particle, but a collection of \"rupa-dhammas\", which are inseparable from each other and always occur simultaneously (\"sahajata\"). \n\nThe modern era saw new developments in Theravada scholarship due to the influence of Western thought. As Donald K Swearer writes: Although monastic education is still grounded in the study of Buddhist texts, doctrine, and the Pali language, the curricula of monastic colleges and universities also reflect subject matter and disciplines associated with Western education.Buddhist modernist trends can be traced to figures like Anagarika Dhammapala and King Mongkut. They promoted a form of Buddhism that was compatible with rationalism and science, and opposed to superstition. Walpola Rahula’s, What the Buddha Taught is seen by scholars as an introduction to modernist Buddhist thought and this book continues to be widely used in universities. Another phenomenon is Buddhist philosophers educated in the West, such as K. N. Jayatilleke (a student of Wittgenstein) and Hammalawa Saddhatissa, going on to write modern works on Buddhist philosophy (\"Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge\", 1963 and \"Buddhist Ethics\", 1987 respectively). \n\nThe colonial clash with Christianity also led to debates (such as the Panadura debate) and doctrinal works written in defense of Buddhism or attacking Christian ideas, such as Gunapala Dharmasiri's \"A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God\" (1988).\n\nAnother development has been modern literature promoting socially Engaged Buddhism and Buddhist economics from thinkers such as Buddhadasa, Sulak Sivaraksa, Prayudh Payutto, Neville Karunatilake and Padmasiri de Silva. \n\nModern scholarship by Western Buddhist monks such as Nyanaponika Thera was also a new development in the modern era.\n\nIn the Pali Canon, the path (\"magga\") or way (\"patipada\") of Buddhist practice is described in various ways, one of the most widely used frameworks in Theravāda is the Noble Eightfold Path:\n\nThe Noble Eightfold Path can also be summarized as the Three Noble Disciplines of sīla (moral conduct or discipline), samādhi (meditation or concentration) and paññā (understanding or wisdom).\n\nTheravāda orthodoxy takes the seven stages of purification as outlined in the \"Visuddhimagga\" as the basic outline of the path to be followed. The \"Visuddhimagga\", a Sinhalese Theravāda doctrinal \"summa\" written in the fifth century by Buddhaghosa, became the orthodox account of the Theravāda path to liberation in Sri Lanka after the 12th century and this influence spread to other Theravāda nations. It gives the sequence of seven purifications, in three sections:\n\n\nThis basic outline is based on the threefold discipline. The emphasis is on understanding the three marks of existence, which removes ignorance. Understanding destroys the ten fetters and leads to nibbana.\n\nTheravadins believe that every individual is personally responsible for their own self-awakening and liberation, as they are the ones that were responsible for their own kamma (actions and consequences). Great emphasis is placed upon applying the knowledge through direct experience and personal realization, than believing about the known information about the nature of reality as said by the Buddha.\n\nSīla, moral conduct, mainly defined as right speech, right action, and right livelihood is primarily understood through the doctrine of kamma. In Theravāda, one's present experience is strongly influenced by one's previous intentional actions and whatever actions one intends and then does will have consequences in the future, whether in this life or the next. Intention is central to the idea of kamma, actions which are done with good intentions, even if they have bad results, will not result in negative kammic consequences. \n\nTo guide right action, there are several sets of precepts or moral trainings (\"sikkhāpada\"). Traditionally, Theravāda laypersons take the five precepts (whether for life or for a limited time) in front of a monastic after taking refuge in the three jewels. Laypeople also sometimes take an extended set of eight precepts which includes chastity during special occasions such as religious holidays.\n\nAnother important feature of Theravāda ethics is the doing of good deeds, performing these deeds are said to make \"merit\" (puñña), which will allow one a better rebirth. A common list of good deeds is the \"ten wholesome actions\": \n\n\nMeditation (Pali: \"Bhavana,\" literally \"causing to become\" or cultivation) means the positive cultivation of one's mind. \n\nWhile often presented as going back to the time of the Buddha, \"vipassana\"-meditation as popularized by the vipassana movement dates back to the 19th and 20th century. According to Buswell, by the 10th century \"vipassana\" was no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the believe that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of \"Maitreya\". It was re-introdcued in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728–1816). A revival of Theravāda meditation practice occurred primarily in Myanmar during the 19th and 20th centuries, re-inventing \"vipassana\"-meditation and developing simplified meditation techniques, based on the \"Satipatthana sutta\", the \"Visuddhimagga\", and other texts, emphasizing \"satipatthana\" and bare insight. These techniques were globally popularized by the Vipassana movement in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThough the \"Vipassana movement\" has popularised meditation both in traditional Theravada countries among the laity, and in western countries, \"meditation plays a minor if not negligible role in the lives of the majority of Theravada monks.\" Meditation is especially popular laypersons, especially during special religious holidays or in their old age, when they have more free time to spend at the temple. Buddhist modernists tend to present Buddhism as rational and scientific, and this has also affected how Vipassana meditation has been taught and presented. This has led in some quarters to a playing down of older non-empirical elements of Theravada, associated with 'superstition'. Strains of older, traditional Theravāda meditation known as \"borān kammaṭṭhāna\" still exist, but this tradition has mostly been eclipsed by the Buddhist modernist meditation movements. \n\nTheravāda Buddhist meditation practice varies considerably in technique and objects. Theravāda Buddhist meditation practices or bhavanas (cultivations) are categorized into two broad categories: Samatha bhavana (calming), and Vipassanā bhavana (investigation, insight). Originally these referred to effects or qualities of meditation, but after the time of Buddhaghosa, it also referred to two distinct meditation types or paths (\"yāna\").\n\n\"Samatha\" (\"calm\") consists of meditation techniques in which the mind is focused on a single object, thought, or mantra, leading to \"samadhi\"'. In traditional Theravada, it is onsidered to be the base for \"vipassanā\" (\"insght\"). In the Theravada-tradition, as early as the Pali Nikayas, the four \"jhānas\" are regarded as a \"samatha\"-practice. The eight and final step of the Eightfold Path, Right Samadhi, is often defined as the four jhanas. In the Pali Nikayas, Jhānas are described as preceding the awakening insight of the Buddha, which turned him into an awakened being. Yet, the interpretation of \"jhana\" as single-pointed concentration and calm, may be a later re-interpretation, in which the original aim of \"jhana\" was lost.\n\n\"Vipassana\"-meditation was invented in the 19th and 20th century, when monks in Thailand and Burma rejected the sole textual study of Buddhism, and tried to put the texts on meditation into practice. \"Vipassana\" applies mindfulness of breathing to calm the mind, focus it on the awareness of chnaging phenomena, and uses this to gain insight into \"dukkha\", \"anatta]\" and \"anicca\". \"Vipassana\" is also described as insight into dependent origination, the five aggregates, the sense spheres and the four noble truths. In western countries, it is complemented with the four divine abidings, the development of loving-kindness and compassion. \n\n\"Vipassana\"-practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of \"sila\", morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires. The practitioner then engages in \"anapanasati\", mindfulness of breathing, which is described in the Satipatthana Sutta as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short. In the \"New Burmese Method,\" the practitioner pays attention to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in vitaka, noting or naming physical and mental phenomena (\"breathing, breathing\"), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking. By noticing the arising of physical and mental pohenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena, as described in the five \"skandhas\" and \"paṭiccasamuppāda\". The practitioner also becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness. This noticing is accompanied by reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into dukkha, anatta, and anicca. When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them.\n\nAccording to Vajiranāṇa Mahathera, writing from a traditional and text-based point of view, in the Pali canon whether one begins the practice by way of samatha or by way of vipassanā is generally seen as depending on one's temperament. According to Vajiranāṇa Mahathera, it is generally held that there are two kinds of individuals. Those of a passionate disposition (or those who enter the path by faith), attain Arahatship through vipassanā preceded by samatha. Those of a skeptical disposition (or those who enter by way of wisdom or the intellect), achieve it through samatha preceded by vipassanā.\n\nTraditionally, the ultimate goal of the practice is to achieve mundane and supramundane wisdom. Mundane wisdom is the insight in the three marks of existence. The development of this insight leads to four supramundane paths and fruits, these experiences consist a direct apprehension of Nibbana. Supramundane (\"lokuttara)\" wisdom refers to that which transcends the world of samsara.\n\nApart from nibbana, there are various reasons why traditional Theravāda Buddhism advocates meditation, including a good rebirth, supranormal powers, combating fear and preventing danger. Recent modernist Theravādins have tended to focus on the psychological benefits and psychological well being. \n\nAccoding to Theravāda doctrine, liberation is attained in four stages of enlightenment: \n\nNirvana (, '; , '; , \"\") is the ultimate goal of Theravadins. It is a state where the fire of the passions has been 'blown out', and the person is liberated from the repeated cycle of birth, illness, aging and death. In the \"Saṃyojanapuggala Sutta\" of the Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha describes four kinds of persons and tells us that the last person – the Arahant – has attained Nibbana by removing all 10 fetters that bind beings to samsara:\nAccording to the early scriptures, the Nirvana attained by \"Arahants\" is identical to that attained by the Buddha himself, as there is only one type of Nirvana. Theravadins believe the Buddha was superior to \"Arahants\" because the Buddha discovered the path all by himself and taught it to others (i.e., metaphorically turning the wheel of Dhamma). \"Arahants\", on the other hand, attained Nirvana partly because of the Buddha's teachings. Theravadins revere the Buddha as a supremely gifted person but also recognize the existence of other such Buddhas in the distant past and future. Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya), for example, is mentioned very briefly in the Pali Canon as a Buddha who will come in the distant future.\n\nLaypersons and monks also perform various types of religious practices daily or during Buddhist holidays. One of these is keeping a Buddhist shrine with a picture or statue of the Buddha for devotional practice in one's home, mirroring the larger shrines at temples. It is common to offer candles, incense, flowers and other objects to these shrine. Gestures of respect are also done in front of Buddha images and shrines, mainly the respectful salutation with the hands (\"añjalikamma\"), and the five-limb prostration (\"pañc'anga-vandana\"). \n\nBuddhist forms of chanting is also widely practiced by both monks and laypersons, who may recite famous phrases such as the taking of refuge, the metta sutta and the mangala sutta in front of their shrine. Chanting may also be part of the practice of recollection (anussati), which refers to contemplating various topics such as the sublime qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha or the five subjects for daily recollection. This may be done as part of a daily puja ritual.\n\nAnother important religious practice for the devout is the keeping of special religious holidays known as Uposatha which are based on a lunar calendar. Laypersons commonly take the eight precepts while visiting a temple or monastery and commit to focusing on Buddhist practice for the day. \n\nStudy (\"ganthadhura\") of the Buddhist texts and listening to Dhamma talks by monks or teachers are also important practices.\n\nTraditionally, Theravāda Buddhism has observed a distinction between the practices suitable for a lay person and the practices undertaken by ordained monks (in ancient times, there was a separate body of practices for nuns). While the possibility of significant attainment by laymen is not entirely disregarded by the Theravāda, it generally occupies a position of less prominence than in the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna traditions, with monastic life being hailed as a superior method of achieving Nirvana. The view that Theravāda, unlike other Buddhist schools, is primarily a monastic tradition has, however, been disputed.\nThis distinction between ordained monks and laypeople – as well as the distinction between those practices advocated by the Pali Canon, and the folk religious elements embraced by many monks – have motivated some scholars to consider Theravāda Buddhism to be composed of multiple separate traditions, overlapping though still distinct. Most prominently, the anthropologist Melford Spiro in his work \"Buddhism and Society\" separated Burmese Theravāda into three groups: Apotropaic Buddhism (concerned with providing protection from evil spirits), Kammatic Buddhism (concerned with making merit for a future birth), and Nibbanic Buddhism (concerned with attaining the liberation of Nirvana, as described in the Tipitaka). He stresses that all three are firmly rooted in the Pali Canon. These categories are not accepted by all scholars, and are usually considered non-exclusive by those who employ them.\n\nThe role of lay people has traditionally been primarily occupied with activities that are commonly termed \"merit-making\" (falling under Spiro's category of kammatic Buddhism). Merit-making activities include offering food and other basic necessities to monks, making donations to temples and monasteries, burning incense or lighting candles before images of the Buddha, and chanting protective or merit-making verses from the Pali Canon. Some lay practitioners have always chosen to take a more active role in religious affairs, while still maintaining their lay status. Dedicated lay men and women sometimes act as trustees or custodians for their temples, taking part in the financial planning and management of the temple. Others may volunteer significant time in tending to the mundane needs of local monks (by cooking, cleaning, maintaining temple facilities, etc.). Lay activities have traditionally not extended to study of the Pali scriptures, nor the practice of meditation, though in the 20th century these areas have become more accessible to the lay community, especially in Thailand.\nA number of senior monastics in the Thai Forest Tradition, including Buddhadasa, Ajahn Maha Bua, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Ajahn Pasanno, and Ajahn Jayasaro, have begun teaching meditation retreats outside of the monastery for lay disciples. Ajahn Sumedho, a disciple of Ajahn Chah, founded the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in Hertfordshire, which has a retreat center specifically for lay retreats. Sumedho extended this to Harnham in Northumberland as Aruna Ratanagiri under the present guidance of Ajahn Munindo, another disciple of Ajahn Chah.\n\nIn Pali the word for a male lay devotee is Upasaka and a female devotee is Upasika. One of the duties of the lay followers, as taught by the Buddha, is to look after the needs of the monk/nuns. They are to see that the monk/nuns do not suffer from lack of the four requisites: food, clothing, shelter and medicine. As neither monks nor nuns are allowed to have an occupation, they depend entirely on the laity for their sustenance. In return for this charity, they are expected to lead exemplary lives.\n\nIn Myanmar and Thailand, the monastery was and is still regarded as a seat of learning. In fact today about half of the primary schools in Thailand are located in monasteries. Religious rituals and ceremonies held in a monastery are always accompanied by social activities. In times of crisis, it is to the monks that people bring their problems for counsel. Traditionally, a ranking monk will deliver a sermon four times a month: when the moon waxes and wanes and the day before the new and full moons. The laity also have a chance to learn meditation from the monks during these times.\n\nIt is also possible for a lay disciple to become enlightened. As Bhikkhu Bodhi notes, \"The Suttas and commentaries do record a few cases of lay disciples attaining the final goal of Nirvana. However, such disciples either attain Arahantship on the brink of death or enter the monastic order soon after their attainment. They do not continue to dwell at home as Arahant householders, for dwelling at home is incompatible with the state of one who has severed all craving.\"\n\nIn the modern era, it is now common for lay disciples to practice meditation, attend lay meditation centers and even aim for awakening. The impetus for this trend began in Myanmar and was supported by prime minister U Nu who himself established the International Meditation Center (IMC) in Yangon. Modern lay teachers such as U Ba Khin (who was also the Accountant General of the Union of Burma) promoted meditation as part of a laypersons daily routine. According to Donald K Swearer, another development in modern Theravada is \"the formation of lay Buddhist associations that have partially assumed the social service responsibilities formerly associated with the monastery\". These include social service and activist organizations such as the Young Men’s Buddhist Association of Colombo, the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, the Sarvodaya Shramadana of A. T. Ariyaratne, the NGO's founded by Sulak Sivaraksa such as Santi Pracha.\n\nTheravada sources dating back to medieval Sri Lanka (2nd century BCE to 10th century CE) such as the Mahavamsa show that monastic roles in the tradition were often seen as being in a polarity between urban monks (Sinhala: \"khaamawaasii,\" Pali: \"gamavasi\") on one end and rural forest monks (Sinhala: \"aranyawaasii,\" Pali: \"araññavasi, nagaravasi\", also known as \"Tapassin\") on the other. The ascetic focused monks were known by the names \"Pamsukulikas\" (rag robe wearers) and \"Araññikas\" (forest dwellers). \n\nThe Mahavamsa mentions forest monks associated with the Mahavihara. The Pali Dhammapada Commentary mentions another split based on the \"duty of study\" and the \"duty of contemplation\". This second division has traditionally been seen as corresponding with the city - forest split, with the city monks focusing on the vocation of books (\"ganthadhura\") or learning (\"pariyatti\") while the forest monks leaning more towards meditation (\"vipassanadhura\") and practice (\"patipatti\"). However this opposition is not consistent, and urban monasteries have often promoted meditation while forest communities have also produced excellent scholars, such as the Island Hermitage of Nyanatiloka. \n\nScholar monks generally undertake the path of studying and preserving the Pali literature of the Theravāda. Forest monks tend to be the minority among Theravada sanghas and also tend to focus on asceticism (\"dhutanga\") and meditative praxis. They view themselves as living closer to the ideal set forth by the Buddha, and are often perceived as such by lay folk, while at the same time often being on the margins of the Buddhist establishment and on the periphery of the social order.\n\nWhile this divide seems to have been in existence for some time in the Theravada school, only in the 10th century is a specifically forest monk monastery, mentioned as existing near Anuradhapura, called \"Tapavana\". This division was then carried over into the rest of Southeast Asia as Theravada spread.\n\nToday there are forest based traditions in most Theravada countries, including the Sri Lankan Forest Tradition, the Thai Forest Tradition as well as lesser known forest based traditions in Burma and Laos, such as the Burmese forest based monasteries (\"taw\"yar\") of Pa Auk Sayadaw. In Thailand, forest monks are known as \"phra thudong\" (ascetic wandering monks) or \"phra thudong kammathan\" (wandering ascetic meditator).\n\nThe minimum age for ordaining as a Buddhist monk is 20 years, reckoned from conception. However, boys under that age are allowed to ordain as novices (sāmaṇera), performing a ceremony such as \"shinbyu\" in Myanmar. Novices shave their heads, wear the yellow robes, and observe the Ten Precepts. Although no specific minimum age for novices is mentioned in the scriptures, traditionally boys as young as seven are accepted. This tradition follows the story of the Buddha's son, Rahula, who was allowed to become a novice at the age of seven. Monks follow 227 rules of discipline, while nuns follow 311 rules.\n\nIn most Theravāda countries, it is a common practice for young men to ordain as monks for a fixed period of time. In Thailand and Myanmar, young men typically ordain for the retreat during Vassa, the three-month monsoon season, though shorter or longer periods of ordination are not rare. Traditionally, temporary ordination was even more flexible among Laotians. Once they had undergone their initial ordination as young men, Laotian men were permitted to temporarily ordain again at any time, though married men were expected to seek their wife's permission. Throughout Southeast Asia, there is little stigma attached to leaving the monastic life. Monks regularly leave the robes after acquiring an education, or when compelled by family obligations or ill health.\n\nOrdaining as a monk, even for a short period, is seen as having many virtues. In many Southeast Asian cultures, it is seen as a means for a young man to \"repay\" his parents for their work and effort in raising him, because the merit from his ordination accrues to them as well. Thai men who have ordained as a monk may be seen as more fit husbands by Thai women, who refer to men who have served as monks with a colloquial term meaning \"ripe\" to indicate that they are more mature and ready for marriage. Particularly in rural areas, temporary ordination of boys and young men traditionally gave peasant boys an opportunity to gain an education in temple schools without committing to a permanent monastic life.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, temporary ordination is not practised, and a monk leaving the order is frowned upon. The continuing influence of the caste system in Sri Lanka plays a role in the taboo against temporary or permanent ordination as a bhikkhu in some orders. Though Sri Lankan orders are often organized along caste lines, men who ordain as monks temporarily pass outside of the conventional caste system, and as such during their time as monks may act (or be treated) in a way that would not be in line with the expected duties and privileges of their caste.\n\nMen and women born in Western countries, who become Buddhists as adults, wish to become monks or nuns. It is possible, and one can live as a monk or nun in the country they were born in, seek monks or nuns which has gathered in a different Western country or move to a monastery in countries like Sri Lanka or Thailand. It is seen as being easier to live a life as a monk or nun in countries where people generally live by the culture of Buddhism, since it is difficult to live by the rules of a monk or a nun in a Western country. For instance, a Theravāda monk or nun is not allowed to work, handle money, listen to music, cook and so on, which are extremely difficult rules to live by in cultures which do not embrace Buddhism.\n\nSome of the more well-known Theravādan monks are Mun Bhuridatta, Ajahn Chah, Ledi Sayadaw, Webu Sayadaw, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Khemadhammo, Ajahn Brahm, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Buddhadasa, Mahasi Sayadaw, Nyanaponika Thera, Preah Maha Ghosananda, U Pandita, Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Sucitto, Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Walpola Rahula, Henepola Gunaratana, Bhante Yogavacara Rahula and Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro.\n\nThe practices usually vary in different sub-schools and monasteries within Theravāda. But in the most orthodox forest monastery, the monk usually models his practice and lifestyle on that of the Buddha and his first generation of disciples by living close to nature in forest, mountains and caves. Forest monasteries still keep alive the ancient traditions through following the Buddhist monastic code of discipline in all its detail and developing meditation in secluded forests.\n\nIn a typical daily routine at the monastery during the 3 month vassa period, the monk will wake up before dawn and will begin the day with group chanting and meditation. At dawn the monks will go out to surrounding villages bare-footed on alms-round and will have the only meal of the day before noon by eating from the bowl by hand. Most of the time is spent on Dhamma study and meditation. Sometimes the abbot or a senior monk will give a Dhamma talk to the visitors. Laity who stay at the monastery will have to abide by the traditional eight Buddhist precepts.\n\nThe life of the monk or nun in a community is much more complex than the life of the forest monk. In the Buddhist society of Sri Lanka, most monks spend hours every day in taking care of the needs of lay people such as preaching \"bana,\" accepting alms, officiating funerals, teaching \"dhamma\" to adults and children in addition to providing social services to the community.\n\nAfter the end of the Vassa period, many of the monks will go out far away from the monastery to find a remote place (usually in the forest) where they can hang their umbrella tents and where it is suitable for the work of self-development. When they go wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those requisites which are necessary will be carried along. These generally consist of the bowl, the three robes, a bathing cloth, an umbrella tent, a mosquito net, a kettle of water, a water filter, razor, sandals, some small candles, and a candle lantern.\n\nThe monks do not fix their times for walking and sitting meditation, for as soon as they are free they just start doing it; nor do they determine for how long they will go on to meditate. Some of them sometimes walk from dusk to dawn whereas at other times they may walk from between two and seven hours. Some may decide to fast for days or stay at dangerous places where ferocious animals live in order to aid their meditation.\n\nThose monks who have been able to achieve a high level of attainment will be able to guide the junior monks and lay Buddhists toward the four degrees of spiritual attainment.\n\nA few years after the arrival of Mahinda, the bhikkhu Saṅghamittā, who is also believed to have been the daughter of Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka. She ordained the first nuns in Sri Lanka. In 429, by request of China's emperor, nuns from Anuradhapura were sent to China to establish the order there, which subsequently spread across East Asia. The prātimokṣa of the nun's order in East Asian Buddhism is the Dharmaguptaka, which is different than the prātimokṣa of the current Theravada school; the specific ordination of the early Sangha in Sri Lanka not known, although the Dharmaguptaka sect originated with the Sthāvirīya as well.\n\nThe nun's order subsequently died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century and in Burma in the 13th century. It had already died out around the 10th century in other Theravadin areas. Novice ordination has also disappeared in those countries. Therefore, women who wish to live as renunciates in those countries must do so by taking eight or ten precepts. Neither laywomen nor formally ordained, these women do not receive the recognition, education, financial support or status enjoyed by Buddhist men in their countries. These \"precept-holders\" live in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and Thailand. In particular, the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. Japan is a special case as, although it has neither the bhikkhuni nor novice ordinations, the precept-holding nuns who live there do enjoy a higher status and better education than their precept-holder sisters elsewhere, and can even become Zen priests. In Tibet there is currently no bhikkhuni ordination, but the Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.\n\nIn 1996, 11 selected Sri Lankan women were ordained fully as Theravada bhikkhunis by a team of Theravāda monks in concert with a team of Korean nuns in India. There is disagreement among Theravāda vinaya authorities as to whether such ordinations are valid. The Dambulla chapter of the Siam Nikaya in Sri Lanka also carried out a nun's ordination at this time, specifically stating their ordination process was a valid Theravadin process where the other ordination session was not. This chapter has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns since then. This has been criticized by leading figures in the Siam Nikaya and Amarapura Nikaya, and the governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has declared that there can be no valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree with this.\n\nIn 1997 Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun; when she received full ordination in 2000, her dwelling became America's first Theravada Buddhist bhikkhuni vihara.\n\nA 55-year-old Thai Buddhist 8-precept white-robed maechee nun, Varanggana Vanavichayen, became the first woman to receive the going-forth ceremony of a Theravada novice (and the gold robe) in Thailand, in 2002. On February 28, 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly known as Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, became the first Thai woman to receive bhikkhuni ordination as a Theravada nun.\nDhammananda Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka. The Thai Senate has reviewed and revoked the secular law passed in 1928 banning women's full ordination in Buddhism as unconstitutional for being counter to laws protecting freedom of religion. However Thailand's two main Theravada Buddhist orders, the Mahanikaya and Dhammayutika Nikaya, have yet to officially accept fully ordained women into their ranks.\n\nIn 2009 in Australia four women received bhikkhuni ordination as Theravada nuns, the first time such ordination had occurred in Australia. It was performed in Perth, Australia, on 22 October 2009 at Bodhinyana Monastery. Abbess Vayama together with Venerables Nirodha, Seri, and Hasapanna were ordained as Bhikkhunis by a dual Sangha act of Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis in full accordance with the Pali Vinaya.\n\nIn 2010, in the US, four novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai Theravada tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. Henepola Gunaratana and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere.\n\nThe first bhikkhuni ordination in Germany, the ordination of German woman Samaneri Dhira, occurred on June 21, 2015 at Anenja Vihara.\n\nIn Indonesia, the first Theravada ordination of bhikkhunis in Indonesia after more than a thousand years occurred in 2015 at Wisma Kusalayani in Lembang, Bandung in West Java. Those ordained included Vajiradevi Sadhika Bhikkhuni from Indonesia, Medha Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Anula Bhikkhuni from Japan, Santasukha Santamana Bhikkhuni from Vietnam, Sukhi Bhikkhuni and Sumangala Bhikkhuni from Malaysia, and Jenti Bhikkhuni from Australia.\n\nTheravāda monks typically belong to a particular \"nikaya\", variously referred to as monastic orders or fraternities. These different orders do not typically develop separate doctrines, but may differ in the manner in which they observe monastic rules. These monastic orders represent lineages of ordination, typically tracing their origin to a particular group of monks that established a new ordination tradition within a particular country or geographic area.\n\nIn Sri Lanka caste plays a major role in the division into nikayas. Some Theravāda Buddhist countries appoint or elect a sangharaja, or Supreme Patriarch of the Sangha, as the highest ranking or seniormost monk in a particular area, or from a particular nikaya. The demise of monarchies has resulted in the suspension of these posts in some countries, but patriarchs have continued to be appointed in Thailand. Myanmar and Cambodia ended the practice of appointing a sangharaja for some time, but the position was later restored, though in Cambodia it lapsed again.\n\n\n\nTheravāda Buddhism is followed by countries and people around the globe, and is:\n\nToday, Theravāda Buddhists, otherwise known as Theravadins, number over 150 million worldwide, and during the past few decades Theravāda Buddhism has begun to take root in the West and in the Buddhist revival in India.\n\n"}

(1488 – 8 September 1555) was a Spanish friar of the Order of Saint Augustine who was a noted preacher, ascetic and religious writer of his day. He became an archbishop who was famous for the extent of his care for the poor of his see.\n\nHe was born Tomás García y Martínez in Fuenllana, Spain, in 1488. His father was a miller, who regularly distributed food and provisions to the poor, as did his mother. He grew up and was educated in Villanueva de los Infantes, in the Province of Ciudad Real, Spain, therefore the name Thomas of Villanueva. Part of the original house still stands, with a coat of arms in the corner, beside a family chapel. In spite of his family's wealth, as a young boy he often went about naked because he had given his clothing to the poor.\n\nAt the age of sixteen years, Thomas entered the University of Alcalá de Henares to study Arts and Theology. He became a professor there, teaching arts, logic, and philosophy, despite a continuing absentmindedness and poor memory. In 1516, he decided to join the Augustinian friars in Salamanca and in 1518 was ordained a priest.\n\nHe became renowned for his eloquent and effective preaching in the churches of Salamanca. Thomas composed beautiful sermons, among which stands out the \"Sermon on the Love of God,\" one of the great examples of sacred oratory of the 16th century. Charles V, upon hearing him preach, exclaimed, \"This monsignor can move even the stones!\". Charles named Thomas one of his councilors of state and court preacher in Valladolid, the residence of the Emperor when on his visits to the Low Countries.\n\nHis scathing attacks on his fellow bishops earned him the title of reformer. Some of his sermons attacked the cruelty of bullfighting. He also had a great devotion to the Virgin Mary, whose heart he compared to the burning bush of Moses that is never consumed.\n\nWithin the Order, he successively held the positions of prior of his local monastery, Visitor General, and Prior Provincial for Andalusia and Castile. In 1533, Thomas sent out the first Augustinian friars to arrive in Mexico. Charles V offered him the post of Archbishop of Granada but he would not accept it.\n\nIn 1544 he was nominated as Archbishop of Valencia and he continued to refuse the position until ordered to accept by his superior. Given a donation to decorate his residence, he sent the money to a hospital in need of repair. He began his episcopacy by visiting every parish in the Archdiocese to discover what the needs of the people were. Aided by his assistant bishop, Juan Segriá, he put in order an archdiocese that for a century had not had direct pastoral government. He organized a special college for Moorish converts, and in particular an effective plan for social assistance, welfare, and charity.\nIn 1547 he ordained as a priest the future Saint Luis Beltrán, O.P., a noted missionary in South America. Thomas started Presentation Seminary in 1550.\n\nHe was well known for his great personal austerity (he sold the straw mattress on which he slept in order to give money to the poor) and wore the same habit that he had received in the novitiate, mending it himself. Thomas was known as “father of the poor.” His continual charitable efforts were untiring, especially towards orphans, poor women without a dowry, and the sick. He possessed, however, an intelligent notion of charity, so that while he was very charitable, he sought to obtain definitive and structural solutions to the problem of poverty; for example, giving work to the poor, thereby making his charity bear fruit. \"Charity is not just giving, rather removing the need of those who receive charity and liberating them from it when possible,\" he wrote. He established boarding schools and high schools.\n\nThomas died in Valencia on September 8, 1555 of angina at the age of 67. His remains are preserved at the Cathedral there.\n\nHe was canonized by Pope Alexander VII on November 1, 1658. His feast day is celebrated on September 22.\n\nThomas is the author of various \"Tracts,\" among which is included the \"Soliloquy between God and the soul,\" on the topic of communion. Francisco de Quevedo wrote his biography. His complete writings were published in six volumes as \"Opera omnia,\" in Manila in 1881.\n\nThomas is the namesake and patron saint of Villanova University, near Philadelphia in the United States, which was founded and is administered by the friars of his Order; Universidad Católica de Santo Tomás de Villanueva in Havana, Cuba; St. Thomas University in Miami Gardens, Florida, USA; and Villanova College, a Catholic school for boys located in Brisbane, Australia. In the Philippines, some churches and towns are dedicated in honor of the saint with grand feast or fiesta celebrations with lots of food on the table for the guests and visitors. He is the patron saint of the towns of Alimodian and Miag-ao, both in Iloilo. He is also the patron saint of Barangay Santolan in Pasig City.\n\nA congregation of sisters is also named after him.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2809225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2809225", "title": "Tradition history", "text": "Tradition history\n\nTradition history or criticism is a methodology of Biblical criticism that was developed by Hermann Gunkel. Tradition history seeks to analyze biblical literature in terms of the process by which biblical traditions passed from stage to stage into their final form, especially how they passed from oral tradition to written form. Tradition history/criticism is a sister discipline of form criticism—also associated with Gunkel, who used the results of source and form criticism to develop the history of tradition interpretation. Form criticism and tradition criticism thus overlap, though the former is more narrow in focus. Tradition history is connected with secular folklore studies, especially Axel Olrik's analysis of Scandinavian folklore and the \"laws\" which he established concerning the nature of such folklore. The stories in the Bible were then analyzed on the basis of these \"laws\". \n\nTradition history forces interpreters to consider the possibility that some texts may have had an oral prehistory. It also notes that past traditions were retold and used for a present purpose; that it was made real, vital, or relevant for each successive generation.\n\nThe method also has weaknesses. Tradition history creates highly speculative reconstructions, often built on the speculative deductions from source criticism. Moreover, tradition history may exaggerate the role of oral tradition. If texts were written soon after they were spoken so that there was not a long oral prehistory, then the assumptions of tradition history fall to the ground. The use of Olrik's laws is also dubious: It may be a false analogy to compare Icelandic folklore with Hebrew folklore since they are very different cultures. Some folklorists question whether Olrik's laws apply even to Scandinavian literature much less any other (Gunkel admitted they did not apply to all stories in Genesis).\n\n"}

{"id": "578732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=578732", "title": "Zawiya (institution)", "text": "Zawiya (institution)\n\nA zaouia or zawiya ( \"zāwiyah\"; \"assembly\" \"group\" or \"circle\", also spelled \"zawiyah, zawiyya, zaouiya, zaouïa\" and \"zwaya\") is an Islamic religious school or monastery. The term is Maghrebi and West African, roughly corresponding to the Eastern term \"madrasa\". A \"zawiya\" often contains a pool, and sometimes a fountain.\n\nIn precolonial times, these were the primary sources for education in the area, and taught basic literacy to a large proportion of children even in quite remote mountainous areas - leading to the generally accepted speculation that literacy rates in Algeria at the time of the French conquest in 1830 were higher than those of European France. Their curriculum began with memorization of the Arabic alphabet and the later, shorter suras of the Qur'an; if a student was sufficiently interested or apt, it progressed to law (fiqh), theology, Arabic grammar (usually taught with al-Ajurrumi's famous summary), mathematics (mainly as it pertained to the complex legal system of inheritance distribution), and sometimes astronomy. These are still operational throughout the Maghreb, and continue to be a major educational resource in the Sahel of West Africa, from Mauritania to Nigeria.\n\nIn the Arab world, the term \"zawiya\" can also refer to a Sufi lodge, akin to the term Tekke/Tekyeh in Iran, Turkey and the former Ottoman areas, as well as khanqah or dargah used in various parts of Asia. An example is the Hilaliyya Zawiya in Syria. One of the best known living or contemporary \"zawiyas\" is the Zawiya of Sheikh Ahmed Tijani located in Fes, Morocco. There are several extensions or sub-zawiyas affiliated with this Zawiya located in various places around the world.\n\nAmong the Hassaniya Arabic-speaking populations of Mauritania, Western Sahara, Morocco, Mali and Algeria (often referred to as Moors/Maure and Sahrawis), the term is also used to signify a certain type of tribe. Sahrawi-Moorish society was traditionally (and still is, to some extent) stratified into several tribal castes, with the Hassane warrior tribes ruling and extracting tribute—horma—from the subservient znaga tribes. A middle caste was formed by the Zawāyā, or scholarly tribes, who provided religious teaching and services. This did not necessarily mean that they maintained a monastery or school as described above, since all these tribes were more or less nomadic. However, important shaikhs and Sufis would sometimes create schools, or, after their deaths, their Shrine would turn into holy places of significance to the tribe its called Mazaar.\n\nOften, the Zawāyā were descended from Sanhadja Berbers, while the Hassane claimed lineage from the Beni Hassan Arabs. Even if intermarriage and tribal alliances made the distinction difficult to maintain from a scientific perspective, it was culturally important; however, from about the 19th century, most or all Sahrawi-Moorish tribes had adopted the Hassaniyya Arabic dialect and come to regard themselves as Arabs. Sometimes, the Zawāyā and Hassane roles changed with this: military and economic strength would often lead to a gradual redefinition of the tribe's role, and, simultaneously, to its self-perception of religious and ethnic background. Especially in the northern Hassane areas, i.e. today's Western Sahara, the Zawāyāa tribes were more or less synonymous with the Chorfa, tribes who claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad. In the areas corresponding broadly to today's Mauritania, this was not necessarily so; there, the name \"Marabout\" is also used synonymously with \"Zawāyā\" in its tribal meaning.\n\n\n"}
