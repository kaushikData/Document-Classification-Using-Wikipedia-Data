{"id": "16160739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16160739", "title": "Animal welfare in Nazi Germany", "text": "Animal welfare in Nazi Germany\n\nThere was widespread support for animal welfare in Nazi Germany among the country's leadership. Adolf Hitler and his top officials took a variety of measures to ensure animals were protected. Many Nazi leaders, including Hitler and Hermann Göring, were supporters of animal rights and conservation. Several Nazis were environmentalists, and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the Nazi regime. Heinrich Himmler made an effort to ban the hunting of animals. Göring was a professed animal lover and conservationist, who, on instructions from Hitler, committed Germans who violated Nazi animal welfare laws to concentration camps. In his private diaries, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a vegetarian whose hatred of the Jewish and Christian religions in large part stemmed from the ethical distinction these faiths drew between the value of humans and the value of other animals; Goebbels also mentions that Hitler planned to ban slaughterhouses in the German Reich following the conclusion of World War II.\n\nThe legacy of Nazi animal welfare laws is controversial. Some critics of animal rights use the historical link with Nazism to condemn the modern animal rights movement, by way of a fallacious argument of guilt by association. On the other hand, supporters of animal rights often deny the historical link between Nazism and animal welfare. The current animal welfare laws in Germany are diluted versions of the laws introduced by the Nazis.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, kosher butchering and vivisection (animal experimentation) were the main concerns of the German animal welfare movement. The Nazis adopted these concerns as part of their political platform. According to Boria Sax, the Nazis rejected anthropocentric reasons for animal protection—animals were to be protected for their own sake. In 1927, a Nazi representative to the Reichstag called for actions against cruelty to animals and kosher butchering.\n\nIn 1931, the Nazi Party (then a minority in the Reichstag) proposed a ban on vivisection, but the ban failed to attract bipartisan support. By 1933, after Hitler had ascended to the Chancellery and the Nazis had consolidated control of the Reichstag, the Nazis immediately held a meeting to enact the ban on vivisection. On April 21, 1933, almost immediately after the Nazis came to power, the parliament began to pass laws for the regulation of animal slaughter. On April 21, a law was passed concerning the slaughter of animals; no animals were to be slaughtered without anesthetic. \n\nOn April 24, Order of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior was enacted regarding the slaughter of poikilotherms. Germany was the first nation to ban vivisection. A law imposing total ban on vivisection was enacted on August 16, 1933, by Hermann Göring as the prime minister of Prussia. He announced an end to the \"unbearable torture and suffering in animal experiments\" and said that those who \"still think they can continue to treat animals as inanimate property\" will be sent to concentration camps. On August 28, 1933, Göring announced in a radio broadcast:\n\nGöring also banned commercial animal trapping and imposed severe restrictions on hunting. He prohibited boiling of lobsters and crabs. In one incident, he sent a fisherman to a concentration camp for cutting up a bait frog.\n\nOn November 24, 1933, Nazi Germany enacted another law called \"Reichstierschutzgesetz\" (Reich Animal Protection Act), for protection of animals. This law listed many prohibitions against the use of animals, including their use for filmmaking and other public events causing pain or damage to health, feeding fowls forcefully and tearing out the thighs of living frogs. The two principals (\"Ministerialräte\") of the German Ministry of the Interior, Clemens Giese and Waldemar Kahler, who were responsible for drafting the legislative text, wrote in their juridical comment from 1939, that by the law the animal was to be \"protected for itself\" (\"um seiner selbst willen geschützt\"), and made \"an object of protection going far beyond the hitherto existing law\" (\"Objekt eines weit über die bisherigen Bestimmungen hinausgehenden Schutzes\").\n\nOn February 23, 1934, a decree was enacted by the Prussian Ministry of Commerce and Employment which introduced education on animal protection laws at primary, secondary and college levels. On 3 July 1934, a law \"Das Reichsjagdgesetz\" (The Reich Hunting Law) was enacted which limited hunting. The act also created the German Hunting Society with a mission to educate the hunting community in ethical hunting. On July 1, 1935, another law \"Reichsnaturschutzgesetz\" (Reich Nature Conservation Act) was passed to protect nature. According to an article published in \"Kaltio\", one of the main Finnish cultural magazines, Nazi Germany was the first state in the world to place the wolf under protection. Nazi Germany \"introduced the first legislation for the protection of wolves.\"\n\nIn 1934, Nazi Germany hosted an international conference on animal welfare in Berlin. On March 27, 1936, an order on the slaughter of living fish and other poikilotherms was enacted. On March 18 the same year, an order was passed on afforestation and on protection of animals in the wild. On September 9, 1937, a decree was published by the Ministry of the Interior which specified guidelines for the transportation of animals. In 1938, the Nazis introduced animal protection as a subject to be taught in public schools and universities in Germany.\n\nAlthough various laws were enacted for animal protection, the extent to which they were enforced has been questioned. The law enacted by Hermann Göring on August 16, 1933 banning vivisection was revised by a decree of September 5 of that year, with more lax provisions, then allowing the Reich Interior Ministry to distribute permits to some universities and research institutes to conduct animal experiments under conditions of anesthesia and scientific need. According to \"Pfugers Archiv für die Gesamte Physiologie\" (Pfugers Archive for the Total Physiology), a science journal at that time, there were many animal experiments during the Nazi regime. In 1936, the \"Tierärztekammer\" (Chamber of Veterinarians) in Darmstadt filed a formal complaint against the lack of enforcement of the animal protection laws on those who conducted illegal animal testing.\n\nAnimal rights activist Boria Sax argues in his book \"Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust\" that the Nazis manipulated attitudes towards animal protection to conform to their own symbolic system. Presumably, by equating the National Socialist German Workers Party with \"nature\", the Nazis reduced ethical issues to biological questions.\n\nScholars who argue that the Nazis were not authentic supporters of animal rights point out that the Nazi regime disbanded some organizations advocating environmentalism or animal protection. These organizations, such as the 100,000-member strong Friends of Nature, were disbanded because they advocated Marxism or other political ideologies that were illegal under Nazi law.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "231263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231263", "title": "Benjamin Jowett", "text": "Benjamin Jowett\n\nBenjamin Jowett (, modern variant ; 15 April 1817 – 1 October 1893) was renowned as an influential tutor and administrative reformer in the University of Oxford, a theologian and translator of Plato and Thucydides. He was Master of Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nJowett was born in Peckham, Kent, and grew up in Camberwell, the third of nine children. His father was a furrier originally from a Yorkshire family that, for three generations, had been supporters of the Evangelical movement in the Church of England; and an author of a metrical translation of the Old Testament Psalms. His mother was a Langhorne, related to John Langhorne, the poet and translator of Plutarch. At twelve, Jowett was placed on the foundation of St Paul's School (then in St Paul's Churchyard) where he soon gained a reputation as a precocious classical scholar. Aged eighteen he was awarded an open scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his life. He went up in 1836, and was quickly recognized as one of the leading Oxford Dons of his generation, made a Fellow while still an undergraduate in 1838; he graduated with first-class honours in 1839. This was at the height of the Oxford Tractarian movement: through the friendship of W. G. Ward he was drawn for a time in the direction of High Anglicanism; but a stronger and more lasting influence was that of the Arnold school, represented by A. P. Stanley. The controversy caused Jowett to withdraw from High Table at college to lodgings in Broad Street.\n\nAs early as 1839, Stanley had joined with Archibald Campbell Tait, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, in advocating certain university reforms. From 1846 onwards, Jowett threw himself into this movement, which in 1848 became general amongst the younger and more thoughtful fellows, until it took effect in the commission of 1850 and the act of 1854. Jowett then concentrated on theology: he spent the summers of 1845 and 1846 in Germany with Stanley, and became an eager student of German criticism and speculation. His views became more than radical, they were heretical, which severely curtailed prospects for advancement within the walls of the conformity of Anglican Oxford. Amongst the writings of that period he was most impressed by those of F.C. Baur. But he never ceased to exercise an independent judgment, and his work on St Paul, which appeared in 1855, was the result of much original reflection and inquiry. Benjamin Jowett found a friend and correspondent in Florence Nightingale, but whether there was any romantic attachment is unclear. It has been suggested that he belatedly proposed marriage, but was rejected, and lived the latter part of his life in regret that never knew matrimonial bliss. Jowett's didactic and pedagogic nature tended him towards instruction of her complicated character accusing her of exaggeration, an emotional intensity occasioned by hysteria. He was a father figure, paternalistic towards a deeply conservative woman, religious, self-censoring and strict in her conduct. Another educational reform, the opening of the Indian Civil Service to competition, took place at the same time, and Jowett was one of the commission. He had two brothers, William and Alfred who had served and died in India, and he never ceased to take a deep and practical interest in Indian affairs. After the Second Royal Commission in May 1859 he called Philomela 'the Governess of Governors of India' for her robust dealings with the poor conditions in Calcutta \"the natives themselves...educated to cleanliness & health by the enforcement of sanitary regulations in the large towns.\" When an old man he visited Claydons, where Margaret Verney donated him a print portrait of Florence which he later bequested in his will to Somerville College. A. Sorabji, an Indian writer, was a student barrister at Somerville College in 1890s, when the Master of Balliol, pointing to the picture declared her love for him: the story was never confirmed. In another story entirely Margot Tennant later wife of Henry Asquith, befriended Jowett, only to learn that he had had a \"violent...very violent\" relationship with Nightingale. Jowett was an \"éminence grise\" of liberal theology but could be somewhat chaotic in his recollections.\n\nJowett was appointed to the Regius Professorship of Greek in autumn 1855. He had been a tutor of Balliol and a clergyman since 1842 and had devoted himself to the work of tuition: his pupils became his friends for life. He discerned their capabilities and taught them to know themselves. This made him a reputation as \"the great tutor.\"\n\nA great disappointment, his repulse for the mastership of Balliol, also in 1854, appears to have roused him into the completion of his book on \"The Epistles of St Paul\". This work, described by one of his friends as \"a miracle of boldness,\" is full of originality and suggestiveness, but its publication awakened against him a storm of theological opposition from the Orthodox Evangelicals, which followed him more or less through life. Instead of yielding to this, he joined with Henry Bristow Wilson and Rowland Williams, who had been similarly attacked, in the production of the volume known as \"Essays and Reviews\". This appeared in 1860 and gave rise to a strong outbreak of criticism. Jowett's loyalty to those who were prosecuted on this account was no less characteristic than his persistent silence while the augmentation of his salary as Greek professor was withheld. This persecution was continued until 1865, when E.A. Freeman and Charles Elton discovered by historical research that a breach of the conditions of the professorship had occurred, and Christ Church, Oxford raised the endowment from £40 a year to £500. Jowett was one of the recipients of Nightingale's three volume work \"Suggestions for Thought\" for proof-reading and criticism. In the third volume of \"Essays and Reviews\" he contributed \"On the Interpretation of Scripture\" in which he attempted to reconcile her assertion that religion was law and could be unified with science. Her radical thoughts on women's place in the home, and his departure from liberal Anglican theology helped to block his career advancement for a decade to the Mastership of Balliol. By 1860, he was already Regius Professor of Greek and a Fellow of Balliol, but an increase in his stipend was withheld. While the work gained fulsome praise from philosopher-politician John Stuart Mill, it profoundly shook the more traditional establishment's fervent belief that the working-classes would continue to worship in parish churches. Recognition that this was no longer so, was just one of the theological departures. In October 1862 he was invited to Oak Hill Park to offer Florence the sacrament. Accepting the prospect with relish, he nonetheless consulted with Archbishop Tait for permission. Many of his letters to her and Mrs Bracebridge have survived; their religion was tinged with a mutual respect for their shared common interests and intellectual gifts. Also included is an unflattering description of a middle-aged man.\n\nMeanwhile, Jowett's influence at Oxford had steadily increased; he had his favourites. It culminated when the country clergy, provoked by the final acquittal of the essayists, had voted in convocation against the endowment of the Greek chair. Jowett's pupils, who were now drawn from the university at large, supported him with enthusiasm. He made friends with the Freemantles (related to Gladstone's minister, Grant Duff), and the Verneys at Claydons. On holiday in Derbyshire he would write to them and Florence describing his findings at Lea Hurst in 1864. One historian has identified his relations with her being most intense 1863 to 1866: in April 1864, he had advised Florence Nightingale to prevent Garibaldi, her world-famous guest, from stirring up trouble in Italy. This coincided with a big philosophical argument in which they were poles apart: there were three major pieces of sanitary legislation, the Contagious Diseases Acts which in 1870 came under fire from Josephine Butler, a feminist and social reformer, who wished their repeal. The rational theologian in Jowett warned Nightingale to ignore those \"on the wrong tack\". Rising incidents of venereal disease posed a moral question about whether to regulate prostitution, when men still might die from the infection. Policing of the health conditions became a case for which women's rights campaigners demanded repeal, they launched a vociferous attack in the press on amongst other, Jowett. He was a compassionate man, visiting the selfless Hilary Bonham Carter dying from cancer, in May 1865 administering his own brand of prayer and kindness. He was a staunch critic of the Poor Laws that condemned the poor, sick, and vulnerable to appalling degradation, left people to starve. In London alone in 1866 there 21,500 patients with no trained nurses. But his influence could be profound in 1874 he criticised her impending Report of Land Tenure in India to the extent that it was never published because she \"could lose influence\".\n\nIn the midst of other labours, Jowett had been quietly exerting his influence so as to conciliate all shades of liberal opinion, and bring them to bear upon the abolition of the theological test, which was still required for the M.A. and other degrees, and for university and college offices. He spoke at an important meeting upon this question in London on 10 June 1864, which laid the ground for the University Tests Act of 1871, directly after he had made as Master, Balliol College \"a sort of heaven on earth\" in 1870. The liberal reforms to college commenced radical scientific enquiries into the nature of man's existence questioning empirical data on the basis of findings the meaning of Christianity and its very existence. The shock waves reverberated through the liberal establishment into the founding of the Labour Party and the New Liberalism of the Great War.\n\nIn connection with the Greek professorship, Jowett had undertaken a work on Plato which grew into a complete translation of the \"Dialogues\" with introductory essays, for which Florence Nightingale's criticism was gratefully received. At this he laboured in vacation time for at least ten years. He argued that platonic love between men was devoid of sexual activity, though Walter Pater would later disagree. He showed no interest in offering his own opinion on God, theology in his translations, in several editions of Plato's works. The educated middle-classes were looking for an answer to how Plato could be relevant to Victorians. But his interest in theology had not abated, and his thoughts found an outlet in occasional preaching. The university pulpit, indeed, was closed to him, but several congregations in London delighted in his sermons, and from 1866 until the year of his death he preached annually in Westminster Abbey, where Stanley had become Dean in 1863. Three volumes of selected sermons were published posthumously. The years 1865–70 were occupied with assiduous teaching and writing.\n\nAmongst his pupils at Balliol were men destined to high positions in the state, whose parents had thus shown their confidence in the supposed heretic, and gratitude on this account was added to other motives for his unsparing efforts in tuition. In 1870, Robert Scott, Master of Balliol College, was promoted to the deanery of Rochester and Jowett, finally after years of trying, was elected to the vacant Mastership by the fellows of Balliol. Jowett attributed this arrangement to his liberal friend Robert Lowe, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke (at that time a member of Gladstone's ministry). From the vantage-ground of this long-coveted position the Plato was published in 1871. It had a great and well-deserved success. While scholars criticized particular renderings (and there were many small errors to be removed in subsequent editions), it was generally agreed that he had succeeded in making Plato an English classic.\n\nFrom 1866, his authority in Balliol had been paramount, and various reforms in college had been due to his initiative. The opposing minority were now powerless, and the younger fellows who had been his pupils were more inclined to follow him than others would have been. There was no obstacle to the continued exercise of his firm and reasonable will. He still knew the undergraduates individually, and watched their progress with a vigilant eye. His influence in the University was less assured. The pulpit of St Mary's, the University church, was no longer closed to him, but the success of Balliol in the schools gave rise to jealousy in other colleges, and old prejudices did not suddenly give way; while a new movement in favour of \"the endowment of research\" ran counter to his immediate purposes.\n\nMeanwhile, the tutorships in other colleges, and some of the headships also, were being filled with Balliol men, and Jowett's former pupils were prominent in both houses of parliament and at the bar. He continued the practice, which he had commenced in 1848, of taking with him a small party of undergraduates in vacation time, and working with them in one of his favourite haunts, at Askrigg in Wensleydale, or Tummel Bridget or later at West Malvern. Included in this list was Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge who became recognised as equal to the great classical scholar Theodor Mommsen. The new hall (1876), the organ there, entirely his gift (1835) and the cricket ground (1889), remain as external monuments of the master's activity. Neither business nor the many claims of friendship interrupted literary work. The six or seven weeks of the long vacation, during which he had pupils with him, were mainly employed in writing. The translation of Aristotle's \"Politics\", the revision of Plato, and, above all, the translation of Thucydides many times revised, occupied several years. The edition of the \"Republic\", undertaken in 1856, remained unfinished, but was continued with the help of Professor Lewis Campbell.\n\nOther literary plans were not to take effect — an \"Essay on the Religions of the World\", a \"Commentary on the Gospels\", a \"Life of Christ\", a volume on \"Moral Ideas\". Such plans were frustrated, not only by his practical avocations, but by his determination to finish what he had begun, and the fastidious self-criticism which it took so long to satisfy. The book on \"Morals\" might, however, have been written but for the heavy burden of the vice-chancellorship, which he was induced to accept in 1882, by the hope, only partially fulfilled, of securing many improvements for Oxford University. The Vice-Chancellor was \"ex officio\" a delegate of the Oxford University Press, where he hoped to effect much; and a plan for draining the Thames Valley, which he had now the power of initiating, was one on which his mind had dwelt for many years.\n\nHowever, one plan that certainly came to fruition to great applause was the co-operation with Florence Nightingale to bring a lecture tour to Oxford for undergraduates training in the agricultural sciences for the Indian Civil Service. It was supported by economist Arnold Toynbee, also at Balliol, and W R Robertson, Principal of Madras Agricultural College. For the first time, Indians would receive a proper education in the technical aspects of forestry and farming.\n\nThe exhausting labours of the vice-chancellorship were followed by illness (1887); after this he relinquished the hope of producing any great original writing. His literary industry was thenceforth confined to a commentary on the \"Republic\" of Plato, and some essays on Aristotle which were to have formed a companion volume to the translation of the \"Politics\". The essays which should have accompanied the translation of Thucydides were never written. Jowett, who never married, died on 1 October 1893 in Oxford. The funeral was one of the most impressive ever seen in that city. The pall-bearers were seven heads of colleges and the provost of Eton, all old pupils.\n\nTheologian, tutor, University reformer, renowned Master of an Oxford college, Jowett's best claim to the remembrance of succeeding generations was his greatness as a moral teacher. Many of the most prominent Englishmen of the day were his pupils and owed much of what they were to his precept and example, his penetrative sympathy, his insistent criticism, and his unwearying friendship. Seldom have ideal aims been so steadily pursued with so clear a recognition of practical limitations. \"Dear (tho perfidious) Professor\" Jowett's theological work was transitional; yet has an element of permanence, \"Mr Jowett put as much of his genius into Plato as Plato did into Mr Jowett', eulogised Florence Nightingale on her old friend.\n\nAs has been said of another thinker, he was \"one of those deeply religious men who, when crude theological notions are being revised and called in question seek to put new life into theology by wider and more humane ideas.\" In earlier life he had been a zealous student of Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel, and to the end he never ceased to cultivate the philosophic spirit; but he had little confidence in metaphysical systems, and sought rather to translate philosophy into the wisdom of life. As a classical scholar, his scorn of littlenesses sometimes led him into the neglect of minutiae, but he had the higher merit of interpreting ideas. A well-known Balliol rhyme about him runs:\n\nJowett is buried in St Sepulchre's Cemetery off Walton Street in Oxford.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17665107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17665107", "title": "Catholic Marian music", "text": "Catholic Marian music\n\nRoman Catholic Marian music shares a trait with some other forms of Christian music in adding another emotional dimension to the process of veneration and in being used in various Marian ceremonies and feasts. Marian music is now an \"inherent element\" in many aspects of the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Roman Catholic Mariology.\n\nThroughout the centuries Marian music has grown and progressed, and witnessed a resurgence along with the Renaissance, e.g. with the composition of the Ave Maria motet by Josquin des Prez. The tradition continued with a number of great composers up to the late 19th century, e.g. with Giuseppe Verdi's \"Ave Maria\" in 1880 followed by his \"Laudi alla Vergine Maria\".\n\nOne of the oldest Marian intonations is credited to Saint Ambrose of Milan (339-374). The Church names an ancient liturgy after him (Ambrosian Rite), which is actually older but nonetheless traditionally attributed to him. Some 870 parishes in the diocese of Milan still use the ancient Ambrosian rite. Several Ambrosian rite Marian texts were intonated, for example the famous Gaude:\n\nMarian hymns by Ambrose include the \"Confractorium\" from the Christmas liturgy and in a poetic creation of Saint Ambrose celebrating the Mother of God: \"Intende, qui Regis Israel.\"\n\nOne of the earliest medieval Marian compositions is the popular Salve Regina in Latin from a Benedictine monk at the Reichenau Island (Lake Constance), which exists in several Gregorian versions. The liturgy of the hour includes several offices to be sung. At the close of the Office, one of four \"Marian antiphons\" is sung. These songs, \"Alma Redemptoris Mater, Ave Regina Caelorum, Regina Coeli,\" and \"Salve Regina\", have been described as \"among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages.\"\n\nOther Marian supplications exist in numerous Latin versions as well. It is difficult to trace the beginning of non-Gregorian Marian liturgical music. In the year 1277 Pope Nicholas III prescribed rules for liturgy in Roman churches. Three years later, in 1280, Petrus de Cruce published his Marian anthem \"Ave virgo regia, Ave gloriosa O maria Maris stella.\" Later, composer Pérotin followed with his \"Alleluja, Navitatis gloriosae virginis,\" to be sung at the feast of the birth of Mary. Marian motets became very popular in the Middle Ages, a large collection of which is in St. Paul Cathedral in London. Pope John XXII (1316–34) issued the apostolic constitution \"Docta SS Patrum\" about Church music. It was the first modern music regulations for musical presentation during the liturgy\n\nMonteverdi's \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" contains distinctly Marian texts among its 13 movements, though the composer's intention for the work as a whole is debated. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed in honour of the Virgin Mary Latin Masses and several shorter operas. Other known classic composers with Marian compositions mainly in Latin include Orlando di Lasso and Franz Schubert.\n\nVivaldi, Monteverdi, Mozart, Haydn, and others are well-known composers who contributed to Marian music. Less known is the fact that before 1802, the secularisation, many religious congregations had their own composers. A totally unknown Father Valentin Rathgeber, OSB, (1682–1750) wrote 43 Masses, 164 offertories, 24 concerts, and 44 Marian antiphones. \"Missa de Beata Virgine\" and the Messe de Nostre Dame are examples of individual contributions. Monteverdi's \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" has remained structurally unchanged for the past 1500 years. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed in honour of the Virgin Mary Latin Masses and several shorter operas. Other known classic composers with Marian compositions mainly in Latin include Orlando di Lasso and Franz Schubert.\n\nIn 12th century France the tradition began of Christmas dramas, in which the nativity events are reproduced by actors. This became popular in other European countries and is seen as the origin of popular Christmas carols, which were an integral part of the Christmas drama. These early Christmas songs are largely devotions to the Mother of God. Early manifestations are in Bavaria in the 12th century. At the same time, Easter songs are often converted into Marian hymns, for example the hymn \"Te virgini Mariae laudes concinant Christianae\". The assumption of Mary is praised in numerous songs from the 10th century, In several songs, Mary is praised to be above all saints and angels and participates in the kingdom of her son. Her assumption is “wished by the faithful people” in a song from the 12th century. The Marian songs and hymns in this epoch are too numerous to mention. They include pious excitement, even some exaggerations, and valuable insights into the Marian belief, especially in the assumption.\n\nExamples of Ave (Hail Mary) songs include: \n\nExamples of Salve songs include:\n\nGaude (Rejoice) hymns include:\n\nVale (farewell) and Mater dolorosa (mother of sorrows) are also subjects of numerous Marian hymns.\n\nIt seems that settings of the Ordinary of the Mass are a latter development than Liturgy of the Hours music . Modern Kyriales designate two Gregorian chant Mass settings for Marian feasts, \"In solemnitatibus et Festis Beatae Mariae Virginis \"and\" in Festis et Memoriis\". Before the Council of Trent the \"Gloria\" of the first of these contained the trope \"Spiritus et alme orphanorum paraclete\", heard in Josquin's \"Missa de Beata Virgine\" but not in Machault's Messe de Nostre Dame which was written as a Votive Mass. The list of compositions by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina includes numerous Marian masses:\n\n\nThe Marian music in the baroque period is strongly influenced by the Latin tradition, but develops its own characteristics. Marian songs venerate her exceptional sanctity. Many Marian songs have the form of litanies, expressing veneration of Mary. Others moralize the faithful in light of her virtuous life. In Poland and Hungary, baroque Marian compositions stress her national protective powers for the Polish and Hungarian nation, an aspect largely missing in Italy, France, and Germany, where Mary is likely to be called upon to protect a city or region rather than a nation. Many Latin Marian hymns are now translated into a vernacular language, especially in Germany under the influence of Lutheran use of the vernacular in liturgy. Latin texts are often enriched with flowery reverences and Marian praises. Like Marian poetry, Marian music has flourished most in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France, countries uninfluenced by the reformation.\n\nBefore the German secularisations of 1802 many religious congregations had their own composers. In the monastery of Andechs, Father Nonnosus Madleder, in Ottobeuren, Father Franx Schnizer, in Irsee, Father Meinrad Spiess, and in Banz, Father Valentin Rathgeber, OSB, (1682–1750): 43 Masses, 164 offertories, 24 concerts, and 44 Marian antiphones. \n\nBesides the above-mentioned Vespers, Joseph Haydn wrote several Marian compositions including two famous Marian Masses, the \"Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae,\" No. 5 in E flat major, also known as the \"Grosse Orgelmesse\" (Great Organ Mass) (H. 22/4) (1766) and the \"Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae\" No. 3 in C major (H. 22/5) (1766–73).\n\nSeveral motets by Anton Bruckner are related to Mary, including three settings of Ave Maria. Max Reger composed the motet \"Unser lieben Frauen Traum\" in 1914.\n\nFrancis Poulenc composed \"Litanies à la Vierge Noire\" and a Stabat Mater in 1950. Arvo Pärt composed several works related to Mary, including a Magnificat in 1989 and a Salve Regina in 2001.\n\nThe Franciscan Helmut Schlegel wrote in 2009 a hymn, \"Glauben können wie du\", addressing Mary and wanting to imitate her virtues faith, hope and love. It was included in 2015 in an oratorio, \"Laudato si'\", which narrates stations of her life, quoting the Magnificat.\n\n"}

Examples include \"Nazi\"→\"N*z*\", \"evolution\"→\"*v*l*t**n\", \"gun control\"→\"g*n c*ntr*l\". \"The purpose is not to make the word unrecognizable but to make it a mention rather than a use.\" The term \"disemvoweling\" —attested from 1990 — was occasionally used for the splat-out of vowels.\n\nTeresa Nielsen Hayden used the vowel-deletion technique in 2002 for internet forum moderation on her blog \"Making Light\". This was termed \"disemvoweling\" by Arthur D. Hlavaty later in the same thread.\n\nNielsen Hayden joined the group blog \"Boing Boing\" as community manager in August 2007\n, when it re-enabled comments on its posts, and implemented disemvoweling. Gawker Media sites adopted disemvoweling as a moderation tool in August 2008. On 30 October 2008, \"TIME\" magazine listed disemvoweling as #42 of their \"Top 50 Inventions of 2008\".\n\nXeni Jardin, co-editor of \"Boing Boing\", said of the practice, \"the dialogue stays, but the misanthrope looks ridiculous, and the emotional sting is neutralized.\" Also, \"Boing Boing\" producers claim that disemvoweling sends a clear message to internet forums as to types of behavior that are unacceptable.\n\nIn July 2008, \"New York Times\" reporter Noam Cohen criticized disemvoweling as a moderation tool, citing a June 2008 dispute about the deletion of all posts on \"Boing Boing\" that mentioned sex columnist Violet Blue\n. In the \"Boing Boing\" comment threads resulting from this controversy, Nielsen Hayden used the disemvoweling technique. Cohen noted that disemvoweling was \"Not quite censorship, but not quite unfettered commentary either.\" A subsequent unsigned case study on online crisis communication asserted that \"removing the vowels from participants’ comments only increased the gulf between the editors and the community\" during the controversy.\n\nMatt Baumgartner, a blogger at the Albany \"Times Union\", reported in August 2009 that the newspaper's lawyers had told him to stop disemvoweling comments.\n\nNielsen Hayden originally disemvoweled postings manually, using Microsoft Word. Because the letter Y is sometimes a vowel and sometimes a consonant, there are a variety of ways to treat it. Nielsen Hayden's policy was never to remove Y, in order to maintain legibility.\n\nThe technique has been facilitated by plug-in filters to automate the process. The first, for MovableType, was written in 2002; others are available for WordPress and other content management systems.\n"}

The term is often used in reference to a more general discipline, as, for example, in describing a software engineer who has general knowledge of programming, as well as domain knowledge about the pharmaceutical industry. People who have domain knowledge, are often considered specialists or experts in the field.\n\nIn software engineering \"domain knowledge\" is knowledge about the environment in which the target system operates, for example, software agents. Domain knowledge usually must be learned from software users in the domain (as domain specialists/experts), rather than from software developers. It may include user workflows, data pipelines, business policies, configurations and constraints and is crucial in the development of a software application. Expert’s domain knowledge (frequently informal and ill-structured) is transformed in computer programs and active data, for example in a set of rules in knowledge bases, by knowledge engineers.\n\nCommunicating between end-users and software developers is often difficult. They must find a common language to communicate in. Developing enough shared vocabulary to communicate can often take a while.\n\nThe same knowledge can be included in different domain knowledge.\nKnowledge which may be applicable across a number of domains is called \"domain-independent\" knowledge, for example logics and mathematics.\nOperations on domain knowledge are performed by meta-knowledge.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1003483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1003483", "title": "Epistemic theories of truth", "text": "Epistemic theories of truth\n\nIn philosophy, epistemic theories of truth are attempts to analyze the notion of truth in terms of epistemic notions such as knowledge, belief, acceptance, verification, justification, and perspective. \n\nA variety of such conceptions can be classified into verificationist theories, perspectivalist or relativist theories, and pragmatic theories.\n\nVerificationism is based on verifying propositions. The distinctive claim of verificationism is that the result of such verifications is, by definition, truth. That is, truth is reducible to this process of verification.\nAccording to perspectivalism and relativism, a proposition is only true relative to a particular perspective. Roughly, a proposition is true relative to a perspective if and only if it is accepted, endorsed, or legitimated by that perspective.\n\nMany authors writing on the topic of the notion of truth advocate or endorse combinations of the following positions. Each of these epistemic conceptions of truth can be subjected to various criticisms. Some criticisms apply across the board, while others are more specific.\n\nThe two main kinds of verification philosophies are positivism and a-priorism.\n\nIn positivism, a proposition is meaningful, and thus capable of being true or false, if and only if it is verifiable by sensory experiences.\n\nA-priorism, often used in the domains of logic and mathematics, holds a proposition true if and only if \"a priori\" reasoning can verify it. In the related certainty theory, associated with Descartes and Spinoza, a proposition is true if and only if it is known with certainty.\n\nLogical positivism attempts to combine positivism with a version of a-priorism.\n\nAnother theory of truth which is related to a-priorism is the concept-containment theory of truth. The concept-containment theory of truth is the view that a proposition is true if and only if the concept of the predicate of the proposition is \"contained in\" the concept of the subject. For example, the proposition that bachelors are unmarried men is true, on this view, because the concept of the predicate (unmarried men) is contained in the concept of the subject (bachelor). A contemporary reading of the concept-containment theory of truth is to say that every true proposition is an analytically true proposition.\n\nAccording to perspectivalism and relativism, a proposition is only true relative to a particular perspective. The Sophists' relativist and Nietzsche's philosophy are some of the most famous examples of such perspectivalism. There are four main versions of perspectivalism, and some interesting subdivisions:\n\nAccording to individual perspectivalism, perspectives are the points of view of particular individual persons. So, a proposition is true for a person if and only if it is accepted or believed by that person (i.e., \"true for me\").\n\nAccording to discourse perspectivalism, a perspective is simply any system of discourse, and it is a matter of convention which one chooses. A proposition is true relative to that particular discourse if and only if it is somehow produced (or \"legitimated\") by the methods of that particular discourse. An example of this appears in the philosophy of mathematics: formalism. A proposition is true relative to a set of assumptions just in case it is a deductive consequence of those assumptions.\n\nIn collectivist perspectivalism, perspectives are understood as collectivities of people (cultures, traditions, etc.). There are, roughly, three versions of collectivism:\n\nA perspective is, roughly, the broad opinions, and perhaps norms and practices, of a community of people, perhaps all having some special feature in common. So, a proposition is true (for a community C) if, and only if, there is a consensus amongst the members of C for believing it.\n\nIn the power-oriented view, a perspective is a community enforced by power, authority, military might, privilege, etc. So, a proposition is true if it \"makes us powerful\" or is \"produced by power\", thus the slogan \"truth is power\".\n\nThis view of truth as a political stake may be loosely associated with Heidegger or with Michel Foucault's specific analysis of historical and political discourse, as well as with some social constructivists.\n\nHowever, the Nazi mysticism of a communitarian \"Blood community\" conception radically differs from Heidegger or Foucault's criticism of the notion of the individual or collective subject.\n\nTruth-generating perspectives are collectives opposed to, or engaged in struggle against, power and authority. For example, the collective perspective of the \"proletariat\". So, proposition is true if it is the \"product of political struggle\" for the \"emancipation of the workers\" (Adorno). This view is again associated with some social constructivists (e.g., feminist epistemologists).\n\nOn this conception, a truth-conferring perspective is something transcendental, and outside immediate human reach. The idea is that there is a transcendental or ideal epistemic perspective and truth is, roughly, what is accepted or recognized-as-true from that ideal perspective. There are two subvarieties of transcendental perspectivalism:\n\nThe ideal epistemic perspective is the set of \"maximally coherent and consistent propositions\". A proposition is true if and only if it is a member of this maximally coherent and consistent set of propositions (associated with several German and British 19th century idealists).\n\nTheologically, the ideal epistemic perspective is that of God (\"God's point of view\"). From this perspective, a proposition is true if and only if it agrees with the thoughts of God.\n\nAlthough the pragmatic theory of truth is not strictly classifiable as an epistemic theory of truth, it does bear a relationship to theories of truth that are based on concepts of inquiry and knowledge.\n\nThe ideal epistemic perspective is that of \"completed science\", which will appear in the (temporal) \"limit of scientific inquiry\". A proposition is true if and only if, in the long run it will come to be accepted by a group of inquirers using scientific rational inquiry. This can also be modalized: a proposition is true if, and only if, in the long run it would come to be accepted by a group of inquirers, if they were to use scientific rational inquiry. This view is thus a modification of the consensus view. The consensus need to satisfy certain constraints in order for the accepted propositions to be true. For example, the methods used must be those of scientific inquiry (criticism, observation, reproducibility, etc.). This \"modification\" of the consensus view is an appeal to the correspondence theory of truth, which is opposed to the consensus theory of truth. \n\nLong-run scientific pragmatism was defended by Charles Sanders Peirce. A variant of this viewpoint is associated with Jürgen Habermas, though he later abandoned it.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3493628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3493628", "title": "Fruitlands (transcendental center)", "text": "Fruitlands (transcendental center)\n\nFruitlands was a Utopian agrarian commune established in Harvard, Massachusetts, by Amos Bronson Alcott and Charles Lane in the 1840s, based on Transcendentalist principles. An account of its less-than-successful activities can be found in \"Transcendental Wild Oats\" by Alcott's daughter Louisa May Alcott.\n\nLane purchased what was known as the Wyman farm and its , which also included a dilapidated house and barn. Residents of Fruitlands ate no animal substances, drank only water, bathed in unheated water and \"no artificial light would prolong dark hours or cost them the brightness of morning.\" Additionally, property was held communally, and no animal labor was used.\n\nThe community was short-lived and lasted only seven months. It was dependent on farming, which turned out to be too difficult. The original farmhouse, along with other historic buildings from the area, is now a part of Fruitlands Museum.\n\nAmos Bronson Alcott, a teacher and member of the New England Non-Resistance Society, came up with the idea of Fruitlands in 1841. He traveled to England the following year, where he hoped to find support and people to participate with him in the experiment. England was home to his strongest group of supporters, a group of educators who had founded the Alcott House, a school based on his philosophy of teaching. One of his supporters was Charles Lane, who journeyed with him to the United States on October 21, 1842.\n\nIn May 1843, Lane purchased the Wyman Farm in Harvard, Massachusetts for $1800. Though Alcott had come up with the idea of Fruitlands himself, he was not involved in purchasing the land, largely because he was penniless after the failure of his Temple School and his subsequent years in Concord, Massachusetts as a farmer. In July, Alcott announced their plans in \"The Dial\": \"We have made an arrangement with the proprieter of an estate of about a hundred acres, which liberates this tract from human ownership\". They had officially moved to the farm on June 1 and optimistically named it \"Fruitlands\" despite only ten old apple trees on the property.\n\nIn principle, the Fruitlands reformers did not believe in purchasing property; Lane said the following on the subject: \"We do not recognize the purchase of land; but its redemption from the debasing state of proprium, or property, to divine uses, we clearly understand; where those whom the world esteems owners are found yielding their individual rights to the Supreme Owner\" The commune attracted 14 residents, including the Alcott and Lane families. By July, the community had succeeded in planting of grains, one of vegetables, and one of melons. On July 8, Ralph Waldo Emerson visited along with Ellery Channing. Although he was impressed by the serenity of the site and the idea of hard work, he cautiously recorded, \"I will not prejudge them successful... They look well in July. We will see them in December.\"\n\nAlcott and Lane collaborated on a letter which was published in the \"New York Evening Tribune\" on September 1 and soon republished elsewhere. In the article, titled \"The Consociate Family Life\", the duo explained their main purpose was to improve society through \"simplicity in diet, plain garments, pure bathing, unsullied dwellings\".\n\nFruitlands ultimately failed the winter after it opened, largely due to food shortages and accompanying unrest in the inhabitants. The rigors of a New England winter proved too severe for the members of the Fruitlands.\n\nMany of Alcott's and Lane's ideas were derived from Transcendentalism. They were influenced by the Transcendental ideas of God not as the traditional view from the Bible but as a world spirit. Alcott's view of Transcendentalism was a sort of religious anarchism, a renunciation of the world to focus on the spirit. The members of Fruitlands believed that spiritual regeneration was linked to physical health, that \"outward abstinence is a sign of inward fullness\". Though it was based on working together as a community, Fruitlands also hoped for individualistic improvement. Alcott also believed in the perfect intuition of children and, therefore, put a strong emphasis on education and hoped that their innocence would have a rejuvenating effect on elders.\n\nFruitlands residents, who called themselves \"the consociate family\", wished to separate themselves from the world economy by refraining from trade, having no personal property, and not using hired labor. Alcott and Lane believed that the community could achieve complete freedom only by eliminating economic activity altogether. Alcott in particular believed the present economy was evil. To this end, they strove towards self-sufficiency by planning on growing all the food they would need themselves and making only the goods they needed. By accomplishing these two goals, they would eliminate the need to participate in trade or to purchase their food from the outside world. Initially, Bronson Alcott and Lane modeled their ideas about personal property off the Shakers, who held property communally. However, the Shakers were not completely self-sufficient; they traded their hand-made goods for coffee, tea, meat and milk. Bronson Alcott and Lane eliminated the need to trade for these supplies because they eliminated animal products and stimulants from their diets entirely.\n\nIn the end, the Fruitlands community had no effect on the economy of the outside world; Fruitlands allowed its residents to practice their ideals without forcing them to effect any real change.\n\nFruitlands residents began their days with a purging cold-water shower and subsisted on a simple diet containing no stimulants or animal products. They were vegans, excluding even milk and honey from their diets. “Neither coffee, tea, molasses, nor rice tempts us beyond the bounds of indigenous production,” Lane wrote. “No animal substances neither flesh, butter, cheese, eggs, nor milk pollute our tables, nor corrupt our bodies.” Diet was usually fruit and water; many vegetables—including carrots, beets, and potatoes—were forbidden because they showed a lower nature by growing downward. \n\nFruitlands members wore only linen clothes and canvas shoes; cotton fabric was forbidden because it exploited slave labor and wool was banned because it came from sheep. Bronson Alcott and Lane believed that animals should not be exploited for their meat or their labor, so they used no animals for farming. This arose out of two beliefs: that animals were less intelligent than humans and that, therefore, it was the duty of humans to protect them; and that using animals \"tainted\" their work and food, since animals were not enlightened and therefore unclean. Eventually, as the winter was coming, Alcott and Lane compromised and allowed an ox and a cow.\n\nThere were no formal admission requirements or procedures to join the community at Fruitlands, and there was no official record-keeping of members. Many residents stayed only for a short period of time and most lists are based on the journals of Alcott's wife Abby May. Residents of the Fruitlands came to be called \"consecrated cranks\" and followed strict principles and virtues. They strongly believed in the ideas of simplicity, sincerity, and brotherly love.\n\n\nThe biggest challenge at Fruitlands was farming. The community had arrived at the farm a month behind the planting schedule and only about of land were arable. The decision not to use animal labor on the farm proved to be the undoing of the commune, combined with the fact that many of the men of the commune spent their days teaching or philosophizing instead of working in the field. Using only their own hands, the Fruitlands residents were incapable of growing a sufficient amount of food to get them through the winter.\n\nFruitlands was also hampered by its structure. Alcott and Lane wielded nearly limitless authority and dictated very strict and repressive models for living. \"I am prone to indulge in an occasional hilarity\", wrote Alcott's wife Abby May, \"but seem frowned down into still quiet and peace-less order... [and] am almost suffocated in this atmosphere of restriction and form\".\nThe Fruitlands experiment ended only seven months after it began. According to Bronson Alcott, the inhabitants left Fruitlands in January 1844; his daughter, Louisa May, wrote that they left in December 1843, which is considered to be the more accurate date. Alcott was deeply dismayed by the failure of Fruitlands and, moving with his family to live with a nearby farmer, refused to eat for several days. Later, Ralph Waldo Emerson helped purchase a home for the family in Concord.\n\nFruitlands had only a brief opportunity to impact America and the Transcendentalist movement. After it had ended, the land was bought by one of its former participants, Joseph Palmer, who for 20 years used the site as a refuge for former reformers. The property was purchased in 1910 by Clara Endicott Sears, who opened the farmhouse to the public in 1914 as a museum. Today, the Fruitlands Museum also includes a museum on Shaker life, an art gallery of nineteenth-century paintings, and a museum of Native American art and crafts.\n\n\n"}

Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis allows the elimination of embryos and fetuses with intersex traits and thus has an impact on discrimination against intersex people.\n\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) refers to genetic evaluation of embryos and oocytes prior to implantation. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method also makes it possible to select embryos with intersex conditions for termination. Some national authorities, such as the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, maintain lists of conditions for which PGD is permissible, including intersex conditions such as 5 alpha reductase deficiency, androgen insensitivity syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and others.\n\nSurgical interventions on children with intersex conditions are contentious and may lead to selection for other traits like same sex attraction. Though elimination of those identified prenatally to be intersex may be morally permissible, Robert Sparrow states that intersex conditions are comparable to sexual orientation in that harms may be associated with a \"hostile social environment\". He concluded that the acceptability of elimination of intersex conditions has \"uncomfortable\" implications for \"other nonpathological human variations\" that do not affect physical health.\n\nOrganisation Intersex International Australia has quoted research showing pregnancy termination rates of up to 88% in 47,XXY even while the World Health Organization describes the trait as \"compatible with normal life expectancy\", and \"often undiagnosed\". In 2014, it called for the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council to prohibit such interventions, noting a \"close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature\". In 2016, the organization wrote about the sponsorship of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) events by IVF clinics in Australia, stating that, in addition to ethical issues raised by the elimination of intersex traits, \"sponsorship of \"LGBTI\" events by such businesses raises more ethical issues still, including the nature of community and comprehension of issues relating to intersex bodily diversity\".\n\nIn response to Sparrow, Georgiann Davis argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives, and that the \"intersex community is only \"invisible\" to those who choose to ignore it\", while \"the medical profession, not the intersex trait itself, is a major source of the social and psychological harm that perpetuates intersex stigmatization and the \"hostile social environment\" that individuals with intersex traits encounter\". Jeff Nisker links the elimination of intersex conditions to their pathologization, describing how \"[o]nce a difference becomes a medical disorder to which the medical profession is dedicating time and resources to prevent, procedures to this end become endowed with appropriateness\".\n\nJason Behrmann and Vardit Ravitsky state: \"Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity.\" In 2014, Morgan Carpenter expressed concern about intersex variations appeared in a list by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority of \"serious\" \"genetic conditions\" that may be de-selected in the United Kingdom. These include 5-alpha-reductase deficiency and androgen insensitivity syndrome, traits evident in elite Olympic-level women athletes and \"the world's first openly intersex mayor\".\n\nIn 2015, the Council of Europe published an Issue Paper on \"Human rights and intersex people\", remarking on a right to life:\n\nCurrently, prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent the physical and behavioral expression of intersex traits is available. In 1990, a paper by Heino Meyer-Bahlburg titled \"Will Prenatal Hormone Treatment Prevent Homosexuality?\" was published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology. It examined the use of \"prenatal hormone screening or treatment for the prevention of homosexuality\" using research conducted on foetuses with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and other traits.\n\nAlice Dreger, Ellen Feder, and Anne Tamar-Mattis describe how research published by Saroj Nimkarn and Maria New in 2010 constructs \"low interest in babies and men – and even interest in what they consider to be men's occupations and games – as \"abnormal\", and potentially preventable with prenatal dexamethasone\". The authors state that \"weak and unsupported conclusions\" of investigations into the attempted \"prevention of benign behavioral sex variations\" indicates gaps in the ethical management of clinical research.\n\nIn 2012, Hirvikoski and others described a lack of long-term follow-up studies of individuals exposed to prenatal treatment, and the results of a 10-year Swedish study of 43 mothers and children. The authors found evidence of unacceptable side-effects in their study, including neurological consequences. Treatment with dexamethasone was discontinued in Sweden.\n\n\n"}

Originally from Spain, Santayana was raised and educated in the United States from the age of eight and identified himself as an American, although he always kept a valid Spanish passport. He wrote in English and is generally considered an American man of letters. At the age of forty-eight, Santayana left his position at Harvard and returned to Europe permanently, never to return to the United States.\n\nSantayana is popularly known for aphorisms, such as \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\", \"Only the dead have seen the end of war\", and the definition of beauty as \"pleasure objectified\". Although an atheist, he treasured the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview in which he was raised. Santayana was a broad-ranging cultural critic spanning many disciplines.\n\nJorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás was born on December 16, 1863, in Madrid, and he spent his early childhood in Ávila, Spain. His mother, Josefina Borrás, was the daughter of a Spanish official in the Philippines, and Jorge was the only child of her second marriage.\n\nJosefina Borrás first husband was George Sturgis, a Boston merchant, with whom she had five children, two of whom died in infancy. She lived in Boston for a few years following her husband's death in 1857, but in 1861 moved with her three surviving children to live in Madrid. There she encountered Agustín Ruiz de Santayana, an old friend from her years in the Philippines. They married in 1862. A colonial civil servant, Ruiz de Santayana was also a painter and minor intellectual. The family lived in Madrid and Ávila.\n\nIn 1869 Josefina Borrás de Santayana returned to Boston with her three Sturgis children, because she had promised her first husband to raise the children in the United States. She left the six-year-old Jorge with his father in Spain. Jorge and his father followed her to Boston in 1872. However, his father, finding neither Boston nor his wife's attitude to his liking, soon returned alone to Ávila, and remained there the rest of his life. Jorge did not see him again until he entered Harvard College and began to take his summer vacations in Spain. Sometime during this period, Jorge's first name was anglicized as George, the English equivalent.\n\nSantayana attended Boston Latin School and Harvard College, where he studied under the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce and was involved in eleven clubs as an alternative to athletics. He was founder and president of the Philosophical Club, a member of the literary society known as the O.K., an editor and cartoonist for \"The Harvard Lampoon\", and co-founder of the literary journal \"The Harvard Monthly\". In December, 1885, he played the role of Lady Elfrida in the Hasty Pudding theatrical \"Robin Hood\", followed by the production \"Papillonetta\" in the spring of his senior year.\n\nAfter graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard in 1886, Santayana studied for two years in Berlin. He then returned to Harvard to write his dissertation on Hermann Lotze and teach philosophy, becoming part of the Golden Age of the Harvard philosophy department. Some of his Harvard students became famous in their own right, including T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Gertrude Stein, Horace Kallen, Walter Lippmann, and W. E. B. Du Bois. Wallace Stevens was not among his students but became a friend. From 1896 to 1897, Santayana studied at King's College, Cambridge.\n\nSantayana never married. His romantic life, if any, is not well understood. Some evidence, including a comment Santayana made late in life comparing himself to A. E. Housman, and his friendships with people who were openly homosexual and bisexual, has led scholars to speculate that Santayana was perhaps homosexual or bisexual himself, but it remains unclear whether he had any actual heterosexual or homosexual relationships.\n\nIn 1912, Santayana resigned his position at Harvard to spend the rest of his life in Europe. He had saved money and been aided by a legacy from his mother. After some years in Ávila, Paris and Oxford, after 1920, he began to winter in Rome, eventually living there year-round until his death. During his forty years in Europe, he wrote nineteen books and declined several prestigious academic positions. Many of his visitors and correspondents were Americans, including his assistant and eventual literary executor, Daniel Cory. In later life, Santayana was financially comfortable, in part because his 1935 novel, \"The Last Puritan\", had become an unexpected best-seller. In turn, he financially assisted a number of writers, including Bertrand Russell, with whom he was in fundamental disagreement, philosophically and politically.\nSantayana's one novel, \"The Last Puritan\", is a \"bildungsroman\", centering on the personal growth of its protagonist, Oliver Alden. His \"Persons and Places\" is an autobiography. These works also contain many of his sharper opinions and \"bons mots\". He wrote books and essays on a wide range of subjects, including philosophy of a less technical sort, literary criticism, the history of ideas, politics, human nature, morals, the influence of religion on culture and social psychology, all with considerable wit and humor.\n\nWhile his writings on technical philosophy can be difficult, his other writings are far more accessible and pithy. He wrote poems and a few plays, and left an ample correspondence, much of it published only since 2000. Like Alexis de Tocqueville, Santayana observed American culture and character from a foreigner's point of view. Like William James, his friend and mentor, he wrote philosophy in a literary way. Ezra Pound includes Santayana among his many cultural references in \"The Cantos\", notably in \"Canto LXXXI\" and \"Canto XCV\". Santayana is usually considered an American writer, although he declined to become an American citizen, resided in fascist Italy for decades, and said that he was most comfortable, intellectually and aesthetically, at Oxford University. Following 1935 and the writing of his only novel \"The Last Puritan\", he continued to winter in Rome, eventually living there year-round until his death in 1952.\n\nSantayana's main philosophical work consists of \"The Sense of Beauty\" (1896), his first book-length monograph and perhaps the first major work on aesthetics written in the United States; \"The Life of Reason\" five volumes, 1905–6, the high point of his Harvard career; \"Skepticism and Animal Faith\" (1923); and \"The Realms of Being\" (4 vols., 1927–40). Although Santayana was not a pragmatist in the mold of William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce, or John Dewey, \"The Life of Reason\" arguably is the first extended treatment of pragmatism written.\n\nLike many of the classical pragmatists, and because he was well-versed in evolutionary theory, Santayana was committed to metaphysical naturalism. He believed that human cognition, cultural practices, and social institutions have evolved so as to harmonize with the conditions present in their environment. Their value may then be adjudged by the extent to which they facilitate human happiness. The alternate title to \"The Life of Reason\", \"the Phases of Human Progress,\" is indicative of this metaphysical stance.\n\nSantayana was an early adherent of epiphenomenalism, but also admired the classical materialism of Democritus and Lucretius (of the three authors on whom he wrote in \"Three Philosophical Poets\", Santayana speaks most favorably of Lucretius). He held Spinoza's writings in high regard, calling him his \"master and model.\"\n\nAlthough an atheist, he held a fairly benign view of religion. Santayana's views on religion are outlined in his books \"Reason in Religion\", \"The Idea of Christ in the Gospels\", and \"Interpretations of Poetry and Religion\". Santayana described himself as an \"aesthetic Catholic.\" He spent the last decade of his life at the Convent of the Blue Nuns of the Little Company of Mary on the Celian Hill at 6 Via Santo Stefano Rotondo in Rome, where he was cared for by the Irish sisters.\n\nSantayana also held views of racial superiority and eugenic ideations discouraging the races he believed to be superior from \"intermarriage with inferior stock\".\n\nSantayana is remembered in large part for his aphorisms, many of which have been so frequently used as to have become clichéd. His philosophy has not fared quite as well. He is regarded by most as an excellent prose stylist, and Professor John Lachs (who is sympathetic with much of Santayana's philosophy) writes, in \"On Santayana\", that his eloquence may ironically be the very cause of this neglect.\n\nSantayana influenced those around him, including Bertrand Russell, whom Santayana single-handedly steered away from the ethics of G. E. Moore. He also influenced many prominent people such as Harvard students T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Gertrude Stein, Horace Kallen, Walter Lippmann, W. E. B. Du Bois, Conrad Aiken, Van Wyck Brooks, and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, as well as Max Eastman and the poet Wallace Stevens. Stevens was especially influenced by Santayana's aesthetics and became a friend even though Stevens did not take courses taught by Santayana.\n\nSantayana is quoted by the Canadian-American sociologist Erving Goffman as a central influence in the thesis of his famous book \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\" (1959). Religious historian Jerome A. Stone credits Santayana with contributing to the early thinking in the development of religious naturalism. English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead quotes Santayana extensively in his magnum opus \"Process and Reality\".\n\nChuck Jones used Santayana's description of fanaticism as \"redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim\" to describe his cartoons starring Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner.\nSantayana is referenced in the lyrics to singer Billy Joel's 1989 music single, \"We Didn't Start the Fire\".\n\nThe quote, \"Only the dead have seen the end of war,\" was misattributed to Plato in the 2001 war film \"Black Hawk Down\".\n\n\n\nPosthumous edited/selected works\n\nThe Works of George Santayana\n\nUnmodernized, critical editions of George Santayana’s published and unpublished writing. \"The Works\" is edited by the Santayana Edition and published by The MIT Press.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40851426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40851426", "title": "God becomes the Universe", "text": "God becomes the Universe\n\nThe belief that God became the Universe is a theological doctrine that has been developed several times historically, and holds that the creator of the universe actually became the universe. Historically, for versions of this theory where God has ceased to exist or to act as a separate and conscious entity, some have used the term pandeism, which combines aspects of pantheism and deism, to refer to such a theology. A similar concept is panentheism, which has the creator become the universe only in part, but remain in some other part transcendent to it, as well.\n\nMany ancient mythologies suggested that the world was created from the physical substance of a dead deity or a being of similar power. In Babylonian mythology, the young god Marduk slew Tiamat and created the known world from her body. Similarly, Norse mythology posited that Odin and his brothers, Vili and Vé defeated a frost giant, Ymir and then created the world from his skull. Chinese mythology of the Three Kingdoms era recounts the creation of elements of the physical world (mountains, rivers, the sun and moon, etc.) from the body of a creator called Pángǔ (盤古). Such stories did not go so far as to identify the designer of the world as being one as having used his or her own body to provide the material.\n\nBut, one such example exists in Polynesian myth, for in the islands of the Pacific, the idea of Supreme Deity manifests in a divinity that New Zealanders call Tangaroa, the Hawaiians Kanaroa, the Tongans and Samoans Tangaloa, the Georgian and Society islanders Taaroa. A native poetic definition of the Creator relates: \" He was; Taaroa was his name; he abode in the void. No earth, no sky, no men. Taaroa calls, but nought answers; and alone existing, he became the universe. The props are Taaroa; the rocks are Taaroa; the sands are Taaroa; it is thus he himself is named.\"\n\nReligious studies professor, Francis Edward Peters traced this idea to the philosophy of the Milesians, who had also pioneered knowledge of pantheism, in his 1967 \"Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon\", noting that \"[w]hat appeared... at the center of the Pythagorean tradition in philosophy, is another view of \"psyche\" that seems to owe little or nothing to the pan-vitalism or \"pan-deism\" that is the legacy of the Milesians.\n\nMilesian philosopher Anaximander in particular favored the use of rational principles to contend that everything in the world was formed of variations of a single substance (\"apeiron\"), which had been temporarily liberated from the primal state of the world. Friedrich Nietzsche, in his \"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\", stated that Anaximander viewed \"...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance.\" Anaximander was among the material monists, along with Thales, who believed that everything was composed of water, Anaximenes, who believed it was air, and Heraclitus, who believed it to be fire.\n\nGottfried Große in his 1787 interpretation of Pliny the Elder’s Natural History, describes Pliny, a first-century figure, as a pandeist as well.\n\nIn the 9th century, Johannes Scotus Eriugena proposed in his great work, \"De divisione naturae\" (also called \"Periphyseon\", probably completed around 867 AD), that the nature of the universe is divisible into four distinct classes:\n\nThe first is God as the ground or origin of all things, the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. One particularly controversial point made by Eriugena was that God was \"nothing\", in that God could not fall into any earthly classification. Eriugena followed the argument of Pseudo-Dionysius and from neo-Platonists such as Gaius Marius Victorinus that because God was above being, God was not a being: \"So supremely perfect is the essence of the Divinity that God is incomprehensible not only to us but also to Himself. For if He knew Himself in any adequate sense He should place Himself in some category of thought, which would be to limit Himself.\" A more contemporary statement of this idea is that: \"Since God is not a being, he is therefore not intelligible... This means not only that we cannot understand him, but also that he cannot understand himself. Creation is a kind of divine effort by God to understand himself, to see himself in a mirror.\"\n\nEriugena depicts God as an evolving being, developing through the four stages that he outlines. The second and third classes together compose the created universe, which is the manifestation of God, God in process, \"Theophania\"; the second being the world of Platonic ideas or forms. The third is the physical manifestation of God, having evolved through the realm of ideas and made those ideas seem to be matter, and may be pantheistic or pandeistic, depending on the interference attributed to God in the universe:\n\nThe divine system is thus distinguished by beginning, middle and end; but these are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of man's temporal limitations. This eternal process is viewed with finite comprehension through the form of time, forcing the application of temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal. Eriugena concludes this work with another controversial argument, and one that had already been scathingly rejected by Augustine of Hippo, that \"[n]ot only man, however, but everything else in nature is destined to return to God.\" Eriugena's work was condemned by a council at Sens by Honorius III (1225), who described it as \"swarming with worms of heretical perversity,\" and by Pope Gregory XIII in 1585. Such theories were thus suppressed for hundreds of years thence.\n\nGiordano Bruno conceived of a God who was immanent in nature, and for this very purpose was uninterested in human affairs (all such events being equally part of God). However, it was Baruch Spinoza in the 17th century who appears to have been the earliest to use deistic reason to arrive at the conception of a pantheistic God. Spinoza's God was deistic in the sense that it could only be proved by appeal to reason, but it was also one with the universe.\n\nUnlike Eriugena, Spinoza's pantheistic focus on the universe as it already existed did not address the possible creation of the universe from the substance of God, for Spinoza rejected the very possibility of changes in the form of matter required as a premise for such a belief.\n\n18th-century British philosopher Thomas Paine also approached this territory in his great philosophical treatise, \"The Age of Reason\", although Paine was concentrated on the deistic aspects of his inquiry. According to the Encyclopedia of American Philosophy \"Later Unitarian Christians (such as William Ellery Channing), transcendentalists (such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau), writers (such as Walt Whitman) and some pragmatists (such as William James) took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.\" It was Dutch naturalist Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn who first specifically detailed a religious philosophy incorporating deism and pantheism, in his four volume treatise, \"Java, seine Gestalt, Pflanzendecke, und sein innerer Bau\" (\"Images of Light and Shadow from Java's interior\") released anonymously between 1850 and 1854. Junghuhn's book was banned for a time in Austria and parts of Germany as an attack on Christianity. In 1884, theologian Sabine Baring-Gould would contend that Christianity itself demanded that the seemingly irreconcilable elements of pantheism and deism must be combined:\n\nWithin a decade after that, Andrew Martin Fairbairn similarly wrote that \"both Deism and Pantheism err because they are partial; they are right in what they affirm, wrong in what they deny. It is as antitheses that they are false; but by synthesis they may be combined or dissolved into truth\". Ironically, Fairbairn's criticism concluded that it was the presence of an active God that was missing from both concepts, rather than the rational explanation of God's motives and appearance of absence.\n\nIn 1838, Italian phrenologist Luigi Ferrarese in \"Memorie Riguardanti la Dottrina Frenologica\" (\"Thoughts Regarding the Doctrine of Phrenology\") attacked the philosophy of Victor Cousin as a doctrine which \"locates reason outside the human person, declaring man a fragment of God, introducing a sort of spiritual Pandeism, absurd for us, and injurious to the Supreme Being.\" Cousin had often been identified as a pantheist, but it was said that he repudiated that label on the basis that unlike Spinoza, Cousin asserted that \"he does not hold with Spinoza and the Eleatics that God is a pure substance, and not a cause.\"\nIn the 1940s, process theologian Charles Hartshorne identified pandeism as one of his many models of the possible nature of God, acknowledging that a God capable of change (as Hartshorne insisted God must be) is consistent with pandeism. Hartshorne preferred pandeism to pantheism, explaining that \"it is not really the theos that is described\". However, he specifically rejected pandeism early on in favor of a God whose characteristics included \"absolute perfection in some respects, relative perfection in all others\" or \"AR\", writing that this theory \"is able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism.\" Hartshorne accepted the label of panentheism for his beliefs, declaring that \"panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations\".\n\nIn 2001, Scott Adams published \"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment\", in which a fictional character puts forth a radical form of kenosis, surmising that an omnipotent God annihilated himself in the Big Bang, because God would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and would have to end that existence in order to complete his knowledge. Adams' protagonist asks about God, \"would his omnipotence include knowing what happens after he loses his omnipotence, or would his knowledge of the future end at that point?\" He proceeds from this question to the following analysis:\n\nAdams' God exists now as a combination of the smallest units of energy of which the universe is made (many levels smaller than quarks), which Adams called \"God Dust\", and the law of probability, or \"God's debris\", hence the title. The protagonist further proposes that God is in the process of being restored not through some process such as the Big Crunch, but because humankind itself is becoming God.\n\nThe 1976 Simon Raven novel, \"The Survivors\" includes an exchange between characters where one observes, \"God became the universe. Therefore the universe is God.\" while the other counters:\n\nSome theologians have criticised the notion of a Creator wholly becoming the universe. An example is William Walker Atkinson, in his \"Mastery of Being\":\n\nHe claims that if God were evolving or improving, being an infinite being, it would have to be traceable back to some point of having \"an infinitely undeveloped state and condition.\" But, this claim was made prior to the rise of scientific knowledge pinpointing the beginning of the universe in time, and connecting time with space, so that time would not exist as we know it prior to the universe existing. In Islam, a criticism is raised, wherein it is argued that \"from the juristic standpoint, obliterating the distinctions between God and the universe necessarily entails that in effect there can be no Sharia, since the deontic nature of the Law presupposes the existence of someone who commands (amir) and others who are the recipients of the command (ma'mur), namely God and his subjects.\"\n\nIn 1996, Pastor Bob Burridge of the Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies wrote in his \"Survey Studies in Reformed Theology\" an essay on \"The Decrees of God,\" also identifying the notion of God becoming the universe as incompatible with Christianity:\nBurridge disagrees that such is the case, decrying that \"The Creator is distinct from his creation. The reality of secondary causes is what separates Christian theism from pandeism.\" Burridge concludes by challenging his reader to determine why \"calling God the author of sin demand[s] a pandeistic understanding of the universe effectively removing the reality of sin and moral law.\"\n\nStephen Hawking's recent determination that our universe (and others) needed no Creator to come about inspired the response from Deepak Chopra, interviewed by Larry King, that:\n\nChopra insists that Hawking's discoveries speak only to the nature of God, not to its existence.\n\nPhysicist Bernard Haisch has published two books expressing such a model of our universe. The first was the 2006 book entitled \"The God Theory\", in which he writes:\nHaisch published a followup in 2010, \"The Purpose-Driven Universe.\" Both books reject both atheism and traditional theistic viewpoints, favoring instead a model wherein the deity has become the universe, to share in the actualized experiences therein manifested. Haisch provides as proof of his views a combination of fine tuning and mystical experiences arguments. Haisch additionally points to the peculiar capabilities of persons with autism and like defects of the brain experiencing savant syndrome, and especially having the ability to perform complex mathematical calculations. Haisch contends that this is consistent with humans being fragments of a supreme power, with our minds acting as filters to reduce that power to a comprehensible experience, and with the savantic mind having a broken filter which allows access to the use of greater capacities.\n\nAlan Dawe's 2011 book \"The God Franchise\", likewise proposes the human experience as being a temporarily segregated sliver of the experience of God. In 2013, Australian religious studies scholar Raphael Lataster proposed that \"Pandeism could be the most likely God-concept of all.\"\n\nWarren Sharpe wrote:\nHelena Petrovna Blavatsky, as well, had previously observed this:\n\n"}
{"id": "12859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12859", "title": "Golden Rule", "text": "Golden Rule\n\nThe Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. It is a maxim that is found in many religions and cultures.\n\nThe Golden Rule can be considered an ethic of reciprocity in some religions, although other religions treat it differently. The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:\n\n\nThe idea dates at least to the early Confucian times (551–479 BCE) according to Rushworth Kidder, who identifies that this concept appears prominently in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, and \"the rest of the world's major religions\". The concept of the Rule is codified in the Code of Hammurabi stele and tablets, 1754-1790 BCE. 143 leaders encompassing the world's major faiths endorsed the Golden Rule as part of the 1993 \"Declaration Toward a Global Ethic\", including the Baha'i Faith, Brahmanism, Brahma Kumaris, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous, Interfaith, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Native American, Neo-Pagan, Sikhism, Taoism, Theosophist, Unitarian Universalist and Zoroastrian. According to Greg M. Epstein, \" 'do unto others' ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely,\" but belief in God is not necessary to endorse it. Simon Blackburn also states that the Golden Rule can be \"found in some form in almost every ethical tradition\". \n\nYet, as with any historically prominent maxim, the Golden Rule is not without its controversy (as seen in the Criticism section below). \nThe term \"Golden Rule\", or \"Golden law\", began to be used widely in the early 17th century in Britain by Anglican theologians and preachers; the earliest known usage is that of Anglicans Charles Gibbon and Thomas Jackson in 1604.\n\nPossibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the ancient Egyptian goddess Ma'at, appears in the story of The Eloquent Peasant, which dates to the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040–1650 BC): \"Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do.\" This proverb embodies the \"do ut des\" principle. A Late Period (c. 664–323 BC) papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: \"That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another.\"\n\nIn \"Mahābhārata\", the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which the wise minister Vidura advises the King Yuddhiśhṭhira\nIn Chapter 32 in the Part on Virtue of the Tirukkuṛaḷ (c. 200 BC – c. 500 AD), Tiruvalluvar says: \"Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself\" (K. 316.); \"Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?\" (K. 318). He furthermore opined that it is the determination of the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have cherished enmity and done them evil. (K. 312) The (proper) punishment to those who have done evil (to you), is to put them to shame by showing them kindness, in return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (K. 314)\n\nThe Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in ancient Greek philosophy. Examples of the general concept include:\n\nThe Pahlavi Texts of Zoroastrianism (c. 300 BC–1000 AD) were an early source for the Golden Rule: \"That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself.\" Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5, and \"Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others.\" Shayast-na-Shayast 13:29\n\nSeneca the Younger (c. 4 BC–65 AD), a practitioner of Stoicism (c. 300 BC–200 AD) expressed the Golden Rule in his essay regarding the treatment of slaves: \"Treat your inferior as you would wish your superior to treat you.\"\n\nAccording to Simon Blackburn, the Golden Rule \"can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition\". \n\nA rule of altruistic reciprocity was first stated positively in a well-known Torah verse (Hebrew: ):\nHillel the Elder (c. 110 BC – 10 AD), used this verse as a most important message of the Torah for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a gentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for conversion to Judaism but, drawing on , briefed the man:\nHillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish ethics. Rabbi Akiva agreed and suggested that the principle of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches that all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of God (Sifra, Ḳedoshim, iv.; Yer. Ned. ix. 41c; Genesis Rabba 24). According to Jewish rabbinic literature, the first man Adam represents the \"unity of mankind\". This is echoed in the modern preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And it is also taught, that Adam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God's creation:Why was only a single specimen of man created first? To teach us that he who destroys a single soul destroys a whole world and that he who saves a single soul saves a whole world; furthermore, so no race or class may claim a nobler ancestry, saying, 'Our father was born first'; and, finally, to give testimony to the greatness of the Lord, who caused the wonderful diversity of mankind to emanate from one type. And why was Adam created last of all beings? To teach him humility; for if he be overbearing, let him remember that the little fly preceded him in the order of creation.\n\nThe Jewish Publication Society's edition of Leviticus states:Thou shalt not hate thy brother. in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18 Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.This Torah verse represents one of several versions of the \"Golden Rule\", which itself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest written version of that concept in a positive form.\n\nAt the turn of the eras, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:\n\nCommentators summed up foreigners (= Samaritans), proselytes (= 'strangers who resides with you') (Rabbi Akiva, bQuid 75b) or Jews (Rabbi Gamaliel, yKet 3, 1; 27a) to the scope of the meaning.\n\nOn the verse, \"Love your fellow as yourself,\" the classic commentator Rashi quotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum of Rabbi Akiva: \"Love your fellow as yourself – Rabbi Akiva says this is a great principle of the Torah.\"\n\nIsrael's postal service quoted from the previous Leviticus verse when it commemorated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on a 1958 postage stamp.\n\nThe \"Golden Rule\" was given by Jesus of Nazareth (Matthew 7:12 NCV, see also ). The common English phrasing is \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". A similar form of the phrase appeared in a Catholic catechism around 1567 (certainly in the reprint of 1583).\nThe Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the Old Testament: (\"Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.\"; see also Great Commandment) and (\"But treat them just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love yourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.\").\n\nThe Old Testament Deuterocanonical books of Tobit and Sirach, accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Non-Chalcedonian Churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:\n\nTwo passages in the New Testament quote Jesus of Nazareth espousing the positive form of the Golden rule:\n\nA similar passage, a parallel to the Great Commandment, is \n\nThe passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, \"Who is my neighbor?\", by telling the parable of the Good Samaritan, indicating that \"your neighbor\" is anyone in need. This extends to all, including those who are generally considered hostile.\n\nJesus' teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another.\n\nIn one passage of the New Testament, Paul the Apostle refers to the golden rule:\n\nThe Arabian peninsula was known to not practice the golden rule prior to the advent of Islam. \"Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded the survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient rite of blood vengeance\"\n\nHowever, this all changed when Muhammad came on the scene:\n\nFrom the hadith, the collected oral and written accounts of Muhammad and his teachings during his lifetime:\n\nAli ibn Abi Talib (4th Caliph in Sunni Islam, and first Imam in Shia Islam) says:\nThe writings of the Bahá'í Faith encourages everyone to treat others as they would treat themselves and even prefer others over oneself:\n\nAlso,\nBuddha (Siddhartha Gautama, c. 623–543 BC) made this principle one of the cornerstones of his ethics in the 6th century BC. It occurs in many places and in many forms throughout the Tripitaka.\n\nThe Golden Rule is paramount in the Jainist philosophy and can be seen in the doctrines of Ahimsa and Karma. As part of the prohibition of causing any living beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is harmful to oneself.\n\nThe following quotation from the Acaranga Sutra sums up the philosophy of Jainism:\n\nSaman Suttam of Jinendra Varni gives further insight into this precept:-\n\nThe same idea is also presented in V.12 and VI.30 of the \"Analects\" (c. 500 BC), which can be found in the online Chinese Text Project. The phraseology differs from the Christian version of the Golden Rule. It does not presume to do anything unto others, but merely to avoid doing what would be harmful. It does not preclude doing good deeds and taking moral positions, but there is slim possibility for a Confucian missionary outlook, such as one can justify with the Christian Golden Rule.\n\nMozi regarded the golden rule as a corollary to the cardinal virtue of impartiality, and encouraged egalitarianism and selflessness in relationships.\n\nDo not do unto others whatever is injurious to yourself. -- Shayast-na-Shayast 13.29\n\nThe Way to Happiness expresses the Golden Rule both in its negative/prohibitive form and in its positive form. The negative/prohibitive form is expressed in Precept 19 as:\n\nThe positive form is expressed in Precept 20 as:\n\nThe \"Declaration Toward a Global Ethic\" from the Parliament of the World’s Religions (1993) proclaimed the Golden Rule (\"We must treat others as we wish others to treat us\") as the common principle for many religions. The Initial Declaration was signed by 143 leaders from all of the world's major faiths, including Baha'i Faith, Brahmanism, Brahma Kumaris, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous, Interfaith, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Native American, Neo-Pagan, Sikhism, Taoism, Theosophist, Unitarian Universalist and Zoroastrian. In the folklore of several cultures the Golden Rule is depicted by the allegory of the long spoons.\n\nIn the view of Greg M. Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, \" 'do unto others' ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely. \"But not a single one of these versions of the golden rule requires a God\"\". Various sources identify the Golden Rule as a humanist principle:\n\nAccording to Marc H. Bornstein, and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of human rights, in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.\n\nHowever Leo Damrosch argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to \"rights\" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human \"rights\" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of Jean Jacques Rousseau in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced Thomas Jefferson, who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to \"inalienable rights\" into the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts.\n\nThere has been research published arguing that some 'sense' of fair play and the Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of neuroscientific and neuroethical principles.\n\nThe Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it involves a person empathizing with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as \"I\" or \"self\". Sociologically, \"love your neighbor as yourself\" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups. In evolution, \"reciprocal altruism\" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family. In economics, Richard Swift, referring to ideas from David Graeber, suggests that \"without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist.\"\n\nPhilosophers, such as Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche, have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw wrote, \"Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different.\" This suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of \"do unto others\" is \"dangerous in the wrong hands,\" according to philosopher Iain King, because \"some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might inspire them to kill others in suicide missions.\"\n\nImmanuel Kant famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others. Kant's \"Categorical Imperative\", introduced in \"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\", is often confused with the Golden Rule.\n\nIn his book \"How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time\", philosopher Iain King has argued that \"(although) the idea of mirroring your treatment of others with their treatment of you is very widespread indeed… most ancient wisdoms express this negatively – advice on what you should not do, rather than what you should.\" He argues this creates a bias in favour of inertia which allows bad actions and states of affairs to persist. The positive formulation, meanwhile, can be \"incendiary\", since it \"can lead to cycles of tit-for-tat reciprocity,\" unless it is accompanied by a corrective mechanism, such as a concept of forgiveness. Therefore, he concludes that there can be no viable formulation of the Golden Rule, unless it is heavily qualified by other maxims.\n\nWalter Terence Stace, in \"The Concept of Morals\" (1937), wrote:\n\nMarcus George Singer observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1) that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2) that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to. Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.\n\nIn his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting. An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.\n\nIt is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our race or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on.

{"id": "608287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=608287", "title": "Han Fei", "text": "Han Fei\n\nHan Fei (; ; 233 BC), also known as Han Fei Zi, was a Chinese philosopher of the Warring States period \"Chinese Legalist\" school. He is often considered to be the greatest representative of Chinese Legalism for his eponymous work the \"Han Feizi,\" synthesizing the methods of his predecessors.\n\nHis writings were very influential on the future first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. After the early demise of the Qin dynasty Han's philosophy was officially vilified by the following Han Dynasty. Despite its outcast status throughout the history of imperial China, his political theory continued to heavily influence every dynasty thereafter, and the Confucian ideal of a rule without laws was never again realised. Shu Han's chancellor Zhuge Liang demanded emperor Liu Shan read the Han Feizi for learning the way of ruling.\n\nHan borrowed Shang Yang's emphasis on laws, Shen Buhai's emphasis on administrative technique, and Shen Dao's ideas on authority and prophecy, emphasising that the autocrat will be able to achieve firm control over the state with the mastering of his predecessors' methodologies: his position of power (勢, \"Shì\"); technique (術, \"Shù\"), and law (法, \"Fǎ\").\n\n\"Han Fei\" is his name, while -\"Zi\" (,  \"Master\") was often added to philosophers' names as an honorific. The title \"Han Feizi\" is also used to denote the book written by him.\n\nUnlike the other famed philosophers of the time, Han Fei was a member of the ruling aristocracy, having been born into the ruling family of the State of Han during the end phase of the Warring States period. In this context, his works have been interpreted by some scholars as being directed to his cousin, the King of Han. Sima Qian’s Shi ji says that Han Fei studied together with future Qin chancellor Li Si under the Confucian philosopher Xunzi. It is said that because of his stutter, Han Fei could not properly present his ideas in court. His advice otherwise being ignored, but observing the slow decline of his Han state, he developed \"one of the most brilliant (writing) styles in ancient China.\"\n\nSima Qian's biography of Han Fei is as follows: \"Han Fei was a prince of Han, in favor of the study of name/form and law/art which takes its root in the Huang-Lao philosophy. He was born a stutterer and was not able to dispute well, but he was good at writing papers. Together with his friend, Li Si, he served Xun Qing, and Si himself admitted that he was not as competent as Fei. Seeing Han was on the decline, he often remonstrated with the king of Han by submitting papers, but the king did not agree to employ him. At this, Han Fei was frustrated with the reality that, in governing a state, the king did not endeavour to refine and clarify the juridical system of the state, to control his subjects by taking over power, to enhance state property and defence, or to call and employ the wise by enhancing the state.\n\nRather, the king employed the corrupted and treacherous and put them in higher positions over the wise. He regarded the intellectuals as a disturbance to the Law by employing their literature, and thought that knights violate the prohibition of the state by using armed forces. While the state was in peace, the king liked to patronise the honoured; while in need, he employed warriors with armour and helmet. So the cultivated men could not be employed and the men employed could not be cultivated. Severely distressed over the reality that men of high integrity and uprightness were not embraced by the subjects with immorality and corruption, he observed the changes in the gaining and losing of the past. Therefore, he wrote several papers like Gu Fen, Wu Tan, Nei-Wai Chu, Shou Lin, and Shei Nan, which amount to one hundred thousand words. However, while Han Fei himself knew well of the difficulty of persuasion and created the detailed writing, Shei Nan, he eventually killed himself at Qin. He could not escape the trap of words for himself.\"\n\nHis works ultimately ended up in the hands of the thrilled Qin king. Qin king commented \"\"If I can make friends with this person (Han Fei), I may die without regrets\".\" and invited Han Fei to Qin. Han Fei presented the essay \"Preserving the Han\" to ask Qin king not to attack his homeland, but his ex-friend and rival Li Si - who was jealous of Han Fei - used that essay to convinced to imprison Han Fei on account of his likely loyalty to Han. Han Fei responded by writing another essay named \"In the first time of meeting Qin king\", hoping to use his writing talent to win the king's heart. Han Fei did win the king's heart, but not before Li Si forced him to commit suicide by drinking poison. The Qin king later regretted about the unfortunate death of Han Fei.\n\nXunzi formed the hypothesis that human nature is evil, virtueless and suggested human infants must be brought to their virtuous form through social-class-oriented Confucian moral education. Without such, Xunzi argued, man would act virtuelessly and be steered by his own human nature to commit immoral acts. Han Fei's education and life experience during the Warring States period, and in his own Han state, contributed his synthesis of a philosophy for the management of an amoral and interest-driven administration, to which morality seemed a loose and inefficient tool. Han agreed with his teacher's theory of \"virtueless by birth\", but as in previous Legalist philosophy, pragmatically proposed to steer people by their own interest-driven nature.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "229870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229870", "title": "Hans-Hermann Hoppe", "text": "Hans-Hermann Hoppe\n\nHans-Hermann Hoppe (; ; born September 2, 1949) is a German-born American Austrian School economist, and paleolibertarian anarcho-capitalist philosopher. He is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), Senior Fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and the founder and president of the Property and Freedom Society.\n\nHoppe identifies as a culturally conservative libertarian. Some of his remarks and ideas have provoked controversy among his libertarian peers and his colleagues at UNLV. His belief in rights of property owners to establish private covenant communities, from which homosexuals and political dissidents may be \"physically removed,\" has proved particularly divisive. Hoppe also garners controversy due to his support for restrictive limits on immigration which critics argue is at odds with libertarianism and anarchism.\n\nHoppe was born in Peine, West Germany, did undergraduate studies at Universität des Saarlandes and received his MA and PhD degrees from Goethe University Frankfurt. He studied under Jürgen Habermas, a leading German intellectual of the post-WWII era, but gradually came to reject Habermas's ideas, and European leftism generally, regarding them as \"intellectually barren and morally bankrupt.\"\n\nHe was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, from 1976 to 1978 and earned his habilitation in Foundations of Sociology and Economics from the University of Frankfurt in 1981. From 1986 until his retirement in 2008, Hoppe was a professor in the School of Business at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, the publisher of much of his work, and was editor of various Mises Institute periodicals.\n\nHoppe has stated that Murray Rothbard was his \"principal teacher, mentor and master\". After reading Rothbard's books and being converted to a Rothbardian political position, Hoppe moved from Germany to New York City to be with Rothbard, and then followed Rothbard to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, \"working and living side-by-side with him, in constant and immediate personal contact.\" According to Hoppe, from 1985 until Rothbard's 1995 death, Hoppe considered Rothbard his \"dearest fatherly friend\".\n\nHoppe resides in Turkey with his wife Gulcin Imre Hoppe, an Austrian school economist.\n\nIn 2006, Hoppe founded The Property and Freedom Society (\"PFS\") as a reaction against the Milton Friedman-influenced Mont Pelerin Society, which he has derided as \"socialist\". On the fifth anniversary of PFS, Hoppe reflected on its goals:\n\nControversially, invitees have included disparate political dissenters ranging from neo-Ottomanist and Muslim speakers such as Mustafa Akyol to alt-right and white nationalist speakers such as Richard Spencer and Peter Brimelow, the founder of VDARE. He has stated that his invitation to alt-right figures was a feature of his conception of free speech rather than common ground in ideology. Rather than inviting any alt-right figures to later conferences, he has claimed to oppose their ideals and instead invited speakers including Peter Thiel.\n\nReflecting on the presence of alt-right speakers at previous meetings, and his decision against re-inviting them, Hoppe stated at the 2018 Annual Meeting:\n\nIn the September 1988 issue of \"Liberty\", Hoppe attempted to establish an a priori and value-neutral justification for libertarian ethics by devising a new theory which he named \"argumentation ethics\". Hoppe asserts that any argument which in any respect purports to contradict libertarian principles is logically incoherent. In the following issue, \"Liberty\" published comments by ten of Hoppe's fellow libertarians, followed by a rejoinder from Hoppe. In his comment, Hoppe's friend and Mises Institute supervisor Murray Rothbard wrote that Hoppe's theory was \"a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular\" and that Hoppe, \"has managed to transcend the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the Scholastics, and that had brought modern libertarianism into a tiresome deadlock\". However, the majority of Hoppe's colleagues surveyed by \"Liberty\" rejected his theory. In his response, Hoppe derided his critics as \"utilitarians\".\n\nFellow Mises Institute Senior Fellow Roderick T. Long states that Hoppe's \"a priori\" formulation of libertarianism denies the fundamental principle of Misesean praxeology. On the issue of utilitarianism, Long writes, \"Hoppe's argument, if it worked, would commit us to recognizing and respecting libertarian rights regardless of what our goals are – but as a praxeologist, I have trouble seeing how any practical requirement can be justified apart from a means-end structure.\" Another critic argues that Hoppe has not provided any non-circular reasons why we \"have to regard moral values as something that \"must\" be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of 'mere' subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways\". In other words, the theory relies \"on the existence [of] certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself be the result of 'value-free' reasoning.\"\n\nIn 2001, Hoppe published \"\" which examines various social and economic phenomena which, Hoppe argues, are problems caused by democratic forms of government. He attributes democracy's alleged failures to pressure groups which seek to increase government expenditures and regulations. Hoppe proposes alternatives and remedies, including secession, decentralization of government, and \"complete freedom of contract, occupation, trade and migration\". Hoppe argues that monarchy would preserve individual liberty more effectively than democracy.\n\nIn 2013, Hoppe reflected on the relationship between democracy and the arts and concluded that \"democracy leads to the subversion and ultimately disappearance of the notion of beauty and universal standards of beauty. Beauty is swamped and submerged by so-called 'modern art'.\"\n\nWalter Block, a colleague of Hoppe's at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, asserts that Hoppe's arguments shed light \"on historical occurrences, from wars to poverty to inflation to interest rates to crime\". Block notes that while Hoppe concedes that 21st-century democracies are more prosperous than the monarchies of old, Hoppe argues that if nobles and kings replaced today's political leaders, their ability to take a long term view of a country's well-being would \"improve matters\". Block also shared what he called minor criticisms of Hoppe's theses regarding time preferences, immigration and the gap between libertarianism and conservatism.\n\nAccording to Hoppe, four years before the publication of \"Democracy\", Alberto Benegas Lynch, Jr. criticized Hoppe's thesis that monarchy is preferable to democracy.\nA Professor of Economics at the University of Buenos Aires, Benegas Lynch provided empirical evidence demonstrating that modern monarchies tend to be far poorer than modern democracies. In reply, Hoppe stated that as a Misesian economist, he believes that economic theories cannot be \"established or refuted by historical data.\" Hoppe also cited the work of scientist J. Phillipe Rushton to argue that the data are misleading because many modern monarchies are composed of \"Negroid\" people . According to Hoppe, \"since Caucasians have, on the average, a significantly lower degree of time preference than Negroids, any comparison [between African monarchies and Western democracies] would amount to a systematic distortion of the evidence.\" Regardless, Hoppe argues that these data would otherwise systemically favor his case, \"and if anything I have erred - though unavoidably so - on the side of democracy.\"\n\nIn \"Democracy\" Hoppe describes a fully libertarian society of \"covenant communities\" made up of residents who have signed an agreement defining the nature of that community. Hoppe writes \"There would be little or no 'tolerance' and 'openmindedness' so dear to left-libertarians. Instead, one would be on the right path toward restoring the freedom of association and exclusion implied in the institution of private property\". Hoppe writes that towns and villages could have warning signs saying \"no beggars, bums, or homeless, but also no homosexuals, drug users, Jews, Moslems, Germans, or Zulus\".\n\nHoppe writes:\n\nCommenting on this passage, Martin Snyder of the American Association of University Professors said Hoppe's words will disturb \"[t]hose with a better memory than Hoppe for segregation, apartheid, internment facilities and concentration camps, for yellow stars and pink triangles\". Hoppe also provoked controversy by calling homosexuality a \"perversity or abnormality\", alongside vulgarity, drug use, deviant sexual behaviours and pedophilia.\n\nWalter Block wrote that Hoppe's statement calling for advocates of homosexuality \"to be physically removed from society\" was \"exceedingly difficult to reconcile ... with libertarianism\" because \"the libertarian philosophy would support the rights of both groups to act in such manners\". He continues: \"As for homosexuality, it is entirely possible that some areas of the country, parts of Gotham and San Francisco for example, will require this practice, and ban, entirely, heterosexuality. If this is done through contract, private property rights, restrictive covenants, it will be entirely compatible with the libertarian legal code.\"\n\nAs a self-proclaimed anarchist who favors abolishing the nation-state, Hoppe believes that as long as states exist, they should impose some restrictions on immigration. Hoppe has equated free immigration to \"forced integration\" which violates the rights of native peoples, since if land were privately owned, immigration would not be unhindered but would only occur with the consent of private property owners. Hoppe's Mises Institute colleague Walter Block has characterized Hoppe as an \"anti-open immigration activist\" who argues that, though all public property is \"stolen\" by the state from taxpayers, \"the state compounds the injustice when it allows immigrants to use [public] property, thus further \"invading\" the private property rights of the original owners\". However, Block rejects Hoppe's views as incompatible with libertarianism. Employing a reductio ad absurdum argument, he argues that Hoppe's logic implies that flagrantly unlibertarian laws such as regulations on prostitution and drug use \"could be defended on the basis that many tax-paying property owners would not want such behavior on their own private property\". Another libertarian author, Simon Guenzl, writing for \"Libertarian Papers\" argues that: \"supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state's role in society.\"\n\nIn terms of specific immigration restrictions, Hoppe argued that an appropriate policy will require immigrants to the United States to display proficiency in English in addition to \"superior (above-average) intellectual performance and character structure as well as a compatible system of values\". He suggested that these criteria would lead to a \"systematic pro-European immigration bias\". Jacob Hornberger of the \"Future of Freedom Foundation\" opined that the immigration test Hoppe advocated would probably be prejudiced against Latin American immigrants to the United States, due to differences between European Americans and Latin Americans differences in average IQs. Hoppe has stated, \"No one is against immigration and immigrants per se. But immigration must be by invitation only. All immigrants must be productive people and hence, be barred from all domestic welfare payments.\"\n\nHoppe spoke out against invading Iraq (which later happened in 2003) in a 2002 interview and criticized the interventionist foreign policy, stating that \"if you meddle in foreign affairs, you should not be surprised if besides some friends you will also make plenty of enemies.\"\n\nFollowing a March 4, 2004, lecture on time preference at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), a student complained that Hoppe created a hostile classroom environment by stating that homosexuals tend to be more shortsighted than heterosexuals in their ability to save money and plan (economically) for the future, in part because they tend not to have children. Hoppe also suggested that John Maynard Keynes's homosexuality might explain his economic views, with which Hoppe disagreed. Hoppe also stated that very young and very old people, and couples without children, were less likely to plan for the future. Hoppe told a reporter that the comments lasted only 90 seconds of a 75-minute class, no students questioned the comments in that class, and that in 18 years of giving the same lecture all over the world, he had never previously received a complaint about it. At the request of university officials, Hoppe apologized to the class. He said, \"Italians tend to eat more spaghetti than Germans, and Germans tend to eat more sauerkraut than Italians\" and explained that he was speaking in generalities. Thereafter, Hoppe told the reporter, the student alleged that Hoppe did not take the complaint seriously and filed a formal complaint. Hoppe told the reporter that he felt as if it were he who was the victim in the incident and that the student should have been told to \"grow up\".\n\nAn investigation was conducted and the university's provost, Raymond W. Alden III, issued Hoppe a non-disciplinary letter of instruction on February 9, 2005, with a finding that he had \"created a hostile or intimidating educational environment in violation of the University's policies regarding discrimination as to sexual orientation\". Alden also instructed Hoppe to \"... cease mischaracterizing opinion as objective fact\", asserted that Hoppe's opinion was not supported by peer-reviewed academic literature, and remarked that Hoppe had \"refus[ed] to substantiate [his] in-class statements of fact ...\"\n\nHoppe appealed the decision, saying the university had \"blatantly violated its contractual obligations\" toward him and described the action as \"frivolous interference with my right to academic freedom\". He was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU threatened legal action. ACLU attorney Allen Lichtenstein said \"The charge against professor Hoppe is totally specious and without merit\". The Nevada ACLU executive director said \"We don't subscribe to Hans' theories and certainly understand why some students find them offensive ... But academic freedom means nothing if it doesn't protect the right of professors to present scholarly ideas that are relevant to their curricula, even if they are controversial and rub people the wrong way\". Alden's decision was picked up by Fox News and several blogs and libertarians organized a campaign to contact the university. The university received two weeks of bad publicity and the Interim Chancellor (Nevada System of Higher Education) Jim Rogers expressed concerns about \"any attempts to thwart free speech\".\n\nJim Rogers intervened in the matter. He rejected Hoppe's request for a one-year paid sabbatical, and UNLV President Carol Harter acted upon Hoppe's appeal on February 18, 2005. She decided that Hoppe's views, even if non-mainstream or controversial, should not be cause for reprimanding him. She dismissed the discrimination complaint against Hoppe and the non-disciplinary letter was withdrawn from Hoppe's personnel file. She wrote:\n\nHoppe later wrote about the incident and the UNLV investigation in an article entitled \"My Battle With the Thought Police\". Martin Snyder of the American Association of University Professors wrote that he should not be \"punished for freely expressing his opinions\".\n\nVarious controversies about academic freedom, including the Hoppe matter and remarks made by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, prompted the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to hold a conference on academic freedom in October 2005. In 2009 UNLV proposed a new policy that included the encouragement of reporting by people who felt that they had encountered bias. The proposed policy was criticized by the Nevada ACLU and some faculty members who remembered the Hoppe incident as adverse to academic freedom.\n\n\n\n"}

He was very talented in many areas. He studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Helsinki, and graduated MA in 1903. He focused on set theory, and became the first Finnish expert in logic, which was then a new area. In 1906, he worked at the linguistic department of the university where he became interested in languages.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1918, Eklund worked as a teacher in different high schools in Turku and Pori. Around the same time he continued his studies and graduated with a master's degree in philosophy in 1911. He also studied in Germany in 1909 and 1910 in Göttingen, mathematics, philosophy in Leipzig in 1913 and 1914 again philosophy in Göttingen. His most important works of that time were “Russells antimoni och andra paradoxala motsägelser. Logiska undersökningar” (1916), and “Über Mengen, die Elemente ihrer selbst sind” (1918).\n\nImmanuel Kant's philosophy in ethical thinking was a major influence on Eklund.

Today he is mainly known today for his work in logic. Ibn Ṭumlūs is known by his biographers under the name of Abū al-Ḥajjāj or Abū Isḥāq Yūsuf ibn Muhammed ibn Ṭumlūs. In Latin sources, he is known as Alhagiag Bin Thalmus. \n\nHe was born in Alzira, near Valencia, sometime between 1150 and 1165. He studied philosophy, medicine and perhaps jurisprudence with Averroes (Ibn Rushd), and his achievements in medicine were such that he succeeded Averroes as doctor of the Almohad caliph, Mohammad al-Nāṣir, from 1199 to 1213. He died at Alcira in 1223.\n\nNot one of the works of Ibn Ṭumlūs known of today is mentioned by his biographers. Conversely, not one of the works mentioned by his biographers is available today. Ibn Abbar stated that Ibn Ṭumlūs authored some works on the sciences of the Arabic language, but these do not seem to be extant. In addition, Ibn Ṭumlūs’s biographers transmitted to us some poems made by him, which have been transcribed in Fouad Ben Ahmed's definitive biobibliography. There are only two major works that are known to have survived, his \"Book on Logic\" and his commentary on Avicenna's \"Medical Poem.\"\n\nṬumlūs’ \"Book on Logic\" (\"Kitāb fī Mantiq\") survives in just a single manuscript. The manuscript is undated and untitled. Some scholars have proposed dates, but these remain speculative. Although parts of the treatise have been edited under the title \"Introduction to the Art of Logic,\" in fact neither Ibn Ṭumlūs nor his copyist gave a title to the work. The text covers all the parts of Aristotle's Organon, including a Book of Rhetoric and Book of Poetics. Indeed, his advocacy of this expanded Organon is one the significant features of the work. The treatise begins with a long introduction (\"Ṣadr\") to the text in which Ibn Ṭumlūs addresses several controversies concerning his education in logic and the attitudes of the scholars of his time towards logic (namely, the jurists and the students of the prophetic tradition). He considers also the value of al-Ghazālī’s and al-Fārābī’s logical works, both from a philosophical and a religious point of view. Yet although both of these figures are influential on Ibn Ṭumlūs, recent scholarship has shown that his principal influence is his teacher, Averroes.\n\nExcerpts from the \"Book on Logic\" have been edited and translated by various scholars:\nA critical Arabic edition of the sections on dialectic and sophistical topics has recently been made by Fouad Ben Ahmed, who is at work on an Arabic edition of the remainder of the work. At present, no English translations are available.\n\nIbn Ṭumlūs' other major surviving work is his commentary on Avicenna's \"Medical Poem\" (\"Šarḥ al-Urǧūza\"). Although there are eight known manuscripts containing this work, with more probably yet to be identified, no complete edition of the work has been made. A colophon at the end of one manuscript dates Ibn Ṭumlūs' final revisions of the work to Marrakesh in 1209. Scholarship on this work is, at this point, extremely limited.\n"}

Kalidasa, in the phrase मदिरेक्षणे appearing in passage II.72 of his Abhigyanashakuntalam, has also used the word Ikshana to mean the eye, which phrase Sankara explains is – \"madira\" ('wine') as applied to the eye (ikshana), - eye as equivalent to 'beautiful', \"madirekhshane\" means the one whose eyes intoxicate like wine or is the wine-eyed.\n\nIkshana is a technical term used in Vedanta to show how creation took place by the beholding of Para-brahman as an intelligent and a personal act of the creator; it means revelation of the created. Parabrahman is essentially \"citta\" who produces his self as Shabda Brahman (Logos) by \"ikshana\" ('beholding').\n\nBadarayana states:-\n\nAdi Shankara, in his commentary on this \"sutra\", states that the object of \"ikshana\" ('seeing') is the supreme Self, Brahman, and not Hiranyagarbha, the inferior Brahman. He says that the term \"ikshati-karma\" means the object covered by the act of seeing. The all-pervading entity (Purusa) that is to be seen can be seen to be \"higher than the high one\" meditated. Pippalada tells Satyakama, son of Sibi, that he by the \"Sama\" hymns is elevated to the \"Brahmaloka\", he from this \"jivanghata\" ('the Macrocosmic Soul') beholds the supreme Being – एतस्माज्जीवघ्नात्परात्परं पुरिशयं पुरुषुमीक्षति - Prashna Upanishad V.5.\n\nThe statement – \"uho nama vi-tarkoktih pra-vicharekshanatmakah\", the terms \"Vitarka\" and \"Tarka\" are used interchangeably, \"tarka\" occurs after speech, mind and prana have been restrained immediately before Samadhi, vitarka consists of advanced thought and observation (ikshana); it is through discernment (\"uha\") that one leaves the lower plane of \"savikalpa\" and gets uplifted.\n\nThe Vedic concept of tapas and the Upanishadic concept of ikshana to the effect that consciousness and force are ultimately the same and every will has an aspect of force, helped Sri Aurobindo to conclude that the fact is only a partial reflection of the Idea which has created it and that it is the idea which expresses itself in matter and takes to itself bodies, and formulate the 'Theory of ideas as forces'.\n\nIt was through \"ekacittekshana-samyukta-prajna\" the supreme perfect knowledge was realized (\"abhisambodha\") by Gautama Buddha, that converted \"Boddhisattva\" to \"Buddha\"; \"ekacittekshana\" refers to \"Prajna\" exercised in unison with 'one-thought-viewing' when there is no separation between 'knower' and the 'known', all are viewed in one thought and enlightenment is the outcome.\n"}

{"id": "214690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214690", "title": "John Cowper Powys", "text": "John Cowper Powys\n\nJohn Cowper Powys (; 8 October 187217 June 1963) was a British philosopher, lecturer, novelist, literary critic, and poet. Powys was born in Shirley, Derbyshire, where his father was vicar of St. Michael and All Angels Parish Church, between 1871 and 1879. \n\nAlthough Powys published a collection of poems in 1896 and his first novel in 1915, he did not gain success as a writer until he published the novel \"Wolf Solent\" in 1929. He was influenced by many writers, but he has been particularly seen as a successor to Thomas Hardy, and \"Wolf Solent\", \"A Glastonbury Romance\" (1932), along with \"Weymouth Sands\" (1934) and \"Maiden Castle\" (1936), are often referred to as his Wessex novels. As with Hardy's novels, the landscape plays a major role in Powys's works, and an elemental philosophy is important in the lives of his characters. In 1934 he published his important \"Autobiography\". \n\nPowys was also a highly successful itinerant lecturer, first in England and then from 1905 until 1930 in the USA. Many of Powys's novels were written in America and his early novels, and all his major novels, up to and including \"Owen Glendower\", as well as \"Autobiography,\" were first published in the United States\n\nPowys moved to Dorset, England, from America, in 1934 with his American partner Phyllis Playter, but in 1935 they moved to Corwen in Merionethshire, Wales. This led to the publication of two historical novels set in Wales \"Owen Glendower\" (1941) and \"\" (1951). Then in 1955 they moved to Blaenau Ffestiniog where Powys died in 1963.\n\nPowys was born in Shirley, Derbyshire, in 1872, the son of the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843–1923), and Mary Cowper Johnson, a descendant of the poet William Cowper. He came from a family of eleven children, many of whom were also talented. The family lived in Shirley between 1871-79, briefly in Dorchester, Dorset and then they moved to Montacute, Somerset, where Charles Powys was vicar for thirty-two years. \n\nJohn Cowper Powys's two younger brothers Llewelyn Powys (1884–1939) and Theodore Francis Powys were well-known writers, while his sister Philippa published a novel and some poetry. Another sister Marian Powys was an authority on lace and lace-making and published a book on this subject. His brother A. R. Powys was Secretary of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and published a number of books on architectural subjects. Powys studied at Sherborne School and graduated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, June 1894.\n\nOn 6 April 1896 he married Margaret Lyon. They had a son, Littleton Alfred, in 1902. Powys's first employment was teaching in girls’ schools in Brighton, and then Eastbourne. His first published works were two highly derivative collections of poetry published in the 1890s. He worked from 1898 as an Extension lecturer throughout England, for both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.\n\nThen from 1905 to the early 1930s, he lectured in the United States for the American Society for the Extension of University Teaching, gaining a reputation as a charismatic speaker. He spent his summers in England. During this time he travelled the length and breadth of the US, as well as into Canada. Powys's marriage was unsatisfactory, and Powys eventually lived a large part of each year in the USA, and had relationships with various women. An important woman in his life was the American poet Frances Gregg, whom he first met in Philadelphia in 1912. He was also a friend of the famous dancer Isadora Duncan. Another friend and an important supporter in America was the novelist Theodore Dreiser. In 1921 he met Phyllis Playter, the twenty-six-year-old daughter of industrialist and business man Franklin Playter. Eventually they established a permanent relationship, though he was unable to divorce his wife Margaret, who was a Catholic. However, he diligently supported Margaret and the education of their son.\n\nIn the US he engaged in a public debate with the philosopher Bertrand Russell on marriage, and he also debated with the philosopher and historian Will Durant. Powys was also a witness in the obscenity trial of James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\", and was mentioned with approval in the autobiography of US feminist and anarchist, Emma Goldman. Powys would later share Goldman's support for the Spanish Revolution. \n\nHis first novel \"Wood and Stone\", which Powys dedicated to Thomas Hardy, was published in 1915. This was followed by two collections of literary essays \"Visions and Revisions\" (1915) and \"Suspended Judgment\" (1916). In \"Confessions of Two Brothers\" (1916), a work that also contains a section by his brother Llewelyn, Powys writes about his personal philosophy, something he elaborated on in \"The Complex Vision\" (1920), his first full length work of popular philosophy. He also published three collections of poetry between 1916 and 1922.\n\nPolitically, Powys described himself as an anarchist and was both anti-fascist and anti-Stalinist: \"Powys already regarded fascism and Stalinism as appalling, but different, totalitarian regimes\".\n\nIt was not until 1929, with the novel \"Wolf Solent\", that Powys achieved any critical or financial success. In 1930 Powys and Phyllis moved from Greenwich Village in New York City to Hillsdale in rural upstate New York. One of Powys's most admired novels, \"A Glastonbury Romance\", published in 1932, sold well, though he made little if any money from it because of a libel lawsuit. Another important work, \"Autobiography\", was published in 1934.\n\nThen in June 1934 Powys and Phyllis left America and moved to England, living first in Dorchester, the setting for the final Wessex novel, \"Maiden Castle\", before eventually moving in July 1935 to Corwen, Denbighshire North Wales, with the help of the novelist James Hanley, who lived nearby. Corwen was historically part of Edeirnion or Edeyrnion and an ancient commote of medieval Wales, once a part of the Kingdom of Powys. There Powys immersed himself in Welsh literature, mythology and culture, including learning to read Welsh. The move inspired two major historical novels with Welsh settings, \"Owen Glendower\" (1941) and \"Porius\" (1951).\n\nMargaret Powys died in 1947, and his son Littleton Alfred in 1954.\n\nIn May 1955 they moved, for the last time, to Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales. John Cowper Powys died in 1963 and Phyllis Playter in 1982.\n\nPowys's first published works were poetry: \"Odes and Other Poems\" (1896), \"Poems\" (1899), collections which have \"echoes […] of Tennyson, Arnold, Swinburne, among contemporaries, and of John Milton and Wordsworth and Keats\". These were published with the assistance of his cousin Ralph Shirley, who was a director of William Rider and Son the publisher of them. In the summer of 1905 Powys composed \"The Death of God\" an epic poem \"modelled on the blank verse of Milton, Keats, and Tennyson\" that was published as \"Lucifer\" in 1956. There were three further volumes of poetry: \"Wolf's Bane\" (1916), \"Mandragora\" (1917) and \"Samphire\" (1922). The first two collections were published by Powys's manager G. Arnold Shaw. An unfinished, short narrative poem \"The Ridge\" was published in January 1963, shortly before Powys's death that June. In 1964 Kenneth Hopkins published \"John Cowper Powys: A Selection from his Poems\" and in 1979 the Welsh poet and critic Roland Mathias thought this side of Powys worthy of critical study and published \"The Hollowed-Out Elder Stalk: John Cowper Powys as Poet\". Belinda Humfrey, suggests that \"[p]erhaps Powys's best poems are those given to Jason Otter in \"Wolf Solent\" and Taliessin in \"Porius\".\"\n\nThe Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse (1973) edited by English poet Philip Larkin contains \"In A Hotel Writing-Room\" by Powys.\n\nWhile he was a famous lecturer and published a variety of both fiction and non-fiction regularly from 1915, it was not until he was in his early fifties, with the publication of \"Wolf Solent\" in 1929, that he achieved critical and financial success as a novelist. This novel was reprinted several times in both the United States and Britain and translated into German in 1930 and French in 1931. In the Preface he wrote for the 1961 Macdonald edition of the novel Powys states: \"\"Wolf Solent\" is a book of Nostalgia, written in a foreign country with the pen of a traveller and the ink-blood of his home\". \"Wolf Solent\" is set in Ramsgard, based on Sherborne, Dorset, where Powys attended school from May 1883, as well as Blacksod, modelled on Yeovil, Somerset, and Dorchester and Weymouth, both in Dorset, all places full of memories for him. In the same year \"The Meaning of Culture\" was published and it, too, was frequently reprinted. \"In Defence of Sensuality\", published at the end of the following year, was yet another best seller. First published in 1933, \"A Philosophy of Solitude\" was another best seller for Powys in the USA.\n\nBefore \"Wolf Solent\" there had been four earlier apprentice novels; \"Wood and Stone\" (1915), \"Rodmoor\" (1916), the posthumous \"After my Fashion\" (1980), which was written around 1920, and \"Ducdame\" (1925). \"Wolf Solent\" was the first of the so-called Wessex novels, which include \"A Glastonbury Romance\" (1932), \"Weymouth Sands\" (1934) and \"Maiden Castle\" (1936). Powys was an admirer of Thomas Hardy, and these novels are set in Somerset and Dorset, part of Hardy's mythical Wessex. American scholar Richard Maxwell describes these four novels \"as remarkably successful with the reading public of his time\". \"Maiden Castle\", the last of the Wessex novels, is set in Dorchester, Thomas Hardy's Casterbridge, and which he intended to be a \"rival\" to Hardy's \"Mayor of Casterbridge\".\n\nAll the same, despite his indebtedness to the Victorian novel and his enthusiasm for Hardy and Walter Scott, as well as for lesser figures such as Ainsworth, Powys was clearly a modernist, and has affinities also with Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Walter Pater, Marcel Proust, Carl Gustav Jung, Sigmund Freud, D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Dorothy Richardson.\n\nIt is clear from Powys's diaries that his newfound success was greatly helped by the stability that his relationship with Phyllis Playter gave him and her frequent advice on his work in progress.\n\n\"A Glastonbury Romance\" sold particularly well in its British edition, though this was of little avail as it was the subject of an expensive libel case brought by Gerard Hodgkinson, the owner of the Wookey Hole Caves, who felt himself identifiably and unfairly portrayed in the character of Philip Crow. According to Powys this novel's \"heroine is the Grail\", and its central concern is with the various myths, legends and history associated with Glastonbury. Not only is \"A Glastonbury Romance\" concerned with the legend that Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail, a vessel containing the blood of Christ, to the town, but the further tradition that King Arthur was buried there. In addition, one of the novel's main characters, the Welshman Owen Evans, introduces the idea that the Grail has a Welsh (Celtic), pagan, pre-Christian origin. The main sources for Powys's ideas on mythology and the Grail legend are Sir John Rhys's \"Studies in the Arthurian Legend\", R. S. Loomis's \"Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance\", and the works of Jessie L. Weston, including \"From Ritual to Romance\". T. S. Eliot's \"The Wasteland\" is another possible influence. A central aspect of \"A Glastonbury Romance\" is the attempt by John Geard, ex-minister now the mayor of Glastonbury, to restore Glastonbury to its medieval glory as a place of religious pilgrimage. On the other hand, the Glastonbury industrialist Philip Crow, along with John and Mary Crow and Tom Barter, who are, like him, from Norfolk, view the myths and legends of the town with contempt. Philip's vision is of a future with more mines and more factories. John Crow, however, as he is penniless, takes on the task of organising a pageant for Geard. At the same time an alliance of Anarchists, Marxists, and Jacobins try to turn Glastonbury into a commune.\n\nWhile Welsh mythology was already important in \"A Glastonbury Romance\" and \"Maiden Castle\" it became even more important after he and Phyllis Playter moved to Corwen, Wales, in 1935, first in the minor novel \"Morwyn or The Vengeance of God\" (1937). Another important element in \"Morwyn\", is condemnation of animal cruelty, especially vivisection, a theme also found in \"Weymouth Sands\" (1934). As a result, some writers have claimed Powys anticipated the modern animal rights movement.\n\nThere then followed two major historical novels set in Wales, \"Owen Glendower\" (1941) and \"Porius\" (1951). The first deals with the rebellion of the Welsh Prince Owen Glendower (A.D.1400–16), while \"Porius\" takes place in the time of the mythic King Arthur (A.D. 499). However, Arthur is a minor character compared with the Welsh Prince Porius, and the King's magician Myrddin (Merlin). In both works, but especially \"Porius\", Powys makes use of the mythology found in the Welsh classic \"The Mabinogion\". \"Porius\" is, for some, the crowning achievement of Powys's maturity, but others are repelled by its obscurity. It was originally severely cut for publication, but in recent years two attempts have been made to recreate Powys's original intent.\n\nIt is not surprising that John Cowper Powys should, after he moved to Corwen, decide to begin a novel about Owen Glendower, because it was in Corwen that Owen's rebellion against Henry IV began on 16 September 1400, when he formally assumed the ancestral title of Prince of Powys at his manor house of Glyndyfrdwy, then in the parish of Corwen. In September 1935 Phyllis Playter had suggested that he should write an historical novel about Owen Glendower. An important aspect of \"Owen Glendower\" are historical parallels between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the late 1930s and early 1940s: \"A sense of contemporataneousness is ever present in \"Owen Glendower\". We are in a world of change like our own\". The novel was conceived at a time when the \"Spanish Civil War was a major topic of public debate\" and completed on 24 December 1939, a few months after World War II had begun.\n\n\"Porius\" is set mainly in Corwen. The events in this novel take place during the week of \"October 18, to October 25, A.D. 499\", during a historical period when, Powys claims, \"There appears to be an absolute blank, as far as documentary evidence goes, with regard to the history of Britain\". This was in fact a time of major transition in the history of Britain, with the replacing of Roman traditions with Saxon rule, as well as the conversion of the British to Christianity. There are again, as with \"Owen Glendower\", parallels with contemporary history: \"The Dark Ages and the 1930s are the periods of what Powys, in Yeatsian phrase calls 'appalling transition' \". and there was the clear possibility of another \"Saxon\" invasion, when Powys began writing Porius in 1942. In prefatory comments, probably written around 1949, at the time of the beginning of the Cold War, Powys suggests that,\nAs we contemplate the historic background to […] the last year of the fifth century [sic], it is impossible not to think of the background of human life from which we watch the first half of the twentieth century dissolve into the second half. As the old gods were departing then, so the old gods are departing now. And as the future was dark with the terrifying possibilities of human disaster then, so, today, are we confronted by the possibility of catastrophic world events.\n\nPowys also saw the period of Owen Glendower's rebellion taking place at the time of \"one of the most momentous and startling epochs of \"transition\" that the world has known\".\n\nJust as the landscape of Dorset and Somerset, and the characters' deep personal relationships with it, had been of great importance in the great Wessex novels, so the landscape of Wales, especially that of the Corwen region, was now significant.\n\nThe landscape and the intimate relationship that characters have with the elements, including the sky, wind, plants, animals, and insects, are of great significance in all Powys's works. These are linked to another major influence on Powys, Romanticism, especially William Wordsworth and writers influenced by Wordsworth such as Walter Pater. Powys was also an admirer of Goethe and Rousseau. Words such as \"mysticism\" and \"pantheism\" are sometimes used in discussing Powys’s attitude to nature, but what he is concerned with is an ecstatic response to the natural world, epiphanies such as Wordsworth describes in his \"\", with an important difference in that Powys believes that the ecstasy of the young child can be retained by any adult who actively cultivates the power of the imagination. Some have compared this to zen and such contemplative practices, and for Powys, and the protagonists of his novels who usually resemble him, the cultivation of a psycho-sensuous philosophy is as important as the Christian religion was for an earlier generation.\n\nMore minor in scale, the novels that followed \"Porius\" are characterized by an element of fantasy. \"The Inmates\" (1952) is set in a madhouse and explores Powys's interest in mental illness. But it is a work on which Powys failed to bestow sufficient \"time and care\". Glen Cavaliero, in \"John Cowper Powys: Novelist\", describes the novels written after \"Porius\" as \"the spontaneous fairy tales of Rabelaisian surrealist enchanted with life\", and finds \"Atlantis\" (1954) \"the richest and most sustained\" of them. \"Atlantis\" is set in the Homeric world and the protagonist is Nisos the young son of Odysseus who plans to voyage west from Ithaca over the drowned Atlantis. Powys final fiction, such as \"Up and Out\" (1957) and \"All or Nothing\" (1960) \"use the mode of science fiction, although science has no part in them\".\n\nOne of Powys's most important works, his \"Autobiography\" (1934), which describes his first 60 years. While he sets out to be totally frank about himself, and especially his sexual peculiarities and perversions, he largely excludes any substantial discussion of the women in his life. The reason for this is now much clearer because we now know that it was written while he was still married to Margaret, though he was living in a permanent relationship with Phyllis Playter.\n\nIt is one of his most important works and writer J. B. Priestley suggests that, even if Powys had not written a single novel, \"this one book alone would have proved him to be a writer of genius.\" And it \"has justly been compared to the \"Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\"\n\nJohn Cowper Powys was a prolific writer of letters, many of which have been published, and kept a diary from 1929; several diaries, including this one, have been published. Among his correspondents were the novelists Theodore Dreiser, James Purdy, James Hanley, Henry Miller and Dorothy Richardson, but he also replied to the many ordinary admirers who wrote to him.\n\nPeriodically, over almost 50 years, starting with \"Confessions of Two Brothers\" in 1916, Powys wrote works that present his personal philosophy of life. These are not works of philosophy in the academic sense, and in a bookstore the appropriate section might be self-help. Powys describes \"A Philosophy of Solitude\" (1933) as a \"short textbook of the various mental tricks by which the human soul can obtain […] comparative happiness beneath the normal burden of human fate\". It might seem that Powys's various works of popular philosophy were mere potboilers, written to help their finances while he was working on his novels, but critics like Denis Lane, Harald Fawkner, and Janina Nordius believe that they give insight into \"the intellectual structures that form the metastructures of the great novels\". These works were frequently best sellers, especially in the USA. \"The Meaning of Culture\" published in 1929 went through twenty editions in Powys's lifetime. \"In Defence of Sensuality\", published at the end of the following year, was yet another best seller, as was \"A Philosophy of Solitude\" (1933).\n\nTaking advantage of his reputation as an itinerant lecturer, Powys published in 1915 a collection of literary essays, \"Visions and Revisions\". This was published by the manager of his lecture tours, Arnold Shaw, as was the subsequent \"Suspended Judgements: Essays on Books and Sensations\" (1916) and \"One Hundred Best Books\" (1916). \"Visions and Revisions\" went through four impressions in sixteen months. In the next thirty years he published another collection of essays, \"The Enjoyment of Literature\" (1938) (\"The Pleasures of Literature\" in the UK), and three studies of writers, \"Dorothy Richardson\" (1931), \"Dostoievsky\" (1947), and \"Rabelais\" (1948), as well as essays in journals on various writers, including Theodore Dreiser, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and D.H. Lawrence. There is also a work on John Keats, part of which was published posthumously, and a study of Aristophanes that Powys was working on in his later years.\n\nPowys's literary criticism was generally well received by reviewers and Morine Krissdottir in her recent biography of Powys describes the essays in \"Suspended Judgements\" as \"fine criticism\". With regard to \"The Pleasures of Literature\", writer Kenneth Hopkins states that \"[i]f ever there was a book of criticism for the general reader, this is it\". In the 1940s Powys wrote books on two of his favourite authors, \"Dostoievsky\" (1946) and \"Rabelais\" (1948). The latter was particularly praised by a number of reviewers. Rabelais scholar Donald M. Frame, for example, in the \"Romantic Review\", December 1951, describes Powys's translation (which was only of one fourth of Rabelais) \"the best we have in English\". A French translation of \"Rabelais\", by Catherine Lieutenant, was published in 1990.\n\nPowys is a somewhat controversial writer \"who evokes both massive contempt and near idolatry\". Thus while Walter Allen in \"Tradition and Dream\" recognises Powys's genius, he is dissatisfied with what Powys has done with it, seeing Powys's approach to the novel, as \"so alien to the temper of the age as to be impossible for many people to take seriously\". Annie Dillard, however, views things quite differently: \"John Cowper Powys is a powerful genius, whose novels stir us deeply.\" What is noteworthy is that throughout his career he consistently gained the admiration of novelists as diverse as Theodore Dreiser, Henry Miller, Iris Murdoch, Margaret Drabble, and James Purdy, as well as the academic critics George Painter, G. Wilson Knight, George Steiner, Harald Fawkner, and Jerome McGann. In his autobiography, film director John Boorman wrote that he had contemplated a movie adaptation of \"A Glastonbury Romance\" early in his career.\n\nIn 1958 \"Powys was presented with the Bronze Plaque of the Hamburg Free Academy of Arts in recognition of his outstanding services to literature and philosophy\". Then on 23 July 1962, Powys, who was 90, was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters \"in absentia\", by the University of Wales at Swansea, where he was described as \"patriarch of the literature of these islands\". He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Enid Starkie in 1958, and by G. Wilson Knight in 1959 and 1962.\n\nPowys's works have been translated into French, German, Swedish, Japanese, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His uncle and teacher was Menahem ben Ḥelbo, whom Ḳara often cites in his commentaries, these quotations being almost the only source of knowledge concerning Menahem's exegesis.\n\nḲara frequented Rashi's house; it is even possible that he was Rashi's pupil, though this is denied by A. Epstein. They each quote from the other.\n\nIn Rashi's house Ḳara also made the acquaintance of Samuel ben Meïr. They likewise quote each other. Isaac Ḳara, of whose exegesis specimens are given in \"Monatsschrift,\" 1864, p. 219; 1865, p. 384, may be a son of Joseph.\n\nThe surname \"Ḳara\" is usually taken to be a professional name, meaning \"reader\" or \"interpreter of the Bible\". Adolf Jellinek points out, however, that \"Ḳara,\" as contrasted with \"Darshan,\" means the representative of the \"Peshaṭ\" (\"Pashṭan\").\n\nHe was among the first French exegetes and the forerunner of the French school of exegetes later to come. They were all to some extent influenced by his works, most notably among them, the Rashbam. Rashi too was influenced by R. Yosef who repeated his teacher's comments to him and incorporated several of them in his commentary.\n\nḲara was a prolific exegetical writer. When he copied Rashi's commentary on the Pentateuch he added numerous glosses and remarks in order to supplement and revise it; and these glosses were inserted by the scribes in the text of Rashi. They have been collected.\n\nThe original or independent Bible commentaries of Ḳara are:\n\nIt is quite possible that Ḳara wrote also commentaries on \"Ezra and Nehemiah,\" but that the commentaries on these books as contained in MS. Saraval No. 27, and ascribed to Joseph Ḳara, are not genuine (A. Geiger, in \"Oẓar Neḥmad,\" iv.43 et seq.). Some comments of Ḳara on \"Chronicles\" must have existed, as is proved by the quotations in pseudo-Rashi to those books (see \"II Chron.\" iii.15, v.9, xxv.24). According to Epstein (l.c. i.29 et seq.), Ḳara wrote additionally\n\nWhile in his glosses on the Pentateuch and in his commentaries on the Prophets Ḳara depends upon Rashi to the greatest extent, his explanations of the \"Hagiographa\" are more original. He quotes Menahem ben Saruḳ, Dunash ibn Labraṭ, Judah and Moses ha-Darshan, Ḳalir, Meïr Sheliaḥ Ẓibbur, Kalonymus, and others. In his commentary on \"Book of Job\" he frequently uses the writings of Shabbethai Donnolo, and gives very valuable extracts from the lost \"Baraita of Samuel\" with Donnolo's commentary (comp. Epstein, l.c. pp. 34 et seq.).\n\nHis grammatical standpoint is that of Rashi. Whole Hebrew sentences are sometimes translated into French. In his expressions he is not as terse as Rashi. He is bold enough to express the opinion that the Book of Samuel was not written by the prophet himself, but later (\"Commentary on I Samuel\" ix.9). He does not go into grammatical or philological research, and cares more for the sense of the whole sentence than for a single word. He shows more common sense than depth, and though he does not altogether hold aloof from haggadic interpretations, he takes a leading place among the exegetes of northern France, who in general preferred the rational exegesis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37387161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37387161", "title": "Korean Seon", "text": "Korean Seon\n\nSeon Buddhism (Korean: 선; : [sŏn]) is the transformative facture of Chan Buddhism tradition and creed in Korea. A main feature of Seon Buddhism is a method of meditation, Ganhwa Seon (Korean: 간화선). A Korean monk, Jinul (Korean: 지눌) accepted partially a meditative method of Chan Buddhism in 1205. In Chan Buddhism, hwadu (Korean: 화두) was a delivery of realising a natural state of the Awakening. Jinul addressed a doctrine of Sagyo Yiepseon (Korean: 사교입선) that monks should live an inborn life after learning and forgetting all creeds and theories. Within the doctrine of Jinul, hwadu is the witnessing of truthful meaning in everyday life.\n\nDuring the Goryeo dynasty Jinul strongly influenced Korean Buddhism. He was the first monk to be appointed a national teacher and advisor by the king, having written a book presenting the Seon tradition from the Song dynasty. And this Seon tradition preserved well to this day, after Taego Bou brought his Dharma transmission to Goryeo.\n\nThe Joseon dynasty suppressed buddhism in favour of confucianism. In spite of the suppression, Hyujeong wrote about the three religions (Seon Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism) in the Joseon dynasty from Seon point of view. He also succeeded to the Dharma transmission. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), Hyujeong and Yujeong commanded guerrilla units of monks and took part in diplomacy. \n\nUnder annexation by Japan most monks were forced to marry - this lasted about 40 years until the act of purification. During those times, masters like Gyoengheo and Mangong kept Dharma transmission alive.\n\n21th centry, the few left this Dharma transmission. \"남진제 북송담'(南眞際 北松潭) (Jinje to the south, Songdam to the north).\" is well-known phrase in Korean seon tradition these days. Others are Seungsahn, Daewon.\n\nChan was transmitted into Unified Silla (668-935). Beomnang (法朗, Pŏmnang, Peomnang) (632-646), who studied with the Fourth Patriarch Dayi Daoxin (道信) (580-651), was the first to bring the teachings to Korea. Beomnang transmitted his teachings to Sinhaeng (神行) (704-779), who also traveled to China. Sinhaeng studied with Puji (651–739), a successor of Yuquan Shenxiu (died 706), the head of the East Mountain Teaching of Chan. Seon was further popularized by Doui (道義) (died 825) at the beginning of the ninth century.\n\nSeon was gradually further transmitted into Korea, as Korean monks of predominantly Hwaeom (華嚴) and Yogacara (唯識) background began to travel to China to study the Hongzhou school of Mazu Daoyi (709–788) and his successors and the Rinzai school of Linji Yixuan. Mazu's successors had numerous Korean students, some of whom returned to Korea and established their own schools at various mountain monasteries with their leading disciples.\n\nInitially, the number of these schools was fixed at nine. Seon was termed the nine mountain schools\" at the time. Eight of these were of the lineage of Mazu Daoyi (馬祖道一) (709-788), as they were established through connection with either him or one of his eminent disciples. The one exception was the Sumi-san school founded by Yieom (利嚴) (869-936), which had developed from the Caodong school (曹洞).\n\nToǔi (道義 Doui) (died 825), who studied with Zhizang (735-814) and Baizhang Huaihai (百丈) (749-814) is regarded as the first patriarch of Korean Sŏn. He founded the Kaji Mountain school (迦智山 Gaji san school). The Nine mountain Schools adopted the name Jogye Order in 826. The first record of the Nine Mountains school dates from 1084.\n\nBy the eleventh century Sŏn Buddhism became established in Korea. It distinguished itself from the existing Five Schools and their scriptural emphasis. Tension developed between the new meditational schools and the previously existing scholastic schools, which were described by the term \"gyo\", meaning \"learning\" or \"study\". Efforts were needed to attain mutual understanding and rapprochement between Sŏn and these scholastic schools.\n\nThe most important figure of Goryeo-era Seon was Jinul (, 1158-1210), who established a reform movement in Korea. In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism was seen as infected by secular tendencies and involvements, such as fortune-telling and the offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. This perceived corruption was seen to create a profusion of monks and nuns with questionable motives. Therefore, the correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism were prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.\n\nJinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon, which he called the \"samādhi and prajñā society\". Its goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the Songgwangsa (松廣寺) at Jogyesan as a new center of pure practice.\n\nJinul's works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. He laid an equal emphasis on doctrinal teaching and Sŏn practice. One major issue that had long fermented in Chan, and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between \"gradual\" and \"sudden\" methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by Guifeng Zongmi (780-841) and Dahui Zonggao (大慧宗杲) (1089–1163), Jinul created Pojo Sŏn, a \"sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice\" dictum, which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts. Jinul incorporated Dahui Zonggao's \"gwanhwa\" (, \"observing the critical phrase\") into his practice. This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean Seon today.\n\nJinul's philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.\n\nJinul’s successor, Chin’gak Hyesim (혜심/慧諶: 1178~1234) further emphasized the hwadu (Ch. huatou, \"word head\" or \"critical phrase\") practice. He collected 1,125 gongans in his \"Sŏnmun yŏmsongjip\" (\"The Collection of Verses and Cases\", 1226). Hyesim encouraged female practitioners to practice hwadu, where-as women’s Buddhist practice was limited to chanting and sūtra-readings.\n\nIt was during the time of Jinul that the Jogye Order, a Seon sect, became the predominant form of Korean Buddhism, a status it still holds. Taego Bou (1301–1382) studied the Linji school in China and returned to unite the Nine Mountain Schools.\n\nThere would be a series of important Seon teachers during the next several centuries, such as Hyegeun (, 1320-76), Taego Bou (1301–82), Gihwa (1376–1433) and Hyujeong (1520-1604), who continued to develop the basic mold of Korean meditational Buddhism established by Jinul.\n\nAt the end of Goryeo and during Joseon the Jogye Order was combined with the scholarly schools. It lost influence under the ruling class, which embraced neo-Confucianism. Buddhism was gradually suppressed for the next 500 years. The number of temples was reduced, restrictions on membership in the sangha were installed, and Buddhist monks and nuns were literally chased into the mountains, forbidden to mix with society. Joseon Buddhism was first condensed to Seon and Gyo. Eventually, these were further reduced to the single school of Seon.\n\nGiwha wrote an important treatise in defense of Buddhism, the \"Hyeonjeong non\". In the tradition of earlier philosophers, he applied Essence-Function and \"Hwaeom\" (\"sa-sa mu-ae\", \"mutual interpenetration of phenomena\").\n\nDuring Joseon, the number of Buddhist monasteries dropped from several hundred to a mere thirty-six. Limits were placed on the number of clergy, land area, and ages for entering the sangha. When the final restrictions were in place, monks and nuns were prohibited from entering the cities. Buddhist funerals, and even begging, were outlawed. A few rulers temporarily lifted the more suppressive regulations. The most noteworthy of these was the Queen Munjeong. The queen had deep respect for the brilliant monk \"Bou\" (보우, 普雨; 1515–1565), and installed him as the head of the Seon school.\n\nBuddhist monks helped in repelling the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98). Monks were organized into guerrilla units, which enjoyed some instrumental successes. The \"righteous monk\" (義士; \"uisa\") movement was led by Hyujeong (1520–1604), a Seon master and the author of a number of important religious texts. The presence of the monks' army was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders.\n\nSeosan made efforts toward the unification of Buddhist doctrinal study and practice. He was strongly influenced by Wonhyo, Jinul, and Giwha. He is considered the central figure in the revival of Joseon Buddhism, and most major streams of modern Korean Seon trace their lineages back to him through one of his four main disciples: Yujeong (1544–1610); Eongi (1581–1644), Taeneung (1562–1649) and Ilseon (1533–1608), all four of whom were lieutenants to Seosan during the war with Japan.\nBuddhism during the three centuries, from the time of Seosan down to the next Japanese incursion into Korea in the late nineteenth century, did not change very much. The Buddhism of the late Joseon Kingdom saw a revival of Hwaeom studies. There was also a revival of Pure Land Buddhism.\n\nWith the Korean Empire started the Gwangmu Reform, a modernisation of Korea. The Korean Empire ended in 1910, when Korea was annexated by Japan.\n\nKorean monks travelled to Japan for the scholarly study of Buddhism, where they were influenced by Japanese scholars who introduced western ideas into their studies. Via those Korean monks western ideas were also introduced in Korean Buddhism, and a bifurcation developed between monks and scholars.\n\nAfter the Second World War the United Nations developed plans for a trusteeship administration, the Soviet Union administering the peninsula north of the 38th parallel and the United States Army Military Government in Korea administering the south. The politics of the Cold War resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate governments, North Korea and South Korea.\n\nSince the middle of the 20th century Christianity has competed with Buddhism in South Korea, while religious practice has been suppressed in North Korea.\n\nSeon continues to be practiced in Korea today at a number of major monastic centers, as well as being taught at Dongguk University, which has a major of studies in this religion. The largest Buddhist denomination is the Jogye Order.\n\nIn the 1980s a debate arose about \"sudden\" versus \"gradual\" enlightenment\". Since Jinul Korean Seon was based on the integration of practice and scholarly study in the slogan \"sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation\". The modern Korean Seon master Seongcheol revived the slogan \"sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation\", ascribed to Huineng. The last three Supreme Patriarchs of the Jogye Order have a stance in this debate that is in accordance with Seongcheol.\n\nKorean Seon has been spread in the US by Seungsahn. He was a temple abbot in Seoul and after living in Hong Kong and Japan, he moved to the US in 1972, not speaking any English. On the flight to Los Angeles, a Korean American passenger offered him a job at a laundry in Providence, Rhode Island, which became headquarters of Seung Sahn's Kwan Um School of Zen. Shortly after arriving in Providence, he attracted students and founded the Providence Zen Center. The Kwan Um School has more than 100 Zen centers on six continents.\nAnother Korean Zen teacher, Samu Sunim, founded Toronto's Zen Buddhist Temple in 1971. He is head of the Buddhist Society for Compassionate Wisdom, which has temples in Ann Arbor, Chicago, Mexico City, and New York City.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Master Kyongho (1849–1912), re-energized Korean Seon. At the end of World War II, his disciple, Master Mann Gong (1871–1946), proclaimed that lineage Dharma should be transmitted worldwide to encourage peace through enlightenment. Consequently, his Dharma successor, Hye Am (1884–1985) brought lineage Dharma to the United States. Hye Am's Dharma successor, Myo Vong founded the Western Son Academy (1976), and his Korean disciple, Pohwa Sunim, founded World Zen Fellowship (1994) which includes various Zen centers in the United States, such as the Potomac Zen Sangha, the Patriarchal Zen Society and the Baltimore Zen Center.\n\n"}

Europe saw the birth of both the Roman Empire and the British Empire, which form the basis of the two dominant forms of legal system of private law, civil and common law.\n\nThe law of Europe has a diverse history. Roman law underwent major codification in the Corpus Juris Civilis of Emperor Justinian, as later developed through the Middle Ages by medieval legal scholars. In Medieval England, judges retained greater power than their continental counterparts and began to develop a body of precedent. Originally civil law was one common legal system in much of Europe, but with the rise of nationalism in the 17th century Nordic countries and around the time of the French Revolution, it became fractured into separate national systems. This change was brought about by the development of separate national codes, of which the French Napoleonic Code and the German and Swiss codes were the most influential. Around this time civil law incorporated many ideas associated with the Enlightenment. The European Union's Law is based on a codified set of laws, laid down in the Treaties. Law in the EU is however mixed with precedent in case law of the European Court of Justice. In accordance with its history, the interpretation of European law relies less on policy considerations than U.S. law.\n\n\n"}

Insofar as he considered human beings to be no more than fragments of nature, thought was considered by him to be the result of cerebral processes which operate largely beneath the level of consciousness. He insisted on the pre-eminence of the body and the fact that, for this reasons, consciousness observes the results of thought, but does not bring them into being.\n\nInspired by Nietzsche's notion of Eternal Recurrence - which Paquet treated not as a doctrine but an operational principle, that is as a means of disentangling ourselves from secondary aspects of our identity (determined by cultural, religious and moral factors) in order to recover our primary nature - he considered a return to the body as the sole ethical value.\n\nHe developed this Spinozan theme in a number of different directions: ontology (\"L'enjeu de la philosophie\", \"Platon: l’éternel retour de la liberté\"), political philosophy (\"Nous autres Européens\", \"Le Fascisme Blanc\") and esthetics, the latter in particular in relation to painting which he defined as the art of rendering the sensory visible. He is the author of a large number of essays consecrated to visual artists whom he knew personally: Jean Dubuffet, Alexander Calder, André Masson, René Magritte, Paul Delvaux, Fernando Botero, Sophia Vari, Corneille (one of the six founders of the Cobra movement), Bram Bogart, Anna Wilczynska-Wilska, Amann...\n\nHe is also the author of several philosophical novels, namely : \"Renaissance sécondaire\", \"Merde à Jésus\", \"L’affaire Socrate\", \"Marie et les Jean\".\n\nHe died in Poznań, Poland on 22 November 2014.\n\nPaquet was born in Jumet, near Charleroi. According to his own account, he had an unhappy childhood. He sought refuge in books, and in particular in Spinoza's Ethics and in Nietzsche's Antichrist. A school trip to London allowed him to discover the works of William Turner; later a visit to Amsterdam gave rise to his passion for the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh as well as allowing him to meet the situationist painter and architect Constant, whose work \"Het Opstand van de Homo ludens\" (\"\"The uprising of\" Homo Ludens\") he translated into French.\n\nHe matriculated at the Free University of Brussels in 1964 and in 1967 became assistant to Professor Pierre Verstraeten. His graduation dissertation dealt with the problem of unity in Kant's thought in the Critique of Judgment (\"L’unité problématique du kantisme dans la Critique de la force de juger\").\n\nIn 1971, he became a junior associate (\"aspirant\") at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research.\n\nHe did research into fanaticism and published a number of articles including \"Essai sur l’absolu\" (\"Essay on the concept of the Absolute\") which brought him to the attention of French philosopher Gérard Lebrun and led to a professorship in the history of German Philosophy at the University of Tunis.\n\nIt was during his period in Tunis, which lasted from 1972 to 1974, that he wrote his first published work \"L’enjeu de la philosophie\" (\"The Question of Philosophy\") and he began work on his doctoral dissertation on \"The difference between the thought of Kant and Hegel on the question of the essence of art\" (\"La différence des pensées de Kant et de Hegel dans la question de l’essence de l’art\".\n\nIn 1975, he was one of the founders of the publishing house \"Les Éditions de la Différence\".\n\nIn 1978, he obtained his doctorate and continued to work on issues related to painting (René Magritte, Paul Delvaux, Fernando Botero).\n\nIn 1981, he took part, together with Hans-Georg Gadamer in the colloquium \"1881: The great year of Zarathustra\" organised at the Brock University of Saint-Catharines in Canada: he made a presentation of his concept of \"dansité\", a play on words which suggests both \"innerness\" and dance, which was later incorporated into his book \"Magritte ou l’éclipse de l’être\".\n\nHe subsequently took up residence in Canada, where he lived in Ontario and for a time in Quebec.\n\nIn 1988, he taught French literature at the University of Udine in Italy.\n\nUpon his return to Belgium, he made the acquaintance of Bram Bogart in relation to whom he wrote a number of articles.\n\nIn Paris in 1990 he met a number of artists of the \"New New Painting\" group and developed a theoretical account of their artistic approach, set out in a work published by the publishing house \"Nouvelles éditions françaises\".\n\nIn 1993, he created the \"École européenne de philosophie de Charleroi\". This school organized amongst other things courses on the concept of \"ethical conciliation\" and on a draft political constitution for Wallonia which Paquet drew up.\n\nIn 1996, he took up residence in Biarritz where in 1997 he married the painter Anna Wilczynska-Wilska. He organized a retrospective dedicated to Bram Bogart and various events devoted to the painter Amann and the pictorial movement of \"New Pigmentation\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19547", "title": "Modernism", "text": "Modernism\n\nModernism is a philosophical movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.\n\nModernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to \"Make it new!\" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the stream-of-consciousness novel, atonal (or pantonal) and twelve-tone music, divisionist painting and abstract art, all had precursors in the 19th century.\n\nA notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc. Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and makes use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody.\n\nSome commentators define modernism as a mode of thinking—one or more philosophically defined characteristics, like self-consciousness or self-reference, that run across all the novelties in the arts and the disciplines. More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology. From this perspective, modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was 'holding back' progress, and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. Others focus on modernism as an aesthetic introspection. This facilitates consideration of specific reactions to the use of technology in the First World War, and anti-technological and nihilistic aspects of the works of diverse thinkers and artists spanning the period from Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) to Samuel Beckett (1906–1989).\n\nWhile some scholars see modernism continuing into the twenty first century, others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism. Postmodernism is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions.\n\nAccording to one critic, modernism developed out of Romanticism's revolt against the effects of the Industrial Revolution and bourgeois values: \"The ground motive of modernism, Graff asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism.\" While J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), one of the greatest landscape painters of the 19th century, was a member of the Romantic movement, as \"a pioneer in the study of light, colour, and atmosphere\", he \"anticipated the French Impressionists\" and therefore modernism \"in breaking down conventional formulas of representation; [though] unlike them, he believed that his works should always express significant historical, mythological, literary, or other narrative themes.\"\nThe dominant trends of industrial Victorian England were opposed, from about 1850, by the English poets and painters that constituted the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, because of their \"opposition to technical skill without inspiration.\" They were influenced by the writings of the art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900), who had strong feelings about the role of art in helping to improve the lives of the urban working classes, in the rapidly expanding industrial cities of Britain. Art critic Clement Greenberg describes the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as proto-Modernists: \"There the proto-Modernists were, of all people, the pre-Raphaelites (and even before them, as proto-proto-Modernists, the German Nazarenes). The Pre-Raphaelites actually foreshadowed Manet (1832–83), with whom Modernist painting most definitely begins. They acted on a dissatisfaction with painting as practiced in their time, holding that its realism wasn't truthful enough.\" Rationalism has also had opponents in the philosophers Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55) and later Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), both of whom had significant influence on existentialism.\n\nHowever, the Industrial Revolution continued. Influential innovations included steam-powered industrialization, and especially the development of railways, starting in Britain in the 1830s, and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture associated with this. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was The Crystal Palace, the huge cast-iron and plate glass exhibition hall built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style in the construction of major railway terminals in London, such as Paddington Station (1854) and King's Cross station (1852). These technological advances led to the building of later structures like the Brooklyn Bridge (1883) and the Eiffel Tower (1889). The latter broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be. These engineering marvels radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people. The human experience of time itself was altered, with the development of the electric telegraph from 1837, and the adoption of standard time by British railway companies from 1845, and in the rest of the world over the next fifty years.\n\nBut despite continuing technological advances the idea that history and civilization were inherently progressive, and that progress was always good, came under increasing attack in the nineteenth century. Arguments arose that the values of the artist and those of society were not merely different, but that Society was antithetical to Progress, and could not move forward in its present form. Early in the century, the philosopher Schopenhauer (1788–1860) (\"The World as Will and Representation\", 1819) had called into question the previous optimism, and his ideas had an important influence on later thinkers, including Nietzsche. Two of the most significant thinkers of the mid nineteenth century were biologist Charles Darwin (1809–1882), author of \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection\" (1859), and political scientist Karl Marx (1818–1883), author of \"Das Kapital\" (1867). Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection undermined religious certainty and the idea of human uniqueness. In particular, the notion that human beings were driven by the same impulses as \"lower animals\" proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality. Karl Marx argued that there were fundamental contradictions within the capitalist system, and that the workers were anything but free.\nHistorians, and writers in different disciplines, have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism. Historian William Everdell, for example, has argued that modernism began in the 1870s, when metaphorical (or ontological) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician Richard Dedekind's (1831–1916) Dedekind cut, and Ludwig Boltzmann's (1844–1906) statistical thermodynamics. Everdell also thinks modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with Seurat's Divisionism, the \"dots\" used to paint \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\". On the other hand, visual art critic Clement Greenberg called Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) \"the first real Modernist\", though he also wrote, \"What can be safely called Modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with Baudelaire in literature and Manet in painting, and perhaps with Flaubert, too, in prose fiction. (It was a while later, and not so locally, that Modernism appeared in music and architecture).\" The poet Baudelaire's \"Les Fleurs du mal\" (\"The Flowers of Evil\"), and Flaubert's novel \"Madame Bovary\" were both published in 1857.\n\nIn the arts and letters, two important approaches developed separately in France, beginning in the 1860s. The first was Impressionism, a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors (\"en plein air\"). Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored Paris Salon, the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the Salon des Refusés, created by Emperor Napoleon III to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. While most were in standard styles, but by inferior artists, the work of Manet attracted tremendous attention, and opened commercial doors to the movement. The second French school was Symbolism, which literary historians see beginning with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867), and including the later poets, Arthur Rimbaud (1854–1891) \"Une Saison en Enfer\" (\"A Season in Hell\", 1873), Paul Verlaine (1844–1896), Stéphane Mallarmé (1842–1898), and Paul Valéry (1871–1945). The symbolists \"stressed the priority of suggestion and evocation over direct description and explicit analogy,\" and were especially interested in \"the musical properties of language.\"\nCabaret, which gave birth to so many of the arts of modernism, including the immediate precursors of film, may be said to have begun in France in 1881 with the opening of the Black Cat in Montmartre, the beginning of the ironic monologue, and the founding of the Society of Incoherent Arts.\n\nInfluential in the early days of modernism were the theories of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). Freud's first major work was \"Studies on Hysteria\" (with Josef Breuer, 1895). Central to Freud's thinking is the idea \"of the primacy of the unconscious mind in mental life,\" so that all subjective reality was based on the play of basic drives and instincts, through which the outside world was perceived. Freud's description of subjective states involved an unconscious mind full of primal impulses, and counterbalancing self-imposed restrictions derived from social values.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was another major precursor of modernism, with a philosophy in which psychological drives, specifically the \"will to power\" (\"Wille zur Macht\"), was of central importance: \"Nietzsche often identified life itself with 'will to power', that is, with an instinct for growth and durability.\" Henri Bergson (1859–1941), on the other hand, emphasized the difference between scientific, clock time and the direct, subjective, human experience of time. His work on time and consciousness \"had a great influence on twentieth-century novelists,\" especially those Modernists who used the stream of consciousness technique, such as Dorothy Richardson, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf (1882–1941). Also important in Bergson's philosophy was the idea of \"élan vital\", the life force, which \"brings about the creative evolution of everything.\" His philosophy also placed a high value on intuition, though without rejecting the importance of the intellect.\n\nImportant literary precursors of modernism were Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821–1881), who wrote the novels \"Crime and Punishment\" (1866) and \"The Brothers Karamazov\" (1880); Walt Whitman (1819–1892), who published the poetry collection \"Leaves of Grass\" (1855–1891); and August Strindberg (1849–1912), especially his later plays, including the trilogy \"To Damascus\" 1898–1901, \"A Dream Play\" (1902) and \"The Ghost Sonata\" (1907). Henry James has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as \"The Portrait of a Lady\" (1881).\n\nOut of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism, and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of works in the first decade of the 20th century, which, while their authors considered them extensions of existing trends in art, broke the implicit contract with the general public that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas. These \"Modernist\" landmarks include the atonal ending of Arnold Schoenberg's Second String Quartet in 1908, the expressionist paintings of Wassily Kandinsky starting in 1903, and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the Blue Rider group in Munich in 1911, and the rise of fauvism and the inventions of cubism from the studios of Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and others, in the years between 1900 and 1910.\n\nAn important aspect of modernism is how it relates to tradition through its adoption of techniques like reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody in new forms.\nT. S. Eliot made significant comments on the relation of the artist to tradition, including: \"[W]e shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet's] work, may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.\" However, the relationship of Modernism with tradition was complex, as literary scholar Peter Childs indicates: \"There were paradoxical if not opposed trends towards revolutionary and reactionary positions, fear of the new and delight at the disappearance of the old, nihilism and fanatical enthusiasm, creativity and despair.\"\n\nAn example of how Modernist art can be both revolutionary and yet be related to past tradition, is the music of the composer Arnold Schoenberg. On the one hand Schoenberg rejected traditional tonal harmony, the hierarchical system of organizing works of music that had guided music making for at least a century and a half. He believed he had discovered a wholly new way of organizing sound, based in the use of twelve-note rows. Yet while this was indeed wholly new, its origins can be traced back in the work of earlier composers, such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss and Max Reger. Furthermore, it must be noted that Schoenberg also wrote tonal music throughout his career.\n\nIn the world of art, in the first decade of the 20th century, young painters such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse were causing a shock with their rejection of traditional perspective as the means of structuring paintings, though the impressionist Monet had already been innovative in his use of perspective. In 1907, as Picasso was painting \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", Oskar Kokoschka was writing \"Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen\" (\"Murderer, Hope of Women\"), the first Expressionist play (produced with scandal in 1909), and Arnold Schoenberg was composing his String Quartet No.2 in F sharp minor (1908), his first composition without a tonal centre.\n\nA primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne, which were displayed in a retrospective at the 1907 Salon d'Automne. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form; instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Cubism was brought to the attention of the general public for the first time in 1911 at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris (held 21 April – 13 June). Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger and Roger de La Fresnaye were shown together in Room 41, provoking a 'scandal' out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond. Also in 1911, Kandinsky painted \"Bild mit Kreis\" (\"Picture with a Circle\"), which he later called the first abstract painting. In 1912, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote the first (and only) major Cubist manifesto, \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", published in time for the Salon de la Section d'Or, the largest Cubist exhibition to date. In 1912 Metzinger painted and exhibited his enchanting \"La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a Horse)\" and \"Danseuse au Café (Dancer in a Café)\". Albert Gleizes painted and exhibited his \"Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)\" and his monumental \"Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)\". This work, along with \"La Ville de Paris\" (\"City of Paris\") by Robert Delaunay, was the largest and most ambitious Cubist painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period.\n\nIn 1905, a group of four German artists, led by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, formed Die Brücke (the Bridge) in the city of Dresden. This was arguably the founding organization for the German Expressionist movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from Wassily Kandinsky's \"Der Blaue Reiter\" painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, Franz Marc, Paul Klee, and August Macke. However, the term \"Expressionism\" did not firmly establish itself until 1913. Though initially mainly a German artistic movement, most predominant in painting, poetry and the theatre between 1910 and 1930, most precursors of the movement were not German. Furthermore, there have been expressionist writers of prose fiction, as well as non-German speaking expressionist writers, and, while the movement had declined in Germany with the rise of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, there were subsequent expressionist works.\n\nExpressionism is notoriously difficult to define, in part because it \"overlapped with other major 'isms' of the modernist period: with Futurism, Vorticism, Cubism, Surrealism and Dada.\" Richard Murphy also comments: \"the search for an all-inclusive definition is problematic to the extent that the most challenging expressionists\" such as the novelist Franz Kafka, poet Gottfried Benn, and novelist Alfred Döblin were simultaneously the most vociferous anti-expressionists. What, however, can be said, is that it was a movement that developed in the early 20th century mainly in Germany in reaction to the dehumanizing effect of industrialization and the growth of cities, and that \"one of the central means by which expressionism identifies itself as an avant-garde movement, and by which it marks its distance to traditions and the cultural institution as a whole is through its relationship to realism and the dominant conventions of representation.\" More explicitly: that the expressionists rejected the ideology of realism. \n\nThere was a concentrated Expressionist movement in early 20th century German theatre, of which Georg Kaiser and Ernst Toller were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included Reinhard Sorge, Walter Hasenclever, Hans Henny Jahnn, and Arnolt Bronnen. They looked back to Swedish playwright August Strindberg and German actor and dramatist Frank Wedekind as precursors of their dramaturgical experiments. Oskar Kokoschka's \"Murderer, the Hope of Women\" was the first fully Expressionist work for the theatre, which opened on 4 July 1909 in Vienna. The extreme simplification of characters to mythic types, choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity would become characteristic of later Expressionist plays. The first full-length Expressionist play was \"The Son\" by Walter Hasenclever, which was published in 1914 and first performed in 1916.\n\nFuturism is yet another modernist movement. In 1909, the Parisian newspaper \"Le Figaro\" published F. T. Marinetti's first manifesto. Soon afterwards a group of painters (Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo, and Gino Severini) co-signed the Futurist Manifesto. Modeled on Marx and Engels' famous \"Communist Manifesto\" (1848), such manifestoes put forward ideas that were meant to provoke and to gather followers. However, arguments in favor of geometric or purely abstract painting were, at this time, largely confined to \"little magazines\" which had only tiny circulations. Modernist primitivism and pessimism were controversial, and the mainstream in the first decade of the 20th century was still inclined towards a faith in progress and liberal optimism.\nAbstract artists, taking as their examples the impressionists, as well as Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) and Edvard Munch (1863–1944), began with the assumption that color and shape, not the depiction of the natural world, formed the essential characteristics of art. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time. Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, and Kazimir Malevich all believed in redefining art as the arrangement of pure color. The use of photography, which had rendered much of the representational function of visual art obsolete, strongly affected this aspect of modernism.\n\nModernist architects and designers, such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier, believed that new technology rendered old styles of building obsolete. Le Corbusier thought that buildings should function as \"machines for living in\", analogous to cars, which he saw as machines for traveling in. Just as cars had replaced the horse, so modernist design should reject the old styles and structures inherited from Ancient Greece or from the Middle Ages. Following this machine aesthetic, modernist designers typically rejected decorative motifs in design, preferring to emphasize the materials used and pure geometrical forms. The skyscraper is the archetypal modernist building, and the Wainwright Building, a 10-story office building built 1890–91, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, is among the first skyscrapers in the world. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956–1958) is often regarded as the pinnacle of this modernist high-rise architecture. Many aspects of modernist design still persist within the mainstream of contemporary architecture, though previous dogmatism has given way to a more playful use of decoration, historical quotation, and spatial drama.\nIn 1913—which was the year of philosopher Edmund Husserl's \"Ideas\", physicist Niels Bohr's quantized atom, Ezra Pound's founding of imagism, the Armory Show in New York, and in Saint Petersburg the \"first futurist opera\", Mikhail Matyushin's \"Victory over the Sun\"—another Russian composer, Igor Stravinsky, composed \"The Rite of Spring\", a ballet that depicts human sacrifice, and has a musical score full of dissonance and primitive rhythm. This caused uproar on its first performance in Paris. At this time though modernism was still \"progressive\", increasingly it saw traditional forms and traditional social arrangements as hindering progress, and was recasting the artist as a revolutionary, engaged in overthrowing rather than enlightening society. Also in 1913 a less violent event occurred in France with the publication of the first volume of Marcel Proust's important novel sequence \"À la recherche du temps perdu\" (1913–1927) (\"In Search of Lost Time\"). This is often presented as an early example of a writer using the stream-of-consciousness technique, but Robert Humphrey comments that Proust \"is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness\" and that he \"was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of-consciousness novel.\"\n\nStream of consciousness was an important modernist literary innovation, and it has been suggested that Arthur Schnitzler (1862–1931) was the first to make full use of it in his short story \"Leutnant Gustl\" (\"None but the Brave\") (1900). Dorothy Richardson was the first English writer to use it, in the early volumes of her novel sequence \"Pilgrimage\" (1915–67). The other modernist novelists that are associated with the use of this narrative technique include James Joyce in \"Ulysses\" (1922) and Italo Svevo in \"La coscienza di Zeno\" (1923).\n\nHowever, with the coming of the Great War of 1914–18 and the Russian Revolution of 1917, the world was drastically changed and doubt cast on the beliefs and institutions of the past. The failure of the previous status quo seemed self-evident to a generation that had seen millions die fighting over scraps of earth: prior to 1914 it had been argued that no one would fight such a war, since the cost was too high. The birth of a machine age which had made major changes in the conditions of daily life in the 19th century now had radically changed the nature of warfare. The traumatic nature of recent experience altered basic assumptions, and realistic depiction of life in the arts seemed inadequate when faced with the fantastically surreal nature of trench warfare. The view that mankind was making steady moral progress now seemed ridiculous in the face of the senseless slaughter, described in works such as Erich Maria Remarque's novel \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1929). Therefore, modernism's view of reality, which had been a minority taste before the war, became more generally accepted in the 1920s.\n\nIn literature and visual art some Modernists sought to defy expectations mainly in order to make their art more vivid, or to force the audience to take the trouble to question their own preconceptions. This aspect of modernism has often seemed a reaction to consumer culture, which developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century. Whereas most manufacturers try to make products that will be marketable by appealing to preferences and prejudices, high modernists rejected such consumerist attitudes in order to undermine conventional thinking. The art critic Clement Greenberg expounded this theory of modernism in his essay \"Avant-Garde and Kitsch\". Greenberg labeled the products of consumer culture \"kitsch\", because their design aimed simply to have maximum appeal, with any difficult features removed. For Greenberg, modernism thus formed a reaction against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial popular music, Hollywood, and advertising. Greenberg associated this with the revolutionary rejection of capitalism.\n\nSome Modernists saw themselves as part of a revolutionary culture that included political revolution. In Russia after the 1917 Revolution there was indeed initially a burgeoning of avant-garde cultural activity, which included Russian Futurism. However others rejected conventional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of political consciousness had greater importance than a change in political structures. But many modernists saw themselves as apolitical. Others, such as T. S. Eliot, rejected mass popular culture from a conservative position. Some even argue that modernism in literature and art functioned to sustain an elite culture which excluded the majority of the population.\n\nSurrealism, which originated in the early 1920s, came to be regarded by the public as the most extreme form of modernism, or \"the avant-garde of Modernism\". The word \"surrealist\" was coined by Guillaume Apollinaire and first appeared in the preface to his play \"Les Mamelles de Tirésias\", which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917. Major surrealists include Paul Éluard, Robert Desnos, Max Ernst, Hans Arp, Antonin Artaud, Raymond Queneau, Joan Miró, and Marcel Duchamp.\n\nBy 1930, Modernism had won a place in the establishment, including the political and artistic establishment, although by this time Modernism itself had changed.\n\nModernism continued to evolve during the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1932 composer Arnold Schoenberg worked on \"Moses und Aron\", one of the first operas to make use of the twelve-tone technique, Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 \"Guernica\", his cubist condemnation of fascism, while in 1939 James Joyce pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with \"Finnegans Wake\". Also by 1930 Modernism began to influence mainstream culture, so that, for example, \"The New Yorker\" magazine began publishing work, influenced by Modernism, by young writers and humorists like Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, E. B. White, S. J. Perelman, and James Thurber, amongst others. Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short stories that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in \"The New Yorker\", which are considered to be the first examples of surrealist humor in America. Modern ideas in art also began to appear more frequently in commercials and logos, an early example of which, from 1916, is the famous London Underground logo designed by Edward Johnston.\n\nOne of the most visible changes of this period was the adoption of new technologies into daily life of ordinary people in Western Europe and North America. Electricity, the telephone, the radio, the automobile—and the need to work with them, repair them and live with them—created social change. The kind of disruptive moment that only a few knew in the 1880s became a common occurrence. For example, the speed of communication reserved for the stock brokers of 1890 became part of family life, at least in middle class North America. Associated with urbanization and changing social mores also came smaller families and changed relationships between parents and their children.\nAnother strong influence at this time was Marxism. After the generally primitivistic/irrationalist aspect of pre-World War I Modernism, which for many Modernists precluded any attachment to merely political solutions, and the neoclassicism of the 1920s, as represented most famously by T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky—which rejected popular solutions to modern problems—the rise of Fascism, the Great Depression, and the march to war helped to radicalise a generation. Bertolt Brecht, W. H. Auden, André Breton, Louis Aragon and the philosophers Antonio Gramsci and Walter Benjamin are perhaps the most famous exemplars of this Modernist form of Marxism. There were, however, also Modernists explicitly of 'the right', including Salvador Dalí, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, the Dutch author Menno ter Braak and others.\n\nSignificant Modernist literary works continued to be created in the 1920s and 1930s, including further novels by Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, Robert Musil, and Dorothy Richardson. The American Modernist dramatist Eugene O'Neill's career began in 1914, but his major works appeared in the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s. Two other significant Modernist dramatists writing in the 1920s and 1930s were Bertolt Brecht and Federico García Lorca. D. H. Lawrence's \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" was privately published in 1928, while another important landmark for the history of the modern novel came with the publication of William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\" in 1929. In the 1930s, in addition to further major works by Faulkner, Samuel Beckett published his first major work, the novel \"Murphy\" (1938). Then in 1939 James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\" appeared. This is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, consisting of a mixture of standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words, which attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams. In poetry T. S. Eliot, E. E. Cummings, and Wallace Stevens were writing from the 1920s until the 1950s. While Modernist poetry in English is often viewed as an American phenomenon, with leading exponents including Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, H.D., and Louis Zukofsky, there were important British Modernist poets, including David Jones, Hugh MacDiarmid, Basil Bunting, and W. H. Auden. European Modernist poets include Federico García Lorca, Anna Akhmatova, Constantine Cavafy, and Paul Valéry.\nThe Modernist movement continued during this period in Soviet Russia. In 1930 composer Dimitri Shostakovich's (1906–1975) opera \"The Nose\" was premiered, in which he uses a montage of different styles, including folk music, popular song and atonality. Amongst his influences was Alban Berg's (1985–1935) opera \"Wozzeck\" (1925), which \"had made a tremendous impression on Shostakovich when it was staged in Leningrad.\" However, from 1932 Socialist realism began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union, and in 1936 Shostakovich was attacked and forced to withdraw his 4th Symphony. Alban Berg wrote another significant, though incomplete, Modernist opera, \"Lulu\", which premiered in 1937. Berg's Violin Concerto was first performed in 1935. Like Shostakovich, other composers faced difficulties in this period. In Germany Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) was forced to flee to the U.S. when Hitler came to power in 1933, because of his Modernist atonal style as well as his Jewish ancestry. His major works from this period are a Violin Concerto, Op. 36 (1934/36), and Piano Concerto, Op. 42 (1942). Schoenberg also wrote tonal music in this period with the Suite for Strings in G major (1935) and the Chamber Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939). During this time Hungarian Modernist Béla Bartók (1881–1945) produced a number of major works, including \"Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta\" (1936) and the \"Divertimento for String Orchestra\" (1939), String Quartet No. 5 (1934), and No. 6 (his last, 1939). But he too left for the US in 1940, because of the rise of fascism in Hungary. Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971) continued writing in his neoclassical style during the 1930s and 1940s, writing works like the \"Symphony of Psalms\" (1930), Symphony in C (1940) and \"Symphony in Three Movements\" (1945). He also emigrated to the US because of World War II. Olivier Messiaen (1908–1992), however, served in the French army during the war and was imprisoned at Stalag VIII-A by the Germans, where he composed his famous \"Quatuor pour la fin du temps\" (\"Quartet for the End of Time\"). The quartet was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards.\n\nIn painting, during the 1920s and the 1930s and the Great Depression, modernism is defined by Surrealism, late Cubism, Bauhaus, De Stijl, Dada, German Expressionism, and Modernist and masterful color painters like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard as well as the abstractions of artists like Piet Mondrian and Wassily Kandinsky which characterized the European art scene. In Germany, Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II, while in America, modernism is seen in the form of American Scene painting and the social realism and regionalism movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, George Tooker, John Steuart Curry, Reginald Marsh, and others became prominent. Modernism is defined in Latin America by painters Joaquín Torres García from Uruguay and Rufino Tamayo from Mexico, while the muralist movement with Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martinez Delgado, and Symbolist paintings by Frida Kahlo, began a renaissance of the arts for the region, characterized by a freer use of color and an emphasis on political messages.\n\nDiego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, \"Man at the Crossroads\", in the lobby of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center. When his patron Nelson Rockefeller discovered that the mural included a portrait of Vladimir Lenin and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. Frida Kahlo's (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition, which were often bloody and violent. Frida Kahlo's Symbolist works relate strongly to Surrealism and to the Magic Realism movement in literature.\n\nPolitical activism was an important piece of David Siqueiros' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the Mexican Revolution. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. The young Jackson Pollock attended the workshop and helped build floats for the parade.\n\nDuring the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including Pablo Picasso. On 26 April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the Basque town of Gernika was bombed by Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural-sized \"Guernica\" to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s and through the years of World War II, American art was characterized by Social Realism and American Scene Painting, in the work of Grant Wood, Edward Hopper, Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, and several others. \"Nighthawks\" (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The scene was inspired by a diner in Greenwich Village. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.\n\n\"American Gothic\" is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of Carpenter Gothic style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting; like Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of Sherwood Anderson's 1919 \"Winesburg, Ohio\", Sinclair Lewis's 1920 \"Main Street\", and Carl Van Vechten's \"The Tattooed Countess\" in literature. However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.\n\nThe situation for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazis' power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. \"Degenerate art\" was a term adopted by the Nazi regime in Germany for virtually all modern art. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or Jewish Bolshevist in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely. Degenerate Art was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in Munich in 1937. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with modernism and abstraction that many left for the Americas. German artist Max Beckmann and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, and others were just beginning to come of age.\n\nArshile Gorky's portrait of someone who might be Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of abstract expressionism from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and John D. Graham, Gorky created biomorphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.\n\nWhile \"The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature\" states that modernism ended by c. 1939 with regard to British and American literature, \"When (if) Modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to Modernism occurred.\" Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts, but with regard to music, Paul Griffiths notes that, while Modernism \"seemed to be a spent force\" by the late 1920s, after World War II, \"a new generation of composers—Boulez, Barraqué, Babbitt, Nono, Stockhausen, Xenakis\" revived modernism\". In fact many literary Modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works. The term \"late modernism\" is also sometimes applied to Modernist works published after 1930. Among Modernists (or late Modernists) still publishing after 1945 were Wallace Stevens, Gottfried Benn, T. S. Eliot, Anna Akhmatova, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, John Cowper Powys, and Ezra Pound. Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published his most important Modernist poem \"Briggflatts\" in 1965. In addition, Hermann Broch's \"The Death of Virgil\" was published in 1945 and Thomas Mann's \"Doctor Faustus\" in 1947. Samuel Beckett, who died in 1989, has been described as a \"later Modernist\". Beckett is a writer with roots in the expressionist tradition of Modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including \"Molloy\" (1951), \"Waiting for Godot\" (1953), \"Happy Days\" (1961), and \"Rockaby\" (1981). The terms \"minimalist\" and \"post-Modernist\" have also been applied to his later works. The poets Charles Olson (1910–1970) and J. H. Prynne (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late Modernists.\n\nMore recently the term \"late modernism\" has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of World War II, especially the Holocaust and the dropping of the atom bomb.\n\nThe postwar period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris (the former center of European culture and the former capital of the art world) the climate for art was a disaster. Important collectors, dealers, and Modernist artists, writers, and poets had fled Europe for New York and America. The surrealists and modern artists from every cultural center of Europe had fled the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. A few artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard, remained in France and survived.\n\nThe 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a Modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, surrealism, Joan Miró, cubism, Fauvism, and early modernism via great teachers in America like Hans Hofmann and John D. Graham. American artists benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand Léger, Max Ernst and the André Breton group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim's gallery \"The Art of This Century\", as well as other factors.\n\nParis, moreover, recaptured much of its luster in the 1950s and 60s as the center of a machine art florescence, with both of the leading machine art sculptors Jean Tinguely and Nicolas Schöffer having moved there to launch their careers—and which florescence, in light of the technocentric character of modern life, may well have a particularly long lasting influence.\n\nThe term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence. While there are significant precursors, including Alfred Jarry (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of Samuel Beckett.\n\nCritic Martin Esslin coined the term in his 1960 essay \"Theatre of the Absurd\". He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way Albert Camus uses the term in his 1942 essay, \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to vaudeville, mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the \"well-made play\".\n\nPlaywrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), Eugène Ionesco (1909–1994), Jean Genet (1910–1986), Harold Pinter (1930–2008), Tom Stoppard (born 1937), Alexander Vvedensky (1904–1941), Daniil Kharms (1905–1942), Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–1990), Alejandro Jodorowsky (born 1929), Fernando Arrabal (born 1932), Václav Havel (1936–2011) and Edward Albee (1928–2016).\nDuring the late 1940s Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all contemporary art that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art is made. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—placing unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and nonimagery—essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art.\nThe other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkos and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. Rereadings into abstract art by art historians such as Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock and Catherine de Zegher critically show, however, that pioneering women artists who produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by official accounts of its history.\n\nHenry Moore (1898–1986) emerged after World War II as Britain's leading sculptor. He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.\nIn the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including a reclining figure for the UNESCO building in Paris in 1958. With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore's sculptures grew significantly. The last three decades of Moore's life continued in a similar vein, with several major retrospectives taking place around the world, notably a prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the Forte di Belvedere overlooking Florence. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. On the campus of the University of Chicago in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of physicists led by Enrico Fermi achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's \"Nuclear Energy\" was unveiled. Also in Chicago, Moore commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named \"Man Enters the Cosmos\" (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the space exploration program.\n\nThe \"London School\" of figurative painters, including Francis Bacon (1909–1992), Lucian Freud (1922–2011), Frank Auerbach (born 1931), Leon Kossoff (born 1926), and Michael Andrews (1928–1995), have received widespread international recognition.\n\nFrancis Bacon was an Irish-born British figurative painter known for his bold, graphic and emotionally raw imagery. His painterly but abstracted figures typically appear isolated in glass or steel geometrical cages set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. Bacon began painting during his early 20s but worked only sporadically until his mid-30s. His breakthrough came with the 1944 triptych \"Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion\" which sealed his reputation as a uniquely bleak chronicler of the human condition. His output can be crudely described as consisting of sequences or variations on a single motif; beginning with the 1940s male heads isolated in rooms, the early 1950s screaming popes, and mid to late 1950s animals and lone figures suspended in geometric structures. These were followed by his early 1960s modern variations of the crucifixion in the triptych format. From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Bacon mainly produced strikingly compassionate portraits of friends. Following the suicide of his lover George Dyer in 1971, his art became more personal, inward-looking, and preoccupied with themes and motifs of death. During his lifetime, Bacon was equally reviled and acclaimed.\n\nLucian Freud was a German-born British painter, known chiefly for his thickly impastoed portrait and figure paintings, who was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time. His works are noted for their psychological penetration, and for their often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model. According to William Grimes of \"The New York Times\", \"Lucien Freud and his contemporaries transformed figure painting in the 20th century. In paintings like \"Girl with a White Dog\" (1951–52), Freud put the pictorial language of traditional European painting in the service of an anti-romantic, confrontational style of portraiture that stripped bare the sitter's social facade. Ordinary people—many of them his friends—stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist's ruthless inspection.\"\n\nIn abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like hard-edge painting and other forms of geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism. Clement Greenberg became the voice of post-painterly abstraction when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. Color Field painting, hard-edge painting and lyrical abstraction emerged as radical new directions.\n\nBy the late 1960s however, postminimalism, process art and Arte Povera also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements that encompassed both painting and sculpture, via lyrical abstraction and the postminimalist movement, and in early conceptual art. Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, and plastic and real space. Nancy Graves, Ronald Davis, Howard Hodgkin, Larry Poons, Jannis Kounellis, Brice Marden, Colin McCahon, Bruce Nauman, Richard Tuttle, Alan Saret, Walter Darby Bannard, Lynda Benglis, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra, Sam Gilliam, Mario Merz and Peter Reginato were some of the younger artists who emerged during the era of late modernism that spawned the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.\n\nIn 1962 the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted \"The New Realists\", the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery. The show sent shockwaves through the New York School and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in England in 1958 the term \"Pop Art\" was used by Lawrence Alloway to describe paintings that celebrated the consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of David Hockney and the works of Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi (who created the groundbreaking \"I was a Rich Man's Plaything\", 1947) are considered seminal examples in the movement. Meanwhile, in the downtown scene in New York's East Village 10th Street galleries, artists were formulating an American version of pop art. Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show the works of Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist. Later Leo Castelli exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for most of their careers. There is a connection between the radical works of Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of Ben-Day dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction.\n\nMinimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts. Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.\n\nAs a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include Donald Judd, John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Ronald Bladen, Anne Truitt, and Frank Stella. It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against Abstract expressionism and a bridge to Postminimal art practices. By the early 1960s minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in the geometric abstraction of Kazimir Malevich, the Bauhaus and Piet Mondrian) that rejected the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of abstract expressionist surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of action painting. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Minimalism is variously construed either as a precursor to postmodernism, or as a postmodern movement itself. In the latter perspective, early minimalism yielded advanced Modernist works, but the movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists like Robert Morris changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.\n\nHal Foster, in his essay \"The Crux of Minimalism\", examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian Modernism in their published definitions of minimalism. He argues that minimalism is not a \"dead end\" of Modernism, but a \"paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today.\"\n\nThe terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams. Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music. The term \"minimalist\" often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has also been used to describe the plays and novels of Samuel Beckett, the films of Robert Bresson, the stories of Raymond Carver, and the automobile designs of Colin Chapman.\n\nIn the late 1960s Robert Pincus-Witten coined the term \"postminimalism\" to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected. The term was applied by Pincus-Whitten to the work of Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra and new work by former minimalists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Barry Le Va, and others. Other minimalists including Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, Agnes Martin, John McCracken and others continued to produce late Modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainders of their careers.\n\nSince then, many artists have embraced minimal or postminimal styles, and the label \"Postmodern\" has been attached to them.\n\nRelated to abstract expressionism was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of Robert Rauschenberg exemplifies this trend. His \"combines\" of the 1950s were forerunners of pop art and installation art, and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs. Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, and Edward Kienholz were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art. Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials. Another pioneer of collage was Joseph Cornell, whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of found objects.\n\nIn the early 20th century Marcel Duchamp submitted for exhibition a urinal as a sculpture. He professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as \"readymades\". \"Fountain\" was a urinal signed with the pseudonym \"R. Mutt\", the exhibition of which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being John Cage's \"4'33\"\", which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg's \"Erased de Kooning Drawing\". Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualities of the work itself. In choosing \"an ordinary article of life\" and creating \"a new thought for that object\" Duchamp invited onlookers to view \"Fountain\" as a sculpture.\n\nMarcel Duchamp famously gave up \"art\" in favor of chess. Avant-garde composer David Tudor created a piece, \"Reunion\" (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross, that features a chess game in which each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. Duchamp and Cage played the game at the work's premier.\n\nSteven Best and Douglas Kellner identify Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns as part of the transitional phase, influenced by Duchamp, between Modernism and Postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high Modernism.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art. Yves Klein in France, Carolee Schneemann, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman and Yoko Ono in New York City, and Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell and Nam June Paik in Germany were pioneers of performance-based works of art. Groups like The Living Theatre with Julian Beck and Judith Malina collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer, especially in their piece \"Paradise Now\". The Judson Dance Theater, located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York; and the Judson dancers, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others; collaborated with artists Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and engineers like Billy Klüver. Park Place Gallery was a center for musical performances by electronic composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and other notable performance artists including Joan Jonas.\n\nThese performances were intended as works of a new art form combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. They were characterized by the reductive philosophies of minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressivity of abstract expressionism. Images of Schneeman's performances of pieces meant to shock are occasionally used to illustrate these kinds of art, and she is often seen photographed while performing her piece \"Interior Scroll\". However, the images of her performing this piece are illustrating precisely what performance art is not. In performance art, the performance itself is the medium. Other media cannot illustrate performance art. Performance art is performed, not captured. By its nature performance is momentary and evanescent, which is part of the point of the medium as art. Representations of performance art in other media, whether by image, video, narrative or otherwise, select certain points of view in space or time or otherwise involve the inherent limitations of each medium, and which therefore cannot truly illustrate the medium of performance as art.\n\nDuring the same period, various avant-garde artists created Happenings, mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in various specified locations, often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physicality, costuming, spontaneous nudity, and various random or seemingly disconnected acts. Notable creators of happenings included Allan Kaprow—who first used the term in 1958, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Robert Whitman.\n\nAnother trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. Intermedia is a term coined by Dick Higgins and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of Fluxus, concrete poetry, found objects, performance art, and computer art. Higgins was the publisher of the Something Else Press, a concrete poet married to artist Alison Knowles and an admirer of Marcel Duchamp. Ihab Hassan includes \"Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms,\" in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art. One of the most common forms of \"multi-media art\" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed video art. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art, where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.\n\nFluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by George Maciunas (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to John Cage's 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the New School for Social Research in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members Jackson Mac Low, Al Hansen, George Brecht and Dick Higgins.\n\nFluxus encouraged a do-it-yourself aesthetic and valued simplicity over complexity. Like Dada before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.\n\nAndreas Huyssen criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for Postmodernism as \"either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement—as it were, postmodernism's sublime.\" Instead he sees Fluxus as a major Neo-Dadaist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against \"the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the Cold War.\"\n\nThe continuation of abstract expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstraction, geometric abstraction, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, postminimalism, and other late 20th-century Modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, well-established artists such as Sir Anthony Caro, Lucian Freud, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Agnes Martin, Al Held, Ellsworth Kelly, Helen Frankenthaler, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, James Rosenquist, Alex Katz, Philip Pearlstein, and younger artists including Brice Marden, Chuck Close, Sam Gilliam, Isaac Witkin, Sean Scully, Mahirwan Mamtani, Joseph Nechvatal, Elizabeth Murray, Larry Poons, Richard Serra, Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Ronald Davis, Dan Christensen, Joel Shapiro, Tom Otterness, Joan Snyder, Ross Bleckner, Archie Rand, Susan Crile, and others continued to produce vital and influential paintings and sculpture.\n\nSee also and Hanshinkan Modernism\n\nPeter Kalliney suggests that,\"Modernist concepts, especially aesthetic autonomy, were fundamental to the literature of decolonization in anglophone Africa.\" In his opinion, Rajat Neogy, Christopher Okigbo, and Wole Soyinka, were among the writer who \"repurposed modernist versions of aesthetic autonomy to declare their freedom from colonial bondage, from systems of racial discrimination, and even from the new postcolonial state\".\n\nThe terms \"modernism\" and \"modernist\", according to scholar William J. Tyler, \"have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-a-vis Western European modernism remain\". Tyler finds this odd, given \"the decidedly modern prose\" of such \"well-known Japanese writers as Kawabata Yasunari, Nagai Kafu, and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki\". However, \"scholars in the visual and fine arts, architecture, and poetry readily embraced \"modanizumu\" as a key concept for describing and analyzing Japanese culture in the 1920s and 1930s\". In 1924, various young Japanese writers, including Kawabata Yasunari, Riichi Yokomitsu started a literary journal \"Bungei Jidai\" (\"The Artistic Age\"). This journal was \"part of an 'art for art's sake' movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles\".\n\nJapanese modernist architect Kenzō Tange (1913–2005) was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: \"It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call structuralism\", He was influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\nIn China the \"New Sensationists\" (新感觉派, Xīn Gǎnjué Pài) were a group of writers based in Shanghai who in the 1930s and 1940s were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism. They wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Among these writers were Mu Shiying, Liu Na'ou, and Shi Zhecun.\n\nIn India, the Progressive Artists' Group was a group of modern artists, mainly based in Mumbai, India formed in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, it synthesised Indian art with European and North America influences from the first half of the 20th Century, including Post-Impressionism, Cubism and Expressionism.\n\nBy the early 1980s the Postmodern movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various conceptual and intermedia formats. Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold earlier. In music, postmodernism is described in one reference work, as a \"term introduced in the 1970s\", while in British literature, \"The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature\" sees modernism \"ceding its predominance to postmodernism\" as early as 1939. However, dates are highly debatable, especially as according to Andreas Huyssen: \"one critic's postmodernism is another critic's modernism.\" This includes those who are critical of the division between the two and see them as two aspects of the same movement, and believe that late Modernism continues.\n\nModernism is an encompassing label for a wide variety of cultural movements. Postmodernism is essentially a centralized movement that named itself, based on sociopolitical theory, although the term is now used in a wider sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards which exhibit awareness of and reinterpret the modern.\n\nPostmodern theory asserts that the attempt to canonise Modernism \"after the fact\" is doomed to undisambiguable contradictions.\n\nIn a narrower sense, what was Modernist was not necessarily also postmodern. Those elements of Modernism which accentuated the benefits of rationality and socio-technological progress were only Modernist.\n\nModernism's stress on freedom of expression, experimentation, radicalism, and primitivism disregards conventional expectations. In many art forms this often meant startling and alienating audiences with bizarre and unpredictable effects, as in the strange and disturbing combinations of motifs in Surrealism or the use of extreme dissonance and atonality in Modernist music. In literature this often involved the rejection of intelligible plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that defied clear interpretation.\n\nFrom 1932 Socialist realism began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union; it had previously endorsed Futurism and Constructivism. The Nazi government of Germany deemed modernism narcissistic and nonsensical, as well as \"Jewish\" (see Antisemitism) and \"Negro\". The Nazis exhibited Modernist paintings alongside works by the mentally ill in an exhibition entitled \"Degenerate Art\". Accusations of \"formalism\" could lead to the end of a career, or worse. For this reason many Modernists of the postwar generation felt that they were the most important bulwark against totalitarianism, the \"canary in the coal mine\", whose repression by a government or other group with supposed authority represented a warning that individual liberties were being threatened. Louis A. Sass compared madness, specifically schizophrenia, and modernism in a less fascist manner by noting their shared disjunctive narratives, surreal images, and incoherence.\n\nIn fact, modernism flourished mainly in consumer/capitalist societies, despite the fact that its proponents often rejected consumerism itself. However, high modernism began to merge with consumer culture after World War II, especially during the 1960s. In Britain, a youth subculture emerged calling itself \"Modernist\" (usually shortened to Mod), following such representative music groups as the Who and the Kinks. The likes of Bob Dylan, Serge Gainsbourg and the Rolling Stones combined popular musical traditions with Modernist verse, adopting literary devices derived from James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, James Thurber, T. S. Eliot, Guillaume Apollinaire, Allen Ginsberg, and others. The Beatles developed along similar lines, creating various Modernist musical effects on several albums, while musicians such as Frank Zappa, Syd Barrett and Captain Beefheart proved even more experimental. Modernist devices also started to appear in popular cinema, and later on in music videos. Modernist design also began to enter the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a space age high-tech future.\n\nThis merging of consumer and high versions of Modernist culture led to a radical transformation of the meaning of \"Modernism\". First, it implied that a movement based on the rejection of tradition had become a tradition of its own. Second, it demonstrated that the distinction between elite Modernist and mass consumerist culture had lost its precision. Some writers declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now \"post avant-garde\", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement. Many have interpreted this transformation as the beginning of the phase that became known as postmodernism. For others, such as art critic Robert Hughes, postmodernism represents an extension of modernism.\n\n\"Anti-modern\" or \"counter-modern\" movements seek to emphasize holism, connection and spirituality as remedies or antidotes to modernism. Such movements see modernism as reductionist, and therefore subject to an inability to see systemic and emergent effects. Many Modernists came to this viewpoint, for example Paul Hindemith in his late turn towards mysticism. Writers such as Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, in \"\" (2000), Fredrick Turner in \"A Culture of Hope\" and Lester Brown in \"Plan B\", have articulated a critique of the basic idea of modernism itself—that individual creative expression should conform to the realities of technology. Instead, they argue, individual creativity should make everyday life more emotionally acceptable.\n\nSome traditionalist artists like Alexander Stoddart reject modernism generally as the product of \"an epoch of false money allied with false culture\".\n\nIn some fields, the effects of modernism have remained stronger and more persistent than in others. Visual art has made the most complete break with its past. Most major capital cities have museums devoted to modern art as distinct from post-Renaissance art (c. 1400 to c. 1900).

{"id": "612291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612291", "title": "Naïve realism", "text": "Naïve realism\n\nIn philosophy of mind, naïve realism, also known as direct realism, common sense realism or perceptual realism, is the idea that the senses provide us with direct awareness of objects as they \"really\" are. Objects obey the laws of physics and retain all their properties whether or not there is anyone to observe them. They are composed of matter, occupy space and have properties, such as size, shape, texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually perceived correctly.\n\nIn contrast, some forms of idealism claim that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas, and some forms of skepticism say we cannot trust our senses. Naïve realism is known as \"direct\" as against \"indirect\" or \"representational\" realism when its arguments are developed to counter the latter position, also known as epistemological dualism; that our conscious experience is not of the real world but of an internal representation of the world.\n\nFor a history of direct realist theories, see \"Direct and indirect realism § History\".\n\nThe naïve realist theory may be characterized as the acceptance of the following five beliefs:\n\n\nIn the area of visual perception in psychology, the leading direct realist theorist was J. J. Gibson. Other psychologists were heavily influenced by this approach, including William Mace, Claire Michaels, Edward Reed, Robert Shaw, and Michael Turvey. More recently, Carol Fowler has promoted a direct realist approach to speech perception.\n\nAmong contemporary analytic philosophers who defended direct realism one might refer to, for example, Hilary Putnam, John McDowell, Galen Strawson, and John R. Searle.\n\nSearle, for instance, addresses the popular but perhaps mistaken assumption that \"we can only directly perceive our own subjective experiences, but never objects and states of affairs in the world themselves\". According to Searle, it has influenced many thinkers to reject direct realism. But Searle contends that the rejection of direct realism is based on a bad argument: the Argument from illusion, which in turn relies on vague assumptions on the nature or existence of \"sense data\". Various sense data theories were deconstructed in 1962 by the British philosopher J. L. Austin in a book titled \"Sense and Sensibilia\".\n\nTalk of sense data has been replaced by talk of representational perception in a broader sense, and scientific realists typically assume representational perception. But the assumption is philosophical, and arguably little prevents scientific realists from assuming direct perception, as in direct or \"naïve\" realism. In a blog-post on \"Naive realism and color realism\" Putnam sums up with the following words: \n\"\"... Being an apple is not a natural kind in physics, but it is in biology, recall. Being complex and of no interest to fundamental physics isn't a failure to be \"real\". I think green is as real as applehood.\".\"\n\nSimon Blackburn has argued that whatever positions they may take in books, articles or lectures, naive realism is the view of \"philosophers when they are off-duty.\"\n\nIt is not uncommon to think of naïve realism as distinct from scientific realism, which states that the universe contains just those properties that feature in a scientific description of it, not properties like colour \"per se\" but merely objects that reflect certain wavelengths owing to their microscopic surface texture. This lack of supervenience of experience on the physical world has influenced many thinkers to reject naïve realism as a physical theory.\n\nOne should add, however, that naïve realism does not claim that reality is only what we see, hear, etc. Likewise, scientific realism does not claim that reality is only what can be described by fundamental physics. It follows that the relevant distinction to make is not between naïve and scientific realism but between \"direct and indirect realism\".\n\nThe direct realist claims that the experience of a sunset, for instance, is the real sunset that we directly experience. The indirect realist claims that our relation to reality is indirect, so the experience of a sunset is a subjective copy of what really is radiation as described by physics. But the direct realist does not deny that the sunset is radiation; the experience has a hierarchical structure, and the radiation is part of what amounts to the direct experience.\n\nAn example of a scientific realist is John Locke, who held the world only contains the primary qualities that feature in a corpuscularian scientific account of the world (see corpuscular theory), and that other properties were entirely subjective, depending for their existence upon some perceiver who can observe the objects.\"\n\nThe modern philosopher of science Howard Sankey argues for a form of scientific realism which has commonsense realism as one of its foundations.\n\nRealism in physics refers to the fact that physical systems must have definite properties when measured or observed. Physics until the 19th century was implicitly and sometimes explicitly based on philosophical realism.\n\nScientific realism in classical physics has remained compatible with the naïve realism of everyday thinking on the whole, but there is no consistent way to visualize the world underlying quantum theory in terms of ideas of the everyday world. \"The general conclusion is that in quantum theory naïve realism, although necessary at the level of observations, fails at the microscopic level.\" Experiments such as the Stern–Gerlach experiment and quantum phenomena such as complementarity lead quantum physicists to conclude that \"[w]e have no satisfactory reason for ascribing objective existence to physical quantities as distinguished from the numbers obtained when we make the measurements which we correlate with them. There is no real reason for supposing that a particle has at every moment a definite, but unknown, position which may be revealed by a measurement of the right kind ... On the contrary, we get into a maze of contradiction as soon as we inject into quantum mechanics such concepts as carried over from the language and philosophy of our ancestors ... It would be more exact if we spoke of 'making measurements' of this, that, or the other type instead of saying that we measure this, that, or the other 'physical quantity'.\" It is no longer possible to adhere to both the principle of locality (that distant objects cannot affect local objects), and counterfactual definiteness, a form of ontological realism implicit in classical physics. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics hold that a system lacks an actualized property until it is measured, which implies that quantum systems exhibit a non-local behavior. Bell's theorem proved that every quantum theory must either violate locality or counterfactual definiteness. This claim has given rise to a contentious debate of the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Although locality and 'realism,' in the sense of counterfactual definiteness, are jointly false, it is possible to retain one of them. The majority of working physicists discard counterfactual definiteness in favor of locality, since non-locality is held to be contrary to relativity. The implications of this stance are rarely discussed outside of the microscopic domain but the thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat illustrates the difficulties presented. As quantum mechanics is applied to larger and larger objects, even a one-ton bar, proposed to detect gravity waves, must be analysed quantum mechanically, while in cosmology a wave function for the whole universe is written to study the Big Bang. It is difficult to accept the quantum world as somehow not physically real, so \"Quantum mechanics forces us to abandon naïve realism\", though it can also be argued that the counterfactual definiteness 'realism' of physics is a much more specific notion than general philosophical realism.\n\n\"'[W]e have to give up the idea of realism to a far greater extent than most physicists believe today.' (Anton Zeilinger) ... By realism, he means the idea that objects have specific features and properties — that a ball is red, that a book contains the works of Shakespeare, or that an electron has a particular spin ... for objects governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, like photons and electrons, it may make no sense to think of them as having well-defined characteristics. Instead, what we see may depend on how we look.\"\n\n\"Virtual realism\" is closely related to the above theories.\n\nIn the research paper \"The reality of virtual reality\" it is proposed that, \"virtuality is itself a bona fide mode of reality, and that 'virtual reality' must be understood as 'things, agents and events that exist in cyberspace'. These proposals resolve the incoherences found in the ordinary uses of these terms... 'virtual reality', though based on recent information technology, does not refer to mere technological equipment or purely mental entities, or to some fake environment as opposed to the real world, but that it is an ontological mode of existence which leads to an expansion of our ordinary world.\"\n\n\"The emergence of teleoperation and virtual environments has greatly increased interest in \"synthetic experience\", a mode of experience made possible by both these newer technologies and earlier ones, such as telecommunication and sensory prosthetics... understanding synthetic experience must begin by recognizing the fallacy of naïve realism and with the recognition that the phenomenology of synthetic experience is continuous with that of ordinary experience.\"\n\nThe alleged necessity to recognize a \"fallacy of naïve realism\" seems, however, unwarranted. One should not be misled by the word \"naïve\", for a naïve realist normally understands what a picture is: that the depicted face on a photograph, for instance, is not the real face, and that the things seen on a computer-screen are symbols or electronic depictions, and so on. A majority of the population arguably subscribes to naïve common sense notions of reality, without a recognizable loss in capacity to interact in cyberspace.\n\n"}

Hoodbhoy is also a prominent activist in particular concerned with promotion of freedom of speech, secularism and education in Pakistan.\n\nBorn and raised in Karachi, Hoodbhoy studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for nine years, where he received degrees in electrical engineering, mathematics and solid-state physics, eventually leading to a PhD in nuclear physics. In 1981, Hoodbhoy went on to conduct post-doctoral research at the University of Washington, before leaving to serve as a visiting professor at the Carnegie Mellon University in 1985. While still a professor at the Quaid-e-Azam University, Hoodbhoy worked as a guest scientist at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics between 1986 until 1994. He remained with the Quaid-e-Azam University until 2010, throughout which he held visiting professorships at MIT, University of Maryland and Stanford Linear Collider.\n\nIn 2011, Hoodbhoy joined LUMS while simultaneously working as a researcher with the Princeton University and a columnist with the \"Express Tribune\". His contract with LUMS was terminated in 2013 which resulted in a controversy. He is a sponsor of the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\", and a member of the monitoring panel on terrorism of the World Federation of Scientists. Hoodbhoy has won several awards including the Abdus Salam Prize for Mathematics (1984); the Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science (2003); the Burton Award (2010) from the American Physical Society. In 2011, he was included in the list of 100 most influential global thinkers by \"Foreign Policy\". In 2013, he was made a member of the UN Secretary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament.\n\nHoodbhoy remains one of Pakistan's most prominent academics. He is the author of \"Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality\" He is the head of \"Mashal\" Books in Lahore, which claims to make \"a major translation effort to produce books in Urdu that promote modern thought, human rights, and emancipation of women\". Hoodbhoy has written for \"Project Syndicate\", \"DAWN\", \"The New York Times\" and \"The Express Tribune\". Hoodbhoy is generally considered one of the most vocal, progressive and liberal member of the Pakistani intelligentsia.\n\nBorn and raised in Karachi, Sindh, Hoodbhoy passed the competitive O-Level and A-Level exams after attending the famed Karachi Grammar School. After earning a scholarship, Hoodbhoy went to the United States to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). While attending the MIT in Massachusetts, Hoodbhoy worked for a local Pakistani restaurant based in Massachusetts to support his studies and showed a great interest in electronics and mathematics.\n\nAt MIT, Hoodbhoy graduated with double BSc in Electrical Engineering and mathematics in 1971, followed by MS in physics with a concentration in solid-state physics in 1973. After graduation, Hoodbhoy joined the Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) as a researcher and renewed his scholarship to resume his studies in the United States.\n\nHoodbhoy continued his research in doctoral studies in physics at the MIT, and was awarded PhD in nuclear physics in 1978. In the United States, his collaboration took place with the who participated in well known Manhattan Project in the 1940s, who subsequently influenced in his philosophy. Hoodbhoy remained a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Washington, for a short time. In 1973, Hoodbhoy joined the Institute of Physics of the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore.\n\nHoodbhoy focused his research career extensively on quantum field theory, particle phenomenology, and supersymmetry in the area of particle physics. After receiving PhD from MIT, Hoodbhoy met Riazuddin and Abdus Salam– the prominent Pakistani physicists who were visiting the MIT to give lectures on particle physics. Subsequently, he joined the group of Pakistani physicists at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. At ICTP, Hoodbhoy collaborated with Pakistan's leading theoretical physicists who worked under Abdus Salam in the 1970s.\n\nAfter ICTP work, Hoodbhoy returned to Pakistan to join Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) where he began teaching and lecturing on physics. Eventually, he became chairman of Institute of Theoretical Physics (now department of physics). After spending more than 30 years at Qau, Hoodbhoy moved to Lahore where he joined the Lahore University of Management Sciences as a visiting professor, while remains a visiting scientist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Controversy over his contract in LUMS sparked an academic debate when it was reported in the news media that Hoodbhoy's email to Vice-Chancellor of LUMS was made public. Eventually, Hoodbhoy moved to Forman Christian College University permanently and joined the senior staff to instructed courses on physics.\n\nPrior to his return to Pakistan in 1976, the secretive development program on nuclear deterrence was near completion and Hoodbhoy was aware of the program. Hoodbhoy maintains his close ties with Pakistan's vibrant nuclear society, and had collaborated with many of country's leading theoretical physicists throughout his career, mainly with Ishfaq Ahmad. On several occasions, Hoodbhoy staunchly countered Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's \"father-of\" claims, and roundly criticized his academic research on nuclear physics. In the 1980s, he famously debated with Bashiruddin Mahmood on the topics of sunspots, life-after-death, and philosophy.\n\nIn 1999, Hoodbhoy with Ishfaq Ahmad and Riazuddin, played a major and influential role in the establishment of National Center for Physics (NCP), becoming one of the earliest academic scientists who joined the NCP at its inception.\n\nHoodbhoy has roundly criticized the development on nuclear weapons, especially its extension to South Asia, mainly by India and Pakistan. In 2011, Hoodbhoy held India responsible for Pakistan's symmetric nuclear weapons programme as part of Pakistan's self-credible deterrence. According to Hoodbhoy, India's nuclear tests forced Pakistan to jump into the nuclear arena in 1974, and again in 1998, after war-threatening statements were made by Indian government to Pakistan; Pakistan equalised this magnitude over the nuclear edge that same month. While believing that Pakistan's nuclear deterrence has protected the country from any foreign aggression and preventing from numerous war threatening situations with India, Hoodbhoy on the other hand has raised concerns about the security of nuclear arsenals on the possibility of radicals gaining control.\n\nHoodbhoy is a prominent sponsor of the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\", representing the Pakistan's delegation.\n\nApart from his specialist field of research, Hoodbhoy extensively writes and speaks on topics ranging from science in Islam to education and arms disarmament issues around the world. He is author of \"Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality\", that has been translated into five languages. In this book, Hoodbhoy outlines the history of Pakistan, implications of theocracy and martial law in Pakistan, and the textbook revival in education system of Pakistan. His articles on various issues related to science and social issues are often published in international media. His publications are repeatedly published in both technical and non-technical papers.\nHoodbhoy widely writes about the role and modernisation of Pakistan military, particularly the defence budget spending by the Pakistan government on the military. In an interview on secularism, he mentioned that obsession with scientific-religious apophenia may have caused lack of scientific advancement among Muslims in recent years. In 2003 he was one the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nHoodbhoy has criticized the Pakistan Higher Education Commission (HEC) for pursuing \"a drive to achieve numbers rather than quality\". He believes that because of \"policies that reward authors of research articles and PhD supervisors with cash and promotions\", universities in Pakistan have \"turned into factories producing junk papers and PhDs.\"\nHe has been a harsh critic on the performance of HEC since 2003 when it was led by Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman, and the issue has led to heated debates in Pakistan's news media.\n\nIn 2009 Hoodbhoy came into conflict with Atta-ur-Rahman, an organic chemist, over the Higher Education Commission (HEC). In the United States, the journal \"Nature\" published an article on the successes and failures of the HEC. Hoodbhoy wrote to complain about, among other things, the article's failure to mention (what Hoodbhoy called) \"the billions wasted on mindless prestige mega-projects\".\nIn the debate on HEC Adil Najam, Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Atta-ur-Rehman defended the HEC while agreeing with some of Hoodbhoy's criticism.\n\nAdministrative competency of HEC was called into question by Hoodbhoy who describe the HEC's achievement \"dismal\". Hoodbhoy supported his arguments against HEC's productivity, that in the case of UESTP-France convention in Karachi, out of an expected faculty strength of between 450 and 600, no French faculty or administrative staff actually arrived. At the television debate, Hoodbhoy questioned the statistics used to support the positive appraisal of HEC's activities in a series of communications between Hoodbhoy and HEC chairman Atta-Ur-Rehman. It was claimed by the latter that in mathematics, Pakistani authors received 20% more citations than the worldwide average. Hoodbhoy questioned this on several grounds including the number of self-citations these publications received and said that this was a crucial aspect that the HEC left out of its interpretation. Criticism was leveled by Hoodbhoy at the practice of hiring those foreign academics in local universities who were said to have difficulty in communicating and teaching, although they contributed to boosting the number of research publications originating from Pakistani universities.\n\nHoodbhoy has made important contributions in physics, particularly in particle physics. Many of Hoodbhoy's recorded lectures on physics are available online. At National Center for Physics, Hoodbhoy conducted research on different aspects of particle physics, and pioneered studies in modern physics and its extension to mathematical and nuclear physics. In 2006, Hoodbhoy published a brief mathematical description of Generalized Parton Distributions. In 2007, Hoodbhoy re-published the work of Jens Lyng Peterson the Maldacena conjecture (a conjectured equivalence between a string theory and gravity defined on one space, and a quantum field theory without gravity defined by one or less dimension) where he contributed mathematically to the theory. In the same year, he re-published the work of Edward Witten on Anti-de Sitter space and its extension to the field of Holography. While the paper was published experimentally in 1998 by Witten, Hoodbhoy provided the brief mathematical proofs and description to understand, logically, the subject of Sitter space— a scalar curvature in general theory of relativity.\n\nOn 14 April 2001, it was announced that Dr. Hoodbhoy would be receiving \"Sitara-i-Imtiaz\" from the former President, General (retired) Pervez Musharraf which he refused to accept. His refusal prompted the \"Friday Times\" to interview him.\n\nHe produced a 13-part documentary series in Urdu for Pakistan Television on critical issues in education, and two series aimed at popularising science. In 2004, he made a documentary film 'Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, Pakistan, India' along with Dr. Zia Mian. These documentaries carry heavy emphasis on the issues of education, public health and scientific revolution in Pakistan.\n\nIn his documentaries, Dr. Hoodbhoy has heavily criticised Pakistan and India's nuclear weapons program. He also pointed out the seriousness of the Talibanization in Pakistan and its immediate effects on South Asia. His documentaries also point out that American and NATO forces in Afghanistan didn't help the Afghan people's life and there was no reform in Afghanistan's social and public sector and, instead, the insurgency and corruption grew, which also destabilised Pakistan's western front.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20110874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20110874", "title": "Reference", "text": "Reference\n\nReference is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to \"refer to\" the second object. It is called a \"name\" for the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the \"referent\" of the first object. A name is usually a phrase or expression, or some other symbolic representation. Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept.\n\nReferences can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is audible (onomatopoeia), visual (text), olfactory, or tactile, emotional state, relationship with other, spacetime coordinate, symbolic or alpha-numeric, a physical object or an energy projection. In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in cryptography.\n\nReferences feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. Some of them are described in the sections below.\n\nThe word \"reference\" is derived from Middle English \"referren\", from Middle French \"référer\", from Latin \"referre\", \"to carry back\", formed from the prefix \"re\"- and \"ferre\", \"to bear\". A number of words derive from the same root, including \"refer\", \"referee\", \"referential\", \"referent\", \"referendum\".\n\nThe verb \"refer (to)\" and its derivatives may carry the sense of \"link to\" or \"connect to\", as in the meanings of \"reference\" described in this article. Another sense is \"consult\"; this is reflected in such expressions as reference work, reference desk, job reference, etc.\n\nIn semantics, reference is generally construed as the relationships between nouns or pronouns and objects that are named by them. Hence, the word \"John\" refers to the person John. The word \"it\" refers to some previously specified object. The object referred to is called the \"referent\" of the word. Sometimes the word-object relation is called \"denotation\"; the word denotes the object. The converse relation, the relation from object to word, is called \"exemplification\"; the object exemplifies what the word denotes. In syntactic analysis, if a word refers to a previous word, the previous word is called the \"antecedent\".\n\nGottlob Frege argued that reference cannot be treated as identical with meaning: \"Hesperus\" (an ancient Greek name for the evening star) and \"Phosphorus\" (an ancient Greek name for the morning star) both refer to Venus, but the astronomical fact that '\"Hesperus\" is \"Phosphorus\"' can still be informative, even if the \"meanings\" of \"Hesperus\" and \"Phosphorus\" are already known. This problem led Frege to distinguish between the sense and reference of a word. Some cases seem to be too complicated to be classified within this framework; the acceptance of the notion of secondary reference may be necessary to fill the gap. See also Opaque context.\n\nThe very concept of the linguistic sign is the combination of content and expression, the former of which may refer entities in the world or refer more abstract concepts, e.g. thought.\nCertain parts of speech exist only to express reference, namely anaphora such as pronouns. The subset of reflexives expresses co-reference of two participants in a sentence. These could be the agent (actor) and patient (acted on), as in \"The man washed himself\", the theme and recipient, as in \"I showed Mary to herself\", or various other possible combinations.\n\nIn computer science, references are data types that refer to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of data structures, such as linked lists. Generally, a reference is a value that enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most programming languages support some form of reference. For the specific type of reference used in the C++ language, see reference (C++).\n\nThe notion of reference is also important in relational database theory; see referential integrity.\n\nReferences to many types of printed matter may come in an electronic or machine-readable form. For books, there exists the ISBN and for journal articles, the Digital object identifier (DOI) is gaining relevance. Information on the Internet may be referred to by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).\n\nIn terms of mental processing, a self-reference is used in psychology to establish identification with a mental state during self-analysis. This seeks to allow the individual to develop own frames of reference in a greater state of immediate awareness. However, it can also lead to circular reasoning, preventing evolution of thought.\n\nAccording to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a reference condition is the state toward which a control system's output tends to alter a controlled quantity. The main proposition is that \"All behavior is oriented all of the time around the control of certain quantities with respect to specific reference conditions.\"\n\nIn academics and scholarship, an author-title-date information in bibliographies and footnotes, specifying complete works of other people. Copying of material by another author without proper citation or without required permissions is plagiarism.\n\nKeeping a diary allows an individual to use references for personal organization, whether or not anyone else understands the systems of reference used. However, scholars have studied methods of reference because of their key role in communication and co-operation between \"different\" people, and also because of misunderstandings that can arise. Modern academic study of reference has been developing since the 19th century.\n\nIn scholarship, a reference may be a citation of a text that has been used in the creation of a piece of work such as an essay, report, or oration. Its primary purpose is to allow people who read such work to examine the author's sources, either for validity or to learn more about the subject. Such items are often listed at the end of an article or book in a section marked \"Bibliography\" or \"References\". A bibliographical section often contains works not cited by the author, but used as background reading or listed as potentially useful to the reader. A reference section contains only those works cited by the author(s) in the main text.\n\nIn patent law, a reference is a document that can be used to show the state of knowledge at a given time and that therefore may make a claimed invention obvious or anticipated. Examples of references are patents of any country, magazine articles, Ph.D. theses that are indexed and thus accessible to those interested in finding information about the subject matter, and to some extent Internet material that is similarly accessible.\n\nIn art, a reference is an item from which a work is based. This may include:\nAnother example of reference is samples of various musical works being incorporated into a new one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22089292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22089292", "title": "Rosary of the Seven Sorrows", "text": "Rosary of the Seven Sorrows\n\nThe Rosary of the Seven Sorrows, also known as the \"Chaplet of Seven Sorrows\" or the Servite Rosary, is a Rosary based prayer that originated with the Servite Order. It is often said in connection with the Seven Sorrows of Mary.\n\nIt is a rosary consisting of a ring of seven groups of seven beads separated by a small medal depicting one of the sorrows of Mary, or a single bead. A further series of three beads and a medal are also attached to the chain (before the first \"sorrow\") and these are dedicated to prayer in honour of Mary's Tears, as well as to indicate the beginning of the chaplet. Conventionally the beads are of black wood or some other black material indicating sorrow. It has also been called the Seven Swords Rosary referring to the prophecy of Simeon: \n\"Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted; and thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed.\" - (Lk.2:34-35)\n\nIt received approval through the grant of indulgences by Pope Benedict XII, Pope Clement XII, and Pope Clement XIII.\n\nThis devotion to the Our Sorrowful Mother was originated in the thirteenth century, when seven professional men from Florence, which was an important commercial center of Europe, were influenced by the penitential spirit common to the Brothers of Penance with whom they were in close contact. In 1240 they withdrew from the world to pray and serve the Lord, leading a life of penance, prayer and service to Mary. Because of so many visitors, they retreated again to Monte Senario, where the Servites (Servants of Mary) was formed. By 1244, under the direction of St. Peter of Verona, they began to wear a religious habit similar to the Dominicans and began to live under the rule of Saint Augustine. The Servites devoted their prayer to the rosary of the Seven Sorrows. The choice of the number was derived from the symbolic value of the number seven, suggesting fullness, completeness, and abundance. Consequently, only the principal sorrows are listed.\n\nThe chaplet recalls the Sorrows the Virgin Mother of God endured in compassion for the suffering and death of her Divine Son. The Seven Dolors are taken from Scripture events and the devotion has a long history, and developed gradually. Before Pope Pius VII's formal approval, the Servite Order had permission in 1668 to celebrate the Feast of the Seven Dolors because the Order was instrumental in popularizing the Seven Sorrows Devotion. Members of the Servite Order actively promoted the Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows during the time of the Black Death (1347-1351).\n\nMethods of praying the chaplet vary. This devotion may be spread over a week, commemorating one sorrow each day, or it may be prayed as whole in a single day.\n\nA method provided by the 1866 version of \"The Raccolta\" is shown below. The recitation begins with the sign of the cross and an Act of contrition. Each sorrow is announced, (and in some versions of the recitation, a meditatory prayer is said, or a segment from the Hymn \"Stabat Mater Dolorosa\"). Then on the separate bead an Our Father is said, followed by a Hail Mary for each of the seven beads. Some then close the septet of Hail Marys with a brief invocation to Our Lady of Sorrows (Commonly: \"Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary pray for us\"), or a Glory Be. The next sorrow is then announced, and carried out in the same manner until all seven have been meditated upon. The three Hail Marys dedicated to her tears are said and then a closing prayer is said, the most commonly known or traditional closing prayer in the English speaking world is the following:\n\nV. Pray for us, O most sorrowful Virgin.\nR. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.\n\n\"Let us pray.\"\nLord Jesus, we now implore, both for the present and for the hour of our death, the intercession of the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Thy Mother, whose holy soul was pierced at the time of Thy passion by a sword of grief. Grant us this favor, O Saviour of the world, Who liveth and reigneth with the Father and the Holy Ghost, forever and ever. Amen.\n\nOn July 2, 2001, the Holy See released a declaration of Bishop Augustin Misago of Gikongoro, on apparitions that took place in 1982-83 in Kibeho, Rwanda indicating that they were worthy of belief. Visionaries reported appearances by Mary who identified herself as \"Our Lady of the Word\". Mary instructed one of the visionaries (Marie-Claire Mukangango) to spread devotion of the Seven Sorrows Rosary. According to the visionary she is quoted as saying:\n\n“One must meditate on the Passion of Jesus, and on the deep sorrows of His Mother. One must recite the Rosary every day, and also the Rosary of the Seven Sorrows of Mary, to obtain the favour of repentance.”\n\n\n"}

Hartman, which attempts to formally elucidate value theory using both formal and symbolic logic.\n\nThe fundamental principle, which functions as an axiom, and can be stated in symbolic logic, is that \"a thing is good insofar as it exemplifies its concept\". To put it another way, \"a thing is good if it has all its descriptive properties.\" This means, according to Hartman, that the good thing has a name, that the name has a meaning defined by a set of properties, and that the thing possesses all of the properties in the set. A thing is bad if it does not fulfill its description. If it doesn't fulfill its definition it is terrible (awful, miserable). A car, by definition, has brakes. A car which accelerates when the brakes are applied is an awful car, since a car by definition must have brakes. A horse, if we called it a car, would be an even worse car, with fewer of the properties of a car. The name we put on things is very important: it sets the norm for how we judge them.\n\nHe introduces three basic dimensions of value, \"systemic\", \"extrinsic\" and \"intrinsic\" for sets of properties—\"perfection\" is to \"systemic value\" what \"goodness\" is to \"extrinsic value\" and what \"uniqueness\" is to \"intrinsic value\"—each with their own cardinality: finite, formula_1 and formula_2. In practice, the terms \"good\" and \"bad\" apply to finite sets of properties, since this is the only case where there is a ratio between the total number of desired properties and the number of such properties possessed by some object being valued. (In the case where the number of properties is countably infinite, the \"extrinsic\" dimension of value, the \"exposition\" as well as the mere definition of a specific concept is taken into consideration.)\n\nHartman quantifies this notion by the principle that \"each property of the thing is worth as much as each other property, depending on the level of abstraction\". Hence, if a thing has \"n\" properties, each of them—if on the same level of abstraction—is proportionally worth \"n\". . In other words, a car having brakes or having a gas cap are weighted equally so far as their value goes, so long as both are a part of one's definition of a \"car.\" Since a gas cap is not normally a part of a car's definition, it would be given no weight. Headlights could be weighed twice, once or not at all depending on how headlights appear in the description of a car. Given a finite set of \"n\" properties, a thing is \"good\" if it is perceived to have all of the properties, \"fair\" if it has more than / of them, \"average\" if / of them, and \"bad\" if it has fewer than /.\n\nHartman goes on to consider infinite sets of properties. Hartman claims that \"according to a theorem of transfinite mathematics, any collection of material objects is at most denumerably infinite\". This is not, in fact, a theorem of mathematics. But, according to Hartman, people are capable of a denumerably infinite set of predicates, intended in as many ways, which he gives as formula_2. As this yields a notional cardinality of the continuum, Hartman advises that when setting out to describe a person, a continuum of properties would be most fitting and appropriate to bear in mind. This is the cardinality of \"intrinsic value\" in Hartman's system.\n\nAlthough they play no role in ordinary mathematics, Hartman deploys the notion of aleph number reciprocals, as a sort of infinitesimal proportion. This, he contends goes to zero in the limit as the uncountable cardinals become larger. In Hartman's calculus, for example, the assurance in a Dear John letter, that \"we will always be friends\" has axiological value formula_4, whereas taking a metaphor literally would be slightly preferable, the reification having a value of formula_5.\n\nHartman invented the Hartman Value Profile, which is however not a description of what \"is\" valuable, but a test to determine what people regard as valuable. It measures concept-formation and decision-making capacity. A Hartman festschrift (\"Values and Valuation\") appeared a few years after his death. Some critics would claim that most of the articles in it are not by Hartman supporters. Hartman, some critics claim, is out of the mainstream of value philosophy, but he was asked by UNESCO to summarize the state of Value Theory at Mid-Century. Many would dispute the idea that the number of properties of a thing can in any meaningful way be enumerated, but this is something Hartman never said was necessary. A standard argument against enumeration is that new properties can be defined in terms of old ones. Adding more features, a critic could object, even if each seems to be a good one, can sometimes lead to the overall value going down. In this way we get over-engineered software or a remote control which has too many buttons on it. Hartman holds that \"the name (that one puts on a concept) sets the norm\" so he would rejoin that a \"Remote with \"too many\" buttons\" is a disvalue.\n\nFrom a mathematician's point of view, much of Hartman's work in \"The Structure of Value\" is rather novel and does not use conventional mathematical methodology, nor axiomatic reasoning. However he later employed the mathematics of topological compact, connected Hausdorff spaces, interpreting them as a model for the value-structure of metaphor, in a paper on aesthetics.\n\nHartman, following Georg Cantor, uses infinite cardinalities. As a stipulated definition, he posits the reciprocals of transfinite cardinal numbers. These, together with the algebraic laws of exponents, enables him to construct what is today known as The Calculus of Values. In his paper \"The Measurement of Value,\" Hartman explain how he calculates the value of such items as Christmas shopping in terms of this calculus. While inverses of infinite quantities (\"infinitesimals\") exist in certain systems of numbers, such as hyperreal numbers and surreal numbers, these are not reciprocals of cardinal numbers.\n\nHartman supporters maintain that it is not necessary for properties to be actually enumerated, only that they exist and can correspond bijectively (one-to-one) to the property-names comprising the meaning of the concept. The attributes in the meaning of a concept only \"consist\" as stipulations; they don't \"exist\". Questions regarding the existence of a concept belong to ontology.\n\nIntensional attributes can resemble, but are not identical to, the properties perceived by the five senses. Attributes are names of properties. When, even partially, the properties of a thing match the attributes of that thing in the mind of the one making the judgment, the thing will be said to have \"value\". When they completely correspond, the thing will be called \"good\". These are basic ideas in value science.\n\n\n"}

Silhak was designed to counter the \"uncritical\" following of Confucian teachings and the strict adherence to \"formalism\" and \"ritual\" by neo-Confucians. Most of the Silhak scholars were from factions excluded from power and other disaffected scholars calling for reform. They advocated an empirical Confucianism deeply concerned with human society at the practical level.\n\nIts proponents generally argued for reforming the rigid Confucian social structure, land reforms to relieve the plight of peasant farmers, promoting Korea's own national identity and culture, encouraging the study of science, and advocating technology exchange with foreign countries. Silhak scholars wanted to use realistic and experimental approaches to social problems with the consideration of the welfare of the people. Silhak scholars encouraged human equality and moved toward a more Korean-centric view of Korean history. The Silhak school is credited with helping to create a modern Korea.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46743951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46743951", "title": "Sokushin zebutsu", "text": "Sokushin zebutsu\n\nSokushin zebutsu (), rendered in English as Mind is Itself Buddha, is a book of the Shōbōgenzō by the 13th century Sōtō Zen monk Eihei Dōgen. It was written in the spring of 1239 at Dōgen's monastery Kōshōhōrin-ji in Kyoto. The book appears as the fifth book in both the 75 and 60 fascicle versions of the Shōbōgenzō, and it is ordered sixth in the later chronological 95 fascicle \"Honzan\" editions. The title \"Sokushin zebutsu\" is an utterance attributed to the 8th century Song Dynasty Zen monk Mazu Daoyi in a well known kōan that appears most notably as Case 30 in The Gateless Barrier, although Dōgen would have known it from the earlier Transmission of the Lamp. In addition to this book of the Shōbōgenzō, Dōgen also discusses the phrase \"Sokushin zebutsu\" in several of his formal Dharma Hall Discourses, namely numbers 8, 75, 319, and 370, all of which are recorded in the Eihei Kōroku.\n\nDōgen's book \"Sokushin zebutsu\" lays out his understanding of this phrase, rendered in English as \"mind is itself Buddha\". He quickly notes that he views as incorrect the interpretation that the \"ordinary thoughts and awareness of sentient beings\" are already Buddha. He states that instead, \"\"Sokushin zebutsu\" is buddhas of aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana. Those who have not actualized aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana are not \"sokushin zebutsu\".” While aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana are a version of the four stages of enlightenment and are normally thought of a series of steps one must go through to achieve a final goal, Dōgen writes in the Shōbōgenzō book Gyōji, \"Where aspiration is present, there is already practice. Practice is itself awakening. This practice-awakening is nirvana. Thus “aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana” are not sequential stages. All are one.\" Thus, for Dōgen, \"sokushin zebutsu\" is identical to practice, or zazen. Further, at the conclusion of the essay, Dōgen writes, “The buddhas spoken of here are none other than Shakayamuni Buddha. Shakyamuni Buddha is \"sokushin zebutsu\". When all buddhas in the past, present, and future are buddhas, they unfailingly become Shakyamuni Buddha\". Dōgen thus equates mind, Buddhas, Shakyamuni Buddha, Bodhicitta, practice or zazen, awakening, and enlightenment, offering a characteristic teaching in nondualism.\n"}
{"id": "69201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69201", "title": "Spiritual gift", "text": "Spiritual gift\n\nA spiritual gift or charism (plural: charisms or charismata; in Greek singular: χάρισμα\n, plural: χαρίσματα ) is an endowment or extraordinary power given by the Holy Spirit These are the supernatural graces which individual Christians need (and were needed in the days of the Apostles) to fulfill the mission of the Church. In the narrowest sense, it is a theological term for the extraordinary graces given to individual Christians for the good of others and is distinguished from the graces given for personal sanctification, such as the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThese extraordinary spiritual gifts, often termed \"charismatic gifts\", are the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, increased faith, the gifts of healing, the gift of miracles, prophecy, the discernment of spirits, diverse kinds of tongues, interpretation of tongues. To these are added the gifts of apostles, prophets, teachers, helps (connected to service of the poor and sick), and governments (or leadership ability) which are connected with certain offices in the Church. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to individuals, but their purpose is to build up the entire Church. They are described in the New Testament, primarily in 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4. 1 Peter 4 also touches on the spiritual gifts.\n\nThe gifts are related to both seemingly \"natural\" abilities and seemingly more \"miraculous\" abilities, empowered by the Holy Spirit. The two major opposing theological positions on their nature is that they ceased long ago or that they continue (Cessationism versus Continuationism).\n\nThe New Testament contains several lists of spiritual gifts, most authored by St. Paul. While each list is unique, there is overlap.\n\nChristians believe that the \"charismata\" were foretold by the Prophet Joel (2:28) and promised by Christ (Gospel of Mark 16:17–18). This promise was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost and elsewhere as the church spread. In order to correct abuses concerning the spiritual gifts at Corinth, Paul devoted much attention to spiritual gifts in his First Epistle to the Corinthians (chapters 12–14).\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 12, two Greek terms are translated as \"spiritual gifts\". In verse 1, the word \"pneumatika\" (\"spirituals\" or \"things of the Spirit\") is used. In verse 4, \"charisma\" is used. This word is derived from the word \"charis\", which means \"grace\". In verses 5 and 6, the words \"diakonia\" (translated \"administrations\", \"ministries\", or \"service\") and \"energemata\" (\"operations\" or \"inworkings\") are used in describing the nature of the spiritual gifts. In verse 7, the term \"manifestation (\"phanerosis\") of the Spirit\" is used.\n\nFrom these scriptural passages, Christians understand the spiritual gifts to be enablements or capacities that are divinely bestowed upon individuals. Because they are freely given by God, these cannot be earned or merited. Though worked through individuals, these are operations or manifestations of the Holy Spirit—not of the gifted person. They are to be used for the benefit of others, and in a sense they are granted to the church as a whole more than they are given to individuals. There is diversity in their distribution—an individual will not possess all of the gifts. The purpose of the spiritual gifts is to edify (build up), exhort (encourage), and comfort the church.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Paul did not list all of the gifts of the Spirit, and many believe that there are as many gifts as there are needs in the body of Christ. The gifts have at times been organized into distinct categories based on their similarities and differences to other gifts. Some divide them into three categories using Old Testament offices. \"Prophetic\" gifts include any gift involving teaching, encouraging, or rebuking others. \"Priestly\" gifts include showing mercy and care for the needy or involve intercession before God. \"Kingly\" gifts are those involving church administration or government. Others categorize them into \"gifts of knowledge\" (word of wisdom, word of knowledge, distinguishing between spirits), \"gifts of speech\" (tongues, interpretation, prophecy), and \"gifts of power\" (faith, healing, miracles). The gifts have also been categorized as those that promote the inner growth of the church (apostle, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, teaching, word of wisdom/knowledge, helps, and administration) and those that promote the church's outer development (faith, miracles, healing, tongues, interpretation of tongues).\n\nProponents of cessationism distinguish between the \"extraordinary\", \"miraculous\", or \"sign\" gifts (such as prophecy, tongues, and healing) and the other gifts. Cessationism is held by some Protestants, especially from the Calvinist tradition, who believe that miraculous gifts and their operations were limited to early Christianity and \"ceased\" afterward. Other Protestants, including Lutheran, Methodist, Pentecostals and charismatics, adhere to the continuationist position, believing that all the spiritual gifts are distributed among Christians by the Holy Spirit and that they are normative in contemporary Christendom. In addition, Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Church also continue to believe in and make use of all of the spiritual gifts.\n\nApostle: The title apostle comes from the Greek word \"apostolos\" which means \"a messenger, one sent forth with orders\". It refers to one who has been delegated authority by another in a foreign land. Apostles were the first leaders of the Church; they were commissioned by Jesus to initiate and direct the preaching of the gospel. While many Christians agree that the title of apostle is reserved for those among the first generation of Christians, many Christian denominations continue in one way or another to recognize a continuing apostolic ministry. Many churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, believe in the doctrine of apostolic succession, which holds that properly ordained bishops are the successors to the apostles. Other Christian groups, such as classical Pentecostals, consider the role of a missionary to be fulfilling an apostolic ministry. There are some Christians, however, who advocate restoring the Fivefold ministry, including the formal recognition of the office of apostle. Others would say that the office no longer exists.\n\nProphet: In the New Testament, the office of prophet is to equip the saints for the work of service through exhortation, edification, and consolation (1 Corinthians 12:28; 1 Corinthians 14:3 Ephesians 4:11). The prophet's corresponding gift is prophecy. Prophecy is \"reporting something that God spontaneously brings to your mind\". Many, particularly Pentecostals and charismatics, distinguish between the \"office of prophet\" and the \"gift of prophecy\", believing that a Christian can possess the gift of prophecy without holding the prophetic office.\n\nEvangelist: An evangelist is one who devotes himself to preaching the gospel. In the New Testament, evangelists preached from city to city, church to church.\n\nPastor: This term derives from a Greek word for \"shepherd\". In theory pastors are gifted to lead, guide, and set an example for other Christians. The grammatical structure of Ephesians 4:11 leads many to conclude that teacher and pastor should be considered one term (pastor-teacher). Even so, the two terms are not interchangeable; while all pastors are teachers, not all teachers are pastors. Pastoral Gifts include integrity and compassion. \n\nTeacher: Someone who devotes his or her life to preaching and teaching the Christian faith. When teaching is provided for the Church by God, two gifts are actually given—to the Church is given a teacher and along with the teacher comes a divine capacity to teach.\n\nService: The word translated as \"ministry\" is \"diakonia\", which can also be translated \"service\". Since there are many types of ministries and service to the Church, this then describes a broad array of gifts rather than a single gift.\n\nExhortation: The ability to motivate Christians \"to patient endurance, brotherly love, and good works\".\n\nGiving: Those with this gift share their own possessions with others with extraordinary generosity. While all Christians should be givers, those possessing this gift will go beyond this normal giving.\n\nLeading: This gift speaks to the various leadership roles found in the Church. While many think of roles such as administration, management of funds, strategy planning, etc. as functions outside of the supernatural realm, in reality individuals in these positions are just as in need of supernatural empowerment as are ministers of the gospel. Some writers consider the gifts of governments and leading to be the same gift, but others consider them closely related yet different.\n\nMercy: Possibly identical to the gift of helps, the mercy-shower possesses a ministry of visitation, prayer, and compassion to the poor and sick.\n\nWord of wisdom: An utterance or message of wisdom supernaturally granted to an individual. For Paul, wisdom refers to \"the knowledge of the great Christian mysteries: the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ, and the indwelling in the believer of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2; Ephesians 1:17)\".\n\nWord of knowledge: The knowledge referred to is often said to relate to understanding Christian doctrine or scriptural truth. It is sometimes said to be connected with the ministry of teachers.\n\nFaith: This refers to that strong or special faith \"which removes mountains, casts out devils (Matthew 17:19–20), and faces the most cruel martyrdom without flinching\". It is distinguished from the \"saving\" and \"normal\" Christian faith.\n\nGifts of healings: The ability to supernaturally minister healing to others. The plural indicates the variety of sickness healed and the many forms the gift takes, such as healing by anointing with oil, by the laying on of hands, by saying the name of Jesus or by the sign of the cross.\n\nWorking of miracles: The performance of deeds beyond ordinary human ability by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nVisions. An outpouring of this gift is prophesied in Joel 2:28 and Acts 2:17 shows that early Christians believed this prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. Visions tend to be more private experiences than the other gifts. Some researchers expand the definition of visions to include a strongly felt presence.\n\nDiscerning of spirits: The capacity to discern, distinguish, or to discriminate the source of a spiritual manifestation—whether it emanates from a good or evil spirit. It seemed to have been particularly associated with prophecy as it would be necessary to know whether a prophetic utterance was truly inspired by God.\n\nTongues: The supernatural ability of speaking an unlearned language. Paul seems to have distinguished between the public use of the gift (which must always be interpreted) and the private use which was for the spiritual strengthening of oneself. Currently among Christians there is a dispute as to whether tongues were/are always xenoglossy (speaking an unlearned human language) or whether it also included/includes glossolalia (speaking an unlearned and allegedly non-human language of heavenly or angelic origin).\n\nInterpretation of tongues: This gift always follows the public exercise of the gift of tongues. In 1 Corinthians 14, the Apostle Paul required that all speech in Christian worship should be intelligible. This required that speech given in an unknown tongue be interpreted in the common language of the gathered Christians.\n\nHelps: This gift has to do with service to the sick and the poor. Possessor of this gift has a \"spiritual burden and a God-given love for the needy and afflicted\".\n\nAdministration: Also called the gift of governing, the Greek word translated \"governments\" is \"kubernesis\", the verb form of which means \"to steer\" or \"to be a helmsman\". This gift then refers to the God-given capacity to lead or guide the Church through storms and difficult seas.\n\nWhile not specifically defined as spiritual gifts in the Bible, other abilities and capacities have been considered as spiritual gifts by some Christians. Some are found in the New Testament such as:\n\nOthers are found in the Old Testament such as:\n\nThe word is also used in secular circumstances within social psychology. In that context, charism is defined as personal influence on other people individually or as a group.\n\nReligious orders (including Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran and Methodist) use the word \"charism\" to describe their spiritual orientation and any special characteristics of their mission or values that might be exhibited as a result of the vows that they have taken and the orientation of the order to which they belong. An example might be the works of a teaching order compared to that of a missionary order or one devoted to the care of the poor or the sick and those in need of help.\n\n\n"}

Raymond had been active in the Christian defense against the Moors (Muslims) and Jews in the kingdom of Aragon since the 1240s. To this end, Raymond instituted the teaching of Arabic and Hebrew in several houses of the friars, and he also founded priories in Murcia (then still under Muslim rule) and in Tunis. Additionally he went to help establish the Church in the recently conquered island of Mallorca. Raymond's request to Thomas was transmitted by fellow Dominican Ramón Martí, one of eight friars appointed to make a study of oriental languages with the purpose of carrying on a mission to Jews and Moors.\nThe historicity of this account has been questioned in modern scholarship. Arguments adduced include the lack of an explicit dedication to Raymond, the evidence that substantial portions of book 1 were complete by mid-1259 (suggesting that Thomas started work on the book as early as 1257), and the suggestion that the work makes no effort to address tenets of Islam specifically.\n\nLater in 1259, Thomas left Paris and returned to Naples, where he was appointed as general preacher by the provincial chapter of 29 September 1260. In September 1261 he was called to Orvieto as conventual lector responsible for the pastoral formation of the friars unable to attend a \"studium generale\".\nIt was in Orvieto that Thomas completed \"Summa contra Gentiles\", which was followed by the \"Catena aurea\", and minor works produced for Pope Urban IV such as the liturgy for the newly created feast of Corpus Christi and the \"Contra errores graecorum\".\n\nParts of the text have survived in Aquinas' autograph, kept in the Vatican Library as Lat. 9850. The manuscript includes fragments of books one and two, and large portions of book three.\n\nThe \"Summa contra Gentiles\" consists of four books.\nThe structure of Thomas' work is designed to proceed from general philosophical arguments for monotheism, to which Muslims and Jews are likely to consent even within their own respective religious traditions, before progressing to the discussion of specifically Christian doctrine.\n\nBooks I–III cover truths that naturally are accessible to the human intellect while book IV covers revealed \ntruths for which natural reason is inadequate.\n\nThe conventional title is taken from chapter I.2, where Thomas states his intention as the work's author:\n\"I have set myself the task of making known, as far as my limited powers will allow, the truth that the Catholic faith professes, and of setting aside the errors that are opposed to it. To use the words of Hilary: 'I am aware that I owe this to God as the chief duty of my life, that my every word and sense may speak of Him' [\"De Trinitate\" I, 37].\"\n\nThe first book begins with general questions of truth and natural reason, and from chapter 10 investigates the concept of monotheistic God, chapters 10 to 13 concerned with the existence of God, followed by a detailed investigation of God's properties (chapters 14 to 102).\n\nThe second book is dedicated to the Creation (viz. the physical universe, everything which exists).\n\nThe third book discusses providence and the human condition, i.e. good and evil acts, human fate and intellect and the relation of created beings to the creator.\n\nThe fourth book is dedicated to discussing points of Christian doctrine which separate Nicaean Christianity from the other monotheistic religions, i.e. the doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Sacraments and the Resurrection.\n\nGiuseppe Ciante (d. 1670), a leading Hebrew expert of his day and professor of theology and philosophy at the College of Saint Thomas in Rome was appointed in 1640 by Pope Urban VIII to the mission of preaching to the Jews of Rome (\"Predicatore degli Ebrei\") in order to promote their conversion.\" In the mid-1650s Ciantes wrote a \"monumental bilingual edition of the first three Parts of Thomas Aquinas’ \"Summa contra Gentiles\", which includes the original Latin text and a Hebrew translation prepared by Ciantes, assisted by Jewish converts, the \"Summa divi Thomae Aquinatis ordinis praedicatorum Contra Gentiles quam Hebraicè eloquitur…\". \nUntil the present this remains the only significant translation of a major Latin scholastic work in modern Hebrew.\"\n\nThe first modern edition of the work is the one by Ucceli (1878) re-published in 1918 as part of the \"Editio Leonina\".\n\nAppendices to the first three books, based on the authograph, were edited as vols. 13 (1918, 3–61) and 14 (1926, 3–49) of the Leonine edition.\nThe Leonine text was re-edited, with corrections, by P. Marc, C. Pera and P. Carmello and published with Marietti, Torino-Rome, in 1961.\nModern translations have been published in: \nEnglish (1924, 1957),\nGerman (1937, 2001),\nSpanish (1968)\nand French (1993, 1999)\n\n\n"}

Some of her papers were published in PLOS One, Journal de Physique, Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology, Applied Surface Science, Canadian Journal of Chemistry, Journal of Nanoparticle Research, Materials Science and Engineering and Journal of Biological Chemistry.\n\nHer research works include a variety of themes, such as thermal stability of mirrors when exposed to the synchrotron radiation, stabilization of antisense oligonucleotides, molecular cloning and regulation of gene expression, biomedical effects and hemocompatibility of biomaterials, surface properties of chemicals physicochemical characterization and analysis of microelectrode arrays and bactericidal properties of nanomaterials.\n\nTaraneh Javanbakht's works are in several branches of philosophy. Her philosophical writings, netism, including her theories in metaphysics, analytical philosophy, ethics and political philosophy, was published in the Journal of New Philosophy, the College Student Journal of Tabatabai University in Iran in 2011 and 2012 and as her dissertation in the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) in 2016. Some other parts of netism, including the aesthetics and epistemology, were republished by the Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia in 2016.\n\nThe genealogy, according to netism, has three steps: 1. the Being tendential of itself, which is the universe, 2. the being tendential of himself that is the human being in his first step of existence, and 3. the being detendential of himself that is the human being in his second step of existence, who reduces continuously the tendencies of repetition in his life.\n\nHer theory in cognitive science, the demarcator theory, is in opposition with the prototype theory and exemplar theory. The demarcator theory was published by the Université du Québec à Montréal in 2016. This theory, in difference with these two mentioned theories, explains why, when and how human beings distinguish or confound the categories of concepts. She formalized this theory by the combination of non-classical logics.\n\nShe introduced and developed the tendential logic, a new logic with applications in sciences, philosophy, literature, arts and social movements. The tendential logic and its applications were published by the Université du Québec à Montréal in 2016. Her works on different models showed that the combination of the tendential logic with the other non-classical logics, such as fuzzy logic and modal logic, is appropriate to model the human cognitive disorders.\n\nHer other philosophical articles were republished by the Tebyan Cultural Institute in 2008, the Iranian Students News Agency in 2004 and the National Content Consortium in 2013.\n\nTaraneh Javanbakht writes poems in English, French, German, Russian, Azari, Arabic and Persian. Her poem book in these languages was published by Arvin Press in Iran in 2005. Her nine poem books and two short story books were published in Iran. Her articles in literary criticism were published in the literary magazines and newspapers. Her three translation books entitled \"Man az derakhte zaman haft miveh chideham\", \"Sarab\" and \"Gozideh ashare jahan\" were published in 2005 in Iran.\n\nTaraneh Javanbakht's acrylic and oil paintings and her clay sculptures are in different styles such as realism, surrealism and abstract art. She composes music for piano and guitar. Her music book entitled \"Eshghe Shirin\" contains classical music and modern music. Her plays and scenarios are found in her book entitled \"Marathon to the power of tomorrow\".\n\nHer articles in women's movement and human rights were also published by Gooyanews and the Committee of human rights reporters. Her memoirs about some social events were published in her articles.\n\nSeveral critics on the works of Taraneh Javanbakht were published in the media. Some of these critics are as follows:\n\nThe organizations and institutions in United States, Europe and Iran republished Taraneh Javanbakht's works. Some of her republished works are as follows:\n\nSome of the outlooks of Taraneh Javanbakht are as follows:\n\nAccording to her own claim, Taraneh Javanbakht is the founder and president of the World Women Association. She is a member of the Minkowski institute. She has also been a member of the Research Group of Science and Biomedical Technology at the École Polytechnique de Montréal since 2011.\n\nTaraneh Javanbakht was awarded for her works in Iran, France and Canada. She was awarded by Reza Amrollahi, the President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the second in the administration of President of Iran in 1993.\n\nSome of the researchers and writers published the biography and works of Taraneh Javanbakht in their books, which were published in Iran and United States. The Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia republished her philosophical system, netism, including her philosophy of knowledge and aesthetics in 2016. Pooran Farrokhzad wrote about Taraneh Javanbakht's books in her book entitled \"Karnamaye zanane karaye Iran\", which was published by Ghatreh publishing in 2002. Ravenna press published Taraneh Javanbakht's poem in an anthology in Washington in 2004. Rira Abbasi published Taraneh Javanbakht's poem in another anthology entitled \"Shere solh\".

These three lectures were then revised and expanded for the book, with an introduction by Nelson Goodman. \n\nThe first section is \"Perceiving and learning,\" and it summarizes the psychology of perception and learning. The second is \"Breaking into language,\" and it concerns reification, which moves from rudimentary to full-fledged through the use of the relative clause with its relative pronoun and subsidiary pronouns. These pronouns then recur as the bound variables of quantifications. The third section, \"Referring to objects,\" examines properties, classes and numbers. He concludes that it is a genetic fallacy to claim that truth cannot emerge from fallacious proofs.\n\nQuine is interested in explaining the \"psychogenesis of reference,\" constructing how sensory perception moves from the ability to describe concrete objects to abstract objects through a series of increasingly complex ways of referring to things. Following sensory reception of input from the physical world, someone acquiring language must learn to form \"observation sentences, talk of bodies, compound sentences, quantifiers, numbers until the imagined person has a scheme not much less sophisticated than our own.\" According to author Gary Kemp, Quine \"refines the claims and tasks of epistemology so as to make good on the basic claim that all knowledge derives from experience.\" Because it was created for the Carus Lectures, Quine states his ontological position in a \"delightfully relaxed, good-humored style.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4253757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4253757", "title": "The Secret (2006 film)", "text": "The Secret (2006 film)\n\nThe Secret is a 2006 film consisting of a series of interviews designed to demonstrate the New Thought claim that everything one wants or needs can be satisfied by believing in an outcome, repeatedly thinking about it, and maintaining positive emotional states to \"attract\" the desired outcome.\n\nThe film and the subsequent publication of the book of the same name attracted interest from media figures such as Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, and Larry King. It has also received a great deal of controversy and criticism for its claims, and has been parodied in TV shows.\n\n\"The Secret\", described as a self-help film, uses a documentary format to present a concept titled \"law of attraction\". As described in the film, the \"Law of Attraction\" hypothesis posits that feelings and thoughts can attract events, feelings, and experiences, from the workings of the cosmos to interactions among individuals in their physical, emotional, and professional affairs. The film also suggests that there has been a strong tendency by those in positions of power to keep this central principle hidden from the public.\n\nThe film includes interviews with individuals who describe themselves as professionals and authors in the fields of quantum physics, psychology, metaphysics, coaching, theology, philosophy, finance, feng shui, medicine, and personal development, who are called \"secret teachers\". Some of them, on their Web sites, promote the film and their connection to it. A few of the persons' brief appearances do not speak of the \"law of attraction\" in their interviews, so their support of the concepts is assumed by viewers.\n\nPeople who focus on the law of attraction who are interviewed in the film and have later been featured on prominent American TV shows are John Assaraf, Michael Beckwith, John Demartini, Bob Proctor, Jack Canfield, James Arthur Ray, Joseph Vitale, Lisa Nichols, Marie Diamond, and John Gray. Others involved in the film who have spoken of their strong belief in the Law of Attraction, include Esther Hicks and Jerry Hicks (original edition only), Mike Dooley, David Schirmer, and Marci Shimoff. Others interviewed in the film who voice very similar views without using the phrase \"law of attraction\" include Lee Brower (Board Member of WorldVuer), Hale Dwoskin, Bob Doyle, Cathy Goodman, Morris E. Goodman, John Hagelin, Bill Harris, Ben Johnson, Loral Langemeier, Denis Waitley, Neale Donald Walsch, John Gray and Fred Alan Wolf. NY Times bestselling authors of \"The Passion Test\", Janet Bray Attwood and Chris Attwood, are not featured in the film, but they arranged 36 of the 52 interviews done for the movie. The Attwoods are included in the credits at the end of the film.\n\nThe authors of \"The Secret\" cite the New Thought movement which began in the late 18th century as the historical basis for their ideas.\n\nThe New Thought book \"The Science of Getting Rich\" by Wallace Wattles, the source Rhonda Byrne cites as inspiration for the film, was preceded by numerous other New Thought books, including the 1906 book \"Thought Vibration or the law of attraction in the Thought World\" by William Walker Atkinson, editor of \"New Thought magazine\". Other New Thought books Byrne is purported to have read include self-help authors like Prentice Mulford's 19th-century\" Thoughts Are Things;\" and Robert Collier's \"Secret of the Ages\" from 1926.\n\n\"The Secret\" website cites the Emerald Tablet, said to be written by Hermes Trismegistus (purportedly a \"secret teacher\"), as... one of the most important historical documents known to mankind\". Byrne posits that the earliest trace of \"the secret\" occurred in the Emerald Tablet, followed much later by the Rosicrucians — a \"secret order that espoused many of the ideas of The Secret.\" Mention is made of Victor Hugo and Ludwig van Beethoven's supposed membership in the order as well as Isaac Newton's purported work in translating the tablet. However, no evidence has been shown to support this claim.\n\nCarolyn Sackariason of the \"Aspen Times\", when commenting about Byrne's intention to share \"The Secret\" with the world, identifies the Rosicrucians as keepers of \"The Secret\". Neither the words \"Emerald Tablet\" nor \"Rosicrucian\" are spoken in the film, however, at key transition points the screen image rapidly zooms in on the word \"Rosicrucian\".\n\nThe film was created by Prime Time Productions of Melbourne, Australia with Rhonda Byrne, executive producer; Paul Harrington, producer; and Drew Heriot, director. Gozer Media of Collingwood, a suburb of Melbourne, is the design house\nresponsible for the visual style and feel of the film and book. Byrne's company TS Production LLC, a Hungarian company, is responsible for marketing and distribution of the film and book. Byrne commented about the research she did prior to making the film:\n\nByrne's inspiration for creating \"The Secret\" came from reading the 1910 book \"The Science of Getting Rich\" by Wallace D. Wattles. The film was done as a project for Australia's Nine Network. Nine put up less than 25% of the $3 million project with additional funding from mortgaging Byrne's home and from an investment by Bob Rainone, \"a former Internet executive in Chicago\". Rainone became the CEO of one of Byrne's companies, The Secret LLC, and is described by Byrne as \"delivered to us from heaven\".\n\nShooting of the interviews was done in July and August 2005 with editing \"effectively completed by Christmas time\". About 55 teachers and authors were interviewed at locations including Chicago, Aspen, Alaska, and a Mexican Riviera cruise (interviewing Esther Hicks). The film uses 24 of these teachers in the \"Extended Edition\" of the film. The first edition featured a 25th teacher, Esther Hicks, known \"as the most prominent interpreter of the Law of Attraction\". Since the first release of the DVD, Esther Hicks declined to continue with the project. Her 10% share of sales netted the Hickses $500,000. As a result of this, scenes with Esther Hicks, are instead narrated by Lisa Nichols and Marci Shimoff. No other \"secret teachers\" received compensation for their appearance in the film — revealed by Bob Proctor in an interview on Nightline.\n\nBetsy Chasse, one of the producers, directors, and screenwriters for \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" interviewed Paul Harrington, the co-producer of \"The Secret.\" In the interview, Harrington gave this description of Byrne's production methods: \"We used the law of attraction during the making of the program. We went very unconventional, in terms of scheduling and budgeting. We allowed things to come to us... We just had faith that things would come to us.\"\n\nChannel Nine, after viewing the completed film, chose to not broadcast it. A new contract was negotiated with all DVD sales going to Byrne's companies (Prime Time and The Secret LLC). In hindsight, Len Downs of Channel Nine commented, \"we looked at it and we didn't deem it as having broad, mass appeal\". The film was eventually broadcast by Channel Nine at 10:30 pm on Saturday, 3 February 2007. Downs reported that \"it didn't do all that well\". The film was sold on DVD and also broadcast online through streaming media.\n\nThe film has been described as a \"slick repackaging\" of the Law of Attraction, a concept originating in the New Thought ideas of the late 19th century. In producing the film, the law was intentionally \"packaged\" with a focus on \"wealth enhancement\" — differing from the more spiritual orientation of the New Thought Movement. One of the film's backers stated, \"we desired to hit the masses, and money is the number one thing on the masses' minds\". A review in salon.com described the packaging of the products related to the film as having \"a look... that conjures a 'Da Vinci Code' aesthetic, full of pretty faux parchment, quill-and-ink fonts and wax seals.\n\nChoosing to package the film's theme as a \"secret\" has been called an important component of the film's popularity. Donavin Bennes, a buyer who specializes in metaphysics for Borders Books, stated \"We all want to be in on a secret. But to present it as \"the\" secret, that was brilliant.\" \"\"\n\nThe movie was advertised on the Internet using \"tease\" advertising and viral marketing; techniques in which the specific details of \"The Secret\" were not revealed. Additionally, Prime Time Productions granted written permission to individuals or companies, via application at the official site, to provide free screenings of the film to public audiences. Optionally, the DVD may be sold at these screenings.\n\nA companion book by Rhonda Byrne was published called \"The Secret\" (Simon & Schuster, 2006). \"The Secret\" was featured on two episodes of \"Oprah\" — and as the film reached number one on the Amazon DVD chart in March 2007, the book version of \"The Secret\" reached number one on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list. For much of February through April 2007, both the book and the DVD versions were #1 or #2 at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Borders. Simon & Schuster released a second printing of 2 million copies of \"The Secret\" — \"the biggest order for a second printing in its history,\" while \"Time\" reported brisk sales of the DVD through New Age bookstores, and New Thought churches, such as Unity and Agape International Spiritual Center. Like the movie, the book has also experienced a great deal of controversy and criticism for its claims, and has been parodied on several TV shows.\n\nThe estimated domestic DVD sales in the US in 2007 exceed $56 million, and eventually topped $65 million.\n\n\"The Secret\" has been described as a \"self-help phenomenon\", a \"publishing phenomenon\", and a \"cultural phenomenon\". \n\nSeveral critics wrote about the Secret in relation to self-help in general. Julie Mason, of the \"Ottawa Citizen\", wrote that word of mouth about the film spread through Pilates classes, \"get-rich-quick websites\" and personal-motivation blogs. Jane Lampman, of the \"Christian Science Monitor\", described \"The Secret\" as a brand promoting \"Secret\"-related teachers, seminars and retreats. According to Jill Culora, of the \"New York Post\", fans of \"The Secret\" have posted on a wide range of blogs and Web forums accounts of how shifting from negative to positive thoughts made big improvements in their lives.\n\nJerry Adler of Newsweek called it \"breathless pizzazz\" for a tired self-help genre; \"emphatically cinematic\" and \"driven by images and emotions rather than logic\"; a blend of Tony Robbins and \"The Da Vinci Code\"; and \"the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" of infomercials\".\n\nIn 2007, \"The Secret\" was reportedly being discussed in \"e-mails, in chat rooms, around office cubicles, [and] on blind dates\". It is recognized as having a broad and varied impact on culture.\n\nAmerican TV host Oprah Winfrey is a proponent of the film and later the book. On The Larry King Show she said that the message of \"The Secret\" is the message she's been trying to share with the world on her show for the past 21 years. Author Rhonda Byrne was later invited to her show along people who vow by \"The Secret\".\n\nSome critics were bothered by the film's focus on questionable wealth enhancement, including promises that the universe will give you material goods \"like having the universe as your catalog.\"\n\nAccording to a March 2007 issue of \"Skeptical Inquirer\", the central idea of the film \"has [no] basis in scientific reality\", despite invoking scientific concepts.\n\nWithin businesses using the DVD for employee-training and morale-building, author Barbara Ehrenreich called it \"a gimmick\" and \"disturbing\", like \"being indoctrinated into a cult\".\n\nUFC former champion Conor McGregor claims \"The Secret\" played a role in his rise to fame. McGregor has said his first reaction on watching the DVD version was: “This is bullshit — but then something clicked for me.” He and girlfriend Dee Devlin, who manages his finances, started focusing on small things they wanted, such as a parking space closest to the doors of a local shopping centre. He said: “We would be driving to the shop and visualising the exact car park space. And then we’d be able to get it every time.” \nThey then began visualizing wealth, fame and championships.\n\nThe concept was parodied on \"The Chaser's War on Everything\", \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Boston Legal\" and \"Saturday Night Live\". \n\nThe Australian Nine Network's \"A Current Affair\"—an Australian TV tabloid show—on 14 May 2007 segment titled, \"\"The Secret\" Stoush\", interviews Australian author Vanessa J. Bonnette. In the interview, Bonnette—when referring to the book version of \"The Secret\"—asserts, \"that is my work and Rhonda Byrne has stolen it\". Bonnette and a reporter compare her book to Byrne's on the use of the \"TV transmission\" analogy. Bonnette's book, \"Empowered for the New Era\" (2003 Empowered For Life) was released in 2007 as a second edition. Bonnette, at her website, claims 100 instances of plagiarism. Byrne's marketing company, TS Production LLC, has responded with a lawsuit to restrain Bonnette. From the statement of claim:\n\nDavid Schirmer, the \"investment guru\"—and only Australian—in the film, has his business activities under investigation by the Australian Securities Investment Commission (ASIC). This was reported on 1 June 2007 by A Current Affair in a segment titled \"The Secret Con\" with those words and \"The Secret\" logo appearing in the background behind the newscaster. The show initially confronted Schirmer in a segment titled \"The Secret Exposed\", aired on 28 May 2007, with complaints from people who say Schirmer owed them money.\n\nOn February 12, 2008 Bob Proctor's company, LifeSuccess Productions, L.L.C. successfully sued \"investment guru\" David Schirmer, his wife Lorna, and their several companies (including LifeSuccess Pacific Rim PTY LTD, Schirmer Financial Management PTY LTD, LifeSuccess Productions PTY LTD, Excellence in Marketing PTY LTD, and Wealth By Choice PTY LTC) for \"misleading or deceptive conduct\".\n\nIn August 2008, \"The Australian\" reported that Drew Heriot (director) and Dan Hollings (Internet consultant for \"The Secret\") were in a legal dispute with Rhonda Byrne over pay from the project.\n\nFilm footage featuring Esther Hicks was removed from the later \"Extended Edition\" of \"The Secret\" after film's creator Rhonda Byrne rescinded the original contract covering Hicks' participation.\n\nPaul Harrington, the producer for the film, reported that broadcast TV—instead of the Internet—was initially planned as the medium for the first release:\n\n\"The Secret\" premiere was broadcast through the Internet on March 23, 2006 using Vividas technology. It is still available either on a pay-per-view basis via streaming media (or on DVD at the official site for the film). A new extended edition of \"The Secret\" was released to the public on October 1, 2006. The Australian television premiere was on Nine Network on Saturday, February 3, 2007.\n\nPlans were announced in 2007 to produce a sequel to \"The Secret\" and a spin-off TV series. It has also been announced that a fiction film is in production based on The Secret, which will star Katie Holmes as the main character.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6711330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6711330", "title": "Waldorf education", "text": "Waldorf education\n\nWaldorf education, also known as Steiner education, is based on the educational philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy. Its pedagogy strives to develop pupils' intellectual, artistic, and practical skills in an integrated and holistic manner. The cultivation of pupils' imagination and creativity is a central focus. \n\nIndividual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology, and governance. Qualitative assessments of student work are integrated into the daily life of the classroom, with quantitative testing playing a minimal role and standardized testing usually limited to what is required to enter post-secondary education. \n\nThe first Waldorf school opened in 1919 in Stuttgart, Germany. A century later, it has become the largest independent school movement in the world, with about 1,150 independent Waldorf schools, about 1,800 kindergartens and 646 centers for special education located in 75 countries. There are also a number of Waldorf-based public schools, charter schools and academies, and homeschooling environments. In Continental Europe, Waldorf pedagogy has become a well-recognized theory of education that has influenced public schooling and many European Waldorf schools receive state funding. Public funding of Waldorf schools in English-speaking countries is increasingly widespread but has encountered controversy due to widespread anti-vaccinationism and failure to adhere to normal standards of education (e.g. in literacy).\n<onlyinclude>\n</onlyinclude>\n\nThe first school based upon Steiner's ideas was opened in 1919 in response to a request by Emil Molt, the owner and managing director of the Waldorf-Astoria Cigarette Company in Stuttgart, Germany, to serve the children of employees of the factory. This is the source of the name \"Waldorf,\" which is now trademarked in some countries in association with the method.The co-educational school soon forayed beyond the company, admitting children from a diverse social spectrum and growing rapidly to became the first comprehensive school in Germany \n\nWaldorf education became more widely known in Britain in 1922 through lectures Steiner gave on education at a conference at Oxford University. Two years later, on his final trip to Britain at Torquay in 1924, Steiner delivered a Waldorf teacher training course. The first school in England, now Michael Hall school, was founded in 1925; the first in the USA, the Rudolf Steiner School in New York City, in 1928. By the 1930s, numerous schools inspired by the original school and/or Steiner's pedagogical principles had opened in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Hungary, the USA, and the UK.\n\nPolitical interference from the Nazi regime limited and ultimately closed most Waldorf schools in Europe, with the exception of the British, Swiss, and some Dutch schools. The affected schools were reopened after the Second World War, though those in Soviet-dominated areas were closed again a few years later by Communist regimes.\n\nIn North America, the number of Waldorf schools increased from nine in the US and one in Canada in 1967 to around 200 in the US and over 20 in Canada today. There are currently 29 Steiner schools in the United Kingdom and 3 in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Waldorf schools began to proliferate in Central and Eastern Europe. Most recently, many schools have opened in Asia, especially in China. There are currently over 1,000 independent Waldorf schools worldwide.\n\nThe structure of Waldorf education follows Steiner's theory of child development, which divides childhood into three developmental stages and describes learning strategies appropriate to each stage. These stages, each of which lasts approximately seven years, are broadly similar to those later observed and described by Piaget. Steiner's educational ideas closely follow modern \"common sense\" educational theory, as this has developed since Comenius and Pestalozzi.\n\nThe stated purpose of this approach is to awaken the \"physical, behavioral, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual\" aspects of each individual, fostering creative as well as analytic thinking. A 2005 review found that Waldorf schools successfully develop \"creative, social and other capabilities important in the holistic growth of the person\".\nWaldorf pedagogical theory considers that during the first years of life children learn best by being immersed in an environment they can learn from through un-selfconscious imitation of practical activities. The early childhood curriculum therefore centers on experiential education, allowing children to learn by example, and opportunities for imaginative play. The overall goal of the curriculum is to \"imbue the child with a sense that the world is good\".\n\nWaldorf preschools employ a regular daily routine that includes free play, artistic work (e.g. drawing, painting or modeling), circle time (songs, games, and stories), and practical tasks (e.g. cooking, cleaning, and gardening), with rhythmic variations. Periods of outdoor recess are also usually included. The classroom is intended to resemble a home, with tools and toys usually sourced from simple, natural materials that lend themselves to imaginative play. The use of natural materials has been widely praised as fulfilling children's aesthetic needs, encouraging their imagination, and reinforcing their identification with nature, though one pair of reviewers questioned whether the preference for natural, non-manufactured materials is \"a reaction against the dehumanizing aspects of nineteenth-century industrialization\" rather than a \"reasoned assessment of twenty-first century children's needs\".\n\nPre-school and kindergarten programs generally include seasonal festivals drawn from a variety of traditions, with attention placed on the traditions brought forth from the community. Waldorf schools in the Western Hemisphere have traditionally celebrated Christian festivals, though many North American schools also include Jewish festivals.\n\nWaldorf kindergarten and lower grades generally discourage pupils' use of electronic media such as television and computers. There are a variety of reasons for this: Waldorf educators believe that use of these conflicts with young children's developmental needs, media users may be physically inactive, and media may be seen to contain inappropriate or undesirable content and to hamper the imagination.\n\nWaldorf pedagogues consider that readiness for formal learning depends upon increased independence of character, temperament, habits, and memory, one of the markers of which is the loss of the baby teeth. Formal instruction in reading, writing, and other academic disciplines are therefore not introduced until students enter the elementary school, when pupils are around seven years of age. Steiner believed that engaging young children in abstract intellectual activity too early would adversely affect their growth and development.\n\nWaldorf elementary schools (ages 7–14) emphasize cultivating children's emotional life and imagination. In order that students can connect more deeply with the subject matter, academic instruction is presented through artistic work that includes story-telling, visual arts, drama, movement, vocal and instrumental music, and crafts. The core curriculum includes language arts, mythology, history, geography, geology, algebra, geometry, mineralogy, biology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, and nutrition. The school day generally begins with a one-and-a-half to two-hour, cognitively oriented academic lesson, or \"Main Lesson\", that focuses on a single theme over the course of about a month's time. This typically begins with introductory activities that may include singing, instrumental music, and recitations of poetry, generally including a verse written by Steiner for the start of a school day.\n\nElementary school educators' stated task is to present a role model children will naturally want to follow, gaining authority through fostering rapport and \"nurturing curiosity, imagination, and creativity\". The declared goal of this second stage is to \"imbue children with a sense that the world is beautiful\". There is little reliance on standardized textbooks.\n\nWaldorf elementary education allows for individual variations in the pace of learning, based upon the expectation that a child will grasp a concept or achieve a skill when he or she is ready. Cooperation takes priority over competition. This approach also extends to physical education; competitive team sports are introduced in upper grades.\n\nEach class normally remains together as a cohort throughout their years, developing as a quasi-familial social group whose members know each other quite deeply. In the elementary years, a core teacher teaches the primary academic subjects. A central role of this class teacher is to provide supportive role models both through personal example and through stories drawn from a variety of cultures, educating by exercising creative, loving authority. Class teachers are normally expected to teach a group of children for several years, a practice known as looping. The traditional goal was for the teacher to remain with a class for the eight years of the \"lower school\" cycle, but in recent years the duration of these cycles has been increasingly treated flexibly. Already in first grade, specialized teachers teach many of the subjects, including music, crafts, movement, and two foreign languages from complementary language families (in English-speaking countries often German and either Spanish or French); these subjects remain central to the curriculum throughout the elementary school years.\n\nWhile class teachers serve a valuable role as personal mentors, establishing \"lasting relationships with pupils\", especially in the early years, Ullrich documented problems when the same class teacher continues into the middle school years. Noting that there is a danger of any authority figure limiting students enthusiasm for inquiry and assertion of autonomy, he emphasized the need for teachers to encourage independent thought and explanatory discussion in these years, and cited approvingly a number of schools where the class teacher accompanies the class for six years, after which specialist teachers play a significantly greater role.\n\nSteiner considered children's cognitive, emotional and behavioral development to be interlinked. When students in a Waldorf school are grouped, it is generally not by a singular focus on their academic abilities. Instead Steiner adapted the idea of the classic four temperaments – melancholic, sanguine, phlegmatic and choleric – for pedagogical use in the elementary years. Steiner indicated that teaching should be differentiated to accommodate the different needs that these psychophysical types represent. For example, \"cholerics are risk takers, phlegmatics take things calmly, melancholics are sensitive or introverted, and sanguines take things lightly\". Today Waldorf teachers may work with the notion of temperaments to differentiate their instruction. Seating arrangements and class activities may be planned taking into account the temperaments of the students but this is often not readily apparent to observers. Steiner also believed that teachers must consider their own temperament and be prepared to work with it positively in the classroom, that temperament is emergent in children, and that most people express a combination of temperaments rather than a pure single type.\n\nIn most Waldorf schools, pupils enter secondary education when they are about fourteen years old. Secondary education is provided by specialist teachers for each subject. The education focuses much more strongly on academic subjects, though students normally continue to take courses in art, music, and crafts. The curriculum is structured to foster pupils' intellectual understanding, independent judgment, and ethical ideals such as social responsibility, aiming to meet the developing capacity for abstract thought and conceptual judgment.\n\nIn the third developmental stage (14 years old and up), children in Waldorf programs are supposed to learn through their own thinking and judgment. Students are asked to understand abstract material and expected to have sufficient foundation and maturity to form conclusions using their own judgment. The intention of the third stage is to \"imbue children with a sense that the world is true\".\n\nThe overarching goals are to provide young people the basis on which to develop into free, morally responsible, and integrated individuals, with the aim of helping young people \"go out into the world as free, independent and creative beings\". No independent studies have been published as to whether or not Waldorf education achieves this aim.\n\nThe philosophical foundation of the Waldorf approach, anthroposophy, underpins its primary pedagogical goals: to provide an education that enables children to become free human beings, and to help children to incarnate their \"unfolding spiritual identity\", carried from the preceding spiritual existence, as beings of body, soul, and spirit in this lifetime. Educational researcher Martin Ashley suggests that the latter role would be problematic for secular teachers and parents in state schools, and the commitment to a spiritual background both of the child and the education has been problematic for some committed to a secular perspective.\n\nWhile anthroposophy underpins the curriculum design, pedagogical approach, and organizational structure, it is explicitly not taught within the school curriculum and studies have shown that Waldorf pupils have little awareness of it. Tensions may arise within the Waldorf community between the commitment to Steiner's original intentions, which has sometimes acted as a valuable anchor against following educational fads, and openness to new directions in education, such as the incorporation of new technologies or modern methods of accountability and assessment.\n\nWaldorf schools frequently have striking architecture, employing walls meeting at varied angles (not only perpendicularly) to achieve a more fluid, less boxed-in feeling to the space. The walls are often painted in subtle colors, often with a lazure technique, and include textured surfaces.\n\nThe schools primarily assess students through reports on individual academic progress and personal development. The emphasis is on characterization through qualitative description. Pupils' progress is primarily evaluated through portfolio work in academic blocks and discussion of pupils in teacher conferences. Standardized tests are rare, with the exception of examinations necessary for college entry taken during the secondary school years. Letter grades are generally not given until students enter high school at 14–15 years, as the educational emphasis is on children's holistic development, not solely their academic progress. Pupils are not normally asked to repeat years of elementary or secondary education.\n\nThough Waldorf schools are autonomous institutions not required to follow a prescribed curriculum (beyond those required by local governments) there are widely agreed upon guidelines for the Waldorf curriculum, supported by the schools' common principles. The schools offer a wide curriculum \"governed by close observation and recording of what content motivates children at different ages\" and including within it, for example, the English, Welsh and Northern Irish National Curriculum.\n\nThe main academic subjects are introduced through up to two-hour morning lesson blocks that last for several weeks. These lesson blocks are horizontally integrated at each grade level in that the topic of the block will be infused into many of the activities of the classroom and vertically integrated in that each subject will be revisited over the course of the education with increasing complexity as students develop their skills, reasoning capacities and individual sense of self. This has been described as a spiral curriculum.\n\nMany subjects and skills not considered core parts of mainstream schools, such as art, music, gardening, and mythology, are central to Waldorf education. Students learn a variety of fine and practical arts. Elementary students paint, draw, sculpt, knit, weave, and crochet. Older students build on these experiences and learn new skills such as pattern-making and sewing, wood and stone carving, metal work, book-binding, and doll or puppet making. Fine art instruction includes form drawing, sketching, sculpting, perspective drawing and other techniques.\n\nMusic instruction begins with singing in early childhood and choral instruction remains an important component through the end of high school. Pupils usually learn to play pentatonic flutes, recorders and/or lyres in the early elementary grades. Around age 9, diatonic recorders and orchestral instruments are introduced.\n\nCertain subjects are largely unique to the Waldorf schools. Foremost among these is eurythmy, a movement art usually accompanying spoken texts or music which includes elements of drama and dance and is designed to provide individuals and classes with a \"sense of integration and harmony\". Although found in other educational contexts, cooking, farming, and environmental and outdoor education have long been incorporated into the Waldorf curriculum. Other differences include: non-competitive games and free play in the younger years as opposed to athletics instruction; instruction in two foreign languages from the beginning of elementary school; and an experiential-phenomenological approach to science whereby students observe and depict scientific concepts in their own words and drawings rather than encountering the ideas first through a textbook.\n\nThe Waldorf curriculum has always incorporated multiple intelligences.\n\nThe scientific methodology of modern Waldorf schools utilizes a so-called \"phenomenological approach\" to science education employing an exemplary methodology of inquiry-based learning aiming to \"strengthen the interest and ability to observe\" in pupils. The main aim is to cultivate a sense of \"wholeness\" in regards to the human's place in nature. Several empirical studies have noted how this method appears effective and even exemplary when evaluated against age-matched peers using the internationally recognized PISA test of 15-year-old students in mathematics and science. \n\nOther experts have called into question the quality of this phenomenological approach if it fails to educate Waldorf students on basic tenets of scientific fact. One study conducted by California State University at Sacramento researches outlined numerous theories and ideas prevalent throughout Waldorf curricula that were patently pseudoscientific and steeped in magical thinking. These included the idea that animals evolved from humans, that human spirits are physically incarnated into \"soul qualities that manifested themselves into various animal forms,\" that the current geological formations on Earth have evolved through so-called \"Lemurian\" and \"Atlantiean\" epochs, and that the four kingdoms of nature are \"mineral, plant, animal, and man.\" All of these are directly contradicted by mainstream scientific knowledge and have no basis in any form of conventional scientific study. Contradictory notions found in Waldorf textbooks are distinct from factual inaccuracies occasionally found in modern public school textbooks, as the inaccuracies in the latter are of a specific and minute nature that results from the progress of science. The latter (those inaccuracies present in Waldorf textbooks), however, are the result of a mode of thinking that has no valid basis in reason or logic.\n\nOne study of the science curriculum compared a group of American Waldorf school students to American public school students on three different test variables. Two tests measured verbal and non-verbal logical reasoning and the third was an international TIMSS test. The TIMSS test covered scientific understanding of magnetism. The researchers found that Waldorf school students scored higher than both the public school students and the national average on the TIMSS test while scoring the same as the public school students on the logical reasoning tests. However, when the logical reasoning tests measured students' understanding of part-to-whole relations, the Waldorf students also outperformed the public school students. The authors of the study noted the Waldorf students' enthusiasm for science, but viewed the science curriculum as \"somewhat old-fashioned and out of date, as well as including some doubtful scientific material\". Educational researchers Phillip and Glenys Woods, who reviewed this study, criticized the authors' implication of an \"unresolved conflict\": that it is possible for supposedly inaccurate science to lead to demonstrably better scientific understanding.\n\nIn 2008, Stockholm University terminated its Waldorf teacher training courses. In a statement the university said \"the courses did not encompass sufficient subject theory and a large part of the subject theory that is included is not founded on any scientific base\". The dean, Stefan Nordlund, stated \"the syllabus contains literature which conveys scientific inaccuracies that are worse than woolly; they are downright dangerous\".\n\nBecause they view human interaction as the essential basis for younger children's learning and growth, Waldorf schools view computer technology as being first useful to children in the early teen years, after they have mastered \"fundamental, time-honoured ways of discovering information and learning, such as practical experiments and books\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Waldorf schools are granted an exemption by the Department for Education (DfE) from the requirement to teach ICT as part of Foundation Stage education (ages 3–5). Education researchers John Siraj-Blatchford and David Whitebread praised the [DfE] for making this exemption, highlighting Waldorf education's emphasis on simplicity of resources and the way the education cultivates the imagination.\n\nWaldorf schools have been very popular with parents working in the technology sector, including those from some of the most advanced technology firms. In one Silicon Valley school, \"three-quarters of the students have parents with a strong high-tech connection\". A number of technologically oriented parents from the school expressed their conviction that younger students do not need the exposure to computers and technology, but benefit from creative aspects of the education; one Google executive was quoted as saying \"I fundamentally reject the notion you need technology aids in grammar school.\"\n\nWaldorf education aims to educate children about a wide range of religious traditions without favoring any one of these. One of Steiner's primary aims was to establish a spiritual yet nondenominational setting for children from all backgrounds that recognized the value of role models drawn from a wide range of literary and historical traditions in developing children's fantasy and moral imaginations. Indeed, for Steiner, education was an activity which fosters the human being's connection to the divine and is thus inherently religious.\n\nWaldorf schools were historically \"Christian based and theistically oriented\", as they expand into different cultural settings they are adapting to \"a truly pluralistic spirituality\". Waldorf theories and practices are often modified from their European and Christian roots to meet the historical and cultural traditions of the local community. Examples of such adaptation include the Waldorf schools in Palestine and Japan, which celebrate festivals drawn from these cultures, and classes in the Milwaukee Urban Waldorf school, which have adopted African American and Native American traditions. Such festivals, as well as assemblies generally, which play an important role in Waldorf schools, generally center on classes presenting their work.\n\nReligion classes, universally absent from American Waldorf schools, are a mandatory offering in some German federal states, whereby in Waldorf schools each religious denomination provides its own teachers for the classes, and a non-denominational religion class is also offered. In the United Kingdom, public Waldorf schools are not categorized as \"Faith schools\".\n\nTom Stehlik places Waldorf education in a humanistic tradition, and contrasts its philosophically grounded approach to \"value-neutral\" secular state schooling systems.\n\nWaldorf teacher education programs offer courses in child development, the methodology of Waldorf teaching, academic subjects appropriate to the future teachers' chosen specialty, and the study of pedagogical texts and other works by Steiner. For early childhood and elementary school teachers, the training includes considerable artistic work in storytelling, movement, painting, music, and handwork.\n\nOne of Waldorf education's central premises is that all educational and cultural institutions should be self-governing and should grant teachers a high degree of creative autonomy within the school; this is based upon the conviction that a holistic approach to education aiming at the development of free individuals can only be successful when based on a school form that expresses these same principles. Most Waldorf schools are not directed by a principal or head teacher, but rather by a number of groups, including:\n\nParents are encouraged to take an active part in non-curricular aspects of school life. Waldorf schools have been found to create effective adult learning communities.\n\nThere are coordinating bodies for Waldorf education at both the national (e.g. the \"Association of Waldorf Schools of North America\" and the \"Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship\" in the UK and Ireland) and international level (e.g. International Association for Waldorf Education and The European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education (ECSWE)). These organizations certify the use of the registered names \"Waldorf\" and \"Steiner school\" and offer accreditations, often in conjunction with regional independent school associations.\n\nThe first US Waldorf-inspired public school, the Yuba River Charter School in California, opened in 1994. The Waldorf public school movement is currently expanding rapidly; while in 2010, there were twelve Waldorf-inspired public schools in the United States, by 2018 there were 53 such schools.\n\nMost Waldorf-inspired schools in the United States are elementary schools established as either magnet or charter schools. The first Waldorf-inspired high school was launched in 2008 with assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. While these schools follow a similar developmental approach as the independent schools, Waldorf-inspired schools must demonstrate achievement on standardized tests in order to continue receiving public funding. Studies of standardized test scores suggest that students at Waldorf-inspired schools tend to score below their peers in the earliest grades and catch up or surpass their peers by middle school. One study found that students at Waldorf-inspired schools watch less television and spend more time engaging in creative activities or spending time with friends. Public Waldorf schools' need to demonstrate achievement through standardized test scores has encouraged increased use of textbooks and expanded instructional time for academic subjects.\n\nA legal challenge alleging that California school districts' Waldorf-inspired schools violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article IX of the California Constitution was dismissed on its merits in 2005 and on appeal in 2007 and 2012.\n\nThe first state-funded Steiner-Waldorf school in the United Kingdom, the Steiner Academy Hereford, opened in 2008. Since then, Steiner academies have opened in Frome, Exeter and Bristol as part of the government-funded free schools programme.\n\nIn November 2012, BBC News broadcast an item about accusations that the establishment of a state-funded Waldorf School in Frome was a misguided use of public money. The broadcast reported that concerns were being raised about Rudolf Steiner's beliefs, stating he \"believed in reincarnation and said it was related to race, with black (\"schwarz\") people being the least spiritually developed, and white (\"weiß\") people the most.\" In 2007, the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education (ECSWE) issued a statement, \"Waldorf schools against discrimination\", which said in part, \"Waldorf schools do not select, stratify or discriminate amongst their pupils, but consider all human beings to be free and equal in dignity and rights, independent of ethnicity, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, and political or other convictions. Anthroposophy, upon which Waldorf education is founded, stands firmly against all forms of racism and nationalism.\"\n\nThe British Humanist Association critiqued a reference book used to train teachers in Steiner academies for suggesting that the heart is sensitive to emotions and promoting homeopathy, while critiquing Darwinism for purportedly reductionist thinking and Victorian ethics. Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine, suggested that Waldorf schools \"have an anti-science agenda\". A United Kingdom Department for Education spokeswoman responded that \"no state school is allowed to teach homeopathy as scientific fact\" and that free schools \"must demonstrate that they will provide a broad and balanced curriculum\".\n\nAustralia has \"Steiner streams\" incorporated into a small number of existing government schools in some states; in addition, independent Steiner-Waldorf schools receive partial government funding. The majority of Steiner-Waldorf schools in New Zealand receive a small amount of state funding. In the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec and Alberta, all private schools receive partial state funding.\n\nThe first Steiner school in Russia was established in 1992 in Moscow. That school is now an award-winning government-funded school with over 650 students offering classes for kindergarten and years 1 to 11 (the Russian education system is an eleven year system). There are 18 Waldorf schools in Russia and 30 kindergartens. Some are government funded (with no fees) and some are privately funded (with fees for students). As well as five Waldorf schools in Moscow, there are also Waldorf schools in Saint Petersburg, Irkutsk, Jaroslawl, Kaluga, Samara, Schukowskij, Smolensk, Tomsk, Ufa, Vladimir, Voronezh, and Zelenograd. The Association of Russian Waldorf Schools was founded in 1995 and now has 21 members.\n\nWaldorf-inspired home schools typically obtain their program information through informal parent groups, online, or by purchasing a curriculum. Waldorf homeschooling groups are not affiliated with the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA), which represents independent schools and it is unknown how many home schools use a Waldorf-inspired curriculum.\n\nEducationalist Sandra Chistolini suggests that parents offer their children Waldorf-inspired homeschooling because \"the frustration and boredom some children feel in school are eliminated and replaced with constant attention to the needs of childhood [and] connections between content and the real world.\"\n\nSteiner's belief that all people are imbued with a spiritual core has fueled Waldorf schools' social mission. The schools have always been coeducational and open to children of all social classes. They were designed from the beginning to be comprehensive, 12-year schools under the direction of their own teachers, rather than the state or other external authorities, all radical principles when Steiner first articulated them.\n\nSocial renewal and transformation remain primary goals for Waldorf schools, which seek to cultivate pupils' sense of social responsibility. Studies suggest that this is successful; Waldorf pupils have been found to be more interested in and engaged with social and moral questions and to have more positive attitudes than students from mainstream schools, demonstrating activism and self-confidence and feeling empowered to forge their own futures.\n\nWaldorf schools build close learning communities, founded on the shared values of its members, in ways that can lead to transformative learning experiences that allow all participants, including parents, to become more aware of their own individual path, but which at times also risk becoming exclusive. Reports from small-scale studies suggest that there are lower levels of harassment and bullying in Waldorf schools and that European Waldorf students have extremely lower rates of xenophobia and gender stereotypes than students in any other type of schools. Betty Reardon, a professor and peace researcher, gives Waldorf schools as an example of schools that follow a philosophy based on peace and tolerance.\n\nMany private Waldorf schools experience a tension between these social goals and the way tuition fees act as a barrier to access to the education by less well-off families. Schools have attempted to improve access for a wider range of income groups by charging lower fees than comparable independent schools, by offering a sliding scale of fees, and/or by seeking state support.\n\nWaldorf schools have linked polarized communities in a variety of settings.\n\n\nWaldorf education also has links with UNESCO. In 2008, 24 Waldorf schools in 15 countries were members of the UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network. The Friends of Waldorf Education is an organization whose purpose is to support, finance and advise the Waldorf movement worldwide, particularly in disadvantaged settings.\n\nAlthough studies about Waldorf education tend to be small-scale and vary in national context, a recent independent comprehensive review of the literature concluded there is evidence that Waldorf education encourages academic achievement as well as \"creative, social and other capabilities important to the holistic growth of a person.\"\n\nIn comparison to state school pupils, European Waldorf students are significantly more enthusiastic about learning, report having more fun and being less bored in school, view their school environments as pleasant and supportive places where they are able to discover their personal academic strengths, and have more positive views of the future. Twice as many Waldorf students as state school pupils report having good relationships with teachers; they also report significantly fewer ailments such as headaches, stomach aches, and disrupted sleep.\n\nA 2007 German study found that an above-average number of Waldorf students become teachers, doctors, engineers, scholars of the humanities, and scientists. Studies of Waldorf students' artistic capacities found that they averaged higher scores on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking Ability, drew more accurate, detailed, and imaginative drawings, and were able to develop richer images than comparison groups.\n\nSome observers have noted that Waldorf educators tend to be more concerned to address the needs of weaker students who need support than they are to meet the needs of talented students who could benefit from advanced work.\n\nProfessor of Educational Psychology Clifford Mayes considered that \"Waldorf students learn in sequences and paces that are developmentally appropriate, aesthetically stimulating, emotionally supportive, and ecologically sensitive.\" Profs. of Education Timothy Leonard and Peter Willis stated that Waldorf education \"cultivates the imagination of the young to provide them a firm emotional foundation upon which to build a sound intellectual life\".\n\nProfessor of Education Bruce Uhrmacher considers Steiner's view on education worthy of investigation for those seeking to improve public schooling, saying the approach serves as a reminder that \"holistic education is rooted in a cosmology that posits a fundamental unity to the universe and as such ought to take into account interconnections among the purpose of schooling, the nature of the growing child, and the relationships between the human being and the universe at large\", and that a curriculum need not be technocratic, but may equally well be arts-based.\n\nDavid Elkind names Rudolf Steiner as one of the \"giants of early-childhood development\" and describes activities for young children in a Waldorf school as \"social\", \"holistic\", and \"collaborative\", as well as reflecting the principle that \"early education must start with the child, not with the subject matter to be taught\".\n\nThomas Nielsen, Assistant Professor at the University of Canberra's Education Department, considers the imaginative teaching approaches used in Waldorf education (drama, exploration, storytelling, routine, arts, discussion and empathy) to be effective stimulators of spiritual-aesthetic, intellectual and physical development, expanding \"the concept of holistic and imaginative education\" and recommends these to mainstream educators.\n\nAndreas Schleicher, international coordinator of the PISA studies, commented on the \"high degree of congruence between what the world demands of people, and what Waldorf schools develop in their pupils\", placing a high value on creatively and productively applying knowledge to new realms. This enables \"deep learning\" that goes beyond studying for the next test. Deborah Meier, principal of Mission Hill School and MacArthur grant recipient, whilst having some \"quibbles\" about the Waldorf schools, stated: \"The adults I know who have come out of Waldorf schools are extraordinary people. That education leaves a strong mark of thoroughness, carefulness, and thoughtfulness.\"\n\nRobert Peterkin, Director of the Urban Superintendents Program at Harvard's Graduate School of Education and former Superintendent of Milwaukee Public Schools during a period when Milwaukee funded a public Waldorf school, considers Waldorf education a \"healing education\" whose underlying principles are appropriate for educating all children.\n\nWaldorf education has also been studied as an example of educational neuroscience ideas in practice.\n\nIn 2000, educational scholar Heiner Ullrich wrote that intensive study of Steiner's pedagogy had been in progress in educational circles in Germany since about 1990 and that positions were \"highly controversial: they range from enthusiastic support to destructive criticism\". In 2008, the same scholar wrote that Waldorf schools have \"not stirred comparable discussion or controversy...those interested in the Waldorf School today ... generally tend to view this school form first and foremost as a representative of internationally recognized models of applied classic reform pedagogy\" and that critics tend to focus on what they see as Steiner's \"occult neo-mythology of education\" and to fear the risks of indoctrination in a worldview school, but lose an \"unprejudiced view of the varied practice of the Steiner schools\". Ullrich himself considers that the schools successfully foster dedication, openness, and a love for other human beings, for nature, and for the inanimate world.\n\nProfessor of Comparative Education describes Waldorf education as embodying original pedagogical ideas and presenting exemplary organizational capabilities.\n\nA UK Department for Education and Skills report suggested that Waldorf and state schools could learn from each other's strengths: in particular, that state schools could benefit from Waldorf education's early introduction and approach to modern foreign languages; combination of block (class) and subject teaching for younger children; development of speaking and listening through an emphasis on oral work; good pacing of lessons through an emphasis on rhythm; emphasis on child development guiding the curriculum and examinations; approach to art and creativity; attention given to teachers’ reflective activity and heightened awareness (in collective child study for example); and collegial structure of leadership and management, including collegial study. Aspects of mainstream practice which could inform good practice in Waldorf schools included: management skills and ways of improving organizational and administrative efficiency; classroom management; work with secondary-school age children; and assessment and record keeping.\n\nAmerican state and private schools are drawing on Waldorf education\"less in whole than in part\"in expanding numbers. Professor of Education Elliot Eisner sees Waldorf education exemplifying embodied learning and fostering a more balanced educational approach than American public schools achieve. Ernest Boyer, former president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching commended the significant role the arts play throughout Waldorf education as a model for other schools to follow. Waldorf schools have been described as establishing \"genuine community\" and contrasted to mainstream schools, which have been described as \"residential areas partitioned by bureaucratic authorities for educational purposes\".\n\nMany elements of Waldorf pedagogy have been used in all Finnish schools for many years.\n\nAshley described seven principal ways Waldorf education differed from mainstream approaches: its method of working from the whole to the parts, its attentiveness to child development, its goal of freedom, the deep relationships of teachers to students, the emphasis on experiencing oral traditions, the role of ritual and routine (e.g. welcoming students with a handshake, the use of opening and closing verses, and yearly festivals), the role arts and creativity play, and the Goetheanistic approach to science.\n\nIn states such as Texas, Vermont, Washington and California – where vaccine exemption is legal – Waldorf schools were reported to have a high rate of vaccine exemption within their student populations. A 2010 report by the UK Government noted that Steiner schools should be considered \"high risk populations\" and \"unvaccinated communities\" with respect to children's risks of catching measles and contributing to outbreaks. On November 19, 2018, the BBC reported there was an outbreak of chickenpox in 36 students at the Asheville Waldorf School located in North Carolina. Out of 152 students at the school, 110 had not received a vaccine for the varicella virus (chickenpox). Chickenpox can be life-threatening to individuals with weak immune systems. The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommend that all healthy children 12 months of age and older get the chickenpox vaccine.\n\nStudies have found that Waldorf students have significantly lower incidence of allergies, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and sleep disturbances than state (US: public) school pupils.\n\nRacist attitudes and behaviour have been reported in particular Waldorf schools, including teachers reportedly expressing a view that individuals reincarnate through various races. Newspaper articles have reported claims that Steiner believed in a hierarchy of races, with the white race at the top, and associated intelligence with having blonde hair and blue eyes.\n\nWaldorf associations has rejected adhering to or tolerating racism.\n\n\nNote: All of Steiner's lectures on Waldorf education are available in PDF form at this research site\n\n\nRegional associations of schools \n"}
