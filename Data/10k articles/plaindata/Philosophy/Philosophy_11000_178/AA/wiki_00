It was designed by and built by Marie Byles during 1937. It is also known as Ahimsa, The Hut of Happy Omen and Sentosa. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.\n\nIn 1935 Marie Beuzeville Byles purchased of land on the outskirts of Cheltenham. A few years later she designed and built a small one-bedroom house. Perched on a large rock and built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber, random rubble and with a roof glazed terracotta the structure melds well with its bushland setting. Except for a vegetable garden near the house, the remainder of the site was left in its native state.\n\nMarie Byles shared with Walter Burley Griffin the objective of integrating structures with the natural landscape and vegetation. Although there is no documented record to prove that Griffin's work influenced her, it seems highly likely that she was favorably impressed by the houses he designed for her friends and sought to incorporate some of their qualities into \"Ahimsa\".\n\nMarie Byles was not an architect and, not surprisingly, her work as a designer is less accomplished than Griffin's. Some specific differences are that he preferred flat roofs while her house has a more conventional terracotta pitched roof; Griffin experimented with prefabricated building materials where as Marie used fibro (even in the 1930s this was a very conventional material); but they shared the goal of building small scale, understated and low cost houses which fitted unobtrusively into the Australian bush.\n\nBorn in England in 1900, Byles studied law at The University of Sydney graduating in 1924 to become the first woman in NSW to practice as a solicitor. She was a remarkable woman who was passionately involved in preserving wilderness areas. She was a keen mountaineer and travelled to Norway, China, Canada and New Zealand in search of unclimbed peaks. In 1938 she led an all women team in an attempt to scale a peak, Mount Sansate in Western China. The expedition failed due to adverse weather conditions. In Australia her determined, active nature led her to become an early lobbyist for what we now know as national parks.\n\nByles was one of the early members of The Sydney Bushwalker's Club and was responsible for drawing the attention of the NSW Lands Department to the wilderness area around Maitland Bay on the central coast north of Sydney. She was appointed Trustee of Bouddi National Park and organised working bees amongst the bushwalkers to maintain the area.\n\nThe Beecroft-Cheltenham Civic Trust was established by her as a \"non-progress association\" which worked for the closure of roads in the area and the planting of native trees and shrubs. She worked with the Bradley sisters (Joan and Eileen) to rid the bush of weeds around her property, and practiced organic gardening techniques all her life. She always slept outside on an open verandah, never drove a car, and walked everywhere, usually with a rucksack. \n\nIn 1941 while on a bushwalk, where one of the members was taken ill, Byles shouldered his pack, his carriers and her own, and in consequence her feet were permanently damaged. From that time onwards she could manage short bushwalks only, and mountain climbing became impossible. Always interested in eastern religions, in particular the ideas of Gandhi, her disability gave her more time to research and write. In the late 1940s she took up medication and later traveled to India and Burma to undergo instruction. In the 1950s Byles built a hut in her garden called the Hut of Happy Omen, which she made available to meditation groups. By this time she had adopted the most ascetic form of South East Asian Buddhism.\n\nThe name Ahimsa is derived from Gandhi's teachings and means peace or non-violence.\n\nOne night in 1966, while sleeping on her open verandah Byles was physically assaulted and sustained serious injuries including a fractured skull. She declined to charge her assailant. After a period of convalescence she returned to live alone on the estate still sleeping out in the open air. Miss Byles gave up her legal practice in 1970, four years after the attack.\n\nIn 1970 Miss Byles gave the property to the National Trust of Australia, remaining in residence as Honorary Curator. Concerned that the one-bedroom house might be too small for her successor, she developed a plan for an addition comprising a one room detached pavilion.\n\nMarie Byles died at \"Ahimsa\" on 21 November 1979.\n\nAhimsa has an area of and is contiguous with a much larger area of bushland, Pennant Hills Park, to the north. The vegetation is described as dry sclerophyll (hard leafed) bushland on Sydney sandstone and is typical of the flora associated with the Northern Hills District of Sydney.\n\nThe northwest, northeast and part of the southeast boundaries are delimited by unmade road reserves, Malton Road (part) and Lyne Road (also known as Cobram Road). It is located on a small ridge, formerly and unofficially called Native Rose Ridge, on the inside of a sharp curve in a creek draining the Beecroft Cheltenham area. This creek subsequently joins Devlins Creek. The upper parts of \"Ahimsa\" are relatively flat but the groundslopes off in a series of small Hawkesbury Sandstone cliffs in a north by north-west direction to the fire trail and towards Pennant Hills Park. There are many flat sandstone outcrops and small cliffs.\n\nThe buildings include \"Ahimsa\", The Hut of Happy Omen, the toilets, which were all built before the land was sold to the Trust, Sentosa, a detached bedsitter which was approved in principle in November 1975. A carport was built onto The Hut in 1977. \"Ahimsa\" is a small one-bedroom house built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber and random rubble with a pitched roof of glazed terracotta. There is a brick fireplace in the living room and a large north-facing open verandah looking over the gully. The Hut of Happy Omen is basically an open shed built of unpainted fibro with a roof of corrugated fibro. At some time it has been extended to incorporate a kitchenette and a shower stall. Sentosa is an open plan bedsitter also constructed of fibro with a skillion roof of corrugated fibro.\n\nMarie Byles' design principles are best expressed in this quotation from her: 'No Painting whatever anywhere - Any woodwork to be treated with linseed raw oil (saves unkeep): External walls are to be fibro; Corrugated (sic) fibro (long experience has shown fiber to be lasting, with no upkeep).'\n\nPaths were made by volunteers and Marie Byles' bushwalking friends.\n\nAs at 27 June 2000, the physical condition was good.\n\nAn absorption trench was constructed in 1975 to contain surface run off from properties adjacent to \"Ahimsa\" as the Trust was afraid that excessive run off would encourage weed growth.\n\nOne cave has been altered and an attractive two metre high Hawkesbury Sandstone retaining wall was constructed many years ago near the path from the northern gate.\n\nDespite her wish that no plants foreign to it, even from other parts of Australia, should be planted several native plants not indigenous to Ahimsa have been planted.\n\nAs at 27 January 2010, \"Ahimsa\" and surrounding landscape stand as a testimony to Marie Byles' life and vision as a feminist and a conservationist. These subjects are of increasing interest to contemporary Australians and are helping to share our culture. Aesthetically, the small scale understated buildings fit unobtrusively into the Australian bushland. The peaceful atmosphere of the property gives visitors an insight into the character of the woman who gave the property to the National Trust. The bushland and topographical features, and the property's close proximity to the state reserve next door, form an intact natural area indicative of the appearance of this area prior to human occupation.\n\n\"Ahimsa\" was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nThe history of the property is very much the culmination of the ideology practiced by Marie Byles. Marie Byles has been one of the foremost protagonists of national parks as a mechanism to conserve nature. She was one of the early members of Sydney Bushwalkers' Club joining it in 1929 being a keen bushwalker. She was also the first woman lawyer in Australia, which gave her a certain amount of confidence. This confidence coupled with her interest and dedication to the cause of nature conservation became an asset to the nature conservation lobby in Australia. The creation of the Bouddi National Park is identified as a result of the unrelenting efforts by Marie Byles.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nThe small scale understated buildings fit unobtrusively into the Australian bushland.

{"id": "23156688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23156688", "title": "Al-Hajj Salim Suwari", "text": "Al-Hajj Salim Suwari\n\nSheikh Al-Hajj Salim Suwari was a 13th-century West African Soninke \"karamogo\" (Islamic scholar) who focused on the responsibilities of Muslims minorities residing in a non-Muslim society. He formulated an important theological rationale for peaceful coexistence with the non-Muslim ruling classes called the Suwarian tradition, which survives to this day despite the pressures of modernism.\n\nThe spread of Islam throughout West Africa was a concomitant of long-distance trade by Mande-speaking Muslim traders and craftsmen known as \"Dyula\". Since Muslims in these regions lived in the \"dar al-kufr\" (House of Unbelievers), they needed legitimization for trading with unbelievers – an activity viewed with disdain by some North African Muslim jurists. Sheikh Al-Hajj Salim Suwari focused on providing a solution to this and other related issues. Hailing from the Sahelian town of Ja (Dia) in the core Mali area, Al-Hajj Salim Suwari had performed the pilgrimage (\"hajj\") to Mecca several times and devoted his intellectual career to developing an understanding of the faith that would assist Muslim minorities in residing in \"pagan\" lands (\"dar al-kufr\").\n\nSheikh Suwari formulated the obligations of Dyula minorities residing across West Africa into something dubbed the \"Suwarian tradition\". It stressed the need for Muslims to coexist peaceably with unbelievers, and so justified a separation of religion and politics. The Suwarian prescription for peaceful coexistence involved seven main precepts: (a) unbelievers are ignorant, not wicked: (b) it is Allah's design that some people remain ignorant longer than others: (c) Muslims must nurture their own learning and piety and thereby furnish good examples to non-Muslims around them, so they will know how to behave when they are converted: (d) they could accept the jurisdiction of non-Muslim authorities, as long as they had the necessary protection and conditions to practice the faith in accordance with the \"sunnah\" of the Prophet Muhammed. In this teaching Suwari followed a strong predilection in Islamic political philosophy for any government, albeit non-Muslim or tyrannical, as opposed to none: (e) The military \"jihad\" was a resort only in self-defense if the faithful were threatened. (f) Suwari discouraged \"dawah\" (proselytizing), instead contending that Allah would bring non-Muslims to Islam in His own way; it was not a Muslim's responsibility to decide when ignorance should give way to belief: (g) Muslims must ensure that, by their commitment to education and learning, they keep their observance of the Law free from error.\n\nSuwarians articulate an ideological level, without straying from orthodoxy, the peculiarities of the situation in which Muslims found themselves in the period following the collapse of imperial Mali. Described by author Nehemia Levtzion as \"accommodationist Islam\", it created a praxis to enable Muslims to function within essentially non-Muslim societies, accommodating their interests to those of the wider society while at the same time combating erosion of their distinctive Muslim identity. Since their form of Islam was capable of accommodating traditional cults, the \"dyula\" often served as priests, soothsayers and counselors at the courts of animist rulers.\n\nThe Suwarian tradition was a realistic rationale for Muslims living in the woodland and forest regions of West Africa over the past five or six centuries. It was not without tension that came in part from the missionary dimension of Islam itself; it was challenged by Muslim reformers in recent centuries. Its neat compartments were obscured by occasional intermarriage between merchants and rulers. But the Suwarian tradition was resilient and useful, and it is probably similar to the positions of many African Muslim communities who found themselves in situations of inferior numbers and force, took advantage of their networks for trade, and enjoyed good relations with their \"pagan\" hosts.\n\nAl-Hajj Salim's scholarly activity was centered on the town of Jagha in the \"bilâd as-sûdân\" (Western Sudan), but his influence was greatest along the southern fringes of the Manding trade network, and corresponds to the period of the disintegration of the old Malian empire. From the accounts of Ivor Wilks and Lamin Sanneh it is difficult to date the lifespan of Salim Suwari. Wilks dates his life around the late 15th century, while Sanneh thinks he lived two centuries earlier, around the late 13th century. Differences notwithstanding, Wilks intimates that his teachings were nurtured by his followers in Niger, Senegal and middle section of the Niger river from where they conveyed the tradition to the Voltaic region in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Wilks describes it as \"pacifistic and quietist in content,\" implying a tolerant and respectful approach to non-Muslims, while in the words of Sanneh, one of the imperatives of the tradition is its \"travel or mobility (\"al-safar\") involving the penetration of distant lands for the purposes of religion.\"\n\nThe Suwari school of thought was a scholarly discipline that enjoyed a substantial number of \"ulema\" as well as a long history among West African Muslims. Ivor Wilks observes that \"almost all of the \"asanid\", scholarly chains owned by Muslim scholars of Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso converge on the highly revered figure of Kong Liman Abbas\" whose own chain can be traced backwards \"in twelve teaching generations to Al-Hajj Salim Suwari.\" Wilks traces a long chain of scholars and students that passed through the tradition of Suwari, ranging from Saghanugu Liman of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), Ibrahim bin al-Mustapha of Wa, Ghana, Al-Amin bin Muhammad al-Abyad Kulibali of Kong, Côte d'Ivoire to Sa’id bin Abd al-Qadir, of Wa.\n\nIt may not be stretching the point to suggest that the same tradition of \"ulema\", especially the Kamaghaté, Wattara of the Soninke Wangara patronym, were the influential Muslims and traders in Kumasi in the years before the late 1890s when the Hausa Muslims migrated in large waves to Kumasi after the collapse of Salaga. It is probable that the Suwari tradition swept through greater parts of the Ghanaian Muslim communities – Wenchi, Wa, Gonja, Dagbon, and among some of the Kumasi Muslims, excluding the Hausas and other Muslims of Nigerian origin. And His great grandson Shiek Alhaj Baba Suwari of Wenchi in Ghana also contributed to massive spread of Islam in the sub-region.\n\nThe Jakhanke people also trace their spiritual ancestry to al-Hajj Salim Suwari, and since they believed that the spirits of dead saints kept guard over their followers and interceded for them before Allah, the graves of al-Hajj Salim and other great teachers were centers for pilgrimage.\n\n"}

{"id": "980538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=980538", "title": "Ali Hujwiri", "text": "Ali Hujwiri\n\nAbu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. ʿUthmān b. ʿAlī al-Ghaznawī al-Jullābī al-Hujwīrī (c. 1009-1072/77), known as ʿAlī al-Hujwīrī or al-Hujwīrī (also spelt Hajweri, Hajveri, or Hajvery) for short, or reverentially as Shaykh Syed ʿAlī al-Hujwīrī or as Dātā Ganj Bakhsh by Muslims of the Indian subcontinent, was an 11th-century Ghaznian-Persian Sunni Muslim mystic, theologian, and preacher who became famous for composing the \"Kashf al-maḥjūb\" (\"Unveiling of the Hidden\"), which is considered the \"earliest formal treatise\" on Sufism in Persian. Ali Hujwiri is believed to have contributed \"significantly\" to the spread of Islam in South Asia through his preaching, with one historian describing him as \"one of the most important figures to have spread Islam in the Indian subcontinent.\" \n\nIn the present day, Ali Hujwiri is venerated as the patron saint of Lahore, Pakistan by the traditional Sunni Muslims of the area. He is, moreover, one of the most widely venerated saints in the entire Indian subcontinent, and his tomb-shrine in Lahore, popularly known as Data Darbar, is one of the most frequented shrines in South Asia. At present, it is Pakistan's largest shrine \"in numbers of annual visitors and in the size of the shrine complex,\" and, having been nationalized in 1960, is managed today by the Department of Awqaf and Religious Affairs of the Punjab. The mystic himself, meanwhile, continues to remain a \"household name\" in the daily Islam of both India and Pakistan. In 2016, the Government of Pakistan declared 21 November to be a public holiday for the commemoration of the commencement of Ali Hujwiri's three-day death anniversary.\n\nAli Hujwiri was born in Ghazni, in present-day Afghanistan, in around 1009 to Uthman ibn Ali or Bu Ali. He is a direct descendant of Prophet Muhammad through his father who was a direct descendant of Al-Imam Hasan ibn Ali. His genealogical chain goes back eight generations to Ali.\nAccording to the autobiographical information recorded in his own \"Kashf al-maḥjūb\", it is evident that Ali Hujwiri travelled \"widely through the Ghaznavid Empire and beyond, spending considerable time in Baghdad, Nishapur, and Damascus, where he met many of the pre-eminent Ṣūfīs of his time.\" In matters of jurisprudence, he received training in the Hanafi rite of orthodox Sunni law under various teachers. As for his Sufic training, he was linked through his teacher al-Khuttalī to al-Husrī, Abu Bakr Shibli (d. 946), and Junayd of Baghdad (d. 910). For a short period of time, the mystic is believed to have lived in Iraq, where he first became wealthy but late fell into debt. His brief marriage during this period of time is said to have been unhappy. Eventually, Ali Hujwiri settled in Lahore, where he died with the reputation of a renowned preacher and teacher. His last few years, however, were not free of struggle, as he was imprisoned for some time for \"the lack of the books he had left at Ghazni.\" After his death, Ali Hujwiri was unanimously regarded as a great saint by popular acclaim.\n\nAli Hujwiri described the first caliph of Islam Abu Bakr (d. 634) as \"the Greatest Truthful,\" and deemed him \"the leader (\"imām\") of all the folk of this Path.\" Eulogizing Abu Bakr's piety, Ali Hujwiri praised him for how \"he gave away all his wealth and his clients, and clad himself in a woolen garment, and came to the Messenger Muhammad \" and stated elsewhere that he \"is placed by the Sufi shaykhs at the head of those who have adopted the contemplative life.\" In conclusion, Ali Hujwiri stated: \"The whole sect of Sufis have made him their patron in stripping themselves of worldly things, in fixity, in eager desire for poverty, and in longing to renounce authority. He is the leader of the Muslims in general, and of the Sufis in particular.\"\n\nAli Hujwiri described the second caliph of Islam Umar (d. 644) as one \"specially distinguished by sagacity and resolution,\" and said that \"the Sufis make him their model in wearing a patched garment and rigorously performing the duties of religion.\" He further praised Umar for his \"very exalted station\" in combining a life of worldly duties with intense and consistent spiritual devotion.\nRegarding the third of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs of the early Islamic community, Uthman (d. 656), Ali Hujwiri stated that the \"Sufis take Uthman as their exemplar in sacrificing life and property, in resigning their affairs to God, and in sincere devotion.\"\n\nWith respect to the fourth of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs of Islam, Ali (d. 661), Ali Hujwiri stated: \"His renown and rank in this Path were very high. He explained the principles of Divine Truth with exceeding subtlety... Ali is a model for the Sufis in respect to the truths of outward expressions and the subtleties of inward meanings, the stripping of one's self of all property either of this world or of the next, and consideration of the Divine Providence.\" He also approvingly cited Junayd of Baghdad's saying: \"Ali is our Shaykh as regards the principles and as regards the endurance of affliction.\"\n\nAccording to Ali Hujwiri, purely secular dancing \"has no foundation either in the religious law of Islam or in the path of Sufism, because all reasonable men agree that it is a diversion when it is in earnest, and an impropriety when it is in jest.\" As such, he censured \"all the traditions cited in its favour\" as \"worthless.\" As for the legitimate ecstatic experiences of some Sufis, whose bodies convulsed when their \"heart [throbbed] with exhilaration and rapture\" on account of their intense love of God, Ali Hujwiri declared that these movements only outwardly resembled dancing and opined that \"those who call it 'dancing' are utterly wrong. It is a state that cannot be explained in words: 'without experience no knowledge.'\"\n\nRegarding Abu Hanifa (d. 772), the traditionally recognized founder of the Hanafi school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, Ali Hujwiri stated: \"He is the Imām of Imāms (lit. 'Leader of Leaders') and the exemplar of the Sunnis.\"\nRegarding Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855), the traditionally recognized founder of the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, Ali Hujwiri stated: \"He was distinguished by devoutness and piety, and was the guardian of the Traditions of the Messenger. Sufis of all sects regard him as blessed. He associated with great shaykhs ... his miracles were manifest and his intelligence sound. The doctrines attributed to him today by certain anthropomorphists are inventions and forgeries; he is to be acquitted of all notions of that sort. He had a firm belief in the principles of religion, and his creed was approved by all the theologians... He is clear of all [the slander] that is alleged against him.\"\n\nRegarding the grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali (d. 670), Ali Hujwiri described him as one \"profoundly versed in [spiritual truths]\" and as one of \"the true saints and shaykhs\" of the Islamic community.\nWith respect to the younger grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali, Husayn ibn Ali (d. 680), Ali Hujwiri emphatically declared: \"He is the martyr of Karbala and all Sufis are agreed that he was in the right. So long as the Truth was apparent, he followed it; but when it was lost he drew the sword and never rested until he sacrificed his dear life for God's sake.\"\nAli Hujwiri described Jafar al-Sadiq (d. 765), the great-grandson of Husayn, as one \"celebrated among the Sufi shaykhs for the subtlety of discourse and his acquaintance with spiritual truths.\"\nRegarding the grandson of Husayn, Muhammad al-Baqir (d. 733), Ali Hujwiri stated: \"He was distinguished for his knowledge of the abstruse science and for his subtle indications as to the meaning of the Quran.\"\nAli Hujwiri praised Zayn al-Abidin (d. 713), the son of Husayn, for being of \"the character of those who have attained perfect rectitude.\"\n\nAs a Sunni Muslim, Ali Hujwiri believed it was a spiritual necessity to follow one of the orthodox schools of religious law, being himself a staunch follower of the Hanafi school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence. As such, Ali Hujwiri condemned as \"heretics\" all those who espoused mystical doctrines without following all the precepts of the religious law (\"sharīʿah\"). He further denounced all those \"who held that ... when the Truth is revealed the Law is abolished.\" For Ali Hujwiri, then, all true and orthodox mystical activity needed to take place within the boundaries of the religious law.\n\nAli Hujwiri deemed it lawful to listen to virtuous poetry, saying: \"It is permissible to hear poetry. The Messenger heard it, and the Companions not only heard it but also spoke it.\" Due to these reasons, he censured those who \"declare that it is unlawful to listen to any poetry whatever, and pass their lives in defaming their brother Muslims.\" Regarding the hearing of secular poetry, however, Ali Hujwiri's opinion was far stricter, and he deemed it \"unlawful\" to hear poetry or love-songs that enticed the hearer to carnal desires through detailed descriptions \"of the face and hair and mole of the beloved.\" In conclusion, he stated that those who regarded the hearing of such poetry \"as absolutely lawful must also regard looking and touching as lawful, which is infidelity and heresy.\"\nAli Hujwiri supported the orthodox belief in the existence of saints. As such, he stated: \"You must know that the principle and foundation of Sufism and Knowledge of God rests on sainthood, the reality of which is unanimously affirmed by all the teachers, though every one has expressed himself in a different language.\" Elsewhere, he said: \"God has saints whom He has specially distinguished by His Friendship and whom He has chosen to be the governors of His Kingdom and has marked out to manifest by His Actions and has peculiarly favored with diverse kinds of miracles and has purged of natural corruptions and has delivered from subjection to their lower soul and passion, so that all their thoughts are of Him and their intimacy is with Him alone. Such have been in past ages, and are now, and shall be hereafter until the Day of Resurrection, because God exalted this community above all others and has promised to preserve the religion of Muhammad... The visible proof [of Islam] is to be found among the saints and the elect of God.\" \n\nAli Hujwiri is perhaps most famous for writing what has been described as \"the earliest formal treatise on Ṣūfism in Persian,\" the renowned \"Kashf al-maḥjūb\" (\"Unveiling of the Hidden\"). The work presents itself as an introduction to the various aspects of orthodox Sufism, and also provides biographies of the greatest saints of the Islamic community. The \"Kashf al-maḥjūb\" is the only work of Ali Hujwiri that has remained until today.\n\nReynold Alleyne Nicholson provided a short list of Ali Hujwiri's writings (all of which are lost aside from the \"Kashf al-maḥjūb\"), which included, amongst others, the following unpreserved works: \n\nOf other books written by Sheikh Ali Hujwiri:\n\n\n"}

She studied philosophy and mathematics at Millikin University (1924–28). After completing her PhD at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1932, she went to Cambridge University (Newnham College) to study with G. E. Moore and Ludwig Wittgenstein, where she earned a second PhD in 1938.\n\nHaving become a close disciple of Wittgenstein, Ambrose later related her association with him in \"Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophy and Language\" (1972), a volume co-edited with her husband Morris Lazerowitz. Along with fellow student Margaret MacDonald she secretly (since he did not allow this) made notes during Wittgenstein's lectures, which were later published. She was one of a select group of students to whom Wittgenstein dictated the so-called Blue and Brown Books, which outline the transition in Wittgenstein's thought between his two major works, \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" and \"Philosophical Investigations\". Wittgenstein terminated their association abruptly in 1935 when Ambrose decided, with encouragement from G.E.Moore, to publish an article entitled \"Finitism in Mathematics\" in the philosophical journal \"Mind\" which was intended to give an account of Wittgenstein's position on the subject.\n\nAmbrose began her career at the University of Michigan when she returned to the United States in 1935.

Kane translates \"arjava\" as straightforwardness. It is explained in ancient Indian texts as “self-restraint from hypocrisy\", and \"the absence of hypocrisy”. It is included as one of several ethical virtuous restraints in an individual's path to spirituality. The Maharashtrian poet Vāmana in Avigita, at xvi.1, posits \"arjava\" is a form of honesty and purity in a person, and an essential virtue so that one may treat everyone equally, whether that other is one’s child, wife, relative, friend, a stranger, someone hostile or oneself without any discrimination.\n\nThe ethical concept of \"Arjava\" is synonymously referred to as \"Adambha\" (अदम्भ, composite word from अ+दम्भ). Adambha also means non-deceitful, straightforwardness and sincerity. It is listed as a virtue in the Indian Epics.\n\nArjava is one of the ten yamas listed by Śāṇḍilya Upanishad, as well as by Svātmārāma. It is one of the virtuous restraints (yamas) taught in ancient Indian texts. The other nine yamas are Ahiṃsā (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, Satya (सत्य): truthfulness, Asteya (अस्तेय): not stealing, Brahmacharya (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, Kṣamā (क्षमा): forgiveness, Dhṛti (धृति): fortitude, Dayā (दया): compassion, Mitāhāra (मितहार): measured diet, and Śauca (शौच): purity, cleanliness.\n\nIn some texts, such as by Adi Sankara, this virtue is called as \"bhavasamsuddhi\", and explained as purity of motive and freedom of mind from hypocrisy, both in one’s social conduct, as well as within oneself where one’s thoughts, words and actions resonate. It is considered as a virtue that empowers one to act and live without anxiety, anger, prejudice, inner conflict or confusion. It is also discussed in Bhagwad Gita in verse 17.16.\n\nThe Mahabharata, in Book 12 Chapter 60, lists \"Adambha\" (non-hypocrisy) as a virtue along with \"Akrodha\" (non-anger), \"Kshama\" (forgiveness) and others. In the same book, in Chapter 278, the Epic explains how and why hypocrisy arises, suggesting that it is a derivative of the sin of covetousness, greed and attachment to superficial possessions. Patanjali's treatise on Yoga lists only five yamas, which includes non-covetousness and non-possessiveness (\"Asteya\" and \"Aparigraha\" respectively), but does not include \"Arjava\".\n\n"}

Originally a Bogomil apocryphal text from Bulgaria, possibly based on a now lost Paulican treatise, \"The Book of the Secret Supper\" was translated into Latin and introduced to Italy in the late 12th century, then taken to Provence before the Albigensian Crusade by the Cathar bishop Nazarials or Nazario.\n\nTwo manuscripts survive; one was found in the archives of the Inquisition in the French town of Carcassonne in Languedoc, a Cathar stronghold, and the other was kept in the National Library of Vienna, Austria. There are significant differences between the two texts indicating independent manuscript traditions.\n\nA postscript added to the Carcassonne manuscript by the Inquisitors states, \"This is the Secret of the heretics of Concorrezzo, brought from Bulgaria by Nazarials, their bishop. It is full of errors.\"\n\n\"The Book of the Secret Supper\" is a first-person narrative beginning \"I, John…\" in which John the Evangelist poses a series of questions to Jesus at a secret supper in the kingdom of heaven. \n\nThe book begins with the story of the opposing forces of the Invisible Father, the creator of good, and Satan, the creator of evil, who shines white before his fall and burns red after.\n\nJesus tells John how Satan took over the world, descending from the third heaven and recruiting angels to join him “according to the plan of the Governor Most High.” Satan brought forth all living things, plants, animals, fish and birds, then created man and woman from clay, animating the man with an angel from the second heaven and the woman with an angel from the first heaven. The angels were distressed at having to inhabit material forms. Satan encouraged them to sin, but they did not know how. Satan filled the woman with a longing for sin, then took the form of a serpent and seduced her. He then filled Adam with lust for debauchery with the result that all their children were offspring of the devil and of the serpent.\n\nJesus then describes his own birth, telling John that the Father sent an angel, in the form of Mary, to receive Him in the Holy Spirit. Jesus descended from the seventh heaven and came forth from her ear. Satan then sent Elijah in the form of John the Baptist to give a false baptism by water, but John is warned that only baptism in spirit by Jesus can bring about the remission of sin. Those baptized with water marry, but those baptized in the spirit remain celibate.\n\nThe final part of the book is a description of the Last Judgement when those who have followed an angelic life shall be honored, while those who lived a life of iniquity shall find wrath, fury and distress in everlasting fire. Satan, after waging war upon the just, will be bound with unbreakable bonds and cast into a pool of fire. Then the Son of God will sit on the right hand of his Father, the righteous will be set among the choirs of angels, God shall be in the midst of them and wipe away their tears, and of His kingdom there shall be no end for ever and ever.\n\nGnosticism\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5431669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5431669", "title": "Clinical equipoise", "text": "Clinical equipoise\n\nClinical equipoise, also known as the principle of equipoise, provides the ethical basis for medical research that involves assigning patients to different treatment arms of a clinical trial. The term was first used by Benjamin Freedman in 1987. In short, clinical equipoise means that there is genuine uncertainty in the expert medical community over whether a treatment will be beneficial. This applies also for off-label treatments performed before or during their required clinical trials.\n\nAn ethical dilemma arises in a clinical trial when the investigator(s) begin to believe that the treatment or intervention administered in one arm of the trial is significantly outperforming the other arms. A trial should begin with a null hypothesis, and there should exist no decisive evidence that the intervention or drug being tested will be superior to existing treatments or effective at all. As the trial progresses, the findings may provide sufficient evidence to convince the investigator of the intervention or drug’s efficacy. Once a certain threshold of evidence is passed, there is no longer genuine uncertainty about the most beneficial treatment, so there is an ethical imperative for the investigator to provide the superior intervention to all participants. Ethicists contest the location of this evidentiary threshold, with some suggesting that investigators should only continue the study until they are convinced that one of the treatments is better, and with others arguing that the study should continue until the evidence convinces the entire expert medical community.\n\nThe extent to which major research ethics policies endorse clinical equipoise varies. For instance, the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement endorses it; whereas, the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) does not. With regard to clinical equipoise in practice, there is evidence that industry-funded studies disproportionately favor the industry product, suggesting unfavorable conditions for clinical equipoise. In contrast, a series of studies of national cancer institute funded trials suggests an outcome pattern consistent with clinical equipoise.\n\nShaw and Chalmers argued early on that \"If the clinician knows, or has good reason to believe, that a new therapy (A) is better than another therapy (B), he cannot participate in a comparative trial of Therapy A versus Therapy B. Ethically, the clinician is obligated to give Therapy A to each new patient with a need for one of these therapies.\" Researchers would thus face an ethical dilemma if they wanted to continue the study and collect more evidence, but had compelling evidence that one of the tested therapies was superior. They further stated that any results should be withheld from the researchers during the trial until completion to avoid this ethical dilemma and ensure the study’s completion.\n\nThis method proved to be difficult in modern research, where many clinical trials have to be performed and analyzed by experts in that field. Freedman proposed a different approach to this ethical dilemma called clinical equipoise. Clinical equipoise occurs \"if there is genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community — not necessarily on the part of the individual investigator — about the preferred treatment.\" Clinical equipoise is distinguished from theoretical equipoise, which requires evidence on behalf of the alternative treatments to be exactly balanced and thus yields a very fragile epistemic threshold for favoring one treatment over the other. Theoretical equipoise could be disturbed, for example, by something as simple as anecdotal evidence or a hunch on the part of the investigator. Clinical equipoise allows investigators to continue a trial until they have enough statistical evidence to convince other experts of the validity of their results, without a loss of ethical integrity on the part of the investigators.\n\nEquipoise is also an important consideration in the design of a trial from a patient’s perspective. This is especially true in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for surgical interventions, where both trial and control arms are likely to have their own associated risks and hopes for benefits. The condition of the patient is also a factor in these risks. Ensuring that trials meet the standards of clinical equipoise is an important part of patient recruitment in this regard; it is likely that past trials that did not meet conditions of clinical equipoise suffered from poor recruitment.\n\nMiller and Brody argue that the notion of clinical equipoise is fundamentally misguided. The ethics of therapy and the ethics of research are two distinct enterprises that are governed by different norms. They state, “The doctrine of clinical equipoise is intended to act as a bridge between therapy and research, allegedly making it possible to conduct RCTs without sacrificing the therapeutic obligation of physicians to provide treatment according to a scientifically validated standard of care. This constitutes therapeutic misconception concerning the ethics of clinical trials, analogous to the tendency of patient volunteers to confuse treatment in the context of RCTs with routine medical care.” Equipoise, they argue, only makes sense as a normative assumption for clinical trials if one assumes that researchers have therapeutic obligations to their research participants. \nFurther criticisms of clinical equipoise have been leveled by Robert Veatch and by Peter Ubel and Robert Silbergleit.\n\n"}

His parents moved back home to Port Elizabeth when he was aged four, and young Brutus was classified under South Africa's apartheid racial code as \"coloured\".\n\nBrutus was a graduate of the University of Fort Hare (BA, 1946) and of the University of the Witwatersrand, where he studied law. He taught English and Afrikaans at several high schools in South Africa after 1948, but was eventually dismissed for his vocal criticism of apartheid. He served on the faculty of the University of Denver, Northwestern University and University of Pittsburgh, and was a Professor Emeritus from the last institution.\n\nIn 2008, Brutus was awarded the Lifetime Honorary Award by the South African Department of Arts and Culture for his lifelong dedication to African and world poetry and literary arts.\nBrutus was an activist against the apartheid government of South Africa in the 1960s. He learned politics in the Trotskyist movement of the Eastern Cape.\n\nAlthough not an accomplished athlete in his own right, he was motivated by the unfairness of selections for athletic teams. He joined the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department organisation (Anti-CAD), a Trotskyist group that organised against the Coloured Affairs Department, which was an attempt by the government to institutionalise divisions between blacks and coloureds.\n\nBrutus was a co-founder of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), an organization that would be heavily influential in the banning of Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics in 1964. In 1961, Brutus was banned for his political activities as part of SANROC. As South Africa attempted, in 1968, to get back into the Olympics by arguing that they would field multi-racial teams, SANROC successfully pointed out that those teams were chosen on a segregated basis, leading to South Africa's continued ban from 1968 until 1992.\n\nIn 1963, Brutus was arrested for trying to meet with an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official; he was accused of breaking the terms of his \"banning,\" which were that he could not meet with more than two people outside his family, and he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, he \"jumped bail\" by trying to leave South Africa to attend the IOC meeting in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on behalf of SANROC and while in Mozambique, on a Rhodesian passport, the Portuguese secret police arrested him and returned him to South Africa. There, while trying to escape, he was shot in the back at point-blank range. After only partly recovering from the wound, Brutus was sent to Robben Island ... for 16 months, five in solitary.\" He was in the cell next to Nelson Mandela's. Brutus was in prison when news of the country's suspension from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, for which he had campaigned, broke.\n\nBrutus was forbidden to teach, write and publish in South Africa. His first collection of poetry, \"Sirens, Knuckles and Boots\", was published in Nigeria while he was in prison. The book received the Mbari Poetry Prize, awarded to a black poet of distinction, but Brutus turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity. He was the author of 14 books.\n\nAfter he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in the Britain,where he first met George Houser, the Executive Director of the American Committee on Africa (ACOA). South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team. At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour; where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organizations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defense of those charged under the apartheid laws. The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games. In cooperation with SANROC, the ACOA organized a boycott of American athletes in February 1968. Jackie Robinson, the first African American athlete to break to color barrier in Major League Baseball, published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. Asa result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.\n\nIn 1983, Brutus won the right to stay in the United States as a political refugee, after a protracted legal struggle. He continued to participate in protests against the apartheid government while teaching in the United States. He was \"unbanned\" by the South African government in 1990. In 1991 he became one of the sponsors of the Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa.\n\nHe returned to South Africa and was based at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where he often contributed to the annual Poetry Africa Festival hosted by the university and supported activism against neo-liberal policies in contemporary South Africa through working with NGOs. \nIn December 2007, Brutus was to be inducted into the South African Sports Hall of Fame. \nAt the induction ceremony, he publicly turned down his nomination, stating: \n\nAccording to fellow writer Olu Oguibe, interim Director of the Institute for African American Studies at the University of Connecticut, \"Brutus was arguably Africa's greatest and most influential modern poet after Leopold Sedar Senghor and Christopher Okigbo, certainly the most widely-read, and no doubt among the world's finest poets of all time. More than that, he was a fearless campaigner for justice, a relentless organizer, an incorrigible romantic, and a great humanist and teacher.\"\n\nBrutus died of prostate cancer on 26 December 2009, at his home in Cape Town, South Africa. He is survived by two sisters, eight children including his son Anthony, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.\n\n\"The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography\", edited by Bernth Lindfors, was published in 2011, including transcripts of tapes recorded when he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Texas at Austin in 1974–75, reflecting on his life and career.\n\n\n\n"}

In order to embody all perfections, therefore, God must embody the good in \"both\" characteristics, and cannot be limited to one, because a God limited to one would suffer the limits of the one, and lack the good in the other.\n\nFor instance, there is a \"good\" in being just, and also a good in being merciful. In being just, God determines that the good are rewarded and the evil are punished. In being merciful, God forgives those who sin. It follows, therefore, that a God that was \"only\" just or \"only\" merciful would be less than perfect. Dipolar theism holds that a perfect God must embody the good in \"both\" of those characteristics. Thus, a perfect God has the \"good\" characteristics of justice \"and\" the good characteristics of mercy.\n\nAlternatively, there is good in having absolute power, and good in leading by persuasion. For a God to be perfect, he cannot rule solely by predestination, because then he would lack the good possessed by a God who led by persuasion. God must therefore embody the \"good\" in both power and persuasion. From this conclusion, some reject the existence of an omnipotent God.\n\nThose rejecting dipolar theism argue that it fails to distinguish between what we \"think\" God is and what God \"actually\" is. Just because we think God should be a certain way in order to embody our idea of perfection does not mean he embodies those characteristics in reality. \n\nThis critique is analogous to the critique of Anselm's ontological argument by Gaunilo: \"Just because I can imagine a perfect island does not mean that it actually exists. Things are what they are no matter what I think they should be.\"\n"}

{"id": "5883654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5883654", "title": "Ernesto Buonaiuti", "text": "Ernesto Buonaiuti\n\nErnesto Buonaiuti (April 24, 1881 – April 20, 1946) was an Italian historian, philosopher of religion, Catholic priest and anti-fascist. He lost his chair at the University of Rome owing to his opposition to the Fascists. As a scholar in History of Christianity and religious philosophy he was one of the most important exponents of the modernist current.\n\nBuonaiuti was born in Rome on April 24, 1881. He was ordained priest on December 19, 1903, and began his studies working with the historian of religion Salvatore Minocchi. He made use of the positive method in his study of early Christianity in his book \"Il cristianesimo primitivo e la Politica imperiale romana\" (\"Primitive Christianity and Roman Imperial Politics\", 1911).\n\nAt the age of 24 he founded the magazine \"Rivista storico-critica delle scienze teologiche\" (\"Historical-critical Review of the Theological Sciences\"), in order to propagate his vision of religious culture in Italy, and after that he directed the magazine \"Ricerche religiose\" (\"Religious Researches\"). Those magazines were soon banned by the church and placed on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\", the index of publications to be considered as forbidden to Catholic readers.\n\nOn January 25, 1925 he was punished with excommunication, which was confirmed several times, because in his works he defended the ideas of the modernist current, particularly in \"Il programma dei modernisti\" (\"The Modernists' Program\", 1908) and \"Lettere di un prete modernista\" (\"Letters from a Modernist Priest\", 1908).\n\nIn his autobiography \"Il pellegrino di Roma\" (\"The Pilgrim from Rome\", 1945), Buonaiuti reconstructed the history of his conflict with the Catholic Church, of which he continued to claim himself a \"loyal son\", even after his excommunication.\n\nFrom 1925 he was Professor of History of Christianity at the University of Rome; however, after the Concordat in 1929, the University forbade him to teach and to examine students, and he was given non-academic tasks, such as library investigation and the writing of research papers. In 1931 his university chair was definitively revoked, because he refused to swear the \"oath of loyalty\" to Fascism (all teachers were forced by law to swear an oath of loyalty to the Fascist government, and those who refused were fired).\n\nIn 1945, after the Allied victory in the Second World War he was restored to his rank of university professor, but he was not allowed to give lectures, since, according to the bureaucracy and the laws resulting from the Concordat, which were retained by the new government, teaching in any Italian State University was forbidden to any excommunicated priest.\n\nHe died on April 20, 1946 in Rome.\n\nThe complete works of Buonaiuti are very extensive: he wrote more than three thousand works, including books and articles, among them the ponderous \"Storia del Cristianesimo\" (\"History of Christianity\") in three volumes, his autobiography (\"Il pellegrino di Roma\") and many studies about Gioacchino da Fiore (\"Gioacchino da Fiore: i tempi, la vita, il messaggio\") and Martin Luther (\"Lutero e la riforma in Germania\").\n\nThe three books of \"Storia del Cristianesimo\" were published between 1942 and 1943; the first volume is about ancient times, the second is about the Middle Ages and the third is about the modern era.\nIt is considered Buonaiuti's most significant academic work. As he himself wrote in his autobiography of 1945, the work was motivated by apologetic reasons: \"in order to draw up the definitive balance-sheet of Christian action in history, now that from a thousand signs one could easily and certainly deduce that Christianity was approaching its hour of dramatic expiration\".\n\nThe main theme of the work revolves around the mystic and moral character of Christianity and its subsequent transformation into a philosofico-theological system and a bureaucratic organization. In Buonaiuti's view, the main religions are not speculative views of the world or rational schematizations of reality, but normative indications of a set of pre-rational and spiritual behaviours. Christianity, born as an announcement of palingenesis, implied a huge social program \"which imposed a progressive conceptual enrichment and an increasingly rigid disciplinary organization. To live and bear fruit in the world, Christianity was condemned to lose its nature and degenerate\" (\"Storia del cristianesimo\", I, p. 15 and seq.). The only chance of salvation for the Church and all of modern society is, in Buonaiuti's view, the restoration of the elementary values of primitive Christianity: love, pain, regret, death.\n\nThe title of this autobiographical work, published in Rome in 1945, cites a definition that the Italian historian Luigi Salvatorelli gave of him, entitling one of his essays \"Ernesto Buonaiuti, pellegrino di Roma\" to emphasize Buonaiuti's love for the Catholic Church, despite the grave disciplinary sanctions he had to face (\"La Cultura\", XII, 1933, pp. 375–391). Buonaiuti claims as his own two works of a modernist tendency published anonymously in 1908: \"Lettere di un prete modernista\" (\"Letters from a Modernist Priest\"), which he considered \"a youth's sin\", and \"Il Programma dei Modernisti\" (\"The Modernists' Program\"). His modernist positions are motivated by scientific reasons (Biblical criticism and exegesis). Initially his modernism seemed similar to the positions of Protestant liberal theologians like Albrecht Ritschl and Adolf von Harnack; however, after researching spirituality in the ancient world, from Zarathustra to the Greek tragedians, Buonaiuti began to recognize in pre-Christian spiritual experiences an anticipation of the Christian view of life. Buonaiuti claimed to be Catholic and to want to stay so \"usque dum vivam\" (\"as long as I live\"), as he wrote to the theology faculty of the University of Lausanne, which had offered him a chair in History of Christianity if he joined the Calvinist Church.\n\nBuonaiuti was an exact contemporary in Rome with Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, who was elected to the papacy as John XXIII in 1958. According to Roncalli's biographer Peter Hebblethwaite the two men were initially close friends, and this connection may have played a part in the future pope's abrupt removal from a seminary post early in his career, as well as in the \"Suspected of Modernism\" entry which was made against Roncalli's name in his official record in the Vatican archives, something he would later refute by inserting, in his own hand \"I, Pope John XXIII, have never been a Modernist\". Certainly the friendship was never repudiated, and according to theologian Giovanni Gennari, Roncalli (who was assisted by Buonaiuti in saying his first Mass in 1904) is known to have used material written by the future excommunicate in teaching Church History. Historians generally agree that the association did not taint Roncalli's orthodoxy, even if he is known to have retained a certain regard for his erstwhile colleague. Indeed Cardinal Capovilla, who was secretary to John XXIII, attributes to his late superior the following sentiments:\n\nRicky Tognazzi's 2003 film \"The Good Pope\" has a character called Nicola Catania who is loosely based on Buonaiuti, although a certain amount of licence is employed. The movie has Catania, a priest deposed for Modernism, keeping vigil in St. Peter's Square as John XXIII, who had been his friend in the seminary lies dying. In actuality, Buonaiuti died in 1946 and Roncalli in 1963.\n\n\n\n"}

He is an advocate of the theory of quantum consciousness.\n\nLászló was born in Budapest, Hungary, the son of a shoe manufacturer and a mother who played the piano; László himself started playing the piano when he was five years old, and gave his first piano concert with the Budapest Symphony Orchestra at the age of nine. At the end of the war he moved to the United States.\n\nLászló is a visiting faculty member at the Graduate Institute Bethany. He has published about 75 books and over 400 papers, and is editor of \"World Futures: The Journal of General Evolution\".\n\nIn 2002, László received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pécs.\nHe participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2006. In 2010, he was elected an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn Hungary, the minister of environment appointed Laszlo as one of the leaders of the ministry's campaign concerning global warming.\n\nLászló married Carita Jägerhorn af Spurila 16 November 1956. One of their two sons is Alexander Laszlo.\n\nIn 1984, László was co-founder with Béla H. Bánáthy, Riane Eisler, John Corliss, Francisco Varela, Vilmos Csanyi, Gyorgy Kampis, David Loye, Jonathan Schull and Eric Chaisson of the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group. Meeting behind the Iron Curtain, the group of scientists and thinkers from a variety of disciplines met in secret. Their goal was to explore whether it might be possible to use the chaos theory to identify a new general theory of evolution that might serve as a path to a better world.\n\nIn 1993, in response to his experience with the Club of Rome, he founded the Club of Budapest to, in his words, \"centre attention on the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course — from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability\".\n\nLászló's 2004 book, \"Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything\" posits a field of information as the substance of the cosmos. Using the Sanskrit and Vedic term for \"space\", \"Akasha\", he calls this information field the \"Akashic field\" or \"A-field\". He posits that the \"quantum vacuum\" (see Vacuum state) is the fundamental energy and information-carrying field that informs not just the current universe, but all universes past and present (collectively, the \"Metaverse\").\n\nLászló believes that such an informational field can explain why our universe appears to be fine-tuned so as to form galaxies and conscious lifeforms; and why evolution is an informed, not random, process. He believes that the hypothesis solves several problems that emerge from quantum physics, especially nonlocality and quantum entanglement.\n\nLászló became interested in the consciousness theories of Anthony Peake, (who in turn was an admirer of László’s work on the Akashic Field). Peake, whose background was in the social sciences, had sought to explain the fact that altered states of consciousness (such as deja vu, dreams, psychedelic drug experiences, meditation, near death experience) sometimes seem to feature precognition and premonitions. Peake had produced a tentative synthesis of the ancient idea of the “Eternal Return” with modern ideas like the simulation argument, the holographic universe, and the many worlds interpretation. In Peake’s hypothesis, one lives variants of the same life repeatedly, and a premonition is in fact a memory of the past. Peake became a Consciousness Studies Department Member at Ervin László’s Center For Advanced Studies. László collaborated with Anthony Peake on the book \"The Immortal Mind: Science and the Continuity of Consciousness Beyond the Brain\".\n\nIn his book \"You Can Change the World\", László promotes a linking of non-government organizations promoting sustainable development, using the Internet.\n\nLászló has written an autobiography entitled \"Simply Genius! And Other Tales from My Life\", published by Hay House Publishers in June 2011.\n\nIn an essay, Stanislav Grof compared László's work to that of Ken Wilber, saying \"Where Wilber outlined what an integral theory of everything should look like, Laszlo actually created one.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52757988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52757988", "title": "Free and Independent Faction", "text": "Free and Independent Faction\n\nThe Free and Independent Faction or Free and Independent Fraction (, sometimes \"Fracțiunea Liberală și Independentă\", \"Independent Liberal Faction\", commonly \"Fracționiștii\", \"The F(r)actionalists\") was a nationalist and national-liberal party in Romania, regionally centered on Western Moldavia. Originally informal, and defined by its adversaries, the Faction mainly comprised pupils and followers of the philosopher Simion Bărnuțiu. During most of its existence, it had as its recognized leader the academic and polemicist Nicolae Ionescu.\n\nConsolidated during the election of Carol I as \"Domnitor\", the Faction opposed his rule, favoring either an elective monarchy with a native prince or a republican system. Factionalist nativism bordered on violent xenophobia, endorsing economic antisemitism and anti-Germanism. The party also stood for democratization, including radical land reform and a reshaping of the census suffrage, while its regional ethos resulted in support for federalism, then communalism. Such stances created tension between the Factionalists and most other groups on the left-liberal fringe, making the Faction an uneasy partner in the \"Red\" government alliances of the 1860s and '70s. They were also opposed in Moldavia by the conservative club \"Junimea\", with whom the Faction had a consuming rivalry, and by moderate liberals such as Mihail Kogălniceanu, who drained the Faction of its votes after 1877.\n\nIonescu's career peaked in 1876, when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the \"Red\" cabinet of Ion Brătianu, and began to separate himself from the Factionalists. He was deposed for his opposition to the war of independence, by which time the Faction was steadily declining in importance. In the 1880s, after a brief alliance with the Conservative Party, the Faction dissolved into the National Liberal Party.\n\nThe origins of Bărnuțiu's movement can be traced back to \"the very last years\" of Alexander John Cuza rule as \"Domnitor\" over the \"United Principalities\", which confederated Moldavia with neighboring Wallachia. The group was centered on the last Moldavian capital, Iași, where Bărnuțiu and Ionescu were both active as educators. Following Bărnuțiu's death in 1864, the Faction had for its \"chiefs\" Alexandru Gheorghiu, Alecu D. Holban, Theodor Lateș, Dimitrie Tacu, Iorgu Tacu, alongside Constantin Corjescu and his brother Dimitrie. As noted by their one-time colleague George Panu, they were \"students and disciples of Bărnuțiu\", who \"had hypnotized them, had inoculated into them his fanatical ideas; they spoke like him, they dressed like him, they walked like him, and quite clearly they thought like him.\" Defining itself as \"national and liberal\", Bărnuțianism was strongly nativist and primordialist, circulating the claim that old Romanian law was purely Roman law (\"see Origin of the Romanians\"). On such grounds, it conceived Romania as a modern reconstruction of the Roman Republic, secured by protectionism, anti-German sentiment, and economic antisemitism, going as far as to propose the expulsion of all foreigners from Romanian soil. Another eccentricity was the Factionalists' project for a complete land reform, redistributing all available land among Romanian nationals.\n\nLike most other groups existing before the creation of an independent Kingdom of Romania in the 1880s, the \"vaguely liberal\" or \"most originally liberal\" Faction was somewhat diffuse, identified by voluntary allegiance rather than formal membership, and was mainly a parliamentary party. Its earliest rally point was the gazette \"Tribuna Română\" (\"Romanian Tribune\"), published in 1866 as the self-styled exponent of \"truly liberal and independent convictions\". Despite having a longer history, the party was only formalized around January 1867, following a speech by its recognized leader, who was by then Nicolae Ionescu—his claim to speak for a \"free and independent faction\" was picked up as a derisive exonym by his adversaries, then accepted by the \"Faction\" itself; ideally, however, Ionescu favored non-partisan democracy. A professor of law and brother of the agronomist Ion Ionescu de la Brad, Ionescu had played a marginal role the Moldavian and Wallachian Revolutions of 1848. In 1856–1858, he had also supported the unionist National Party, putting out the French edition of \"Steaua Dunării\" from Brussels. His effort was partly financed by the Moldavian statesman Mihail Kogălniceanu, with whom Ionescu had an on and off friendship.\n\nUnder the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, Cuza's regime took steps toward solidifying the Principalities, which became the nucleus of modern Romania; however, it alienated the political class with its expansive authoritarianism. The liberal wing, or \"Reds\", envisioned a ceremonial role for the monarchy, within a democratized country: they \"admired Cuza's democratism [but] despised his Bonapartist methods\". \"Red\" leaders joined conservatives and centrists in forming a \"monstrous coalition\" of conspirators, who toppled Cuza in February 1866 and began a search for a foreign \"Domnitor\" to inaugurate a hereditary monarchy. Eventually, after Philippe of Belgium withdrew from the race, Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became a main candidate for the throne. The Faction itself took a distinct position against the Carlist consensus. Bărnuțian postulates allowed Factionalists to argue that a single Romanian vote against a foreign dynasty was the exercise of a natural right, and would invalidate all other opinions. Still frequenting the National Party, D. Tacu took a more moderate position: like Vasile Pogor and Titu Maiorescu, he was only opposed to Carol specifically, and demanded a prince from Romance-speaking Europe.\n\nEventually, a plebiscite on the monarchy confirmed Carol as \"Domnitor\", 685,969 votes to 224. Elected to the Constituent Chamber of Bucharest during the parallel race, six Factionalists abstained during the vote to proclaim Carol as the hereditary ruler. Seated among the left and far-left of Chamber, they were: Ionescu, Tacu, Lateș, Nicolae Iamandi, Ianache Lecca, and Ioan Negură. Speaking from the rostrum at the time, Ionescu, who represented six Moldavian counties, voiced his admiration of Cuza's constitutional law, since \"although despotic, it yielded decent fruit, being applied with a sense of liberalism.\"\n\nWhile their initial opposition to Carol had by then been reduced to abstentionism, the Factionalists' core constituency of Iași experienced a separatist rebellion, instigated by Calinic Miclescu, Constantin Moruzi Pecheanu, Teodor Boldur-Lățescu, and Nicu Ceaur-Aslan. The movement was almost immediately quashed, but moderate federalism was preserved by a plan of moving the Court of Cassation to Iași, making that city a judicial capital of Romania. In the city itself, the Faction's \"group of electors\" held meetings during which some advocated full federalism with a separate civilian government for Moldavia. A motion supporting a preferential treatment for Iași was proposed by the lawyer Gheorghe Cigaras with support from Ceaur-Aslan—and also signed by Gheorghiu, Holban, Alexandru M. Șendrea, Petre Suciu, Tacu, Sandu Dudescu, Grigore Cobălcescu, Anastasie Fătu and Vasile Gheorghian, alongside priests Iosif Bobulescu, Neofit Scriban, and Climent Nicolau. However, to the dismay of other deputies who endorsed decentralization (including Tacu and Lateș), Ionescu spoke out against the Court of Cassation proposal, as he expected Iași to be more thoroughly assisted by government.\n\nCarol was ultimately able to take the throne, but, during the same period, there was a breakdown of consensus inside the \"monstrous coalition\", with heated debates over the passing of the Constitution. A \"White\" party, comprising centrist and conservative elements, backed Carol's hands-on and gradualist approach to institutional modernization. As claimed by the independent radical Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, the emerging anti-liberal coalition, a \"scandalous phenomenon\", \"always paralyzed Romanianism with alienism, and democracy with reaction\". Although \"too archaic\", Hasdeu claimed, the Faction \"rekindled the Romanian spirit\" and mounted resistance against \"cosmopolitan ideas\". Defining itself as \"decentralist and anti-absolutist unionist\", the Faction was organizing throughout Western Moldavia, relying on a network of academics, schoolteachers, and youths. At Bârlad, its \"national-liberal\" chapter was supported by local intellectuals, including brothers Ion and Constantin Codrescu, Ioan Popescu, and Scarlat Vârnav.\n\nWithin this context, a deeper controversy erupted over what Hasdeu referred to as \"alienism\": the issue of Romanian Jews and their political emancipation, which the \"Reds\" and the Faction opposed. In May 1866, while a petition to block Jews from obtaining commercial rights was signed by Ionescu and circulated throughout Moldavia, antisemitic riots possibly instigated by the Faction erupted in Iași, Bârlad, Roman and Botoșani. The clampdown was led by Prefect Grigore Sturdza, and resulted in the temporary arrest of various party leaders, including Fătu, Gheorghian, Gheorghiu, Holban and Suciu—alongside sympathizers such as Petru Poni. As noted by historian A. D. Xenopol (who was for a while a Factionalist sympathizer), antisemitism was only present \"up front\" within the Moldavian Faction and taken up in Wallachia by Cezar Bolliac, but also spread out, more discreetly, among the other political groups. Adolphe Stern, the Jewish community leader, decried the Faction's \"mystical and intransigent dogmatism\", infused with an \"awful hatred\" by the \"pseudo-intellectual\" Bărnuțiu.\n\nThe \"Reds\" and the Factionalists were pushed into cooperating with each other, mainly because the \"Reds\" were virtually unrepresented in Moldavian cities, but remained distinct parties; in crucial moments, the Faction voted against radicalism, rallying with the centrists. The Factionalists' extreme nationalism and antisemitism embarrassed most of the \"Reds\", who generally refrained from directly associating with the Faction outside of elections. The other side of the alliance was also avoiding any direct association. Seen as a purely \"egotistic\" force by its allies, the Faction always feared that the liberals were secretly \"right-wing\". As noted in 1886 by Holban, the Faction also viewed \"Reds\" as \"counterfeit Jacobins\", or as cosmopolitans whose stance was essentially \"anti-national\".\n\nThe core disputes of 1866 centered on the reestablishment of a Romanian Senate, with its implication of elitism. Hasdeu claimed at the time that \"its maintenance costs us some millions a year, but provides us with no benefit, other than that it passes for a fine ornament and emanates a fragrance.\" Ionescu and the \"Red\" Nicolae Voinov proposed a number of successive projects, all of which were unicameral. While supporters of bicameralism insisted that the Senate would function as a Romanian House of Lords, the Factionalists and their allies ridiculed this claim when it came to boyar nobility. Hasdeu wrote that, in Romania, \"most of the old [boyar] families have gone extinct and were replaced by a make-believe aristocracy, newly born and lacking those glorious traditions which support English aristocrats; and on the other hand, most of our notabilities, political, literary and even parliamentary, have their roots in the mass of the people\".\n\nFaced with mounting support for bicameralism, Ionescu and Tacu conceded defeat but, alongside Christian Tell and Alexandru G. Golescu, still supported limiting the power of Senate to vote on the budget. However, they endorsed a bill which, if passed, would have given Senate the authority to try government ministers. Like various deputies on the left, they still resented the distribution of census suffrage, arguing that their bourgeois voters—portrayed by Ionescu's as a \"third-estate\" backbone of constitutionalism—were underrepresented in the 3rd Electoral College. Ionescu supported a two-college system and found it deplorable that, under the provisions for weighted voting, peasants had a 1:40,000 ratio of representation, and landowners a 1:40. Nonetheless, the Faction, like the entire political class, rejected both universal suffrage and direct democracy, seeing Romanians, and peasants especially, as fundamentally immature for enfranchisement.\n\nIn October 1866, after \"difficult\" negotiations with the Sublime Porte, Carol also secured his international recognition, which relieved the need for consensus and allowed party politics to develop further. Following the election of November, in which Ionescu became a perennial deputy for Roman County, the legislature was split evenly between \"Reds\", \"Whites\", and a heterogeneous coalition of Cuza loyalists and Moldavian separatists; the parties of \"the left\", including the Faction, had some 20 deputy seats. During later contests for the new Senate seats, a more complex \"Red\" coalition emerged. Formalized as the Concordia Agreement in March 1867, it also included a group of moderates led by Kogălniceanu. However, as a Kogălniceanu rival, Ionescu never signed up to the Concordia platform, and his colleagues only adhered to some of its tenets.\n\nChanging the configuration of Chamber, this alliance toppled the moderate Prime Minister Ion Ghica, producing three successive radical cabinets, respectively headed by Constantin A. Crețulescu, Ștefan Golescu, and Nicolae Golescu. These inaugurated investment in public works, modified electoral laws, and reduced the powers of the Senate. As Minister of Internal Affairs, \"Red\" doctrinaire Ion Brătianu worked to influence elections in favor the Concordia group, especially during December 1867. The new majority had some 85 seats in Chamber, of which some 14 were Factionalists—known to include Ionescu, Fătu, Gheorghiu, A. D. Holban, Lateș, Negură, Suciu, D. Tacu, Voinov, Ianache Lecca, Dumitru Lupașcu, Mantu Rufu, I. Strejescu, and Dumitru Țanu Vidrașcu. Vârnav, winner of the 4th college seat for Tutova, died mysteriously before confirmation. His partisans claimed that he had been poisoned by Jews, sparking another antisemitic riot.\n\nThe Faction was awarded the Chamber Presidency, held by Fătu, but remained suspicious of the \"Reds\". The staunch \"ethnic protectionism\" and \"hysteric xenophobia\" of both nationalist parties, including their claim that Jews were incapable of assimilating, ensured that the Constitution only granted citizenship to Christians. Moreover, at Internal Affairs, Brătianu went against Carol's advice, ordering \"severe measures against the Jews and foreign 'vagabonds'.\" Such policies were reportedly advocated, and imposed on him, by the Faction. During the interval, thirty-one deputies, Fătu included, presented a bill with exceptionally harsh antisemitic provisions, but this was defeated by an ad-hoc Chamber majority. At the time, Lateș also proposed to only grant Christians the \"political right\" of owning land; his bill was also defeated. The xenophobic stance was reportedly gaining momentum in Moldavia, with Factionalist professors expressing \"aversion\" toward Westernization, and purposefully ignoring \"foreign literature and art\". Their protectionism blended with natalism in another proposal, advanced at one time by Suciu, which would have overtaxed bachelors.\n\nFrom May 1867 to October 1870, in times of \"maximum political strife\", Ionescu put out the Factionalist newspaper \"Dreptatea\" (\"Justice\" or \"Fairness\"). As outlined here, the ideology of Factionalism also comprised fringe positions, including criticism of Christianity—Ionescu viewed conversion to Christianity as a prerequisite of citizenship and the state religion, but argued that the Romanian Orthodox Church was too indebted to Judaism and \"the Greeks\". Alongside the promise of full land reform, Moldavian regionalism resurfaced as communalism: the Faction believed that the executive should be closely monitored by the Chamber, and stood by the notion that communes were autonomous units of the state. On this point, Factionalists were irreconcilable with the \"Reds\", who favored quick centralization and a unitary state. The regionalist agenda was expanded on by another Factionalist newspaper, \"D̦iorile\" (\"The Dawn\"), accused by other liberals of wanting to \"divide the country into satrapies\".\n\nDespite this, and although the Faction voted against development loans from the Oppenheim family, Ionescu also supported the common nationalist agenda, favoring a national currency and the construction of a centralized transport infrastructure. Beyond its advocacy of xenophobic restrictions, the Faction also viewed itself as a watchdog for individual freedoms, and lauded the introduction of jury trials as a testing ground for extended suffrage. Ionescu in particular favored a focus on civics, rather than vocational education, in the state-funded primary schools. From March 1868, Ionescu and Ianache Lecca were also instrumental in reforming the nationwide Civic Guard, which acted as a reserve and police force. Their project called for the Guard to no longer be a paramilitary wing of the \"Red\" caucus, and become a more reliable \"Landwehr\".\n\nBrătianu confirmed Ionescu's suspicions in April 1868, when he canvassed direct support for the \"Reds\" at Iași. His trip was a disappointment, drawing a mob which protested violently against his schemes. In the July 1868 race, Ionescu took a seat in the Senate, where he remained until 1870. His leaving the Factionalist leadership in Chamber was deplored as a major loss by his replacement, Gheorghiu. However, the Faction still dominated Moldavian politics, enlisting affiliations from the moderate liberal Gheorghe Mârzescu and from urban professionals, variously including Dimitrie Anghel (father of the poet), Scarlat Pastia, Miltiade Tzony, and Ștefan Micle. Before 1868, it also had the support of Ion Creangă, a rebellious priest and aspiring writer who attended electoral meetings and Faction primaries. It was during these that Creangă clashed with the local \"White\" orator, Iacob Negruzzi.\n\nIași was by then home to a cultural and political club, called \"Junimea\", which soon presented a structured opposition to both Ionescu's group, and, from 1870, a distinct branch of the \"White\" movement; it was able to attract within its ranks some of the junior Factionalists, including Creangă, Panu, and Xenopol, as well as conservatives such as Negruzzi. \"Junimea\"s Wallachian founder, Titu Maiorescu, published essays directly attacking the cornerstones of Bărnuțiu's politics, and Romanian liberalism as a whole, from the implicit position of liberal conservatism. In particular, he rejected the Faction's ideas on land reform as \"communistic\", expressing his astonishment that an anti-state party had been allowed to govern at all. Maiorescu's friend Petre P. Carp also attacked Factionalism through his newspaper, \"Térra\", which declared itself the voice of true liberalism in its constitutionalist, monarchist, version. Especially through Carp, \"Junimism\" condemned the Faction's xenophobia, and called for the protection of Romanian Jews; Maiorescu also described Ionescu's party \"ephemeral\", defined by its \"hatred of foreigners, and in particular Jews.\"\n\nThe Factionalists took notice of such reactions, and the conflict between them and the \"Junimists\" became exceptionally bitter—the two camps were deadly enemies to one another. Factionalist propaganda portrayed the \"Junimists\" as \"Freemasons\" and as \"hirelings\" of the external enemies. This political dispute highlighted earlier rivalries, which began in 1864, when Maiorescu and Ionescu accused each other of adultery. Factionalists Suciu and Cobălcescu had also lodged a legal complaint against Maiorescu, claiming, spuriously so, that he lacked Romanian citizenship and was therefore ineligible for political office. On the \"Junimist\" side, the response was provided by Negruzzi, who published number of pamphlets depicting Ionescu and the Factionalists as irrational demagogues. \"Junimea\" also kept a record of \"inanities\" published in the Factionalist newspapers.\n\nThe \"Red\" series in government ended in November 1868, when Carol, troubled by the excesses of antisemitism, began selecting his ministers from the moderate right. Carol also apologized for the sufferings of his Jewish subjects, which led the Faction to issue a protest; its senators also voted against the N. Golescu government when it did the same. Ionescu supported Golescu and Brătianu's definition of the Jews as \"vagabonds\", but declared his disappointment at their moderation. As noted at the time by Carp, Brătianu was shying away from official antisemitism, and only instrumenting it through \"anarchy\" and \"the rabble in the streets\"; the Faction, he argued, was at least consistent in seeking out a legal method.\n\nThe Concordia alliance crumbled before the election of March 1869, with Kogălniceanu, who resented the Golescus' external policies, joining Dimitrie Ghica's ministry. The election itself was a sound defeat for the left: the \"Reds\" took 10 seats in Chamber and the Faction only 8, with the moderates and \"Whites\" sharing 120. However, there were widespread reports and complaints that Kogălniceanu had advised local authorities to condone fraud and to intimidate the opposition. According to one account, the defector Mârzescu, serving as Prefect of Iași County, personally ensured that Kogălniceanu won a deputy's seat against Ionescu.\n\nIn early 1870, a new majority of moderates was formed around D. Ghica and Manolache Epureanu—calling themselves the \"Party of Order\"—, with the adherence of Efrem Ghermani and Cezar Bolliac. According to Hasdeu, this was a \"broth of boyars and democrats\", existing only to keep \"the Reds and the Faction\" out of office. Hasdeu also accused Epureanu of wanting to naturalize and introduce Jews into the country, under the guise of constitutionalism: \"So the Constitution will appear to be standing, although trampled upon by the Jews.\" He called for an antisemitic unification—of liberals, radicals and nationalists—into a \"great party of action\", \"purified of all things bastard, all things cosmopolitan\".\n\nAs noted by historian Silvia Marton, the marginalized \"Reds\" first began talking of republicanism in the early months of 1869—\"chipping away at Carol's strength and authority\" despite their setbacks. While Ionescu attended official functions honoring the \"Domnitor\" well into 1869, the Faction discarded its early project for a native dynasty (which it now deemed \"the imperialistic regime\") and, like the Wallachian radicals, embraced republicanism. Nevertheless, Factionalist deputies such as Ion Codrescu still expressed a hope that the throne could stand for \"the country as a whole\", and reaffirmed their conditional support for Carol. The republican drift was accentuated by the elections of May 1870. These were entirely manufactured by Carol, who was arguably overstepping constitutional bounds. They took place in a climate of violence and uncertainty, with riots in Bucharest, Giurgiu, and Pitești. In his editorial of June 3, Hasdeu called Epureanu a \"butcher\", but warned that \"a nation is like iron: the more you strike at it, the more it will harden.\"\n\nEpureanu managed to set up a \"Hen and Fledgling Cabinet\" that included \"Junimist\" Carp at Foreign Affairs. This was an early sign of the success of anti-Factionalism in Moldavia, where \"Junimea\" was growing into a political movement. The election, however, produced 34 deputies who, according to Hasdeu, stood for the \"independent current, whose banner, the one it raised only yesterday, has managed to overwhelm with its vigor the authoritarian school.\" Alongside Ionescu, I. Codrescu, Fătu, Gheorghiu, A. D. Holban, Negură, Suciu, Voinov, and Tacu, these were: Stroe Belloescu, Constantin Bosianu, Alexandru Lăzărescu-Laerțiu, Gheorghe Lecca, Costache Negri, Nicolae Gr. Racoviță, Nicolae Rosetti-Bălănescu, George D. Vernescu, I. Adrian, Ion Agarici, N. Bossie, Costin Brăescu, D. Comănăsceanu, Leon Eraclide, E. Filipescu, I. Gâlcă, M. Ganea, P. Georgiade, V. Holban, Dumitru Lupașcu, George Mantu, L. Moldoveanu, Constantin Scafesu, G. Sefendache, G. Vucenicu. This count may include \"Red\" sympathizers: according to Marton, the Faction only had 25 deputies, and the \"Reds\" 32—at 57 seats, their alliance actually had a slim majority; government was backed by neutral \"Whites\", and by a slim majority of senators. Moreover, the caucus of various liberal groups and tendencies was especially weak, ridiculed by outsiders as a \"perfectly undecided\" legislature.\n\nIn Chamber, Voinov had verbal duels with moderates such as Constantin Boerescu over suspicions of electoral fraud by political bosses. During such bouts, he insisted that the Civic Guard had moral a duty to \"rise up and protect\" the people. There were other calls for a revolution in Wallachia, all sparked by popular support for the French Empire during the Franco-Prussian War—while Carol and some of his ministers favored the German coalition. In radical circles, despite an awareness that France was under an illiberal regime, the war was depicted as a struggle \"between freedom and despotism.\" After some reluctance, with Ionescu noting that nobody in Europe cared about Romania's positioning, the Francophile tenets were also taken up by the Factionalists. In Chamber, Ionescu and Gheorghiu spoke against neutrality, asking Epureanu and Carp to at least express moral sympathy for France, and proposing that Chamber be put in control of foreign policies.\n\nBy August, Wallachian radicals became involved in the incident known as \"Republic of Ploiești\", which ended in a police round-up of prominent \"Reds\". Several were tried for sedition, but acquitted by a sympathetic jury. \"Dreptatea\" condemned the \"ridiculous rebellion\", arguing that its instigators were inconsistent democrats, and dwelling on the older critique of Wallachian centralism; the \"republic\", Ionescu theorized, would only have reinforced the subjugation of Moldavian communes, while also imposing a one-party regime. This denunciation, Marton notes, was possibly prompted by fear of prosecution—in Chamber, Negură and Ionescu pushed through a declaration that denounced sedition, but also proclaimed their support for democratic change and for more parliamentary control. In addition, Ionescu expressed solidarity with the chief conspirator, Alexandru Candiano-Popescu. The Faction then announced its alternative program to devolve the country into an elective monarchy, as a necessary transition to full republicanism.\n\nThe resulting dispute led to a motion of no confidence, and Epureanu was deposed. This marked Ion Ghica's return as Prime Minister, a temporary arrangement which seemed to satisfy both the \"Reds\" and the Faction. Faced with mounting opposition, Carol threatened to resign, and another conspiracy, headed by Eugeniu Carada, prepared to take over government; the status quo was preserved only after Brătianu asked Carada to rescind. The \"Reds\" reverted to an earlier stance, and endorsed Carol as the legitimate \"Domnitor\"; Ionescu and the Faction agitated for the election of a Romanian monarch, but superficially endorsed legalism, and recognized Carol as a legitimate ruler.\n\nThe period was also marked by another controversy, called \"Strousberg Affair\", which tarnished the early history of Romanian railways, rekindled xenophobia, and endangered Romania's relations with the German Empire. This scandal emerged from laws that the Faction had approved of or abstained on (excluding Lăzărescu-Laerțiu, who was an early opponent of the deal); nevertheless, it was largely attributed to the German and Jewish scheming. Following the anti-German riot at Casa Capșa, which he blamed on poor crowd control, Carol ordered Ghica's cabinet to resign. After again threatening to resign himself, he eventually settled on creating a \"White\" cabinet under Lascăr Catargiu. The situation upset Factionalist deputies: alongside their \"Red\" colleague Nicolae Fleva, Ionescu, Gheorghiu and Codrescu alleged that Catargiu was being forced on them by the Romanian military, and more discreetly by Germany.\n\nIn April 1871, Carol and Foreign Minister Gheorghe Costaforu traveled to Moldavia, contacting the monarchist circles, in particular \"Junimea\". At the time, arch-conservatives and some of their \"Junimist\" backers caused a stir with their endorsement of Grigore Sturdza's bills to amend the constitution. These endorsed a more stringent limitation of suffrage, the screening of senators by the \"Domnitor\", the death penalty for murder, and curbs on press freedom. More controversially, Sturdza and his allies also favored opening the country to German colonists. These proposals went unanswered, with Ionescu and Kogălniceanu threatening a revolt of the people. However, the conservative trend was consolidated in the May 1871 election. The opposition was again coalesced: the Factionalists, the \"Reds\", and Kogălniceanu all stood for the \"convened liberal party\" or \"the left\"; nevertheless, the \"Whites\" had a solid win. It inaugurated five years of conservative government, with Catargiu as Prime Minister, while conspiratorial republicans, including Brătianu and C. A. Rosetti, failed to win seats. Speaking for the far-left opposition, Hasdeu claimed that the election had been rigged, since intellectuals and aristocrats such as Maiorescu and Sturdza had been elected by peasant voters in the 4th College.\n\nCatargiu's administration brought the \"routinization of political conflict\", which, although violent in tone, remained mindful of constitutional arrangements. It also witnessed the peak of reciprocal attacks between \"Junimea\" and the Faction: as deputy, and then as Education Minister, Maiorescu began investigating the politicization of higher learning, and in particular the work of Ionescu and other Factionalists at Iași University. Such measures prompted Cobălcescu, who represented the University, to resign from Senate. However, both Maiorescu and Ionescu were incensed when a \"White\" minister, Christian Tell, forced provincial academics to choose between their chairs and their deputy seats in Bucharest.\n\nIn 1871–1874, the dispute between Ionescu and Maiorescu focused on the rural communes, their administration and economy. The new law of 1874 imposed centralization, allowing government to select mayors from a pool of elected councilors. In his interventions, Ionescu supported communal autonomy as the basis for democratic self-government. Instead, Maiorescu noted that the democratic experiment had only created frail institutions, and proposed to curb this with \"feudalism\", by giving rich landowners over-representation in communal councils. In parallel, at Iași, Holban, Tacu and the Corjescus mounted the opposition against a \"Junimist\" communal administration, headed by Mayor Nicolae Gane and Prefect Leon C. Negruzzi (Iacob's brother). As Ceaur-Aslan lost an auction to pave the city streets, a Factionalist newspaper, \"Uniunea Liberală\" (\"Liberal Union\"), claimed that Gane's public works were a graft from the Catargiu spoils system. In November 1872, Gane and Holban almost dueled over the insinuations.\n\nIonescu was also highly critical of the Conservative laws on labor contracts, arguing that hired hands had been stripped of all means to pressure their landowning employers. By then, Maiorescu also took a more protectionist stance than Sturdza, Costaforu, and Factionalists such as Ceaur-Aslan, demanding that foreign investors be barred from buying land in Romania for a period of ten years; his opponents only demanded a two-year term. Ionescu, for his part, supported the establishment of native credit unions with the introduction of unrestricted capitalism, and spoke out against state monopolies for tobacco and alcohol.\n\nFrom early 1871, the \"Reds\" began talks of fusion with the Factionalists and with all other liberal clubs. The cause was popularized by the two new Factionalist organs: \"Uniunea Liberală\" and \"Gazeta de Bacău\" (\"Bacău Gazette\"). These negotiations took years: the alliance, also known as the coalition of \"Mozhar Pasha\", only transformed itself into the National Liberal Party (PNL) in 1875 or after. According to some accounts, the Faction joined the coalition, but not the party. Other sources suggest that the Faction, including its rural chapters, was \"folded into the bosom of the Liberal Party\".\n\nThe elections of that year also created an understanding between Epureanu's \"independent conservative\" faction and Brătianu, allowing them to govern together. In the electoral sweep of 1876, 18 Factionalists, including Ionescu, took seats as PNL deputies. The PNL's secure victory, and a subsequent rapprochement with Carol, toned down republicanism, which was only expressed by dissenters such as Rosetti and Carada. As leader of the Faction, his name absent from the cabinet proposal, Ionescu also continued to voice the old credo, insisting that the republic was \"the most liberal, most democratic, most perfect\" regime. Against the changing consensus, he also defended alleged perpetrators of antisemitic violence.\n\nWith Brătianu as head of government, Ionescu served briefly as Vice President of Chamber. Following a reshuffle, during which the moderates again withdrew and the Faction became an important partner in government, he was appointed Foreign Minister. The younger Factionalist, Ștefan C. Șendrea, was one of his trusted secretaries. Their policy still differed from the PNL's: Ionescu did not look favorably on the project to shed Ottoman suzerainty, and felt that Romania should declare herself a neutral country. Since the guarantees of the Treaty of Paris would have been voided by independence, he feared that the country would end up under a foreign occupation, and was especially troubled by any empowerment of the Russian Empire. During his time in office, Ionescu also toned down his own protectionism. He supported fixed tariffs against Kogălniceanu's free-trade agenda, but argued that import substitution industrialization generated \"bad, overpriced merchandise\"; by 1877, he endorsed reciprocal free-trade agreements with the major exporters of Western Europe. In other areas, the Faction took the initiative for asserting Romanian autonomy. By December 1876, Factionalist deputies, led by Andrei Vizanti, submitted a project to set up the National Bank of Romania. The motion, criticized in the press as amateurish, was eventually defeated in that form.\n\nThis period in government preceded the Faction's ultimate downfall. Now identified as one of the \"center-left\" parliamentary leaders, Ionescu parted with the Faction during his tenure, leaving his Moldavian colleagues in Chamber as an unaffiliated group. In February 1877, Kogălniceanu, George D. Vernescu and other moderates withdrew from the embryonic PNL, leaving it to be taken over by the \"Reds\"; the Faction remained aligned with the \"Mozhar Pasha\" group. Its list of adversaries included, from April, a Moderate Liberal Party—formed in Moldavia by Kogălniceanu and Mârzescu, alongside Eugeniu Alcaz, Vasile Conta, and Telemac Ciupercescu. Also antisemitic, this new group saw itself as a morally superior alternative on the left, specifically designed to replace the Faction. Kogălniceanu in particular criticized Ionescu's performance at Foreign Affairs, accusing him of incompetence and of wasting government resources on the Factionalist political machine; he called on Brătianu to renounce his alliance with Ionescu's \"insignificant liberal group\". He achieved this goal the same month, when he himself took up the position of Foreign Minister. Other Factionalists continued to serve in more minor positions: Gheorghian was Prefect of Iași County, but constantly pressured by the Moderate Liberals into resigning.\n\nManaged by Brătianu and Kogălniceanu, and under a temporary truce between the PNL and the \"Whites\", the country pursued her independence, entering the Russo-Turkish War. On May 9, 1877, as Kogălniceanu proclaimed national sovereignty, Ionescu was one of two deputies to abstain. As a Factionalist senator, Voinov voted against independence. However, other Factionalists, including Vizanti and Tzony, enlisted for service in the Civic Guard of Iași, training alongside adversaries such as Carp, Maiorescu, and Pogor. During the war, Ionescu resumed his campaigning for a more liberal regime for land-and-labor disputes. He and Vizanti proposed state regulations of contracts between landowners and peasants, as well as a continued system of land distribution from state property to landless veterans.\nBy February 1878, various Factionalists were questioning Ionescu's authority, and considering a merger with either the PNL or the Moderate Liberals. The PNL \"Reds\" were again nominally allied with the Faction, pushing aside Kogălniceanu—the latter's party sided instead with a Conservative-Liberal group, headed by the old anti-Factionalist Sturdza. During the election of April, the PNL list in Iași was headlined by the former \"Junimist\" Vasile Alecsandri, with Fătu, Gheorghian, Gheorghiu, Holban, Pastia, and A. Șendrea among the lesser candidates; \"Junimea\" and the Conta–Mârzescu–Ciupercescu group ran on the Conservative-Liberal ticket. As Minister of the Interior, C. A. Rosetti visited Iași and met with the Factionalist leaders at România Hotel. Fearful of not losing electoral power and hence offices, they vetoed Rosetti's plan to rewrite the constitution.\n\nThe party soon switched tactics: Tacu and his younger disciple, Coco Dimitrescu-Iași, were putting out the group's newspaper, \"Mișcarea Națională\" (\"National Movement\"), strongly anti-government and critical of Brătianu's \"Byzantinism\". The debates over antisemitism were rekindled by the Congress of Berlin, which asked Romania to naturalize its Jews. The PNL divided itself over the issue, and the Factionalists reemerged with their old nationalist message. However, they found themselves unable to compete with a younger category of antisemitic activists, rallied by Conta. Ionescu objected to the liberalization of citizenship laws, describing them the process as a \"stain on modern Romanian society.\" While Rosetti and his \"Românul\" advocated a compromise, Ionescu and Vernescu proposed defying the international consensus, even at the risk of independence not being recognized; they only recommended naturalizing those Jews \"who will ask us to\". Tzony took a more moderate position, advocating citizenship rights for Jewish war veterans and, \"in due time\", emancipation for the community as a whole.\n\nDuring the election of 1879, Factionalists endorsed Catargiu's catch-all Conservative Party, and ran on a common list. The alliance was defeated, obtaining only 15 seats in Chamber; a full merger between the two parties was not attempted, with the Conservatives noting that they \"needed no such grafting.\" By January 1880, with most of the Moderate Liberals absorbed into the PNL, Ionescu and some who had debuted with the Faction, including Ștefan Șendrea, joined Vernescu's own Sincere Liberal Party, which sought to reclaim the middle-class vote. Ionescu was for a while a member of the Central Committee of that party, which was sometimes referred to as the \"Vernescu–Ionescu liberal faction\". According to seething diary entries by \"Domnitor\" Carol, in 1881 Catargiu, Vernescu and Ionescu had formed \"something like a party\", and were filibustering in Chamber against PNL laws.\n\nAllied with Rosetti, Ionescu was unable to make the constitution itself more liberal, but, in 1882, managed to reform the labor contracts. By then, he had renounced the cause of republicanism, backing the Kingdom of Romania upon its proclamation in March 1881. H was also warning against anti-state agitation by the socialists and foreign \"Nihilists\", while rejecting a PNL project to place all radicals under police supervision. In socialist circles, Holban and Tzony were known for participating in the crackdown against Moldavian socialism: allegedly, they engineered the persecution of Nikolai Sudzilovsky, Theodor Speranția, and Ioan Nădejde.\n\nFrom 1880, the PNL chapters in Moldavia had begun a focused campaign to \"coerce [the Faction] into merging with the National Liberal party.\" As a sign of this rapprochement, in 1882 several old Factionalist parliamentarians, including Ionescu, supported measures to fold the Civic Guard into the regular army. Before the election of 1884, Tacu, Ștefan Șendrea, Gheorghiu and their colleagues left the Faction to take up PNL seats in Chamber, being criticized by the anti-Brătianu camp for their quick transformation into disciplined party cadres. That year, Ionescu won a deputy's seat at Roman, returning to Chamber for a final term in the October 1888 election, but at Iași. His Sincere Liberals still existed, absorbing remnants of the Moderate Liberal Party. Ionescu was again hostile to Carol, now King of the Romanians, objecting to the creation of a Crown Domain under Ioan Kalinderu and defending Tzony when the latter was indicted for \"lèse-majesté\". Following the peasant riots of Ilfov County, put down by a Conservative administration, he asked for a formal inquiry—although he also supported the Conservative focus on a balanced budget.\n\nAccording to Conservative reports, in 1887 the Faction still existed as a distinct chapter within the PNL \"collective\", kept alive by the spoils system and working to \"falsify public opinion\" on the side of the PNL. In 1889, Ionescu was an unaffiliated deputy, but loosely associated with George Panu's Radicals; his own son Eugen had joined \"Junimea\"s parliamentary group. Ionescu Sr eventually joined the PNL in 1890, after which his political involvement was reduced to occasional speeches. Like Eugen, who also joined the PNL, Ionescu remained essentially an outsider, \"free and independent\" within the party. In contrast, Holban, who still regarded himself as the Factionalist leader, crossed the floor and, by 1894, was one of the Conservative bosses in Iași—alongside Sturdza and \"Junimists\" such as Pogor and the Negruzzis. In 1902, Hasdeu wrote the Faction's epitaph, noting that it had burned its \"rather short fuse\", whereas \"Junimea\", being able to canvass outside Moldavia, \"lasted longer.\"\n"}

Borradori is a specialist in Social and political theory, Aesthetics, and the philosophy of terrorism. A crucial focus of her work is fostering new avenues of communication between rival philosophical lineages, including the analytical and Continental traditions, liberalism and communitarianism, as well as deconstruction and Critical Theory. To invigorate this exchange, she pioneered the scholarly interview as a new philosophical genre.\n\nIn her anthology, \"Recoding Metaphysics: The New Italian Philosophy,\" Borradori presented late 20th-century Italian thinkers, such as Gianni Vattimo, Massimo Cacciari, Mario Perniola,and Emanuele Severino, to the American audience. In \"The American Philosopher: Conversations with Quine, Davidson, Putnam, Nozick, Danto, Rorty, Cavell, MacIntyre, Kuhn,\" she pressed her interlocutors to reflect on their relation to history, the weight of tradition in philosophy, and their encounters with pragmatism and logical positivism. \"The American Philosopher\" was one of the first critical examinations of the historical and institutional context in which contemporary American philosophy operates.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Borradori became a strong voice in the study of terrorism from a philosophical perspective. Her latest book, \"Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida,\" seeks to evaluate the full philosophical and political significance of 9/11 in conversation with two important European thinkers. Overcoming their historical enmity, Habermas and Derrida appear in her book side by side for the first time in their lives. Borradori's book opened the way for their critical collaboration on the public sphere, which continued with a declaration of support for the anti-war demonstrations of February 15, 2003. Entitled, \"February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe,\" their joint statement appeared simultaneously in major European newspapers and was later published in \"Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe\" (Verso, 2005).\n\nIn \"Philosophy in a Time of Terror\", Borradori asserts that militant religious fundamentalists explicitly reject secularization and modernity, which constitute the conceptual foundations of the Enlightenment. This leads Borradori to claim that an appropriate response to 9/11 must reach \"as far as a critical reassessment of the validity of the Enlightenment project\" (10).\n\nWhile Habermas's allegiance to Enlightenment principles has been uncontroversial, Derrida's explicit defense of them is an important achievement of this book. Another remarkable result is to have identified Immanuel Kant as a key reference point in the post-9/11 world. Guided by Borradori's questions, Habermas and Derrida discuss their different interpretations of Kant's legacy, both agreeing, however, with the crux of his political philosophy: the legitimacy of international legal and political institutions as a condition for global justice.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4168072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4168072", "title": "Information ethics", "text": "Information ethics\n\nInformation ethics has been defined as \"the branch of ethics that focuses on the relationship between the creation, organization, dissemination, and use of information, and the ethical standards and moral codes governing human conduct in society\". The term \"information ethics\" was first coined by Robert Hauptman and used in the book \"Ethical challenges in librarianship\". It examines the morality that comes from information as a resource, a product, or as a target. It provides a critical framework for considering moral issues concerning informational privacy, moral agency (e.g. whether artificial agents may be moral), new environmental issues (especially how agents should behave in the infosphere), problems arising from the life-cycle (creation, collection, recording, distribution, processing, etc.) of information (especially ownership and copyright, digital divide, and digital rights). It is very vital to understand that librarians, archivists, information professionals among others, really understand the importance of knowing how to disseminate proper information as well as being responsible with their actions when addressing information.\n\nInformation ethics has evolved to relate to a range of fields such as computer ethics, medical ethics, journalism and the philosophy of information.\n\nDilemmas regarding the life of information are becoming increasingly important in a society that is defined as \"the information society\". The explosion of so much technology has brought information ethics to a forefront in ethical considerations. Information transmission and literacy are essential concerns in establishing an ethical foundation that promotes fair, equitable, and responsible practices. Information ethics broadly examines issues related to ownership, access, privacy, security, and community. It is also concerned with relational issues such as \"the relationship between information and the good of society, the relationship between information providers and the consumers of information\".\n\nInformation technology affects common issues such as copyright protection, intellectual freedom, accountability, privacy, and security. Many of these issues are difficult or impossible to resolve due to fundamental tensions between Western moral philosophies (based on rules, democracy, individual rights, and personal freedoms) and the traditional Eastern cultures (based on relationships, hierarchy, collective responsibilities, and social harmony). The multi-faceted dispute between Google and the government of the People's Republic of China reflects some of these fundamental tensions.\n\nProfessional codes offer a basis for making ethical decisions and applying ethical solutions to situations involving information provision and use which reflect an organization's commitment to responsible information service. Evolving information formats and needs require continual reconsideration of ethical principles and how these codes are applied. Considerations regarding information ethics influence \"personal decisions, professional practice, and public policy\". Therefore, ethical analysis must provide a framework to take into consideration \"many, diverse domains\" (ibid.) regarding how information is distributed.\n\nThe main, peer-reviewed, academic journals reporting on information ethics are the \"Journal of the Association for Information Systems\", the flagship publication of the Association for Information Systems, and \"Ethics and Information Technology\", published by Springer.\n\nThe field of information ethics has a relatively short but progressive history having been recognized in the United States for nearly 20 years. The origins of the field are in librarianship though it has now expanded to the consideration of ethical issues in other domains including computer science, the internet, media, journalism, management information systems, and business.\n\nEvidence of scholarly work on this subject can be traced to the 1980s, when an article authored by Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim and published in the \"Journal of Information Science\", discussed issues relating to the field including confidentiality, information biases, and quality control. Another scholar, Robert Hauptman, has also written extensively about information ethics in the library field and founded the \"Journal of Information Ethics\" in 1992.\n\nCensorship is an issue commonly involved in the discussion of information ethics because it describes the inability to access or express opinions or information based on the belief it is bad for others to view this opinion or information. Sources that are commonly censored include books, articles, speeches, art work, data, music and photos. Censorship can be perceived both as ethical and non-ethical in the field of information ethics.\n\nThose who believe censorship is ethical say the practice prevents readers from being exposed to offensive and objectionable material. Topics such as sexism, racism, homophobia, and anti-semitism are present in public works and are widely seen as unethical in the public eye. There is concern regarding the exposure of these topics to the world, especially the young generation. The Australian Library Journal states proponents for censorship in libraries, the practice of librarians deciphering which books/ resources to keep in their libraries, argue the act of censorship is an ethical way to provide information to the public that is considered morally sound, allowing positive ethics instead of negative ethics to be dispersed. According to the same journal, librarians have an \"ethical duty\" to protect the minds, particularly young people, of those who read their books through the lens of censorship to prevent the readers from adopting the unethical ideas and behaviors portrayed in the books.\n\nHowever, others in the field of information ethics argue the practice of censorship is unethical because it fails to provide all available information to the community of readers. British philosopher John Stuart Mill argued censorship is unethical because it goes directly against the moral concept of utilitarianism. Mill believes humans are unable to have true beliefs when information is withheld from the population via censorship and acquiring true beliefs without censorship leads to greater happiness. According to this argument, true beliefs and happiness (of which both concepts are considered ethical) cannot be obtained through the practice of censorship. Librarians and others who disperse information to the public also face the dilemma of the ethics of censorship through the argument that censorship harms students and is morally wrong because they are unable to know the full extent of knowledge available to the world. The debate of information ethics in censorship was highly contested when schools removed information about evolution from libraries and curriculums due to the topic conflicting with religious beliefs. In this case, advocates against ethics in censorship argue it is more ethical to include multiple sources information on a subject, such as creation, to allow the reader to learn and decipher their beliefs.\n\nEthical concerns regarding international security, surveillance, and the right to privacy are on the rise. The issues of security and privacy commonly overlap in the field of information, due to the interconnectedness of online research and the development of Information Technology (IT). Some of the areas surrounding security and privacy are identity theft, online economic transfers, medical records, and state security. Companies, organizations, and institutions use databases to store, organize, and distribute user's information—with or without their knowledge.\n\nThe more recent trend of medical records is to digitize them. The sensitive information secured within medical records makes security measure vitally important. The ethical concern of medical records is great within the context of emergency wards, where any patient records can be accessed at all times. Within an emergency ward, patient medical records need to be available for quick access; however, this means that all medical records can be accessed at any moment within emergency wards with or without the patient present.\n\nWarfare has also changed the security of countries within the 21st Century. After the events of 9-11 and other terrorism attacks on civilians, surveillance by states raises ethical concerns of the individual privacy of citizens. The USA PATRIOT Act 2001 is a prime example of such concerns. Many other countries, especially European nations within the current climate of terrorism, is looking for a balancing between stricter security and surveillance, and not committing the same ethical concerns associated with the USA Patriot Act. International security is moving to towards the trends of cybersecurity and unmanned systems, which involve the military application of IT. Ethical concerns of political entities regarding information warfare include the unpredictability of response, difficulty differentiating civilian and military targets, and conflict between state and non-state actors.\n\n\n\n"}

He took the position of usher at the grammar-school of Aberdeen in 1758.\n\nIn 1760, he was, to his surprise, appointed Professor of moral philosophy at Marischal College (later part of Aberdeen University) as a result of the influence exerted by his close friend, Robert Arbuthnot of Haddo. In the following year he published a volume of poems, \"The Judgment of Paris\" (1765), which attracted attention. The two works, however, which brought him most fame were \"An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth\", and his poem of \"The Minstrel\". The \"Essay\", intended as an answer to David Hume, had great immediate success, and led to an introduction to the King, a pension of £200, and the degree of LL.D. from Oxford. The first book of \"The Minstrel\" was published in 1771 and the second in 1774, and constitutes his true title to remembrance, winning him the praise of Samuel Johnson. It contains much beautiful descriptive writing.\n\nBeattie was prominent in arguing against the institution of slavery, notably in his \"Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth\" (1770), and in \"Elements of Moral Science\" (1790-1793) where he used the case of Dido Belle to argue the mental capacity of blacks.\n\nBeattie was an amateur cellist and member of the Aberdeen Musical Society. He considered questions of music philosophy in his essay \"On Poetry and Music\" (written 1762, published 1776), which was republished several times and translated into French in 1798. His poem \"The Hermit\" was set to music by Tommaso Giordani (1778).\n\nBeattie was co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783.\n\nJames Beattie was born the son of a shopkeeper and small farmer at Laurencekirk in the Mearns, and educated at Marischal, graduating in 1753.\n\nBeattie underwent much domestic sorrow in his later years, which broke down his own health and spirits. His wife, Mary \"née\" Dunn, whom he had married in 1767, went mad and was committed to a Musselburgh asylum. His two promising sons both died: James Hay in 1790 aged 22 from \"nervous atrophy\", and Montagu in 1796 aged 18 after a short illness. \n\nHe relinquished his duties at Marischal in 1797. That year he became afflicted with rheumatism, and in 1799 he had a stroke of palsy. He died in Aberdeen in 1803 and is buried there in St Nicholas' Churchyard.\n\nHis niece, Margaret Valentine, married Rev Prof George Glennie FRSE.\n\nA biographical sketch, \"An Account of the Life of James Beattie, LL.D.\", was published in 1804 by Alexander Bower.\n\nThe poet Robert Burns informed Mrs Frances Dunlop in a letter that the idea of using Coila as the name of his poetic muse first came to him from Beattie's use of a muse named 'Scota' in his Scots language poem of 1768 titled \"To Mr Alexander at Lochlee.\"\n\nBeattie is one of the sixteen Scottish poets and writers depicted on the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh.

However, he is well known for his other activities – the life philosophy of Existence and, as part of it, biotronics - both initiated by him at Easter 1945 when he experienced a kind of awakening, a state of open consciousness, and thereupon he practised and developed them both for all his lifetime.\n\nIn 1968, with the assistance of the Czechoslovak Minister of Health, Mr. Vlček, biotronics got closer to its incorporation within the national healthcare system but all those efforts were interrupted by the August 1968 occupation by the Warsaw Pact allied forces. In 1982 Josef Zezulka conducted research into biotronics treatment in the Vimperk hospital. The research was managed by the Psychoenergetic Laboratory of Professor Kahuda. Josef Zezulka practised healing mainly in his own flat where people used to go and seek help. He practised healing for more than 40 years.\n\nHis lectures on the philosophy of Existence were more or less secret (the communist Czechoslovakia period was not favourable for such activities) and numerous lectures were held in various private flats. One of the exceptions was the International Congress on Psychotronic Research held in Prague in 1973, where he gave a very successful public speech. At the same time he was secretly writing the teaching down while his friends were transcribing and making copies of his books and essays. The essays were also published in western countries within various publications. His philosophical-religious books were published only after 1989. He died in 1992.\n\nIt was Josef Zezulka who conceived and fulfilled the word \"biotronics\" as one of the healing forms. According to Zezulka, humans are made of three basic components: matter, spirit and vitality. Diseases are subject to the same categorization. Zezulka’s biotronics pertains to complementing and harmonization of the vital body forces in particular. He claims that every human has a basic quota of body forces that are necessary for life. Furthermore, each organ and cell has its own force system. All these systems are interlinked, and the healer-biotronic focuses healing on those force systems when they are disrupted or harmed. Zezulka practised healing completely free of charge. His disciple and entrusted successor Tomáš Pfeiffer says that biotronics does not replace medicine but wants to take care of a vital forces area in which conventional medicine is failing. Currently, Petition for Support of Biotronics is being carried out; it is aimed at having biotronics accepted into the public healthcare system – which is what also Josef Zezulka was striving for.\n\n\"Excerpted from the book BYTÍ - EXISTENCE - A Philosophy for Life \"\n\nHis philosophy of Existence encompasses a wide range of philosophical and religious phenomena. It also deals with cosmology and biophysics. The Podstata (God) from which everything that exists emerged by dividing. This gave rise to matter, spirit, and vitality that permeates the first two, bringing them to life. Matter, spirit and vitality are composed of four basic elements which are centripetal force, centrifugal force, heat and cold; Josef Zezulka calls this process and division The Creative Four. All is subject to the same laws of nature. He sees cycles, oscillation in everything – in the breath of a man, in the breath of the planet (cycles of the seasons), but also in the so-called breath of universe where four phases cyclically rotate. We are currently in the centripetal-cold phase during which everything is cooling down. In this phase matter and spirit permeated through each other and therewith the first being emerged, the first ‘I am’.\n\nA being develops, it reincarnates into higher and higher species. The process of rebirth (reincarnation) is an integral part of the teaching as well as the so-called Law of Reflection (Zákon odrazu) which is known as Karma by the people of India. The law states that whatever the being does, it receives the same back, usually in its next life. Over time more and more new evolutionary species emerge. The particularity of the concept is that it does not end with humans, however, he claims that after humans a higher species will emerge, then even a higher one and so forth and so on. The whole cycle shall be completed by merging with God – Podstata. It also emphasises the planetary cycles, e.g. the Platonic year that lasts about 24,000 years – on the ridge of which a crisis period apparently rises; we currently live in one such period, and this is why there are those disturbances and terror in the world.\n\nVegetarianism is strongly emphasised in the teaching, here the term \"You shall not kill\" is extended to all animals. An integral part is the contemplation on the meaning of life which, according to Josef Zezulka, is \"To be a positive component of the Creative Work\". Time represents another variable he describes as follows: there is in fact no time, everything still exists, persists. Only we, with our consciousness as we live our life, are firmly fixed to time. Furthermore, he divides the thinking into equal parts: belief (intuition) and knowledge (reason). It is a mistake to solely believe, it is a mistake to solely use reason. Ideal is the balance – kalokagathia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46426065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46426065", "title": "Logic", "text": "Logic\n\nLogic (from the ), originally meaning \"the word\" or \"what is spoken\", but coming to mean \"thought\" or \"reason\", is a subject concerned with the most general laws of truth, and is now generally held to consist of the systematic study of the form of valid inference. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its conclusion. (In ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as \"therefore\", \"hence\", \"ergo\", and so on.)\n\nThere is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic (see , below), but it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the 'logical form' common to all valid arguments, the study of inference, including fallacies, and the study of semantics, including paradoxes. Historically, logic has been studied in philosophy (since ancient times) and mathematics (since the mid-19th century), and recently logic has been studied in computer science, linguistics, psychology, and other fields.\n\nThe concept of logical form is central to logic. The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional Aristotelian syllogistic logic and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.\n\nHowever, agreement on what logic is has remained elusive, and although the field of universal logic has studied the common structure of logics, in 2007 Mossakowski et al. commented that \"it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of 'a logic'\".\n\nLogic is generally considered formal when it analyzes and represents the \"form\" of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.\n\nThis is called showing the \"logical form\" of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as \"but\") with logical conjunctions like \"and\" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions (\"any\", \"every\", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as \"all\", or the universal quantifier ∀).\n\nSecond, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression \"all Ps are Qs\" shows the logical form common to the sentences \"all men are mortals\", \"all cats are carnivores\", \"all Greeks are philosophers\", and so on. The schema can further be condensed into the formula \"A(P,Q)\", where the letter \"A\" indicates the judgement 'all - are -'.\n\nThe importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in \"Prior Analytics\", leading Jan Łukasiewicz to say that the introduction of variables was \"one of Aristotle's greatest inventions\". According to the followers of Aristotle (such as Ammonius), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms \"man\", \"mortal\", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", which were called the \"matter\" (Greek \"hyle\") of the inference.\n\nThere is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the predicate calculus that is the fundamental advance of modern logic. The formula \"A(P,Q)\" (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula formula_1 in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for universal quantification and implication rather than just the predicate letter \"A\" and using variable arguments formula_2 where traditional logic uses just the term letter \"P\". With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.\n\nThe validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or \"semantics\" of the sentences that make it up.\n\nAristotle's Organon, especially \"On Interpretation\", gives a cursory outline of semantics which the scholastic logicians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called Supposition Theory. This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or \"stand for\" certain extra-linguistic items. For example, in part II of his Summa Logicae, William of Ockham presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not. Thus \"every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand.\" \n\nEarly modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas. Antoine Arnauld in the Port Royal Logic, says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called \"affirming\" or \"denying\", and in general \"judging\". Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas. This suggests obvious difficulties, leading Locke to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind. This view (psychologism) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.\n\nModern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions. However, the introduction of quantification, needed to solve the problem of multiple generality, rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics. The main modern approach is \"model-theoretic semantics\", based on Alfred Tarski's semantic theory of truth. The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of interpretation functions from them to some predefined domain of discourse: an interpretation of first-order predicate logic is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of individuals, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values \"true\" and \"false\". Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of model theory. Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the proof-theoretic semantics that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of Gerhard Gentzen on structural proof theory and is heavily influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophy, especially his aphorism \"meaning is use\".\n\n\"Inference\" is not to be confused with \"implication\". An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false. The Stoic logician Philo of Megara was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true. An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'. An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid. However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is \"true\", the inference 'p therefore q' is \"valid\". This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.\n\nThe theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as William of Ockham and Walter Burley. It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's Topics and Boethius' \"De Syllogismis hypotheticis\". This is why many terms in logic are Latin. For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as modus ponens (or 'mode of positing'). Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'. The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.\n\nHowever, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called 'hypothetical syllogism' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'. This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'. The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the Encyclopædia Britannica article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.\n\nA formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that logical systems can have are:\n\nSome logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific axioms to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.\n\nAs the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to rationality. Here we have defined logic to be \"the systematic study of the form of arguments\"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.\n\nDeductive reasoning concerns the logical consequence of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.\n\nThere are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic. These include inductive reasoning, which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and abductive reasoning, which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence. The American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) first introduced the term as \"guessing\". Peirce said that to \"abduce\" a hypothetical explanation formula_3 from an observed surprising circumstance formula_4 is to surmise that formula_3 may be true because then formula_4 would be a matter of course. Thus, to abduce formula_3 from formula_4 involves determining that formula_3 is sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary, for formula_4.\n\nWhile inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success. For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or \"strength\", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion. Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of semantics, inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association rule induction, while others may use mathematical models of probability such as decision trees.\n\nLogic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of argumentation. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" that logic \"does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of rationality. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations.\"\n\nLogic has been defined as \"the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form\". This has not been the definition taken in this article, but the idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to logicism in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy. A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic. Robert Brandom has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of material inference (in the terminology of Wilfred Sellars), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.\n\nIn Europe, logic was first developed by Aristotle. Aristotelian logic became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th century. Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal modal logic, and inductive logic, as well as influential terms such as terms, predicables, syllogisms and propositions. In Europe during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with Christian faith. During the High Middle Ages, logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of scholasticism. In 1323, William of Ockham's influential \"Summa Logicae\" was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in Holberg's satirical play \"Erasmus Montanus\".\n\nThe Chinese logical philosopher Gongsun Long () proposed the paradox \"One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two.\" In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the Qin dynasty following the legalist philosophy of Han Feizi.\n\nIn India, the Anviksiki school of logic was founded by Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE). Innovations in the scholastic school, called Nyaya, continued from ancient times into the early 18th century with the Navya-Nyaya school. By the 16th century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as Gottlob Frege's \"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\" and his \"definition of number\", as well as the theory of \"restrictive conditions for universals\" anticipating some of the developments in modern set theory. Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as Charles Babbage, Augustus De Morgan, and George Boole. In the 20th century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.\n\nThe syllogistic logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th century, when interest in the foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called mathematical logic). In 1854, George Boole published \"An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities\", introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as Boolean logic. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published \"Begriffsschrift\", which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of quantifier notation. From 1910 to 1913, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell published \"Principia Mathematica\" on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. In 1931, Gödel raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.\n\nThe development of logic since Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see analytic philosophy) and philosophy of mathematics. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer logic circuits and is fundamental to computer science. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments, often as a compulsory discipline.\n\nThe \"Organon\" was Aristotle's body of work on logic, with the \"Prior Analytics\" constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic. The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name term logic, are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of syllogisms that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.\n\nAristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the Stoics proposed a system of propositional logic that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the problem of multiple generality was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.\n\nToday, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the predicate calculus. Others use Aristotle in argumentation theory to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in artificial intelligence and legal arguments.\n\nA propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives, and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as \"theorems\". An example of a theorem of propositional logic is formula_11, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.\n\nPredicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as first-order logic, second-order logic, many-sorted logic, and infinitary logic. It provides an account of quantifiers general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language. For example, Bertrand Russell's famous barber paradox, \"there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves\" can be formalised by the sentence formula_12, using the non-logical predicate formula_13 to indicate that \"x\" is a man, and the non-logical relation formula_14 to indicate that \"x\" shaves \"y\"; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential quantifiers, conjunction, implication, negation and biconditional.\n\nWhilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing predicate logic to solve the problem of multiple generality that had perplexed medieval logicians.\n\nThe development of predicate logic is usually attributed to Gottlob Frege, who is also credited as one of the founders of analytical philosophy, but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in Principles of Mathematical Logic by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of set theory, and allowed the development of Alfred Tarski's approach to model theory. It provides the foundation of modern mathematical logic.\n\nFrege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. Second-order logic is most prominently defended (against the criticism of Willard Van Orman Quine and others) by George Boolos and Stewart Shapiro.\n\nIn languages, modality deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, \"\"We go to the games\" can be modified to give \"We should go to the games\", and \"We can go to the games\" and perhaps \"We will go to the games\"\". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the modal fallacy.\n\nAristotle's logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous sea-battle argument in \"De Interpretatione\" § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with potentiality and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by Avicenna, who ultimately developed a theory of \"temporally modalized\" syllogistic.\n\nWhile the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include deontic logic and epistemic logic. The seminal work of Arthur Prior applied the same formal language to treat temporal logic and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. Saul Kripke discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of frame semantics, which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new graph-theoretic way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in computational linguistics and computer science, such as dynamic logic.\n\nThe motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's Organon treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of rhetoric.\n\nThis ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically dialectical logic forms the heart of a course in critical thinking, a compulsory course at many universities. Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. Dialectical logic is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in Hegelian and Marxist thought. There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as Stephen Toulmin (\"The Uses of Argument\"), Nicholas Rescher (\"Dialectics\"), and van Eemeren and Grootendorst (Pragma-dialectics). Theories of defeasible reasoning can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue. Such games can provide a formal game semantics for many logics.\n\nArgumentation theory is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in artificial intelligence and law.\n\nMathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.\n\nThe earliest use of mathematics and geometry in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as Euclid, Plato, and Aristotle. Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.\n\nOne of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the logicism pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical tautologies, and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic. The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his \"Grundgesetze\" by Russell's paradox, to the defeat of Hilbert's program by Gödel's incompleteness theorems.\n\nBoth the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of proof theory. Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, Gödel's completeness theorem, a result in model theory and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's proof calculus is enough to \"describe\" the whole of mathematics, though not \"equivalent\" to it.\n\nIf proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject. Set theory originated in the study of the infinite by Georg Cantor, and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from Cantor's theorem, through the status of the Axiom of Choice and the question of the independence of the continuum hypothesis, to the modern debate on large cardinal axioms.\n\nRecursion theory captures the idea of computation in logical and arithmetic terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem by Alan Turing, and his presentation of the Church–Turing thesis. Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of complexity classes—when is a problem efficiently solvable?—and the classification of degrees of unsolvability.\n\nPhilosophical logic deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist (\"natural\") language, that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called \"logic\" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. free logics, tense logics) as well as various extensions of classical logic (e.g. modal logics) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. Kripke's supervaluationism in the semantics of logic).\n\nLogic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.\n\nLogic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: Alan Turing's work on the \"Entscheidungsproblem\" followed from Kurt Gödel's work on the incompleteness theorems. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with mathematical notation, it would be possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In logic programming, a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as Prolog compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.\n\nToday, logic is extensively applied in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer science, and these fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. Argumentation theory is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The ACM Computing Classification System in particular regards:\n\nFurthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using automated theorem proving, the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.\n\nThe logics discussed above are all \"bivalent\" or \"two-valued\"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. Non-classical logics are those systems that reject various rules of Classical logic.\n\nHegel developed his own dialectic logic that extended Kant's transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that \"neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either–or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself\".\n\nIn 1910, Nicolai A. Vasiliev extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction. In the early 20th century Jan Łukasiewicz investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, \"possible\", so inventing ternary logic, the first multi-valued logic in the Western tradition.\n\nLogics such as fuzzy logic have since been devised with an infinite number of \"degrees of truth\", represented by a real number between 0 and 1.\n\nIntuitionistic logic was proposed by L.E.J. Brouwer as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the law of the excluded middle as part of his intuitionism. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student Arend Heyting studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did Gerhard Gentzen. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a constructive logic and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of programming languages through the formulae-as-types correspondence.\n\nModal logic is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its relational semantics is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.\n\nWhat is the epistemological status of the laws of logic? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled \"Is Logic Empirical?\" Hilary Putnam, building on a suggestion of W. V. Quine, argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of mechanics or of general relativity, and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be realists about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the principle of distributivity, substituting for classical logic the quantum logic proposed by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann.\n\nAnother paper of the same name by Michael Dummett argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity. Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, \"Is Logic Empirical?\" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in metaphysics on realism versus anti-realism.\n\nThe notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of \"if ... then ...\", due to a number of problems called the paradoxes of material implication.\n\nThe first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as \"If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5\", which are puzzling because natural language does not support the principle of explosion. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for C. I. Lewis's formulation of strict implication, which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as relevance logic.\n\nThe second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus \"if that man gets elected, granny will die\" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the Gricean maxim of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of monotonicity of entailment, such as relevance logic.\n\nHegel was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the law of non-contradiction. It was based on Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.\n\nClosely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate inconsistency. Relevance logic and paraconsistent logic are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of classical logic and some of its rivals, such as intuitionistic logic, is that they respect the principle of explosion, which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. Graham Priest, the main proponent of dialetheism, has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.\n\nThe philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no logical truths. This is in contrast with the usual views in philosophical skepticism, where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of Sextus Empiricus.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a \"... mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short ... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.\" His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that \"logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished\". Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: \"Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world\".\n\nThis position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as Jürgen Habermas, claim his position is self-refuting—and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge. Georg Lukács, in his book \"The Destruction of Reason\", asserts that, \"Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible.\" Bertrand Russell described Nietzsche's irrational claims with \"He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers\" in his book \"A History of Western Philosophy\".\n\n"}

At baptism, he received the name Francesco (Francis). Being already in a mature age in 1569, he joined the Theatines. He took Holy Orders exceptionally fast, after eight years.\n\nIn 1585 he was accused of breaking the rule. He was arrested for a year and deprived of the priestly faculties. Finally he was exculpated from blame, but he had to wait for it almost till his death. He used to endure the injust accusations and punishments with humility, sacrificing the suffering for various intentions.\n\nIn 1589 in Venice the first edition of the work of his life was printed. At once it gained huge esteem and became a bestseller. During the first 20 years it was published 60 times and translated into German, Latin, French, English and Spanish. Next there were made Portuguese, Croatian, Polish, Armenian, Greek (by Nicodemus the Hagiorite), Arabian and Japanese versions. In the 19th century, Russian monk Theophanes paraphrased it, writing \"The Invisible Fight\", a book which had big influence on the Orthodox Church. Until now there were as much as 600 editions of \"The Spiritual Combat\".\n\nThe \"Combat\" is a practical manual of living. At first it teaches that the sense of life is incessant fighting against egoistic longings and replacing them with sacrifice and charity. The one who does not do this loses, and suffers in Hell; the one who does it, trusting not in his own, but God's power, triumphs and is happy in Heaven. The work of Scupoli analyses various usual situations and advises how to cope with them, preserving a pure conscience and improving virtue. It emphasizes also the boundless goodness of God, which is the cause of all good. What is bad originates from the human who rebels against God.\n\n"}

While at Harvard she was a student of Burton Dreben. Wilson was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at Harvard in 1960-61 and then studied at Oxford University in 1963-64. Wilson spent the early years of her career as an assistant professor of philosophy at Columbia University (1965-1967), and went on to teach at the Rockefeller Institute between 1967 and 1970.\n\nIn 1970, Wilson became the first female member of faculty in the philosophy department at Princeton when she was appointed as an associate professor of philosophy. Wilson was promoted to full professor in 1975, and in 1998 was finally named Stuart Professor of Philosophy. During her tenure at Princeton she shared a department with other prominent philosophers including David Lewis, Saul Kripke, Harry Frankfurt, Gil Harman, Bas van Fraassen, Paul Benacerraf and Richard Jeffrey (she can be seen pictured with many of the same in a 1979 faculty photograph here). Wilson taught courses in Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley and other early modern philosophers as well as the Philosophy of Religion. In her scholarship, Wilson focused on the history of early modern philosophy, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of mind, and the theory of perception. Author of \"Descartes\" (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1978), as well as of many articles on 17th and 18th-century metaphysics and epistemology, some of which are collected in her, \"Ideas and Mechanism\" (1999), Wilson was also editor of \"The Essential Descartes\" (1969) and co-editor (with D.

She also served on a number of APA committees, including the Subcommittee on the Status of Women in the Profession. President of the Leibniz Society of North America from 1985–90, she was a member of numerous other associations, such as the Hobbes Society, the Hume Society, the North American Spinoza Society and the British Society for the History of Philosophy. Wilson served as a juror for the Arts and Humanities for the 1997 Heinz Foundation awards. Wilson died at the age of 59 on August 27, 1998. Since 2002, the Margaret Dauler Wilson Biennial Philosophy Conference has been held in her honor and in 2016, the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University began an occasional series of lectures in her name.

His thoughts combine natural sciences, art, and philosophy under a collective perspective and follow a definition of reality, which – under the term \"existential rationalism\" – is able to remove the separation between humanities and natural sciences.\n\nMax Bense spent his early childhood in his birthplace Strasbourg and in 1918 his family was deported from Alsace-Lorraine as a consequence of World War I. Starting in 1920, he attended grammar school in Cologne and after 1930 he studied physics, chemistry, mathematics, geology, and philosophy at the University of Bonn. During his studies, his interest in literature is revealed by several contributions to newspapers, journals, and broadcast, for which he wrote several radio dramas. In 1937 he received his doctor's degree (Dr. phil. nat.) with his dissertation \"Quantenmechanik und Daseinsrelativität\" (Quantum Mechanics and Relativity of \"Dasein\"). He used the term \"Relativity of Dasein\", which he adopted from Max Scheler, for explaining that novel theories do not have to contradict classical science. Bense – declared opponent of national socialism – knowingly opposed the Deutsche Physik of the Nazi regime (cf. Johannes Juilfs), which rejected the theory of relativity due to Einstein's Jewish origin. Therefore, he did not receive his postdoctoral qualification.\n\nIn 1938, Bense initially worked as a physicist at the Bayer AG in Leverkusen. After the outbreak of World War II he was a soldier, firstly as a meteorologist, then as a medical technician in Berlin and Georgenthal, where he was mayor for a short time after the end of the war. In 1945 the University of Jena appointed him to curator (Chancellor of the University) and offered him the possibility of postdoctoral work (habilitation), which was likely to be cumulative, at the Social-Pedagogic Faculty, which was followed by an appointment to Professor extraordinarius of philosophical and scientific propaedeutics.\n\nIn 1948, Bense fled from the political development of the Soviet occupation zone to Boppard; and he was appointed as a guest professor in philosophy and theory of science by the University of Stuttgart in 1949, and as senior lecturer (associate professor) there in 1950. In 1955, Bense raised a controversy concerning mythologizing tendencies of German postwar culture. Thereupon he became the target of public polemics, resulting in a postponement of his appointment to full professor until 1963.\n\nIn addition, he worked at the adult education center in Ulm and at the Ulm School of Design from 1953 to 1958; he was also guest professor at the Hamburg College for Visual Arts from 1958 to 1960 and in 1966/67.\n\nMax Bense became professor emeritus on February 7, 1978 and died in 1990 as an internationally accredited scientist.\n\nAlready in his first publication, \"Raum und Ich\" (\"Space and Ego\"; 1934), Bense combined theoretical philosophy with mathematics, semiotics, and aesthetics; this remained his thematic emphasis. For the first time, he phrased a rational aesthetics, which defines the components of language – words, syllables, phonemes – as a statistical language repertoire, and which opposes literature that is based upon meaning. Conversely, Bense studied the concept of style, which he applied to mathematics – following Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz' \"Mathesis Universalis\" –, designing a universal markup language. \"Die Mathematik in der Kunst\" (\"Mathematics in Art\"; 1949) was his starting point for investigating mathematical principles of form in the history of art. From this, Bense developed a perspective to see the mathematical spirit in works of literary art, especially in metrics and rhythm. Bense's thoughts assumed the correlation of a mathematical and linguistic consciousness, which have a common origin and have grown into complementary modes of thought. He considered the atomistic structures of the linguistic modes to be equivalent. By using non-interpretable basic elements (characters) and rules or operators, these forms give meaning, impart information and make stylistically formed language possible. He considered the aesthetic and the semantic information to be generally separated and not to be defined until they are used. This was the first German integration of Ludwig Wittgenstein's work into the field of aesthetics.\n\nSome of Bense's knowledge is based on the investigations of the American mathematician George David Birkhoff. Thus some termini like \"redundancy\" and \"entropy\" have to be equated with \"Ordnungsmaß\" and \"Materialverbrauch\" (consumption of material) from Birkhoff's aesthetics research.\n\nBense considered the destruction of the social and intellectual middle-class world since the beginning of the 20th century a parallel to the destruction of the concept of being in philosophy. He saw the natural world replaced by an artificial one. As a forerunner of the computer age, Bense thought about the technical counterparts of human existence; unlike many of his contemporaries he considered machines as pure products of human intelligence, having algorithms as a basis, but soon he posed ethical questions, which were not discussed in ethics of technology until decades later. His pragmatic views of technology, influenced by Walter Benjamin, which lacked either belief in progress or its rejection, brought him the criticism of Theodor W. Adorno – and again put him in the role of the opposition.\n\nInspired by neuroscience, informatics, and the occupation with electronic calculating machines, but also by Wittgenstein's concept of the language-game, Bense tried to put into perspective or to extend the traditional view of literature. In that, he was one of the first philosophers of culture who integrated the technical possibilities of the computer into their thoughts and investigated them across disciplinary boundaries. He statistically and topologically analysed linguistic phenomena, subjected them to questions of semiotic, information theory, and communication theory using structuralistic approaches. Thus Bense became the first theoretician of concrete poetry, which was started by Eugen Gomringer in 1953, and encouraged e.g. Helmut Heißenbüttel, Claus Bremer, Reinhard Döhl, Ludwig Haring, and Franz Mon to perform further experiments, and also had influence on Ernst Jandl's language deconstruction (see also Stuttgarter Gruppe/Schule).\n\nIn his work with literature and literary language, Bense was not content with only theoretical considerations; he had close contact to authors like Alfred Andersch and Arno Schmidt. His constructions of analogy to visual arts made major contributions to the understanding of cubism and dadaism.\n\nAs a theoretician of science, Bense represented the \"synthetic intellectual concept,\" where classical humanism and modern technology constructively complement one another. From this concept of science, he hoped for progressive knowledge, which must always be ethically scrutinized, and at the same time, for the prevention of regression. Because of that, Bense argued for enlightenment and put himself into that tradition.\n\nAfter 1984 Max Bense applied his theories of visual art to screen media. Because of that, early thoughts of media studies concerning the internet, especially the concept of digital poetry, may be traced back to Bense.\n\n\"All publications are in German.\"\n\n\"All references are in German.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "10401093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10401093", "title": "Moral syncretism", "text": "Moral syncretism\n\nMoral syncretism consists of the attempt to reconcile disparate or contradictory moral beliefs, often while melding the ethical practices of various schools of thought.\n\nThe requirements of a global ethic call for \"a minimal basic consensus relating to binding values, irrevocable standards and moral attitudes, which can be affirmed by all religions despite their undeniable dogmatic or theological differences and should also be supported by non-believers.\" It cannot, however, make the specific ethics of the different religions and philosophies around the world superfluous or obsolete, nor should it strive to do so.\n\nSyncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and constructive interaction between different cultures (intercultural competence), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic realms. Conversely the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of \"piety\" and \"orthodoxy,\" may help to generate, bolster or authorize a sense of cultural unity in a well-defined minority or majority. While strengthening the ethical identity of the subgroup, this is often detrimental to the unity of the whole.\n\nA cornerstone of moral syncretism is that religion cannot be morality's only arbiter.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, for example, has said that compassion and affection are human values that are independent of religion: \"We need these human values. I call these secular ethics, secular beliefs. There’s no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things.\"\n\nThis notion is also supported by the traditional Judeo-Christian concept of natural law. In his book \"On Law, Morality and Politics\", St. Thomas Aquinas identifies the innate rational nature of humans as being what defines moral law: \"The rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts.\"\n\nThis does not, however, mean secular ethics and religion are mutually exclusive. In fact, many principles, such as the Golden Rule, are present in both systems, and some religious people, as well as some Deists, prefer to adopt a rational approach to ethics.\n\nMost atheists argue that no religious basis is necessary for one to live an ethical life. They assert that atheists are as motivated towards moral behavior as anyone, or more, citing a range of non-theistic sources of moral behavior including: parental love, their conventional (or advanced) educated upbringing, natural empathy, compassion and the humane concern; respect for social norms, criminal law stemming from natural law, police or other enforced order (and in some cases society); and a desire for a good reputation and self-esteem. According to this view, ethical behavior is a natural consequence of altruistic motivation, not stemming from divine or tenet-prescribed system of punishment or reward in life and/or after death, though experiences and tentative expectations may instead play a role in forming and strengthening a moral atheist's motivations and ethics, united in rejection of any theory of all human beings' afterlife. Thus while atheism does not entail any particular moral philosophy, many atheists are drawn towards philosophies and worldviews such as: secular humanism, empiricism, objectivism, or utilitarianism, which provide a moral framework that is not founded on faith in deities.\n\nHumanists endorse universal morality based on the commonality of human nature and the belief that knowledge of right and wrong is based on our understanding of individual and joint interests, rather than a system of ethics stemming from a transcendental or arbitrarily local source, rejecting faith completely as a basis for moral action. The humanist ethics goal is a search for viable individual, social and political principles of conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.\n\nThe International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) is the worldwide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance. Member organisations and individual members are required to accept the following statement:\n\nHumanism is also known to adopt principles of the Golden Rule. As Oscar Wilde once said, \"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.\" This emphasizes a respect for other people's identities and ideals.\n\nThe School of Economic Science (SES) is an organisation based in Mandeville Place, London, founded by Leon MacLaren in 1937. Originally constituted to facilitate the study of economics, over time it came to focus on philosophy, particularly the Hindu tradition of Advaita Vedanta. In North America, the SES is also known as the School of Practical Philosophy, or by other similar names. In Australia, it is known as the School of Philosophy. Although the SES has been highly criticized for its methodology and alleged motives, it purports to be a syncretic school of moral philosophy.\n\nSeveral groups have taken on the challenge of establishing a world community through doctrine, faith and practice.\n\nUnitarian Universalism is a theologically liberal religion characterized by its support of \"a free and responsible search for truth and meaning.\" This principle permits Unitarian Universalists a wide range of beliefs and practices. Some communities even offer a class called \"Building Your Own Theology.\"\n\nMany Unitarian Universalists consider themselves humanists, while others hold Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, pagan, atheist, agnostic, pantheist, or other beliefs. Some choose to attach no particular theological label to their idiosyncratic combination of beliefs. Others consider themselves to be Unitarian Universalists in theology and seek moral orientation in the Unitarian Universalist Association's Seven Principles and Six Sources. This diversity of views is considered a strength, since the emphasis is placed on a common search for a meaningful existence, rather than an adherence to a particular doctrine.\n\nThe philosophy of Universal Sufism revolves around a unity of all people and religions, as well as the ability to find beauty in all things. It is a form of Sufism that does not exist within the traditional framework of Islam and was most likely influenced by Advaita philosophy. Universal Sufism is characterised by its respect (if not inclusion) for other devotional traditions and its disapproval of miracles.\n\nIt is mandated that Universal Sufis should strive to \"realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out.\"\n"}
{"id": "23558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23558", "title": "Pangenesis", "text": "Pangenesis\n\nPangenesis was Charles Darwin's hypothetical mechanism for heredity, in which he proposed that each part of the body continually emitted its own type of small organic particles called gemmules that aggregated in the gonads, contributing heritable information to the gametes. He presented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication\", intending it to fill what he perceived as a major gap in evolutionary theory at the time. The etymology of the word comes from the Greek words \"pan\" (a prefix meaning \"whole\", \"encompassing\") and \"genesis\" (\"birth\") or \"genos\" (\"origin\"). Pangenesis mirrored ideas originally formulated by Hippocrates and other pre-Darwinian scientists, but built off of new concepts such as cell theory, explaining cell development as beginning with gemmules which were specified to be necessary for the occurrence of new growths in an organism, both in initial development and regeneration. It also accounted for regeneration and the Lamarckian concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as a body part altered by the environment would produce altered gemmules. This made Pangenesis popular among the neo-Lamarckian school of evolutionary thought. This hypothesis was made effectively obsolete after the 1900 rediscovery among biologists of Gregor Mendel's theory of the particulate nature of inheritance.\n\nPangenesis was similar to ideas put forth by Hippocrates, Democritus and other pre-Darwinian scientists in proposing that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix \"pan\"). Darwin wrote that Hippocrates' pangenesis was \"almost identical with mine—merely a change of terms—and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown to the old philosopher.\"\n\nScience historian Conway Zirkle wrote that:\n\nZirkle demonstrated that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics had become fully accepted by the 16th century and remained immensely popular through to the time of Lamarck's work, at which point it began to draw more criticism due to lack of hard evidence. He also stated that pangenesis was the only scientific explanation ever offered for this concept, developing from Hippocrates' belief that \"the semen was derived from the whole body.\" In the 13th century, pangenesis was commonly accepted on the principle that semen was a refined version of food unused by the body, which eventually translated to 15th and 16th century widespread use of pangenetic principles in medical literature, especially in gynecology. Later pre-Darwinian important applications of the idea included hypotheses about the origin of the differentiation of races.\n\nA theory put forth by Pierre Louis Maupertuis in 1745 called for particles from both parents governing the attributes of the child, although some historians have called his remarks on the subject cursory and vague.\n\nIn 1749, French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon developed a hypothetical system of heredity much like Darwin's pangenesis, wherein 'organic molecules' were transferred to offspring during reproduction and stored in the body during development. Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, \"If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar.\"\n\nIn 1801, Erasmus Darwin advocated a hypothesis of pangenesis in the third edition of his book \"Zoonomia\". In 1809, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his \"Philosophie Zoologique\" put forth evidence for the idea that characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an organism, either from effects of the environment or may be passed on to the offspring. Charles Darwin first had significant contact with Lamarckism during his time at the University of Edinburgh Medical School in the late 1820s, both through Robert Edmond Grant, whom he assisted in research, and in Erasmus's journals. Darwin's first known writings on the topic of Lamarckian ideas as they related to inheritance are found in a notebook he opened in 1837, also entitled \"Zoonomia\". Historian Johnathan Hodge states that the theory of pangenesis itself first appeared in Darwin's notebooks in 1841.\n\nIn 1861, Irish physician Henry Freke developed a variant of pangenesis in his book \"Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity\". Freke proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named \"granules\", which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.\n\nIn 1864, four years before the publication of \"Variation\", Herbert Spencer in his book \"Principles of Biology\" proposed a theory of \"physiological units\" similar to Darwin's gemmules, which likewise were said to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics of those body parts to offspring. He also supported the Lamarckian idea of transmission of acquired characteristics.\n\nDarwin had debated whether to publish a theory of heredity for an extended period of time due to its highly speculative nature. He decided to include pangenesis in \"Variation\" after sending a 30 page manuscript to his close friend and supporter Thomas Huxley in May 1865, which was met by significant criticism from Huxley that made Darwin even more hesitant. However, Huxley eventually advised Darwin to publish, writing: \"Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis & say 'See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories—and that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them'\" Darwin's initial version of pangenesis appeared in the first edition of \"Variation\" in 1868, and was later reworked for the publication of a second edition in 1875.\n\nDarwin's pangenesis theory attempted to explain the process of sexual reproduction, inheritance of traits, and complex developmental phenomena such as cellular regeneration in a unified mechanistic structure. Yongshen Liu wrote that in modern terms, pangenesis deals with issues of \"dominance inheritance, graft hybridization, reversion, xenia, telegony, the inheritance of acquired characters, regeneration and many groups of facts pertaining to variation, inheritance and development.\" Mechanistically, Darwin proposed pangenesis to occur through the transfer of organic particles which he named 'gemmules.' Gemmules, which he also sometimes referred to as \"plastitudes,\" pangenes, granules, or germs, were supposed to be shed by the organs of the body and carried in the bloodstream to the reproductive organs where they accumulated in the germ cells or gametes. Their accumulation was thought to occur by some sort of a 'mutual affinity.' Each gemmule was said to be specifically related to a certain body part- as described, they did not contain information about the entire organism. The different types were assumed to be dispersed through the whole body, and capable of self-replication given ‘proper nutriment'. When passed on to offspring via the reproductive process, gemmules were thought to be responsible for developing into each part of an organism and expressing characteristics inherited from both parents. Darwin thought this to occur in a literal sense: he explained cell proliferation to progress as gemmules to bind to more developed cells of their same character and mature. In this sense, the uniqueness of each individual would be due to their unique mixture of their parents’ gemmules, and therefore characters. Similarity to one parent over the other could be explained by a quantitative superiority of one parent's gemmules. Yongshen Lu points out that Darwin knew of cells' ability to multiply by self-division, so it is unclear how Darwin supposed the two proliferation mechanisms to relate to each other. He did clarify in a later statement that he had always supposed gemmules to only bind to and proliferate from developing cells, not mature ones. Darwin hypothesized that gemmules might be able to survive and multiply outside of the body in a letter to J. D. Hooker in 1870.\nSome gemmules were thought to remain dormant for generations, whereas others were routinely expressed by all offspring. Every child was built up from selective expression of the mixture of the parents and grandparents' gemmules coming from either side. Darwin likened this to gardening: a flowerbed could be sprinkled with seeds \"most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period dormant, whilst others perish.\" He did not claim gemmules were in the blood, although his theory was often interpreted in this way. Responding to Fleming Jenkin's review of \"On the Origin of Species\", he argued that pangenesis would permit the preservation of some favourable variations in a population so that they wouldn't die out through blending.\n\nDarwin thought that environmental effects that caused altered characteristics would lead to altered gemmules for the affected body part. The altered gemmules would then have a chance of being transferred to offspring, since they were assumed to be produced throughout an organisms life. Thus, pangenesis theory allowed for the Lamarckian idea of transmission of characteristics acquired through use and disuse. Accidental gemmule development in incorrect parts of the body could explain deformations and the 'monstrosities' Darwin cited in \"Variation\".\n\nHugo de Vries characterized his own version of pangenesis theory in his 1889 book \"Intracellular Pangenesis\" with two propositions, of which he only accepted the first:\n\nDe Vries also coined the term 'pangene' which 20 years later was shortened by Wilhelm Johannsen to gene.\n\nScience historian Janet Browne points out that while Herbert Spencer and Carl von Nägeli also put forth ideas for systems of inheritance involving gemmules, their version of gemmules differed in that it contained \"a complete microscopic blueprint for an entire creature.\" Spencer published his theory of \"physiological units\" three years prior to Darwin's publication of \"Variation\".\n\nShe goes on to say that Darwin believed specifically in gemmules for each body part because they might explain how environmental effects could be passed on as characteristics to offspring.\n\nInterpretations and applications of pangenesis continued to appear frequently in medical literature up until Weismann's experiments and subsequent publication on germ-plasm theory in 1892. For instance, an address by Huxley spurred on substantial work by Dr. James Ross in linking ideas found in Darwin's pangenesis to the germ theory of disease. Ross cites the work of both Darwin and Spencer as key to his application of pangenetic theory.\n\nDarwin's half-cousin Francis Galton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to refute Charles Darwin's hypothetical theory of pangenesis. In consultation with Darwin, he set out to see if gemmules were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments from 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring. He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.\n\nGalton was troubled because he began the work in good faith, intending to prove Darwin right, and having praised pangenesis in \"Hereditary Genius\" in 1869. Cautiously, he criticized his cousin’s theory, although qualifying his remarks by saying that Darwin's gemmules, which he called \"pangenes,\" might be temporary inhabitants of the blood that his experiments had failed to pick up.\n\nDarwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in \"Nature\" where he wrote:\n\nAfter the circulation of Galton's results, the perception of pangenesis quickly changed to severe skepticism if not outright disbelief.\n\nAugust Weismann's idea, set out in his 1892 book \"Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung\" (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance), was that the hereditary material, which he called the germ plasm, and the rest of the body (the soma) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. This distinction is commonly referred to as the Weismann Barrier. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails across multiple generations, was proposed as a proof of the non-existence of Lamarckian inheritance, although Peter Gauthier has argued that Weismann's experiment showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm and neglected to test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse. Weismann argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against neo-Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.\n\nDarwin's pangenesis theory was widely criticised, in part for its Lamarckian premise that parents could pass on traits acquired in their lifetime. Conversely, the neo-Lamarckians of the time seized upon pangenesis as evidence to support their case. Italian Botanist Federico Delpino's objection that gemmules' ability to self-divide is contrary to their supposedly innate nature gained considerable traction; however, Darwin was dismissive of this criticism, remarking that the particulate agents of small pox and scarlet fever seem to have such characteristics. Lamarckism fell from favour after August Weismann's research in the 1880s indicated that changes from use (such as lifting weights to increase muscle mass) and disuse (such as being lazy and becoming weak) were not heritable. However, some scientists continued to voice their support in spite of Galton's and Weismann's results: notably, in 1900 Karl Pearson wrote that pangenesis \"is no more disproved by the statement that ‘gemmules have not been found in the blood,’ than the atomic theory is disproved by the fact that no atoms have been found in the air.\" Finally, the rediscovery of Mendel's Laws of Inheritance in 1900 led to pangenesis being fully set aside. Julian Huxley has observed that the later discovery of chromosomes and the research of T. H. Morgan also made pangenesis untenable.\n\nSome of Darwin's pangenesis principles do relate to heritable aspects of phenotypic plasticity, although the status of gemmules as a distinct class of organic particles has been firmly rejected. However, starting in the 1950s, many research groups in revisiting Galton's experiments found that heritable characteristics could indeed arise in rabbits and chickens following DNA injection or blood transfusion. This type of research originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1940's in the work of Sopikov and others, and was later corroborated by researchers in Switzerland as it was being further developed by the Soviet scientists. Notably, this work was supported in the USSR in part due to its conformation with the ideas of Trofim Lysenko, who espoused a version of neo-Lamarckism as part of Lysenkoism. Further research of this heritability of acquired characteristics developed into, in part, the modern field of epigenetics. Darwin himself had noted that \"the existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption\"; by some accounts in modern interpretation, gemmules may be considered a prescient mix of DNA, RNA, proteins, prions, and other mobile elements that are heritable in a non-Mendelian manner at the molecular level. Liu points out that Darwin's ideas about gemmules replicating outside of the body are predictive of \"in vitro\" gene replication used, for instance, in PCR. It is worth noting, however, that this reinterpretation of pangenesis's viability in modern terms is the work of a niche group of scholars and does not necessarily reflect a renewal of interest by related fields as a whole.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1571987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1571987", "title": "Peace Testimony", "text": "Peace Testimony\n\nPeace testimony, or testimony against war, is a shorthand description of the action generally taken by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) for peace and against participation in war. Like other Quaker testimonies, it is not a \"belief\", but a description of committed actions, in this case to promote peace, and refrain from and actively oppose participation in war. Quakers' original refusal to bear arms has been broadened to embrace protests and demonstrations in opposition to government policies of war and confrontations with others who bear arms, whatever the reason, in the support of peace and active nonviolence. Because of this core testimony, the Religious Society of Friends is considered one of the traditional peace churches.\n\nFriends' peace testimony is largely derived from beliefs arising from the teachings of Jesus to love one's enemies and Friends' belief in the inner light. Quakers believe that nonviolent confrontation of evil and peaceful reconciliation are always superior to violent measures. Peace testimony does not mean that Quakers engage only in passive resignation; in fact, they often practice passionate activism.\n\nThe Peace Testimony is probably the best known testimony of Friends. The belief that violence is wrong has persisted to this day, and many conscientious objectors, advocates of non-violence and anti-war activists are Friends. Because of their peace testimony, Friends are considered as one of the historic peace churches. In 1947 Friends as a worldwide religious group were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which was accepted by the American Friends Service Committee and the then London Yearly Meeting's Friends Service Committee, now called Britain Yearly Meeting Peace & Social Witness on behalf of all Friends. The Peace Testimony has not always been well received in the world; on many occasions Friends have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in military activities.\n\nSome Friends today regard the Peace Testimony in even a broader sense, refusing to pay the portion of the income tax that goes to fund the military. Yearly Meetings in the United States, Britain and other parts of the world endorse and support these Friends' actions. The Quaker Council for European Affairs campaigns in the European Parliament for the right of conscientious objectors in Europe not to be made to pay for the military. Some do pay the money into peace charities and still get goods seized by bailiffs or money taken from their bank accounts.\n\nIn America, others pay into an escrow account in the name of the Internal Revenue Service, which the IRS can only access if they give an assurance that the money will only be used for peaceful purposes. Some Yearly meetings in the US run escrow accounts for conscientious objectors, both within and outside the Society.\n\nMany Friends engage in various non-governmental organizations such as Christian Peacemaker Teams serving in some of the most violent areas of the world. Quaker author Howard Brinton, for example, served in the American Friends Service Committee during World War I.\n\nGeorge Fox, perhaps the most influential early Quaker, made a declaration in 1651 that many see as the first declaration of Friends' beliefs on peace:\nFollowing the 1660 Restoration of King Charles II and a clamp-down on religious radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchists, \n\nA number of letters and statements were written this year, as much to remove any suspicion that Friends might have been involved in violent political activity as a desire to make their position clear. Margaret Fell wrote a letter to King Charles II that was co-signed \"in unity\" by a number of prominent Friends, including Fox:\n\nThe most well-known statement of this belief was stated later that year in a declaration to King Charles II of England in 1660 by George Fox and 11 others. This excerpt is commonly cited:\n\nSome Quakers initially opposed this statement because it did not deny use of the sword to the magistrate or ruler of the state. It also contained no prohibition against paying taxes for purposes of war, something that would trouble Friends to the present.\n\nQuakers have engaged in peace testimony by protesting against wars, refusing to serve in armed forces if drafted, seeking conscientious objector status when available, and even to participating in acts of civil disobedience. Not all Quakers embrace this testimony as an absolute; for example, there were Friends that fought in World War I and World War II. Some others were firm . During extreme circumstances it has been difficult for some Quakers to engage in and uphold this testimony, yet Friends have almost universally been committed to the ideal of peace, even those who have felt the need to compromise on their testimony. Apart from the specific question of war, other ways in which Friends have testified to peace have included vegetarianism and a commitment to restorative justice.\n\nThe Religious Society of Friends was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947. The Nobel Prize was awarded to Friends for Friends' work to relieve suffering and feed many millions of starving people during and after both world wars. The Nobel prize was accepted by the American Friends Service Committee, along with the UK's Friends Service Council on behalf of all Quakers.\n\nThe first paragraph of the Presentation Speech reads:\n\"The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded this year's Peace Prize to the Quakers, represented by their two great relief organizations, the Friends Service Council in London and the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48398", "title": "Philosophical analysis", "text": "Philosophical analysis\n\nPhilosophical analysis (from ) is the techniques typically used by philosophers in the analytic tradition that involve \"breaking down\" (i.e. analyzing) philosophical issues. Arguably the most prominent of these techniques is the analysis of concepts (known as \"conceptual analysis\").\n\nWhile analysis is characteristic of the analytic tradition in philosophy, what is to be analyzed (the \"analysandum\") often varies. Some philosophers focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena, such as sentences, while others focus on psychological phenomena, such as sense data. However, arguably the most prominent analyses are of concepts or propositions, which is known as \"conceptual analysis\" (Foley 1996).\n\nConceptual analysis consists primarily in breaking down or analyzing concepts into their constituent parts in order to gain knowledge or a better understanding of a particular philosophical issue in which the concept is involved (Beaney 2003). For example, the problem of free will in philosophy involves various key concepts, including the concepts of freedom, moral responsibility, determinism, ability, etc. The method of conceptual analysis tends to approach such a problem by breaking down the key concepts pertaining to the problem and seeing how they interact. Thus, in the long-standing debate on whether free will is compatible with the doctrine of determinism, several philosophers have proposed analyses of the relevant concepts to argue for either compatibilism or incompatibilism.\n\nA famous author of conceptual analysis at its best is Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions. Russell attempted to analyze propositions that involved \"definite descriptions\" (such as \"The tallest spy\"), which pick out a unique individual, and \"indefinite descriptions\" (such as \"a spy\"), which pick out a set of individuals. Take Russell's analysis of definite descriptions as an example. Superficially, definite descriptions have the standard subject-predicate form of a proposition. For example, \"The present king of France is bald\" appears to be predicating \"baldness\" of the subject \"the present king of France\". However, Russell noted that this is problematic, because there is no present king of France (France is no longer a monarchy). Normally, to decide whether a proposition of the standard subject-predicate form is true or false, one checks whether the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The proposition is then true if and only if the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The problem is that there is no present king of France, so the present king of France cannot be found on the list of bald things or non-bald things. So, it would appear that the proposition expressed by \"The present king of France is bald\" is neither true nor false. However, analyzing the relevant concepts and propositions, Russell proposed that what definite descriptions really express are not propositions of the subject-predicate form, but rather they express existentially quantified propositions. Thus, \"The present king of France\" is \"analyzed\", according to Russell's theory of descriptions, as \"There exists an individual who is currently the king of France, there is only one such individual, and that individual is bald.\" Now one can determine the truth value of the proposition. Indeed, it is false, because it is not the case that there exists a unique individual who is currently the king of France and is bald—since there is no present king of France (Bertolet 1999).\n\nWhile the method of analysis is characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy, its status continues to be a source of great controversy even among analytic philosophers. Several current criticisms of the analytic method derive from W.V. Quine's famous rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction. While Quine's critique is well-known, it is highly controversial.\n\nFurther, the analytic method seems to rely on some sort of definitional structure of concepts, so that one can give necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept. For example, the concept \"bachelor\" is often analyzed as having the concepts \"unmarried\" and \"male\" as its components. Thus, the definition or analysis of \"bachelor\" is thought to be an unmarried male. But one might worry that these so-called necessary and sufficient conditions do not apply in every case. Wittgenstein, for instance, argues that language (e.g., the word 'bachelor') is used for various purposes and in an indefinite number of ways. Wittgenstein's famous thesis states that meaning is determined by use. This means that, in each case, the meaning of 'bachelor' is determined by its use in a context. So if it can be shown that the word means different things across different contexts of use, then cases where its meaning cannot be essentially defined as 'married bachelor' seem to constitute counterexamples to this method of analysis. This is just one example of a critique of the analytic method derived from a critique of definitions. There are several other such critiques (Margolis & Laurence 2006). This criticism is often said to have originated primarily with Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\".\n\nA third critique of the method of analysis derives primarily from psychological critiques of intuition. A key part of the analytic method involves analyzing concepts via \"intuition tests\". Philosophers tend to motivate various conceptual analyses by appeal to their intuitions about thought experiments. (See DePaul and Ramsey (1998) for a collection of current essays on the controversy over analysis as it relates to intuition and reflective equilibrium.)\n\nIn short, some philosophers feel strongly that the analytic method (especially conceptual analysis) is essential to and defines philosophy—e.g. Jackson (1998), Chalmers (1996), and Bealer (1998). Yet, some philosophers argue that the method of analysis is problematic—e.g. Stich (1998) and Ramsey (1998). Some, however, take the middle ground and argue that while analysis is largely a fruitful method of inquiry, philosophers should not limit themselves to only using the method of analysis.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1403587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1403587", "title": "Philosophy of chemistry", "text": "Philosophy of chemistry\n\nThe philosophy of chemistry considers the methodology and underlying assumptions of the science of chemistry. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. For much of its history, philosophy of science has been dominated by the philosophy of physics, but the philosophical questions that arise from chemistry have received increasing attention since the latter part of the 20th century.\n\nMajor philosophical questions arise as soon as one attempts to define chemistry and what it studies. Atoms and molecules are often assumed to be the fundamental units of chemical theory, but traditional descriptions of molecular structure and chemical bonding fail to account for the properties of many substances, including metals and metal complexes and aromaticity.\n\nAdditionally, chemists frequently use non-existent chemical entities like resonance structures to explain the structure and reactions of different substances; these explanatory tools use the language and graphical representations of molecules to describe the behavior of chemicals and chemical reactions that in reality do not behave as straightforward molecules.\n\nSome chemists and philosophers of chemistry prefer to think of substances, rather than microstructures, as the fundamental units of study in chemistry. There is not always a one-to-one correspondence between the two methods of classifying substances. For example, many rocks exist as mineral complexes composed of multiple ions that do not occur in fixed proportions or spatial relationships to one another.\n\nA related philosophical problem is whether chemistry is the study of substances or reactions. Atoms, even in a solid, are in perpetual motion and under the right conditions many chemicals react spontaneously to form new products. A variety of environmental variables contribute to a substance's properties, including temperature and pressure, proximity to other molecules and the presence of a magnetic field. As Schummer puts it, \"Substance philosophers define a chemical reaction by the change of certain substances, whereas process philosophers define a substance by its characteristic chemical reactions.\"\n\nPhilosophers of chemistry discuss issues of symmetry and chirality in nature. Organic (i.e., carbon-based) molecules are those most often chiral. Amino acids, nucleic acids and sugars, all of which are found exclusively as a single enantiomer in organisms, are the basic chemical units of life. Chemists, biochemists, and biologists alike debate the origins of this homochirality. Philosophers debate facts regarding the origin of this phenomenon, namely whether it emerged contingently, amid a lifeless racemic environment or if other processes were at play. Some speculate that answers can only be found in comparison to extraterrestrial life, if it is ever found. Other philosophers question whether there exists a bias toward assumptions of nature as symmetrical, thereby causing resistance to any evidence to the contrary.\n\nOne of the most topical issues is determining to what extent physics, specifically, quantum mechanics, explains chemical phenomena. Can chemistry, in fact, be reduced to physics as has been assumed by many, or are there inexplicable gaps? Some authors, for example, Roald Hoffmann, have recently suggested that a number of difficulties exist in the reductionist program with concepts like aromaticity, pH, reactivity, nucleophilicity, for example. The noted philosopher of science, Karl Popper, among others, predicted as much.\n\nSeveral philosophers and scientists have focused on the philosophy of chemistry in recent years, notably, the Dutch philosopher Jaap van Brakel, who wrote \"The Philosophy of Chemistry\" in 2000, and the Maltese philosopher-chemist Eric Scerri, editor of the journal \"Foundations of Chemistry\" and author of \"Normative and Descriptive Philosophy of Science and the Role of Chemistry in Philosophy of Chemistry\", 2004, among other articles. Scerri is especially interested in the philosophical foundations of the periodic table, and how physics and chemistry intersect in relation to it, which he contends is not merely a matter for science, but for philosophy.\n\nAlthough in other fields of science students of the method are generally not practitioners in the field, in chemistry (particularly in synthetic organic chemistry) intellectual method and philosophical foundations are often explored by investigators with active research programmes. Elias James Corey developed the concept of \"retrosynthesis\" published a seminal work \"The logic of chemical synthesis\" which deconstructs these thought processes and speculates on computer-assisted synthesis. Other chemists such as K. C. Nicolaou (co-author of \"Classics in Total Synthesis\") have followed in his lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44292528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44292528", "title": "Same-sex intimacy", "text": "Same-sex intimacy\n\nSame-sex intimacy refers to a relationship between two friends of the same sex that has many components of a sexually intimate relationship (e.g. self-disclosures, emotional expressiveness, unconditional support, physical contact and trust), but not necessarily sexual intimacy or sexual contact. The term can apply to the exploration of sexuality outside the home, as well as to the physical activities shared between two friends. Contemporary applications include the \"bromance\" culture, referring intimate bonds formed between male friends in films such as \"I Love You, Man\", as well as the familial bonds exhibited by close female friends, propagated in the mainstream media by television shows such as \"Sex and the City\".\n\nIn \"Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality\", American LGBT historian Jonathan Ned Katz explores notable incidents of same-sex love prior to the creation of the word \"homosexual\"—a time that Katz describes as \"the universe before that great sexual divide.\" Katz's research suggests that prior to distinguishing this (heterosexual-homosexual), men felt freer to explore feelings of intense intimacy for other men without feeling judged or stigmatized by societal views. Katz writes, \"We may refer to early-nineteenth-century men's acts or desires as gay or straight, homosexual, heterosexual, or bisexual, but that places their behaviors and lusts within our sexual system, not the system of their time.\" One example that Katz examines in his book is the relationship between Abraham Lincoln and his friend Joshua Fry Speed. In 1837, the two men began rooming together their first night of meeting, sharing Speed's double bed for the sake of logic and convenience, and quickly developed a close relationship. The two maintained an intimate bond until Lincoln's death in 1865. Although there is no evidence that Lincoln and Speed had a sexual physical relationship, Speed once stated about his relationship with Lincoln that \"no men were ever more intimate.\"\n\nThroughout the 1700s, there was an extensive sexual policing of young people. The restrictions in place included mandatory chaperones when on dates and attending public events, as well as other socially acceptable customs such as bundling. The latter refers to times when a male courter would spend the night in the same bed as his female companion—which was often both necessary and practical, as many courters lived a fair distance from their love interests and the majority of homes had limited beds. When bundling, both partners remained fully clothed and wrapped in separate blankets, sometimes with a \"bundling board\" between their bodies, to ensure that no sexual activity would take place. Many intimate same-sex friendships were developed as a response to such sexual policing practices. Intimate relationships between friends were considered a socially acceptable method of sexual expression outside of marriage, as well an outlet for emotional desire that was otherwise limited at this time.\n\nIn \"The History of Sexuality\", Michel Foucault explores the theory of the repressive hypothesis: the belief that throughout the 1800s, sex was not spoken about because of the heavy sexual policing taking place throughout the Victorian Era. Foucault argues that the Repressive Hypothesis was hypocritical and inaccurate, as, in actuality, sex was discussed at great lengths at this time. The restrictions, Foucault argued, were in reference to who was permitted to discuss sex and desire and in what situation. For instance, citizens were encouraged to disclose their sexual desires and fantasies to Catholic priests in the name of repentance. Foucault's research on the repressive hypothesis and similar myths about how sexuality was discussed and perceived in the Victorian Era demonstrates further how sexual practices were policed, regulated, and monitored by those in power.\n\nIn the 1800s, \"sodomy\" referred to a number of sexual activities that were perceived as deviant. These acts included anal and oral sex outside of marriage, bestiality, masturbation, the \"spending of your seed upon another man,\" and the corrupting youth to partake in any of these activities. Officially, these acts were punishable by death, but sodomites were seldom executed for their crimes. This is because these actions were seen as singular acts for which one could repent. Instead, most offenders were whipped publicly, burned with hot irons, or banished from their towns. All of these punishments were determined and carried out by the church. None of these activities branded an individual a \"sodomite\", for example, but rather as an individual who committed an act of sodomy.\n\nAt its conception, the term \"courtly love\" referred to the extensive code created to control the intense feelings of love between a knight and a married woman of a higher social standing. The knight in question would perform great acts of bravery in her name in order to demonstrate his love for her from afar. In later years, the definition of \"courtly love\" expanded to signify any admiration for a peer and, further, the notion that it was an acceptable form of admiration to create writings or art about your beloved.\n\nThe most notable example of frequent and common instances of courtly love occurs in the writings of William Shakespeare. Shakespeare wrote many sonnets to young men that he admired, praising their beauty, intelligence and virility. He addressed sonnets 1-126 to \"Fair Youth\"—an individual who is commonly interpreted to be male—and later, in Sonnet 20, refers to the boy as the \"master-mistress of [his] passion.\" Additional examples of Shakespeare writing of same-sex intimacy and courtly love are within his procreation sonnets. In these poems, Shakespeare encourages a young man to marry and have children to preserve his beauty, using loving and occasionally romantic language to communicate his message. Additionally, it is believed by many scholars that Shakespeare's famous Sonnet 18 (\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\") is also about a man, as he dedicated his book of sonnets to an unidentified \"Mr. W.H.\"\n\nWhile sexuality was heavily policed and regulated in the 1600s, there were many individuals who disagreed with government policies and who opted to rebel. The most notable example of such an instance is Thomas Morton, an English adventurer who wished to live outside of the family-centric, religion-driven settlements being created by the Christian pilgrims. In 1625, Morton founded Merrymount: a commune that opposed the beliefs that he so despised. His followers practiced interracial, pre- and extra-marital relationships, polygamy, as well as many forms of same-sex intimacy, union, and sexual expression. The acceptance of same-sex contact within this context helped to lay the groundwork for same-sex communes that followed.\n\nIn the 1860s, Martha McWhirter, a married woman living in Belton, Texas, established a community for women who wished to live together away from their husbands, either permanently or part-time. McWhirter's commune allowed for married women to experience emotional relationships without the risk of pregnancy, as well as experience \"sensual pleasures\" such as mineral baths and other soothing exercises amidst the company of other women. While not strictly an expression of same-sex intimacy, this community allowed a socially acceptable way for women to explore friendships and their personal erotic desires outside of the confines of heterosexual marriage.\n\nWhile same-sex intimate friendships gave the participants a much-needed confidant and companion, the realization of self outside of one's family was also important to the formation of these friendships. Following the period of time in which families lived in one room and children learned about sexuality from their parents, a different outlet was necessary for sexual growth among youth. Oftentimes, the practice of a same-sex intimate friendship mirrored that of a heterosexual marriage. Thus, this was considered a socially acceptable method of seeking companionship outside of marriage. As a result, often men and women were encouraged to find companions to spend time with.\n\nBoarding schools and women's colleges encouraged same-sex intimate friendships because of limited access to males and \"socializ[ation]…into a world which valued female sensibility and female bonds.\" Within boarding schools girls formed strong bonds with each other in the absence of other outlets for their emotions and impulses. \"Smashing\" was a term used during the 1860s and 1870s to describe the intensely romantic relationships paralleling heterosexual courtship formed between young women in formal academic settings. In \"Smashing: Women’s Relationships Before the Fall\", Nancy Sahli writes \"…when a Vassar girl takes a shine to another she straightaway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes…candies, locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as—\"smashed\".\" Having a crush on, or strong feelings for another girl was common, and celebrated within magazines and other works of fiction.\n\nIt was the first time for many women in college that they were away from their families and in the public sphere and most were socializing or living with other women who had similar interests and aspirations. There was no longer a requirement to wed if a woman decided to become an academic and, because of this, women felt free to continue living with their female companions indefinitely. \"Boston marriages\", or partnerships in which women lived and worked together, shared a bed, and planned how to spend their money together, became commonplace. Many professional, young women opted for this arrangement in order to remain financially and emotionally independent of male support.\n\nCollege also supported intimate same-sex friendships between males for similar reasons (i.e.: ventures out in to the public sphere, distance from families, easier access to entertainment and friends). Fraternities offered an opportunity for men to live together easily and develop bonds with other males while living in close quarters.\n\nBosom sex was often practised between young women. This refers to the act of revealing or fondling of the breasts by a female companion, often while in bed. Bosom sex signified a deep bond and trust between the women performing it. While this practice was not inherently sexual, it is one of the more documented forms of physical intimacy within same sex intimate friendships and today would certainly be categorized as a sexual act.\n\nIn \"No Kisses Is Like Youres\", Professor Karen V. Hansen discusses the relationship between Rebecca Primus and Addie Brown: two African American women who shared an intimate long-distance friendship in the 1860s that spanned over nine years and took place mostly through correspondence. The preserved letters from this time articulate a friendship that was loving and supportive, and, at times, sexually-charged. Addie writes fondly of her memories sharing a bed with Rebecca and of the incidents of \"bosom sex\" that they experienced together. Addie also frequently refers to Rebecca as her \"beloved\", writing, \"Yours , until death parts us.\"\n\nWomen often held hands, kissed, or caressed while in private settings with other women. This behaviour was acceptable and often encouraged within society as long as these women made no genital contact, the actions were done in a private setting, and such intimacy was not performed in front of men. Therefore, it was not unusual for women to write notes that mirrored the style and content of love letters to each other, even if one or both of the correspondents were married. Women often made statements in these letters that they had the desire to make love to one another, which expressed a desire to court and not necessarily to touch. Anna and Emily Dickinson both often wrote to married friends expressing their desire to be with their female counterparts, and anxiety to be so far away from each other.\n\nWorking class girls, who were experiencing a separation from their family and the ability to venture out into the public sphere for the first time, also found other ways to explore and express their sexuality. Along with intimacy in same-sex friendships, women would often attend cabarets together, or else avail themselves of the readily available entertainments in the city. They may even attend a peepshow together, bringing their intimacy into the public by viewing other women together in a sexual light.\n\nYoung men also often put themselves in hypersexual situations with their intimate same-sex friends, without directly being sexual with them. In \"\", John D'Emilio specifically references Fred Ryman and his friend Claude Macy, whom Ryman \"can truly say [he] love[s]\" who seek out a prostitute together. This was common practice among men who experienced intimate same-sex friendships, and is a practice that has carried on in contemporary times with strip clubs and other such activities.\n\nWhether or not there was also sexual intimacy within these relationships is debatable, as homosexuality was still observed as a punishable offense in the United States of America and the intense need to keep sexuality within the private sphere and away from the public sphere was still present.\n\nIn 1892, American neurologist Charles G. Chaddock wrote about same-sex desire in a German health textbook, making the first mention of the word \"homosexuality\". Chaddock defines homosexuality as the \"great diminution or complete absence of sexual feeling for the opposite sex with the substitution of sexual feeling and instinct for the same sex.\" This is the general understanding we have of the word homosexual today, although at that time homosexuality was still seen as \"contrary sexual instinct.\"\n\nThe introduction of the term \"homosexual\" and the understanding that same-sex sexual desire existed changed the meanings of same-sex intimate friendships. While there had always been some physical aspects to same-sex intimate friendships, now such acts were thrown into a negative light. Sodomy and other activities were no longer seen as single, repentable actions, but instead as a lifestyle choice.\n\nAmerican poet Walt Whitman identified his feelings of same-sex attraction as \"adhesive love\": something falling outside of same-sex intimacy because of its homoerotic undertones. Whitman first mentions adhesive love in Leaves of Grass, referring to it as an alternative take on \"manly love\" or the love of men for men. He expands on this feeling through several of his poems, talking about his \"hot wishes\" for strange men he meets in the dark. Whitman saw manly love as a sexual expression that did not necessarily go against gender binaries, but, rather, challenged the capitalistic and Christian-centric spirit of the current American democracy. Whitman understood adhesive love as necessary aspect of comradeship and male bonding. He did not identify as a homosexual, as the word was not largely recognised. However, he wrote extensively about his erotic physical encounters with young men, and by the end of his life had begun to question his sexual identity, as a result of some prodding by homosexual writer John Addington Symonds.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, homosexuality began to be recognized as something outside of church law and was discussed in the medical community. Sexuality became an identifier of a person, the manifestation of their \"true nature\". Terms such as \"third sex\", \"urning\", \"tribad\" and \"invert\" were used interchangeably with \"homosexual\". In response, sodomy between two willing participants of legal age was officially legalized in New York State in the late 1880s. However, public outrage against homosexuality, the fierce protection of Christian moral standards, and the desire to appear tough on \"sexual perversion\" caused all acts of sodomy to be criminalized until well into the 1960s.\n\nSame-sex intimacy has carried over into the contemporary era. Though our view of it has changed, much of what happens within intimate same-sex friendships remains the same. The two most popular representations of intimate—and often co-dependent—same-sex friendships in modern popular culture are \"bromances\" among men and the \"BFF\" culture among women.\n\nBromance, like the previous forms of same-sex intimacy, allows men to explore their sexuality and experience intimacy outside of a heterosexual relationship. Bromance culture encourages men to find intimate friends or \"heterosexual life partners\" in order to experience the closeness and benefits of friendship. This is something that men have often been denied within constructions of modern masculinity.\n\nOne example of a bromance relationship in contemporary popular culture was portrayed in the film \"I Love You, Man\" (2009). In this movie, male characters Peter and Sydney meet and quickly develop a fast and close friendship. Peter is thrilled with his new best friend, but is also hyper-aware of the social confines and emotional restrictions of a same-sex male friendship. He states, \"I’m really nervous. There are no rules for male friendships.\"\n\nOther examples of bromance relationships are visible in current popular culture. Examples include:\n\n\nBFF (\"best friend forever\") relationships are similar to bromances, but instead emphasize the close friendships between women. BFF culture is generally more socially acceptable and less stigmatized than close relationships between men, as women have been historically and socially conditioned to seek out and embrace the friendship of other women. BFF culture can also be referred to as \"womance\".\n\nOne example of a BFF relationship that closely links to historical examples of same-sex intimacy is that of Meredith and Cristina on \"Grey's Anatomy\". Two surgical interns, the women are drawn to each other because of the fact that they are stubborn and determined to succeed in the male dominated platform of surgery. They become fast friends, and talk to each other about everything. Their relationship blossoms into one of same-sex intimacy, with them hugging and holding hands when they walk, sharing a bed platonically, and later raising Meredith's daughter together while she is temporarily separated from her husband.\n\nLike bromance relationships, many different BFF relationships are visible in popular culture. Some examples of these relationships are visible in:\n\n\nIn contemporary society, the label \"intimate partner\" can now be applied to any individual who is in an emotionally, physically and/or mentally fulfilling relationship, be it same- or opposite-sexed, and does not necessarily apply only to those have physical sex. Intimate partners are not defined only by sexual contact; the definition is as broad as same-sex intimate friendships.\n\n"}

Instead of knowledge of the environment (as with, for example, smell or sight), the \"sensus divinitatis\" is alleged to give humans a knowledge of God.\n\nIn Calvin's view, there is no reasonable non-belief. Neo-Calvinists who adhere to the presuppositionalist school of Christian apologetics sometimes appeal to a \"sensus divinitatis\" to argue that there are no genuine atheists:\n\nAnalytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga of the University of Notre Dame posits a modified form of the \"sensus divinitatis\" whereby all have the sense, only it does not work properly in some humans, due to sin's noetic effects. (see Reformed epistemology)\n\nJonathan Edwards, the 18th-century American Calvinist preacher and theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of \"true benevolence\".\n\nPhilosopher Steven Maitzen claimed in 2006 that the demographics of religious belief make the existence of the \"sensus divinitatis\" unlikely, as this sense appears so unevenly distributed.\n\nHowever, Maitzen may have confused Aquinas's \"sensus dei\" with \"sensus divinitatis\"—\"sensus divinitatis\" (a religious sense) only necessitates a core religious/faith component to one's beliefs, whereas the \"sensus dei\" aims at a natural knowledge of God—compare \"In the Twilight of Western Thought\" by Herman Dooyeweerd (1894–1977).\n"}
{"id": "2717032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2717032", "title": "Social intuitionism", "text": "Social intuitionism\n\nIn moral psychology, social intuitionism is a model that proposes that moral positions and judgments are: (1) primarily intuitive (\"intuitions come first\"), (2) rationalized, justified, or otherwise explained after the fact, (3) taken mainly to influence other people, and are (4) often influenced and sometimes changed by discussing such positions with others. \n\nThis model diverges from earlier rationalist theories of morality, such as of Lawrence Kohlberg's stage theory of moral reasoning. Jonathan Haidt (2001) de-emphasizes the role of reasoning in reaching moral conclusions. Haidt asserts that moral judgment is primarily given rise to by intuition, with reasoning playing a smaller role in most of our moral decision-making. Conscious thought-processes serve as a kind of post hoc justification of our decisions.\n\nHis main evidence comes from studies of \"moral dumbfounding\" where people have strong moral reactions but fail to establish any kind of rational principle to explain their reaction. An example situation in which moral intuitions are activated is as follows: Imagine that a brother and sister sleep together once. No one else knows, no harm befalls either one, and both feel it brought them closer as siblings. Most people imagining this incest scenario have very strong negative reaction, yet cannot explain why. Referring to earlier studies by Howard Margolis and others, Haidt suggests that we have unconscious intuitive heuristics which generate our reactions to morally charged-situations, and underlie our moral behavior. He suggests that when people explain their moral positions, they often miss, if not hide, the core premises and processes that actually led to those conclusions.\n\nHaidt's model also states that moral reasoning is more likely to be interpersonal than private, reflecting social motives (reputation, alliance-building) rather than abstract principles. He does grant that interpersonal discussion (and, on very rare occasions, private reflection) can activate new intuitions which will then be carried forward into future judgments.\n\nHaidt (2001) lists four reasons to doubt the cognitive primacy model championed by Kohlberg and others.\n\n\nJoseph Paxton and Joshua Greene (2010) review evidence suggesting that moral reasoning plays a significant role in moral judgment, including counteracting automatic tendencies toward bias.\n\nGreene and colleagues have proposed an alternative to the social intuitionist model suggesting that deontological moral judgments, which involve rights and duties, are driven primarily by intuition, while utilitarian judgments aimed at promoting the greater good are underlain by controlled cognitive reasoning processes.\n\n"}

{"id": "28246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28246", "title": "Sufism", "text": "Sufism\n\nSufism, or Taṣawwuf (; personal noun: \"ṣūfiyy\" / \"ṣūfī\", \"mutaṣawwif\"), variously defined as \"Islamic mysticism\", \"the inward dimension of Islam\" or \"the phenomenon of mysticism within Islam\", is mysticism in Islam, \"characterized ... [by particular] values, ritual practices, doctrines and institutions\" which began very early in Islamic history and represents \"the main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization of\" mystical practice in Islam. Practitioners of Sufism have been referred to as \"Sufis\" (Arabic plurals: \"ṣūfiyyah\"; \"ṣūfiyyūn\"; \"mutaṣawwifah\"; \"mutaṣawwifūn\").\n\nHistorically, Sufis have often belonged to different \"ṭuruq\", or \"orders\" – congregations formed around a grand master referred to as a \"wali\" who traces a direct chain of successive teachers back to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. These orders meet for spiritual sessions (\"majalis\") in meeting places known as \"zawiyas\", \"khanqahs\" or \"tekke\". They strive for \"ihsan\" (perfection of worship), as detailed in a \"hadith\": \"Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him; if you can't see Him, surely He sees you.\" Sufis regard Muhammad as \"al-Insān al-Kāmil\", the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God, and see him as their leader and prime spiritual guide.\n\nAll Sufi orders trace most of their original precepts from Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law Ali, with the notable exception of one.\n\nAlthough the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, were and are adherents of Sunni Islam, there also developed certain strands of Sufi practice within the ambit of Shia Islam during the late medieval period. Although Sufis were opposed to dry legalism, they strictly observed Islamic law and belonged to various schools of Islamic jurisprudence and theology.\n\nSufis have been characterized by their asceticism, especially by their attachment to \"dhikr\", the practice of remembrance of God, often performed after prayers. They gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661–750)\nand have spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, initially expressing their beliefs in Arabic and later expanding into Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, among others. Sufis played an important role in the formation of Muslim societies through their missionary and educational activities. According to William Chittick, \"In a broad sense, Sufism can be described as the interiorization, and intensification of Islamic faith and practice.\"\n\nThe term \"Sufism\" came into being not by Islamic texts or Sufis themselves but by British Orientalists who wanted to create an artificial divide between what they found attractive in Islamic civilisation (i.e. Islamic spirituality) and the negative stereotypes that were present in Britain about Islam. These British orientalists, therefore, fabricated a divide that was previously non-existent. \n\nHistorically, Muslims have used the originally Arabic word \"taṣawwuf\" () to identify the practice of Sufis. Mainstream scholars of Islam define \"Tasawwuf\" or Sufism as the name for the inner or esoteric dimension of Islam which is supported and complemented by outward or exoteric practices of Islam, such as sharia. In this view, \"it is absolutely necessary to be a Muslim\" to be a true Sufi, because Sufism's \"methods are inoperative without\" Muslim \"affiliation\". However, Islamic scholars themselves are not by any means in agreement about the meaning of the word \"sufi\".\n\nSufis themselves claim that \"Tasawwuf\" is an aspect of Islam similar to \"sharia\", inseparable from Islam and an integral part of Islamic belief and practice. Classical Sufi scholars have defined \"Tasawwuf\" as \"a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God\". Traditional Sufis such as Bayazid Bastami, Rumi, Haji Bektash Veli, Junayd of Baghdad, Al-Ghazali, and Sayyid Ali Hamadani, define Sufism as purely based upon the tenets of Islam and the teachings of Muhammad.\n\nThe original meaning of \"sufi\" seems to have been \"one who wears wool (')\", and the Encyclopaedia of Islam calls other etymological hypotheses \"untenable\". Woollen clothes were traditionally associated with ascetics and mystics. Al-Qushayri and Ibn Khaldun both rejected all possibilities other than ' on linguistic grounds.\n\nAnother explanation traces the lexical root of the word to \"\" \"()\", which in Arabic means \"purity\". These two explanations were combined by the Sufi al-Rudhabari (d. 322 AH), who said, \"The Sufi is the one who wears wool on top of purity\".\n\nOthers have suggested that the word comes from the term \"\" (\"the people of the bench\"), who were a group of impoverished companions of Muhammad who held regular gatherings of \"dhikr\". These men and women who sat at al-Masjid an-Nabawi are considered by some to be the first Sufis.\n\nThe term Sufism could also be a neologism of German origin coined by August Tholuck in his first book \"Sufismus, sive theosophia Persarum pantheistica\", published in Latin in Berlin in 1821.\n\nAccording to Carl W. Ernst the earliest figures of Sufism are Muhammad himself and his companions (\"Sahabah\"). Sufi orders are based on the \"bay‘ah\" (بَيْعَة \"bay‘ah\", مُبَايَعَة \"mubāya‘ah\" \"pledge, allegiance\") that was given to Muhammad by his \"Ṣahabah\". By pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the Sahabah had committed themselves to the service of God. According to Islamic belief, by pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the \"Sahabah\" pledged allegiance to God.\n\nSufis believe that by giving \"bayʿah\" (pledging allegiance) to a legitimate Sufi shaykh, one is pledging allegiance to Muhammad; therefore, a spiritual connection between the seeker and Muhammad is established. It is through Muhammad that Sufis aim to learn about, understand and connect with God. Ali is regarded as one of the major figures amongst the \"Sahaba\" who have directly pledged allegiance to Muhammad, and Sufis maintain that through Ali, knowledge about Muhammad and a connection with Muhammad may be attained. Such a concept may be understood by the \"hadith\", which Sufis regard to be authentic, in which Muhammad said, \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\". Eminent Sufis such as Ali Hujwiri refer to Ali as having a very high ranking in \"Tasawwuf\". Furthermore, Junayd of Baghdad regarded Ali as sheikh of the principals and practices of \"Tasawwuf\".\n\nHistorian Jonathan A.C. Brown notes that during the lifetime of Muhammad, some companions were more inclined than others to \"intensive devotion, pious abstemiousness and pondering the divine mysteries\" more than Islam required, such as Abu Dhar al-Ghifari. Hasan al-Basri, a tabi, is considered a \"founding figure\" in the \"science of purifying the heart\".\n\nPractitioners of Sufism hold that in its early stages of development Sufism effectively referred to nothing more than the internalization of Islam. According to one perspective, it is directly from the Qur'an, constantly recited, meditated, and experienced, that Sufism proceeded, in its origin and its development. Other practitioners have held that Sufism is the strict emulation of the way of Muhammad, through which the heart's connection to the Divine is strengthened.\n\nModern academics and scholars have rejected early Orientalist theories asserting a non-Islamic origin of Sufism, The consensus is that it emerged in Western Asia. Many have asserted Sufism to be unique within the confines of the Islamic religion, and contend that Sufism developed from people like Bayazid Bastami, who, in his utmost reverence to the sunnah, refused to eat a watermelon because he did not find any proof that Muhammad ever ate it. According to the late medieval mystic Jami, Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a \"Sufi\".\n\nImportant contributions in writing are attributed to Uwais al-Qarani, Hasan of Basra, Harith al-Muhasibi, Abu Nasr as-Sarraj and Said ibn al-Musayyib. Ruwaym, from the second generation of Sufis in Baghdad, was also an influential early figure, as was [Junayd of Baghdad; a number of early practitioners of Sufism were disciples of one of the two.\n\nSufism had a long history already before the subsequent institutionalization of Sufi teachings into devotional orders (\"tarîqât\") in the early Middle Ages. The Naqshbandi order is a notable exception to general rule of orders tracing their spiritual lineage through Muhammad's grandsons, as it traces the origin of its teachings from Muhammad to the first Islamic Caliph, Abu Bakr.\n\nOver the years, Sufi orders have influenced and been adopted by various Shi'i movements, especially Isma'ilism, which led to the Safaviyya order's conversion to Shia Islam from Sunni Islam and the spread of Twelverism throughout Iran. Sufi orders include Ba 'Alawiyya, Badawiyya, Bektashi, Burhaniyya, Chishti, Khalwati, Mevlevi, Naqshbandi, Ni'matullāhī, Uwaisi, Qadiriyya, Qalandariyya, Rifa'i, Sarwari Qadiri, Shadhiliyya, Suhrawardiyya, Tijaniyyah, Zinda Shah Madariya, and others.\n\nExisting in both Sunni and Shia Islam, Sufism is not a distinct sect, as is sometimes erroneously assumed, but a method of approaching or a way of understanding the religion, which strives to take the regular practice of the religion to the \"supererogatory level\" through simultaneously \"fulfilling ... [the obligatory] religious duties\" and finding a \"way and a means of striking a root through the 'narrow gate' in the depth of the soul out into the domain of the pure arid unimprisonable Spirit which itself opens out on to the Divinity.\" Academic studies of Sufism confirm that Sufism, as a separate tradition from Islam apart from so-called \"pure Islam\", is frequently a product of Western orientalism and modern Islamic fundamentalists.\n\nAs a mystic and ascetic aspect of Islam, it is considered as the part of Islamic teaching that deals with the purification of the inner self. By focusing on the more spiritual aspects of religion, Sufis strive to obtain direct experience of God by making use of \"intuitive and emotional faculties\" that one must be trained to use. \"Tasawwuf\" is regarded as a science of the soul that has always been an integral part of Orthodox Islam. In his \"Al-Risala al-Safadiyya\", ibn Taymiyyah describes the Sufis as those who belong to the path of the Sunna and represent it in their teachings and writings.\n\nIbn Taymiyya's Sufi inclinations and his reverence for Sufis like Abdul-Qadir Gilani can also be seen in his hundred-page commentary on \"Futuh al-ghayb\", covering only five of the seventy-eight sermons of the book, but showing that he considered \"tasawwuf\" essential within the life of the Islamic community.\n\nIn his commentary, Ibn Taymiyya stresses that the primacy of the \"sharia\" forms the soundest tradition in \"tasawwuf\", and to argue this point he lists over a dozen early masters, as well as more contemporary shaykhs like his fellow Hanbalis, al-Ansari al-Harawi and Abdul-Qadir, and the latter's own shaykh, Hammad al-Dabbas the upright. He cites the early shaykhs (shuyukh al-salaf) such as Al-Fuḍayl ibn ‘Iyāḍ, Ibrahim ibn Adham, Ma`ruf al-Karkhi, Sirri Saqti, Junayd of Baghdad, and others of the early teachers, as well as Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Hammad, Abu al-Bayan and others of the later masters— that they do not permit the followers of the Sufi path to depart from the divinely legislated command and prohibition.\n\nAl-Ghazali narrates in \"Al-Munqidh min al-dalal\":\n\nIn the eleventh-century, Sufism, which had previously been a less \"codified\" trend in Islamic piety, began to be \"ordered and crystallized\" into orders which have continued until the present day. All these orders were founded by a major Islamic scholar, and some of the largest and most widespread included the Qadiriyya (after Abdul-Qadir Gilani [d. 1166]), the Rifa'iyya (after Ahmed al-Rifa'i [d. 1182]), the Chishtiyya (after Moinuddin Chishti [d. 1236]), the Shadiliyya (after Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili [d. 1258]), the Hamadaniyyah (after Sayyid Ali Hamadani [d. 1384], the Naqshbandiyya (after Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari [d. 1389]). Contrary to popular perception in the West, however, neither the founders of these orders nor their followers ever considered themselves to be anything other than orthodox Sunni Muslims, and in fact all of these orders were attached to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni Islam. Thus, the Qadiriyya order was Hanbali, with its founder, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, being a renowned jurist; the Chishtiyya was Hanafi; the Shadiliyya order was Maliki; and the Naqshbandiyya order was Hanafi. Thus, it is precisely because it is historically proven that \"many of the most eminent defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, such as Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Ghazali, and the Sultan Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn (Saladin) were connected with Sufism\" that the popular studies of writers like Idries Shah are continuously disregarded by scholars as conveying the fallacious image that \"Sufism\" is somehow distinct from \"Islam.\"\n\nTowards the end of the first millennium, a number of manuals began to be written summarizing the doctrines of Sufism and describing some typical Sufi practices. Two of the most famous of these are now available in English translation: the \"Kashf al-Mahjûb\" of Ali Hujwiri and the \"Risâla\" of Al-Qushayri.\n\nTwo of al-Ghazali's greatest treatises are the \"Revival of Religious Sciences\" and what he termed \"its essence\", the \"Kimiya-yi sa'ādat\". He argued that Sufism originated from the Qur'an and thus was compatible with mainstream Islamic thought and did not in any way contradict Islamic Law—being instead necessary to its complete fulfillment. Ongoing efforts by both traditionally trained Muslim scholars and Western academics are making al-Ghazali's works more widely available in English translation, allowing English-speaking readers to judge for themselves the compatibility of Islamic Law and Sufi doctrine. Several sections of the \"Revival of Religious Sciences\" have been published in translation by the Islamic Texts Society. An abridged translation (from an Urdu translation) of \"The Alchemy of Happiness\" was published by Claud Field () in 1910. It has been translated in full by Muhammad Asim Bilal (2001).\n\nHistorically, Sufism became \"an incredibly important part of Islam\" and \"one of the most widespread and omnipresent aspects of Muslim life\" in Islamic civilization from the early medieval period onwards, when it began to permeate nearly all major aspects of Sunni Islamic life in regions stretching from India and Iraq to the Balkans and Senegal.\n\nThe rise of Islamic civilization coincides strongly with the spread of Sufi philosophy in Islam. The spread of Sufism has been considered a definitive factor in the spread of Islam, and in the creation of integrally Islamic cultures, especially in Africa and Asia. The Senussi tribes of Libya and the Sudan are one of the strongest adherents of Sufism. Sufi poets and philosophers such as Khoja Akhmet Yassawi, Rumi, and Attar of Nishapur (c. 1145 – c. 1221) greatly enhanced the spread of Islamic culture in Anatolia, Central Asia, and South Asia. Sufism also played a role in creating and propagating the culture of the Ottoman world, and in resisting European imperialism in North Africa and South Asia.\n\nBetween the 13th and 16th centuries, Sufism produced a flourishing intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a \"Golden Age\" whose physical artifacts survive. In many places a person or group would endow a waqf to maintain a lodge (known variously as a \"zawiya\", \"khanqah\", or \"tekke\") to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts, as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge. The same system of endowments could also pay for a complex of buildings, such as that surrounding the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, including a lodge for Sufi seekers, a hospice with kitchens where these seekers could serve the poor and/or complete a period of initiation, a library, and other structures. No important domain in the civilization of Islam remained unaffected by Sufism in this period.\n\nSufism continued to remain a crucial part of daily Islamic life until the twentieth century, when its historical influence upon Islamic civilization began to be undermined by modernism as well as be combated by the rise of Salafism and Wahhabism. Islamic scholar Timothy Winter has remarked: \"[In] classical, mainstream, medieval Sunni Islam ... [the idea of] 'orthodox Islam' would not ... [have been possible] without Sufism\", and that the classical belief in Sufism being an essential component of Islam only weakened in some quarters of the Islamic world \"a generation or two ago\", with the rise of Salafism. In the modern world, the classical interpretation of Sunni orthodoxy, which sees in Sufism an essential dimension of Islam alongside the disciplines of jurisprudence and theology, is represented by institutions such as Egypt's Al-Azhar University and Zaytuna College, with Al-Azhar's current Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb recently defining \"Sunni orthodoxy\" as being a follower \"of any of the four schools of [legal] thought (Hanafi, Shafi’i, Maliki or Hanbali) and ... [also] of the Sufism of Imam Junayd of Baghdad in doctrines, manners and [spiritual] purification.\"\nCurrent Sufi orders include Alians, Bektashi Order, Mevlevi Order, Ba 'Alawiyya, Chishti Order, Jerrahi, Naqshbandi, Mujaddidi, Ni'matullāhī, Qadiriyya, Qalandariyya, Sarwari Qadiriyya, Shadhiliyya, Suhrawardiyya, Saifiah (Naqshbandiah), and Uwaisi. The relationship of Sufi orders to modern societies is usually defined by their relationship to governments.\n\nTurkey and Persia together have been a center for many Sufi lineages and orders. The Bektashi were closely affiliated with the Ottoman Janissaries and are the heart of Turkey's large and mostly liberal Alevi population. They have spread westwards to Cyprus, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and, more recently, to the United States, via Albania.\n\nSufism is popular in such African countries as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal, where it is seen as a mystical expression of Islam. Sufism is traditional in Morocco, but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism under contemporary spiritual teachers such as Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi. Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the mystical.\n\nThe life of the Algerian Sufi master Abdelkader El Djezairi is instructive in this regard. Notable as well are the lives of Amadou Bamba and El Hadj Umar Tall in West Africa, and Sheikh Mansur and Imam Shamil in the Caucasus. In the twentieth century, some Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious religion which holds back Islamic achievement in the fields of science and technology.\n\nA number of Westerners have embarked with varying degrees of success on the path of Sufism. One of the first to return to Europe as an official representative of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western Europe, was the Swedish-born wandering Sufi Ivan Aguéli. René Guénon, the French scholar, became a Sufi in the early twentieth century and was known as Sheikh Abdul Wahid Yahya. His manifold writings defined the practice of Sufism as the essence of Islam, but also pointed to the universality of its message. Other spiritualists, such as George Gurdjieff, may or may not conform to the tenets of Sufism as understood by orthodox Muslims.\n\nOther noteworthy Sufi teachers who have been active in the West in recent years include Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Inayat Khan, Nazim Al-Haqqani, Javad Nurbakhsh, Bulent Rauf, Irina Tweedie, Idries Shah, Muzaffer Ozak, Nahid Angha, and Ali Kianfar.\n\nCurrently active Sufi academics and publishers include Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, Nuh Ha Mim Keller, Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee, Waheed Ashraf, Omer Tarin, Ahmed abdu r Rashid and Timothy Winter.\n\nWhile all Muslims believe that they are on the pathway to Allah and hope to become close to God in Paradise—after death and after the Last Judgment—Sufis also believe that it is possible to draw closer to God and to more fully embrace the divine presence in this life. The chief aim of all Sufis is to seek the pleasing of God by working to restore within themselves the primordial state of \"fitra\".\n\nTo Sufis, the outer law consists of rules pertaining to worship, transactions, marriage, judicial rulings, and criminal law—what is often referred to, broadly, as \"qanun\". The inner law of Sufism consists of rules about repentance from sin, the purging of contemptible qualities and evil traits of character, and adornment with virtues and good character.\n\nTo the Sufi, it is the transmission of divine light from the teacher's heart to the heart of the student, rather than worldly knowledge, that allows the adept to progress. They further believe that the teacher should attempt inerrantly to follow the Divine Law.\n\nAccording to Moojan Momen \"one of the most important doctrines of Sufism is the concept of \"al-Insan al-Kamil\" \"the Perfect Man\". This doctrine states that there will always exist upon the earth a \"Qutb\" (Pole or Axis of the Universe)—a man who is the perfect channel of grace from God to man and in a state of wilayah (sanctity, being under the protection of Allah). The concept of the Sufi Qutb is similar to that of the Shi'i Imam. However, this belief puts Sufism in \"direct conflict\" with Shia Islam, since both the Qutb (who for most Sufi orders is the head of the order) and the Imam fulfill the role of \"the purveyor of spiritual guidance and of Allah's grace to mankind\". The vow of obedience to the Shaykh or Qutb which is taken by Sufis is considered incompatible with devotion to the Imam\".\n\nAs a further example, the prospective adherent of the Mevlevi Order would have been ordered to serve in the kitchens of a hospice for the poor for 1001 days prior to being accepted for spiritual instruction, and a further 1,001 days in solitary retreat as a precondition of completing that instruction.\n\nSome teachers, especially when addressing more general audiences, or mixed groups of Muslims and non-Muslims, make extensive use of parable, allegory, and metaphor. Although approaches to teaching vary among different Sufi orders, Sufism as a whole is primarily concerned with direct personal experience, and as such has sometimes been compared to other, non-Islamic forms of mysticism (e.g., as in the books of Hossein Nasr).\n\nMany Sufi believe that to reach the highest levels of success in Sufism typically requires that the disciple live with and serve the teacher for a long period of time. An example is the folk story about Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari, who gave his name to the Naqshbandi Order. He is believed to have served his first teacher, Sayyid Muhammad Baba As-Samasi, for 20 years, until as-Samasi died. He is said to then have served several other teachers for lengthy periods of time. He is said to have helped the poorer members of the community for many years and after this concluded his teacher directed him to care for animals cleaning their wounds, and assisting them.\n\nDevotion to Muhammad is an exceptionally strong practice within Sufism. Sufis have historically revered Muhammad as the prime personality of spiritual greatness. The Sufi poet Saadi Shirazi stated, \"He who chooses a path contrary to that of the prophet, shall never reach the destination. O Saadi, do not think that one can treat that way of purity except in the wake of the chosen one.\" Rumi attributes his self-control and abstinence from worldly desires as qualities attained by him through the guidance of Muhammad. Rumi states, \"I 'sewed' my two eyes shut from [desires for] this world and the next – this I learned from Muhammad.\" Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the greatest man and states, \"Muhammad's wisdom is uniqueness (\"fardiya\") because he is the most perfect existent creature of this human species. For this reason, the command began with him and was sealed with him. He was a Prophet while Adam was between water and clay, and his elemental structure is the Seal of the Prophets.\" Attar of Nishapur claimed that he praised Muhammad in such a manner that was not done before by any poet, in his book the \"Ilahi-nama\". Fariduddin Attar stated, \"Muhammad is the exemplar to both worlds, the guide of the descendants of Adam. He is the sun of creation, the moon of the celestial spheres, the all-seeing eye...The seven heavens and the eight gardens of paradise were created for him, he is both the eye and the light in the light of our eyes.\" Sufis have historically stressed the importance of Muhammad's perfection and his ability to intercede. The persona of Muhammad has historically been and remains an integral and critical aspect of Sufi belief and practice. Bayazid Bastami is recorded to have been so devoted to the \"sunnah\" of Muhammad that he refused to eat a watermelon because he could not establish that Muhammad ever ate one.\nIn the 13th century, a Sufi poet from Egypt, Al-Busiri, wrote the \"al-Kawākib ad-Durrīya fī Madḥ Khayr al-Barīya\" (The Celestial Lights in Praise of the Best of Creation) commonly referred to as \"Qaṣīdat al-Burda\" (\"Poem of the Mantle\"), in which he extensively praised Muhammad. This poem is still widely recited and sung amongst Sufi groups all over the world.\n\nAccording to Ibn Arabi, Islam is the best religion because of Muhammad. Ibn Arabi regards that the first entity that was brought into existence is the reality or essence of Muhammad (\"al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya\"). Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures. Muhammad is therefore the primary role model for human beings to aspire to emulate. Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested in this world and that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad. Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad. Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad is the best proof of God and by knowing Muhammad one knows God. Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both this world and the afterlife. In this view, Islam is the best religion, because Muhammad is Islam.\n\nSufis maintain that Muhammad is \"Al-Insān al-Kāmil\". Sufis believe that aid and support may be received from Muhammad, even today. Sufis believe that Muhammad listens to them when they call upon him. Sufis strive towards having a relationship with Muhammad and seeking to see Muhammad in a dream is a common Sufi practice.\n\nSufis believe the \"sharia\" (exoteric \"canon\"), \"tariqa\" (\"order\") and \"haqiqa\" (\"truth\") are mutually interdependent. Sufism leads the adept, called \"salik\" or \"wayfarer\", in his \"sulûk\" or \"road\" through different stations (\"maqaam\") until he reaches his goal, the perfect \"tawhid\", the existential confession that God is One. Ibn Arabi says, \"When we see someone in this Community who claims to be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even turn to look at him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved. (\"Jamiʿ karamat al-awliyaʾ\")\".\n\nThe Amman Message, a detailed statement issued by 200 leading Islamic scholars in 2005 in Amman, specifically recognized the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. This was adopted by the Islamic world's political and temporal leaderships at the Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit at Mecca in December 2005, and by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies including the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006. The definition of Sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what may be intended is simple tazkiah as opposed to the various manifestations of Sufism around the Islamic world).\n\nThe literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the \"sharia\" and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it. William Chittick explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:\nThe traditional Sufi orders, which are in majority, emphasize the role of Sufism as a spiritual discipline within Islam. Therefore, the \"sharia\" (traditional Islamic law) and the Sunnah are seen as crucial for any Sufi aspirant. One proof traditional orders assert is that almost all the famous Sufi masters of the past Caliphates were experts in \"sharia\" and were renowned as people with great \"Iman\" (faith) and excellent practice. Many were also \"Qadis\" (sharia law judges) in courts. They held that Sufism was never distinct from Islam and to fully comprehend and practice Sufism one must be an observant Muslim.\n\n\"Neo-Sufism,\" \"pseudo-Sufism,\" and \"universal Sufism\" are terms used to denote modern, Western forms or appropriations of Sufism that do not require adherence to shariah, or the Muslim faith. The terms are not always accepted by those it is applied to. For example, the Afghan-Scottish teacher Idries Shah has been described as a neo-Sufi by the Gurdjieffian James Moore. The Sufi Order in the West was founded by Inayat Khan, teaching the essential unity of all faiths, and accepting members of all creeds. Sufism Reoriented is an offshoot of it charted by the syncretistic teacher Meher Baba. The Golden Sufi Center exists in England, Switzerland and the United States. It was founded by Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee to continue the work of his teacher Irina Tweedie, herself a practitioner of both Hinduism and neo-Sufism. Other Western Sufi organisations include the Sufi Foundation of America and the International Association of Sufism.\n\nWestern Neo-Sufi practices may differ from traditional forms, for instance having mixed-gender meetings and less emphasis on the Qur'an.\n\nTraditional Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of Sufism, and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of different masters and devotional lineages.\n\nOn the one hand there is the order from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan). In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany. This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction (\"jadhba\"), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and Shadhili orders.\n\nContemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late Ottoman scholar Said Nursi and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the Risale-i Nur. This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or \"sunnah\", proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.\n\nSufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of \"subtle centers\" or centers of subtle cognition (known as \"Lataif-e-sitta\") addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition. In general, these subtle centers or \"latâ'if\" are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by Muhammad Emin Er.\n\nSufi psychology has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts. Ja'far al-Sadiq (both an imam in the Shia tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the nafs (self, ego, person), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the qalb (heart), and ruh (soul). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by \"nafs\"), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the \"ruh\").\n\nOf note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is Robert Frager, a Sufi teacher authorized in the Khalwati Jerrahi order. Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.\n\nSufi cosmology and Sufi metaphysics are also noteworthy areas of intellectual accomplishment.\n\nThe devotional practices of Sufis vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies. The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.\n\nPrerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth). Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the \"sunna prayers\"). This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous \"Hadith Qudsi\":\n\nMy servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.\nIt is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed (\"aqidah\"), and to embrace with certainty its tenets. The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).\n\nSufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a \"means\" for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of \"techniques\" is not the cause, but instead the \"occasion\" for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.\n\nMagic may have also been a part of some Sufi practices, notably in India.\n\n\"Dhikr\" is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the Qur'an for all Muslims through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from \"hadith\" literature and the Quran. More generally, \"dhikr\" takes a wide range and various layers of meaning. This includes \"dhikr\" as any activity in which the Muslim maintains awareness of Allah. To engage in \"dhikr\" is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and love, or \"to seek a state of godwariness\". The Quran refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of \"dhikr\" of Allah (65:10–11). Some types of \"dhikr\" are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.\n\nThe \"dhikr\" may slightly vary among each order. Some Sufi orders engage in ritualized \"dhikr\" ceremonies, or \"sema\". \"Sema\" includes various forms of worship such as recitation, singing (the most well known being the Qawwali music of the Indian subcontinent), instrumental music, dance (most famously the Sufi whirling of the Mevlevi order), incense, meditation, ecstasy, and trance.\n\nSome Sufi orders stress and place extensive reliance upon \"dhikr\". This practice of \"dhikr\" is called \"Dhikr-e-Qulb\" (invocation of Allah within the heartbeats). The basic idea in this practice is to visualize the Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart.\n\nThe practice of \"muraqaba\" can be likened to the practices of meditation attested in many faith communities.\n\nWhile variation exists, one description of the practice within a Naqshbandi lineage reads as follows:\n\nHe is to collect all of his bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict themselves upon the heart. And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: \"\"Ilahî anta maqsûdî wa-ridâka matlûbî\"—my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek\". Then he brings to his heart the Name of the Essence—Allâh—and as it courses through his heart he remains attentive to its meaning, which is \"Essence without likeness\". The seeker remains aware that He is Present, Watchful, Encompassing of all, thereby exemplifying the meaning of his saying (may God bless him and grant him peace): \"Worship God as though you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He sees you\". And likewise the prophetic tradition: \"The most favored level of faith is to know that God is witness over you, wherever you may be\".\nSufi whirling (or \"Sufi spinning\") is a form of Sama or physically active meditation which originated among Sufis, and which is still practised by the Sufi Dervishes of the Mevlevi order. It is a customary dance performed within the \"sema\", through which dervishes (also called \"semazens\", from Persian ) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's nafs, egos or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on God, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the Solar System orbiting the sun.\n\nAs explained by Sufis:\nIn the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (\"tennure\") represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (\"hırka\"), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, \"All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!\"\n\n\"Qawwali\" is a form of Sufi devotional music popular in South Asia, usually performed at \"dargahs\". Sufi saint Amir Khusrow is said to have infused Persian, Arabic Turkish and Indian classical musical styles to create the genre in the 13th century. The songs are classified into hamd, na'at, manqabat, marsiya or ghazal, among others. The songs lasting for about 15 to 30 minutes, are performed by a group of singers, and instruments including the harmonium, tabla and dholak are used. Pakistani singing maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is credited with popularizing qawwali all over the world.\n\n\"Walī\" (, plural ) is an Arabic word whose literal meanings include \"custodian\", \"protector\", \"helper\", and \"friend.\" In the vernacular, it is most commonly used by Muslims to indicate an Islamic saint, otherwise referred to by the more literal \"friend of God.\" In the traditional Islamic understanding of saints, the saint is portrayed as someone \"marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness\", and who is specifically \"chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\" The doctrine of saints was articulated by Islamic scholars very early on in Muslim history, and particular verses of the Quran and certain \"hadith\" were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as \"documentary evidence\" of the existence of saints.\n\nSince the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when Sufism began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in Sunni Islam were the early Sufi mystics, like Hasan of Basra (d. 728), Farqad Sabakhi (d. 729), Dawud Tai (d. 777-81) Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya (d. 801), Maruf Karkhi (d. 815), and Junayd of Baghdad (d. 910). From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, \"the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism ... into orders or brotherhoods.\" In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this period, the saint was understood to be \"a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples.\"\n\nIn popular Sufism (i.e. devotional practices that have achieved currency in world cultures through Sufi influence), one common practice is to visit or make pilgrimages to the tombs of saints, renowned scholars, and righteous people. This is a particularly common practice in South Asia, where famous tombs include such saints as Sayyid Ali Hamadani in Kulob, Tajikistan; Afāq Khoja, near Kashgar, China; Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sindh; Ali Hajwari in Lahore, Pakistan; Bawaldin Zikrya in Multan Pakistan; Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, India; Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, India; and Shah Jalal in Sylhet, Bangladesh.\n\nLikewise, in Fez, Morocco, a popular destination for such pious visitation is the Zaouia Moulay Idriss II and the yearly visitation to see the current Sheikh of the Qadiri Boutchichi Tariqah, Sheikh Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi to celebrate the Mawlid (which is usually televised on Moroccan National television).\n\nIn Islamic mysticism, \"karamat\" ( \"karāmāt\", pl. of \"karāmah\", lit. generosity, high-mindedness) refers to supernatural wonders performed by Muslim saints. In the technical vocabulary of Islamic religious sciences, the singular form \"karama\" has a sense similar to \"charism\", a favor or spiritual gift freely bestowed by God. The marvels ascribed to Islamic saints have included supernatural physical actions, predictions of the future, and \"interpretation of the secrets of hearts\". Historically, a \"belief in the miracles of saints (\"karāmāt al-awliyāʾ\", literally 'marvels of the friends [of God]')\" has been \"a requirement in Sunni Islam.\"\n\nPersecution of Sufis and Sufism has included destruction of Sufi shrines and mosques, suppression of orders, and discrimination against adherents in a number of Muslim-majority countries. The Turkish Republican state banned all Sufi orders and abolished their institutions in 1925 after Sufis opposed the new secular order. The Iranian Islamic Republic has harassed Shia Sufis, reportedly for their lack of support for the government doctrine of \"\" (i.e., that the supreme Shiite jurist should be the nation's political leader).\n\nIn most other Muslim countries, attacks on Sufis and especially their shrines have come from Salafis who believe that practices such as celebration of the birthdays of Sufi saints, and dhikr (\"remembrance\" of God) ceremonies are bid‘ah or impure innovation, and polytheistic (Shirk).\n\nAt least 305 people were killed and more than 100 wounded during a November 2017 attack on a mosque in Sinai.\n\nAbdul-Qadir Gilani (1077–1166) was a Persian Hanbali jurist and Sufi based in Baghdad. Qadiriyya was his patronym. Gilani spent his early life in Na'if, the town of his birth. There, he pursued the study of Hanbali law. Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi gave Gilani lessons in fiqh. He was given lessons about \"hadith\" by Abu Bakr ibn Muzaffar. He was given lessons about Tafsir by Abu Muhammad Ja'far, a commentator. His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas. After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad. He spent twenty-five years as a reclusive wanderer in the desert regions of Iraq. In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public. He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi, and was popular with students. In the morning he taught \"hadith\" and \"tafsir\", and in the afternoon he held discourse on the science of the heart and the virtues of the Quran.\n\nAbul Hasan ash-Shadhili (died 1258), the founder of the Shadhiliyya order, introduced \"dhikr jahri\" (the remembrance of God out loud, as opposed to the silent \"dhikr\"). He taught that his followers need not abstain from what Islam has not forbidden, but to be grateful for what God has bestowed upon them, in contrast to the majority of Sufis, who preach to deny oneself and to destroy the ego-self (\"nafs\") \"Order of Patience\" (Tariqus-Sabr), Shadhiliyya is formulated to be \"Order of Gratitude\" (Tariqush-Shukr). Imam Shadhili also gave eighteen valuable \"hizbs\" (litanies) to his followers out of which the notable \"Hizb al-Bahr\" is recited worldwide even today.\n\nAhmad al-Tijani \nAbu al-ʿAbbâs Ahmad ibn Muhammad at-Tijânî or Ahmed Tijani (1735–1815), in Arabic سيدي أحمد التجاني (\"Sidi Ahmed Tijani\"), is the founder of the Tijaniyya Sufi order. He was born in a Berber family, in Aïn Madhi, present-day Algeria and died in Fez, Morocco at the age of 80.\n\nBayazid Bastami is a very well recognized and influential Sufi personality. Bastami was born in 804 in Bastam. Bayazid is regarded for his devout commitment to the Sunnah and his dedication to fundamental Islamic principals and practices.\n\nBawa Muhaiyaddeen (died 1986) is a Sufi Sheikh from Sri Lanka. He was first found by a group of religious pilgrims in the early 1900s meditating in the jungles of Kataragama in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Awed and inspired by his personality and the depth of his wisdom, he was invited to a nearby village. Since that time, people of all walks of life from paupers to prime ministers belonging to all religious and ethnic backgrounds have flocked to see Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen to seek comfort, guidance and help. Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen tirelessly spent the rest of his life preaching, healing and comforting the many souls that came to see him.\n\nMuhyiddin Muhammad b. 'Ali Ibn 'Arabi (or Ibn al-'Arabi) (AH 561 – AH 638; July 28, 1165 – November 10, 1240) is considered to be one of the most important Sufi masters, although he never founded any order (\"tariqa\"). His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of \"tawhid\" (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of \"wahdat al-wujud\" (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (\"ʿubudiyya\"), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.\n\nJunayd of Baghdad (830–910) was one of the great early Sufis. His order was Junaidia, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir. During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: \"From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better\". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa—i.e., the leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.\n\nMansur Al-Hallaj (died 922) is renowned for his claim, \"Ana-l-Haqq\" (\"I am The Truth\"). His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as apostasy, led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922. He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say \"O Lord! You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment. If I am a heretic, enlarge my heresy\".\n\nKhwaja Moinuddin Chishti was born in 1141 and died in 1236. Also known as \"Gharīb Nawāz\" (\"Benefactor of the Poor\"), he is the most famous Sufi saint of the Chishti Order. Moinuddin Chishti introduced and established the order in the Indian subcontinent. The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti, Bakhtiyar Kaki, Baba Farid, Nizamuddin Auliya (each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history. Moinuddin Chishtī turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached Ajmer along with Sultan Shahāb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori, and settled down there. In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city. Moinuddin Chishtī practiced the Sufi \"Sulh-e-Kul\" (peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.\n\nRabi'a al-'Adawiyya or Rabia of Basra (died 801) was a mystic who represents countercultural elements of Sufism, especially with regards to the status and power of women. Prominent Sufi leader Hasan of Basra is said to have castigated himself before her superior merits and sincere virtues. Rabi'a was born either a slave or a servant of very poor origin, released by her master when he awoke one night to see the light of sanctity shining above her head. Rabi'a al-Adawiyya is known for her teachings and emphasis on the centrality of the love of God to a holy life. She is said to have proclaimed, running down the streets of Basra, Iraq:\nShe died in Jerusalem and is thought to have been buried in the Chapel of the Ascension.\n\nA \"Dargah\" (Persian: درگاه \"dargâh\" or درگه \"dargah\", also in Urdu) is a shrine built over the grave of a revered religious figure, often a Sufi saint or dervish. Sufis often visit the shrine for ziyarat, a term associated with religious visits and pilgrimages. Dargahs are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called \"khanqah\" or hospices. They usually include a mosque, meeting rooms, Islamic religious schools (madrassas), residences for a teacher or caretaker, hospitals, and other buildings for community purposes.\n\nThe term \"Tariqa\" is used for a school or order of Sufism, or especially for the mystical teaching and spiritual practices of such an order with the aim of seeking ḥaqīqah (ultimate truth). A tariqa has a murshid (guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director. The members or followers of a tariqa are known as \"murīdīn\" (singular \"murīd\"), meaning \"desirous\", viz. \"desiring the knowledge of knowing God and loving God\".\n\nThe Bektashi Order was founded in the 13th century by the Islamic saint Haji Bektash Veli, and greatly influenced during its fomulative period by the Hurufi Ali al-'Ala in the 15th century and reorganized by Balım Sultan in the 16th century.\n\nThe Chishti Order () was founded by (Khawaja) Abu Ishaq Shami (\"the Syrian\"; died 941) who brought Sufism to the town of Chisht, some 95 miles east of Herat in present-day Afghanistan. Before returning to the Levant, Shami initiated, trained and deputized the son of the local Emir (Khwaja) Abu Ahmad Abdal (died 966). Under the leadership of Abu Ahmad's descendants, the \"Chishtiyya\" as they are also known, flourished as a regional mystical order.\n\nThe Kubrawiya order is a Sufi order (\"tariqa\") named after its 13th-century founder Najmuddin Kubra. The Kubrawiya Sufi order was founded in the 13th century by Najmuddin Kubra in Bukhara in modern Uzbekistan. The Mongols had captured Bukhara in 1221, they committed genocide and killed nearly the whole population. Sheikh Nadjm ed-Din Kubra was among those killed by the Mongols.\n\nThe Mevlevi Order is better known in the West as the \"whirling dervishes\".\n\nMouride is a large Islamic Sufi order most prominent in Senegal and The Gambia, with headquarters in the holy city of Touba, Senegal.\n\nThe Naqshbandi order is one of the major Sufi orders of Islam, previously known as Siddiqiyya as the order stems from Mohammad through Abū Bakr as-Șiddīq. It is considered by some to be a \"sober\" order known for its silent \"dhikr\" (remembrance of God) rather than the vocalized forms of \"dhikr\" common in other orders. The word \"Naqshbandi\" () is Persian, taken from the name of the founder of the order, Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari. Some have said that the translation means \"related to the image-maker\", some also consider it to mean \"Pattern Maker\" rather than \"image maker\", and interpret \"Naqshbandi\" to mean \"Reformer of Patterns\", and others consider it to mean \"Way of the Chain\" or \"Silsilat al-dhahab\".\n\nThe Ni'matullāhī order is the most widespread Sufi order of Persia today. It was founded by Shah Ni'matullah Wali (died 1367), established and transformed from his inheritance of the Ma'rufiyyah circle. There are several suborders in existence today, the most known and influential in the West following the lineage of Dr. Javad Nurbakhsh who brought the order to the West following the 1979 Revolution in Iran.\n\nThe Qadiri Order is one of the oldest Sufi Orders. It derives its name from Abdul-Qadir Gilani (1077–1166), a native of the Iranian province of Gīlān. The order is one of the most widespread of the Sufi orders in the Islamic world, and has a huge presence in Central Asia, Pakistan, Turkey, Balkans and much of East and West Africa. The Qadiriyyah have not developed any distinctive doctrines or teachings outside of mainstream Islam. They believe in the fundamental principles of Islam, but interpreted through mystical experience.\n\nSenussi is a religious-political Sufi order established by Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi. Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi founded this movement due to his criticism of the Egyptian ulema. Originally from Mecca, as-Senussi left due to pressure from Wahhabis to leave and settled in Cyrenaica where he was well received. Idris bin Muhammad al-Mahdi as-Senussi was later recognized as Emir of Cyrenaica and eventually became King of Libya. The monarchy was abolished by Muammar Gaddafi but, a third of Libyan still claim to be Senussi.\n\nThe Shadhili is a Sufi order founded by Abu-l-Hassan ash-Shadhili. Ikhwans (Murids - followers) of the Shadhiliyya are often known as Shadhilis. Fassiya a branch of Shadhiliyya founded by Imam al Fassi of Makkah is the widely practiced Sufi order in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius, Indonesia and other middle east countries.\n\nThe Suhrawardiyya order () is a Sufi order founded by Abu al-Najib al-Suhrawardi (1097–1168). The order was formalized by his nephew, Shahab al-Din Abu Hafs Umar Suhrawardi.\n\nThe Tijaniyyah order attach a large importance to culture and education, and emphasize the individual adhesion of the disciple (murīd).\n\nSufi mysticism has long exercised a fascination upon the Western world, and especially its Orientalist scholars. Figures like Rumi have become well known in the United States, where Sufism is perceived as a peaceful and apolitical form of Islam. Orientalists have proposed a variety of diverse theories pertaining to the nature of Sufism, such as it being influenced by Neoplatonism or as an Aryan historical reaction against \"Semitic\" cultural influence. Hossein Nasr states that the preceding theories are false according to the point of view of Sufism.\n\nThe Islamic Institute in Mannheim, Germany, which works towards the integration of Europe and Muslims, sees Sufism as particularly suited for interreligious dialogue and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and pluralist societies; it has described Sufism as a symbol of tolerance and humanism—nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent. According to Philip Jenkins, a Professor at Baylor University, \"the Sufis are much more than tactical allies for the West: they are, potentially, the greatest hope for pluralism and democracy within Muslim nations.\" Likewise, several governments and organisations have advocated the promotion of Sufism as a means of combating intolerant and violent strains of Islam. For example, the Chinese and Russian governments openly favor Sufism as the best means of protecting against Islamist subversion. The British government, especially following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, has favoured Sufi groups in its battle against Muslim extremist currents. The influential RAND Corporation, an American think-tank, issued a major report titled \"Building Moderate Muslim Networks,\" which urged the US government to form links with and bolster Muslim groups that opposed Islamist extremism. The report stressed the Sufi role as moderate traditionalists open to change, and thus as allies against violence. News organisations such as the BBC, Economist and Boston Globe have also seen Sufism as a means to deal with violent Muslim extremists.\n\nIdries Shah states that Sufism is universal in nature, its roots predating the rise of Islam and Christianity. He quotes Suhrawardi as saying that \"this [Sufism] was a form of wisdom known to and practiced by a succession of sages including the mysterious ancient Hermes of Egypt.\", and that Ibn al-Farid \"stresses that Sufism lies behind and before systematization; that 'our wine existed before what you call the grape and the vine' (the school and the system)...\" Shah's views have however been rejected by modern scholars. Such modern trends of neo-Sufis in Western countries allow non-Muslims to receive \"instructions on following the Sufi path\", not without opposition by Muslims who consider such instruction outside the sphere of Islam.\n\nBoth Judaism and Islam are monotheistic. There is evidence that Sufism did influence the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics. In the first writing of this kind, we see \"Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'iḍ al-Ḳulub\", \"Duties of the Heart\", of Bahya ibn Paquda. This book was translated by Judah ibn Tibbon into Hebrew under the title \"Ḥōḇōṯ Ha-lleḇāḇōṯ\".\n\nIt is noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis Al-Kusajri and Al-Harawi there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the \"Ḥovot ha-Lebabot\" and which bear the same titles: e.g., \"Bab al-Tawakkul\"; \"Bab al-Taubah\"; \"Bab al-Muḥasabah\"; \"Bab al-Tawaḍu'\"; \"Bab al-Zuhd\". In the ninth gate, Baḥya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls \"Perushim\". However, the author of the \"Ḥōḇōṯ Ha-lleḇāḇōṯ\" did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.\n\nAbraham ben Moses ben Maimon, the son of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets. See Sefer Hammaspiq, \"Happerishuth\", Chapter 11 (\"Ha-mmaʿaḇāq\") s.v. hithbonen efo be-masoreth mufla'a zo, citing the Talmudic explanation of Jeremiah 13:27 in Chagigah 5b; in Rabbi Yaakov Wincelberg's translation, \"The Way of Serving God\" (Feldheim), p. 429 and above, p. 427. Also see ibid., Chapter 10 (\"Iqquḇim\"), s.v. wa-halo yoḏeʾaʿ atta; in \"The Way of Serving God\", p. 371.\n\nAbraham Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in Judeo-Arabic and entitled \"כתאב כפאיה אלעאבדין\" \"Kitāb Kifāyah al-'Ābidīn\" (\"A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God\"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's Guide for the Perplexed. In the book, Maimuni evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in Egypt.\n\nThe followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not to be confused with the [later] Jewish Hasidic movement) or Sufism (\"Tasawwuf\"), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation. The Jewish Sufis maintained their own brotherhood, guided by a religious leader—like a Sufi sheikh.\n\nIn 2005, Rabbi Shergill released a Sufi rock song called \"Bulla Ki Jaana\", which became a chart-topper in India and Pakistan.\n\nThe 13h century Persian poet Rumi, is considered one of the most influential figures of Sufism, as well as one of the greatest poets of all time. He has become one of the most widely read poets in the United States, thanks largely to the interpretative translations published by Coleman Barks. Elif Şafak's novel \"The Forty Rules of Love\" is a fictionalized account of Rumi's encounter with the Persian dervish Shams Tabrizi.\n\nAllama Iqbal, one of the greatest Urdu poets has discussed Sufism, philosophy and Islam in his English work \"The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2074549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074549", "title": "Tsang Lap Chuen", "text": "Tsang Lap Chuen\n\nTsang Lap Chuen (Chinese: 曾立存) is a Chinese philosopher in the analytic tradition. He is known for his theory of the sublime in which he presents the notion of limit-situations in life as being central to the human experience.\n\nTsang was born in Wuhua County, Guangdong, China on 7 October 1943, the son of Tsang Kwok Ying (1906–1999), District Minister of (formerly Basle Mission) of Hong Kong, and Wong Kun Tsing (1916–2014), a devout Christian committed to the church and family. They moved to Hong Kong when he was two years old. Today he and his wife Tse Wai Yee live in Hong Kong. They have two sons, Tze Yee and Tze Yan.\n\nTsang attended church-operated public schools before studying at the University of Hong Kong from 1963 to 1968, graduating with a B.A. in philosophy and modern languages and an M.A. in philosophy. From 1968 to 1970 he was a philosophy tutor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. From 1969 to 1974, he continued his study at HKU for a PhD in philosophical method, which ended with his withdrawal due to gradual digression of his research interests. From 1975 until 2004, he was a faculty member in general education and religious studies at Hong Kong Baptist University; from 1978 to 1979, its exchange professor to Malone College, USA; and, from 1995 to 2000, head of its Department of Religion and Philosophy.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1991 Tsang re-enrolled for the PhD program at HKU, this time in philosophy of religion, with the research topic of existential wonder. To place the topic in a historical context, his supervisor F.C.T. Moore introduced him to Kant’s \"Critique of Judgment\" on the concept of the sublime. Eventually, he worked out a thesis on a new theory of the sublime in the tradition of Longinus, Burke and Kant, later published as \"The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory\" by the recommendation of Joseph A. Munitiz, then the Master of Campion Hall, Oxford.\n\nIn the light of Wittgenstein on \"language games\", Lévi-Strauss on \"ritual and myth\" and Freud on \"ideas and dreams\", Tsang develops a conceptual framework of [i] construal, [ii] evocation, [iii] affectivity and [iv] instantiation, giving a coherent account of the elements that can be distinguished in the phenomenon of the sublime, with the event of the Crucifixion as an exemplary instance. In the experience of the sublime, Longinus emphasises our contemplation and thought reaching the limit of the natural order of grandeur; Burke our self-preservation in situations which defy our existing capacities; and Kant our transcendence of the natural order as supersensible beings. Each of them is concerned with an aspect of the sublime which Tsang characterises, in general terms, as that which transports us to a self-realization at the limit of our existence.\n\nAccording to the theory Tsang proposes, the sublime is concerned with a limit-situation in life and our self-realization in it such that the core of all experience of the sublime is an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit. Life-limits are of three kinds, the top limit to our being which borders on that which transcends the natural and the human, the bottom limit to our being which borders on the non-existent, and the median limit which designates the bloom of our being in its domain. We come to an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit in our encounter with an object which is so construed that it elicits a set of thoughts and reactions pertaining to certain themes, including the limits of our powers and abilities, and the importance of being able to go up to or even beyond those limits.\n\nAs such the sublime is concerned with the notion of a limit to what can be said and thought and willed. The sublime is not an object \"per se\", but a particular manner in which certain objects are construed and are evocative of certain thoughts and reactions. There is no one common property of sublime objects, no one single emotional state in sublime experiences, which is an essential feature of the sublime. For the sublime is but a notion in the mind and heart of the person in relation to the object, any object, which is confronted as sublime. However, from the standpoint of an external observer, one is able to distinguish in the experience of the sublime that which presupposes the universality of certain concepts and human characteristics and that which belongs to particular cultural and social forms and varies from culture to culture.\n\nThe book on \"The Sublime\" is recognised in some quarters as ‘an important work offering a viable theory for the concept of \"sublime\" in philosophy’. Among those who consider the theory to be acceptable are Alasdair MacIntyre, an influential moral philosopher, and Cyril Barrett, a renowned aesthetician and art critic. However, as has been pointed out, the theory as proposed, even if it is viable, needs to be spelled out further.\n\n"}
{"id": "348668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=348668", "title": "Unity of the proposition", "text": "Unity of the proposition\n\nIn philosophy, the unity of the proposition is the problem of explaining how a sentence in the indicative mood expresses more than just what a list of proper names expresses.\n\nThe problem was discussed under this name by Bertrand Russell, but can be traced back to Plato. In Plato's \"Sophist\", the simplest kind of sentence consists of just a proper name and a universal term (i.e. a predicate). The name refers to or picks out some individual object, and the predicate then says something about that individual.\n\nThe difficulty is to explain how the predicate does this. If, as Plato thinks, the predicate is the name of some universal concept or form, how do we explain how the sentence comes to be true or false? If, for example, \"Socrates is wise\" consists of just a name for Socrates, and a name for the universal concept of Wisdom, how could the sentence be true \"or\" false? In either case, the \"Socrates\" signifies Socrates, and the predicate signifies Wisdom. But the sentence \"asserts\" that Socrates is wise. The assertion of wisdom must consist in the assertion of some relation between Socrates and Wisdom. What is this relation?\n\nThe problem was discussed much later by Francis Bradley. If we assume that a sentence consists of two objects and a relation that connects them, and we represent this by three names, say John, loving, Mary, how do we express the fact that John loves Mary? For \"John\", \"loving\" and \"Mary\" would name the objects they do, even if this were not a fact. This is known as Bradley's regress.\n\nThe problem became significant in the early development of set theory. Set membership is a formal representation of the relation between the two parts of the proposition, and there are certain philosophical problems connected with this, as Frege realised when he investigated the distinction between concept and object. Assume that \"Shergar is a horse\" analyses into what \"Shergar\" names (an \"Object\", according to Frege), and what \"is a horse\" names (a \"Concept\"). Objects are fundamentally different from concepts, otherwise we get the problem of the unity of the proposition. A predicate cannot function as the subject of a sentence. But what are we doing when we talk about the concept \"is a horse\"? Aren't we using the expression \"the concept \"is a horse\"\", and isn't that a subject expression, which refers (on Frege's account) to an Object? Yes, says Frege, and on that account the concept \"is a horse\" is not a concept at all. This is a dogma that even Frege's most faithful followers found difficult to swallow.\n\nThe difficulty was discussed in detail in \"The Principles of Mathematics\" by Russell, who saw no resolution.\n\nConsider e.g. \"A differs from B\". The constituents of this proposition are simply A, difference and B. The proposition relates A and B, using the words \"is ... from\" in \"A is different from B\". But if we represent this contribution by words for relations, as e.g. \"A <R> difference <R> B\" we are back to a list of terms, we are essentially back at Bradley's regress.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein addresses the problem early on in the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\". In section 2.01 he claims that \"states of affairs\" are combinations of objects. In section 2.03 he explains that nothing is needed to link the objects, since the objects \"hang together\". The arrangement of words that in the sentence corresponds to the arrangement or \"structure\" of objects in the state of affairs expressed by the sentence. This is the so-called picture theory of the proposition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2289465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289465", "title": "Worldcentrism", "text": "Worldcentrism\n\nThe American integral philosopher Ken Wilber uses the term worldcentric to describe an advanced stage of ethical development. This involves a broadening of the spiritual horizon through the formulation of a transpersonal ethic in which we do not only desire the best for all people but for all living beings. It is this aspect where worldcentrism is viewed as an expansion of sociocentrism where one focuses beyond self-needs to also extend care about the group, community, and society. The idea is that worldcentrism situates the positive aspects of egocentrism and sociocentrism in a larger context of concern so that consideration does not only include one's self or one's people but all peoples and all beings. Synonyms of \"worldcentric\" include \"global\" and \"planetary\". \n\nThere are also worldcentrists who maintain that living beings engage in autopoiesis (self-making, self-producing, and self-repairing), which renders these beings as ends-in-themselves and of equal ground value, in addition to whatever extrinsic or intrinsic value they possess.\n\nWilber also sometimes refers to an ethical stage that is beyond the worldcentric, which he calls \"kosmocentric\". In a \"kosmocentric\" awareness, one experiences a release of attachments of the gross realm and a radical recognition of evolutionary processes so that an individual is compassionately called to action and becomes capable of letting the gravity of outcomes go. Wilber used to associate these advanced ethical stages with mystical states, but since 2002 he has associated these advanced ethical stages with the development of complexity in the self-related lines of identity, studied by Susanne Cook-Greuter.
