Originally devised by metaphysicist Edward Zalta in 1999, the theory was an expansion of mathematical Platonism.\n\n\"Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics\" (1983) is the title of a publication by Edward Zalta that outlines abstract object theory.\n\nOn Zalta's account, there are two modes of predication: some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) \"exemplify\" properties, while others (abstract objects like numbers, and what others would call \"non-existent objects\", like the round square, and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely \"encode\" them. While the objects that exemplify properties are discovered through traditional empirical means, a simple set of axioms allows us to know about objects that encode properties. For every set of properties, there is exactly one object that encodes exactly that set of properties and no others. This allows for a formalized ontology.\n\n"}

He sought to revive Islam, and to propagate what he understood to be \"true Islam\". He believed that Islam was essential for politics, and that it was necessary to institute \"sharia\" and preserve Islamic culture from what he viewed as the evils of secularism, nationalism and socialism, which he understood to be the influence Western imperialism.\n\nHe was the founder of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the then largest Islamic organisation in Asia.\nHe and his party are thought to have been the pioneer in politicizing Islam and generating support for an Islamic state in Pakistan.\nThey are thought to have helped inspire General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to introduce \"Sharization\" to Pakistan,\nand to have been greatly strengthened by him after tens of thousands of members and sympathizers were given jobs in the judiciary and civil service during his administration.\nHe was the first recipient of the Saudi Arabian King Faisal International Award for his service to Islam in 1979.\nHe has been the second person in history whose absentee funeral was observed in the Kaaba, succeeding King Ashama ibn-Abjar.\n\nMaududi was born in Aurangabad India, then part of the princely state enclave of Hyderabad, until it returned to India in 1948.\n\nHe was the youngest of three sons of Maulana Ahmad Hasan, a lawyer by profession. Although his father was only middle-class, he was the descendant of the Chishti line of saints; in fact his last name was derived from the first member of the Chishti Silsilah, i.e. Khawajah Syed Qutb ul-Din Maudood Chishti (d. 527 AH). His father's mother was related to Islamic modernist thinker Sayyid Ahmad Khan. As he himself states, his paternal family originally moved from Chicht, in modern-day Afghanistan, during the days of Sikandar Lodi (d. 1517), initially settling in the state of Haryana before moving to Delhi later on, and on his mother's side, his ancestor Mirza Tulak, a soldier of Turkish origin, moved into India from Transoxiana around the times of emperor Aurangzeb (d. 1707), while his maternal grandfather, Mirza Qurban Ali Baig Khan Salik (1816-1881), was a well-known writer and poet in Delhi, a friend of the famous Urdu poet Ghalib.\n\nAt an early age, until he was nine, Maududi was given home education, he \"received religious nurture at the hands of his father and from a variety of teachers employed by him.\" As his father wanted him to become a maulvi, this education consisted of learning Arabic, Persian, Islamic law and hadith. He also studied books of mantiq (logic). A precocious child, he translated Qasim Amin's \"al-Marah al-jadidah\" (\"The New Woman\"), a modernist and feminist work, from Arabic into Urdu at the age of 11. In the field of translation, years later, he also worked on some 3,500 pages from \"Asfar\", a work of Persian mystical thinker Mulla Sadra. His thought would influence Mawdudi, as \"Sadra's notions of rejuvenation of the temporal order, and the necessity of the reign of Islamic law (the shari'ah) for the spiritual ascension of man, found an echo in Mawdudi's works.\"\n\nWhen he was 11, Maududi was admitted to eighth class directly in Madrasa Fawqaniyya Mashriqiyya (Oriental High School), Aurangabad, founded by Shibli Nomani, a modernist Islamic scholar trying to synthesize traditional Islamic scholarship with modern knowledge, and which awakened Maududi's long-lasting interest in philosophy (particularly from Thomas Arnold, who also taught the same subject to Muhammad Iqbal) as well as natural sciences, like mathematics, physics and chemistry. He then moved to a more traditionalist Darul Uloom in Hyderabad. Meanwhile, his father shifted to Bhopal – there Maududi befriended Niaz Fatehpuri, another modernist – where he suffered a severe paralysis attack and died leaving no property or money, forcing his son to abort his education. In 1919, by the time he was 16, and still a modernist in mindset, he moved to Delhi and read books by his distant relative, the reformist Sayyid Ahmad Khan. He also learned English and German in order to study, intensively, Western philosophy, sociology and history for full five years : he eventually came up to the conclusion that \"ulama’ in the past did not endeavor to discover the causes of Europe's rise, and he offered a long list of philosophers whose scholarship had made Europe a world power : Fichte, Hegel, Comte, Mill, Turgot, Adam Smith, Malthus, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Darwin, Goethe, and Herder, among others. Comparing their contribution to that of Muslims, he concluded that the latter's did not reach even 1 percent.\"\n\nEven if he began to get seriously involved in journalism from the early 1920s onwards, being appointed editor of the leading weekly Urdu newspaper \"Taj\" of Jabalpur in 1920 at the age of 17, he also resumed his studies as an autodidact in 1921, notably through the influence of some members of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, by studying the Dars-e-Nizami and subjects such as adab (literature), mantiq (logiq), and kalam (theology and philosophy.) Mawdudi got ijazahs (certificates and diplomas in traditional Islamic learning) but never called himself an 'alim in the formal sense because he found the Islamic scholars to be regressive, even though some Deobandi influence on him would remain:I do not have the prerogative to belong to the class of Ulema. I am a man of the middle cadre, who has imbibed something from both the systems of education, the new and the old; and has gathered my knowledge by traversing both paths. By virtue of my inner light, I conclude that neither the old school nor the new is totally in the right. \n\nFrom 1924 to 1927 Maududi was the editor of \"al-Jamiah\", the newspaper of the Jamiyat-i Ulama (an organization of Islamic clergy), a position of \"extreme importance and influence.\"\n\nAlways interested in independence from the British, Maududi lost faith in the Congress Party and its Muslim allies in the 1920s as the party developed an increasingly Hindu identity. He began to turn more towards Islam, and believed that Democracy could be a viable option for Muslims only if the majority of Indians were Muslim.\n\nMaududi spent some time in Delhi as a young man but went back to Hyderabad in 1928.\n\nIt was from 1933 to 1941 that Maududi's \"most important and influential\" works were published, according to scholar Seyyed Vali Nasr. Nasr describes his role at the time as a \"ideologue\" rather than a journalist he was earlier, or the political activist he became after founding his party.\n\nIn 1932 he joined another journal (\"Tarjuman al-Quran\") and from 1932 to 1937 he began to develop his political ideas, and turn towards the cause of Islamic revivalism and Islam as an ideology, as opposed to what he called \"traditional and hereditary religion\". The government of Hyderabad helped support the journal buying 300 subscriptions which it donated to libraries around India. Maududi was alarmed by the decline of Muslim ruled Hyderabad, the increasing secularism and lack of Purdah among Muslim women in Delhi.\n\nBy 1937 he became in conflict with Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and its support for a pluralistic Indian society where the Jamiat hoped Muslims could \"thrive ... without sacrificing their identity or interests.\"\n\nIn that year he also married Mahmudah Begum, a woman from an old Muslim family with \"considerable financial resources\". The family provide financial help and allowed him to devote himself to research and political action, but his wife had \"liberated\", modern ways, and at first rode a bicycle and did not observe purdah. She was given greater latitude by Maududi than were other Muslims.\n\nAt this time he also began work on establishing an organization for \"Da'wah\" (propagation and preaching of Islam) that would be an alternative to both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League.\n\nAt this time he decided to leave Hyderabad for Northwest India, closer to the Muslim political center of gravity in India. In 1938, after meeting the famous Muslim poet Muhammad Iqbal, Maududi moved to a piece of land in the village of Pathankot in the Punjab to oversee a \"Waqf\" (Islamic foundation) called \"Daru'l-Islam\".\n\nHis hope was to make it a \"nerve center\" of Islamic revival in India, an ideal religious community, providing leaders and the foundation for a genuine religious movement. He wrote to various Muslim luminaries invited them to join him there. The community, like Jamaat-i-Islami later, was composed of \"rukn\" (members), a \"shura`\" (a consultative council), and a \"sadr\" (head). After a dispute with the person who donated the land for the community over Maududi's anti-nationalist politics, Maududi quit the waqf and in 1939 moved the \"Daru'l-Islam\" with its membership from Pathankot to Lahore.\n\nIn Lahore he was hired by Islamiyah College but was sacked after less than a year for his openly political lectures.\n\nIn August 1941, Maududi founded Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) in British India as a religious political movement to promote Islamic values and practices.His Mission was supported by eminent scholars such as Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi, Mualana Muhammad Manzoor Naumani, Maulana Abul Hassan Ali Nudvi and Maulana Naeem Siddiqui. Maududi proposed forming a Muslim state based on Islamic law and in which Islam would guide all areas of life. This state would not be theocracy, Maududi held, but a \"theodemocracy\", because its rule would be based on the entire Muslim community, not the \"ulema\" (Islamic scholars).\n\nInitially, Maududi opposed the creation of a separate Muslim state in the subcontinent. As JI Ameer (leader) he opposed the leaders of the Muslim League who sought an independent Muslim-majority state. He believed that An Islamic state is a Muslim state, but a Muslim state may not be an Islamic state unless and until the Constitution of the state is based on the Qur'an and Sunnah.In particular he opposed the Pakistani state allowing conventional banking and giving too many rights to minorities and Muslims sects such as the Ahmadiyya he considered heretical.\n\nWith the Partition of India in 1947, the JI was split to follow the political boundaries of new countries carved out of British India. The organisation headed by Maududi became known as \"Jamaat-i-Islami\" Pakistan, and the remnant of JI in India as the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. Later JI parties were the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, and autonomous groups in Indian Kashmir.\n\nWith the founding of Pakistan, Maududi's career underwent a \"fundamental change\", being drawn more and more into politics, and spending less time on ideological and scholarly pursuits. Although his Jamaat-i Islami party never developed a mass following, it and Maududi did develop significant political influence. It played a \"prominent part\" in the agitation which brought down President Ayub Khan in 1969 and in the overthrow of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977.\nMaududi and the JI were especially influential in the early years of General Zia ul-Haq's rule.\n\nHis political activity, particularly in support of the creation of an Islamic state clashed with the government, (dominated for many years by a secular political class), and resulted in several arrests and periods of incarceration. The first was in 1948 when he and several other JI leaders were jailed after Maududi objected to the government's clandestine sponsorship of jihad in Kashmir while professing to observe a ceasefire with India.\n\nIn 1951 and again in 1956-7, the compromises involved in electoral politics led to a split in the party over what some members felt were a lowering of JI's moral standards. In 1951, the JI shura passed a resolution in support of the party withdrawing from politics, while Maududi argued for continued involvement. Maududi prevailed at an open party meeting in 1951, and several senior JI leaders resigned in protest, further strengthened Maududi's position and beginning the growth of a \"cult of personality\" around him.\" In 1957 Maududi again overruled the vote of the shura to withdraw from electoral politics.\n\nIn 1953, he and the JI participated in a campaign against the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan. Anti-Ahmadi groups argued that the Ahmadiyya did not embrace Muhammad as the last prophet. Maududi as well as the traditionalist ulama of Pakistan wanted Ahmadi designated as non-Muslims, Ahmadis such as Muhammad Zafarullah Khan sacked from all high level government positions, and intermarriage between Ahmadis and other Muslims prohibited. The campaign generated riots in Lahore, leading to the deaths of at least 200 Ahmadis, and selective declaration of martial law.\n\nMaududi was arrested by the military deployment headed by Lieutenant General Azam Khan and sentenced to death for his part in the agitation. However, the anti-Ahmadi campaign enjoyed much popular support, and strong public pressure ultimately convinced the government to release him after two years of imprisonment. According to Vali Nasr, Maududi's unapologetic and impassive stance after being sentenced, ignoring advise to ask for clemency, had an \"immense\" affect on his supporters. It was seen as a \"victory of Islam over un-Islam\", proof of his leadership and staunch faith.\n\nThe campaign shifted the focus of national politics towards Islamicity. The 1956 Constitution was adopted after accommodating many of the demands of the JI. Maududi endorsed the constitution and claimed it a victory for Islam.\n\nHowever following a coup by General Ayub Khan, the constitution was shelved and Maududi and his party were politically repressed, Maududi being imprisoned in 1964 and again in 1967. The JI joined an opposition alliance with secular parties, compromising with doctrine to support a woman candidate (Fatima Jinnah) for president against Khan in 1965. In the December 1970 general election, Maududi toured the country as a \"leader in waiting\" and JI spent considerable energy and resources fielding 151 candidates. Despite this, the party won only four seats in the national assembly and four in the provincial assemblies.\n\nThe loss led Maududi to withdraw from political activism in 1971 and return to scholarship. In 1972 he resigned as JI's Ameer (leader) for reasons of health. However it was shortly thereafter that Islamism gathered steam in Pakistan in the form of the \"Nizam-i-Mustafa\" (Order of the Prophet) movement, an alliance of conservative political groups united against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto which the JI gave shape to and which bolstered its standing.\n\nIn 1977, Maududi \"returned to the center stage\". When Bhutto attempted to defuse tensions on 16 April 1977, he came to Maududi's house for consultations. When General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq overthrew Bhutto and came to power in 1977, he \"accorded Mawdudi the status of a senior statesman, sought his advice, and allowed his words to adorn the front pages of the newspapers. Maududi proved receptive to Zia's overtures and supported his decision to execute Bhutto.\"\nDespite some doctrinal difference (Maududi wanted \"sharia\" by education rather than by state fiat), Maududi enthusiastically supported Zia and his program of Islamization or \"Sharization\".\n\nMaududi poured his energy into books, pamphlets and more than 1000 speeches and press statements, laying the ground work for making Pakistan an Islamic state, but also dealing with a variety of issues of interest in Pakistan and the Muslim world.\nHe sought to be a \"Mujaddid\", \"renewing\" (\"tajdid\") the religion. This role had great responsibility as he believed a \"Mujaddid\" \"on the whole, has to undertake and perform the same kind of work as is accomplished by a Prophet.\" While earlier mujaddids had renewed religion he wanted also \"to propagate true Islam, the absence of which accounted for the failure of earlier efforts at tajdid.\"\nAccording to at least one biographer (Vali Nasr), Maududi and the JI moved away from some of their more controversial doctrinal ideas (e.g. criticism of Sufism or the Ulama) and closer to orthodox Islam over the course of his career, in order to \"expand\"the \"base of support\" of Jama'at-e Islami.\n\nMaududi believed that the Quran was not just religious literature to be \"recited, pondered, or investigated for hidden truths\" according to Vali Nasr, but a \"socio-religious institution\", a work to be accepted \"at face value\" and obeyed. By implementing its prescriptions the ills of societies would solved. It pitted truth and bravery against ignorance, falsehood and evil.\nThe Qur'an is ... a Book which contains a message, an invitation, which generates a movement. The moment it began to be sent down, it impelled a quiet and pious man to ... raise his voice against falsehood, and pitted him in a grim struggle against the lords of disbelief, evil and iniquity... it drew every pure and noble soul, and gathered them under the banner of truth. In every part of the country, it made all the mischievous and the corrupt to rise and wage war against the bearers of the truth.\n\nIn his \"tafsir\" (Quranic interpretation) \"Tafhimu'l-Qur'an\", he introduced the four interrelated concepts he believed essential to understanding the Quran: \"ilah\" (divinity), \"rabb\" (lord), \"`ibadah\" (worship, meaning not the cherishing or praising of God but acting out absolute obedience to Him), and \"din\" (religion).\n\nMaududi saw Muslims not simply as those who followed the religion of Islam, but as (almost) everything, because obedience to divine law is what defines a Muslim: \"Everything in the universe is 'Muslim' for it obeys Allah by submission to His laws.\" The laws of the physical universe – that the heaven is above earth, that night follows day, etc. – were as much a part of \"sharia\" as banning consumption of alcohol and interest on debts. Thus it followed that stars, planets, oceans, rocks, atoms, etc. should actually be considered \"Muslims\" since they obey their creator's laws. Rather than Muslims being a minority among humans, one religious group among many, it is non-Muslims who are a small minority among everything in the universe. Of all creatures only humans (and jinn) are endowed with free will, and only non-Muslim humans (and jinn) choose to use that will to disobey the laws of their creator.\n\nBut in rejecting Islam (Maududi believed) the non-Muslim struggled against truth:\nHis very tongue which, on account of his ignorance advocates the denial of God or professes multiple deities, is in its very nature 'Muslim'... The man who denies God is called Kafir (concealer) because he conceals by his disbelief what is inherent in his nature and embalmed in his own soul. His whole body functions in obedience to that instinct... Reality becomes estranged from him and he in the dark.\n\nSince a Muslim is one who obeys divine law, simply having made a \"shahada\" (declaration of belief in the oneness of God and the acceptance of Muhammad as God's prophet) or being born into a Muslim family does not make you a Muslim.\nNor is seeking \"knowledge of God\" part of the religion of Islam.\nThe Muslim is a \"slave of God\", and \"absolute obedience to God\" is a \"fundamental right\" of God. The Muslim does \"not have the right to choose a way of life for himself or assume whatever duties he likes.\"\n\nMaududi believed that Islam covered all aspects of life. Islam is not a 'religion' in the sense this term is commonly understood. It is a system encompassing all fields of living. Islam means politics, economics, legislation, science, humanism, health, psychology and sociology. It is a system which makes no discrimination on the basis of race, color, language or other external categories. Its appeal is to all mankind. It wants to reach the heart of every human being.\"\n\nOf all these aspects of Islam, Maududi was primarily interested in culture—preserving Islamic dress, language and customs, from (what he believed were) the dangers of women's emancipation, secularism, nationalism, etc.\nIt was also important to separate the realm of Islam from non-Islam—to form \"boundaries\" around Islam.\nIt would also be proven scientifically (Maududi believed) that Islam would \"eventually ... emerge as the World-Religion to cure Man of all his maladies.\"\n\nBut what many Muslims, including many \"Ulama\", considered Islam, Maududi did not.\nMaudid complained that \"not more than 0.001%\" of Muslim knew what Islam actually was.\nMaududi not only idealized the first years of Muslim society (Muhammad and the \"rightly guided\" Caliphs) but considered what came after to be un-Islamic or \"jahiliya\"—with the exception of brief religious revivals. Muslim philosophy, literature, arts, mysticism were syncretic and impure, diverting attention from the divine.\n\nMaududi had a unique perspective on the transmission of hadith—the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, that form part of the basis of Islamic law. Rather than basing judgement of the quality of a hadith on the number and reliability of the chain of transmission (known as \"isnad\", Hadith where passed on orally before being written down) and the judgments of \"generations of \"muhaddithin\"\" (hadith scholars), Maududi believed in his intuition, and that \"with extensive study and practice one can develop a power and can intuitively sense the wishes and desires of the Holy Prophet... Thus ... on seeing a Hadith, I can tell whether the Holy Prophet could or could not have said it.\"\n\nAccording to Irfan Ahmad, while Maududi opposed all Western influence in Islam, he saw \"women's visibility\" in the bazaar, colleges, theatres, restaurants \"as the greatest threat to morality. Art, literature, music, film, dance, use of makeup by women: all were shrieking signs of immorality\". \n\nMaududi preached that the duty of women is to manage the household, bring up children and provide them and her husband with \"the greatest possible comfort and contentment\".\nMaududi supported the complete veiling and segregation of women as practiced in most of Muslim India of his time. Women, he believed, should remain in their homes except when absolutely necessary. The only room for argument he saw in the matter of veiling/hijab was \"whether the hands and the face\" of women \"were to be covered or left uncovered.\" On this question Maududi came down on the side of the complete covering of women's faces whenever they left their homes.\n\nConcerning the separation of the genders, he preached that men should avoid looking at women other than their wives, mothers, sisters, etc. (\"mahram\"), much less trying to make their acquaintance. He opposed birth control and family planning as a \"rebellion against the laws of nature\", and a reflection of loss of faith in God—who is the planner of human population—and unnecessary because population growth leads to economic development. Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui writes, As to the argument that family planning enables better nourishment and education of children, Mawdudi refers to the beneficial effects of adversity and want on human character.\n\nMaududi opposed allowing women to be either a head of state or a legislator, since \"according to Islam, active politics and administration are not the field of activity of the womenfolk.\" They would be allowed to elect their own all-woman legislature which the men's legislature should consult on all matters concerning women's welfare. Their legislature would also have \"the full right to criticize matters relating to the general welfare of the country,\" though not to vote on them.\n\nMaududi saw music and dancing as social evils. In describing the wickedness that comes of ignoring Islamic law he included not only leaving the poor to \"starvation and destitution\" while wallowing in luxury, liquor and drugs, but having \"a regular need\" for music, satisfied with \"musicians, dancing girls, drum-beaters and manufacturers of musical instruments\".\n\nHis 1941 lecture \"The economic problem of man and its Islamic solution\" is \"generally considered to be \"one of the founding document of modern Islamic economics. Maududi has been called the leader of the \"vanguard of contemporary Islamic orthodoxy\" in \"\"riba\" and finance.\" and credited with laying \"down the foundations for development\" of Islamic economics.\n\nHowever, Maududi believed Islam \"does not concern itself with the modes of production and circulation of wealth\", and was primarily interested in cultural issues rather than socioeconomic ones. \nMaududi dismissed the need for a \"new science of economics, embodied in voluminous books, with high-sounding terminology and large organisation\", or other \"experts and specialists\" which he believed to be \"one of the many calamities of modern age\". One of the major fallacies of economics was that it regarded \"as foolish and morally reprehensible\" spending \"all that one earns, and everyone is told that he should save something out of his income and have his savings deposited in the bank or purchase an insurance policy or invest it in stocks and shares of joint-stock companies.\" In fact, the practice of saving and not spending some income is \"ruinous for humanity\".\n\nBut since Islam was a complete system, it included (a shariah-based) economic program, comparable and (of course) superior to other economic systems.\nCapitalism was a \"satanic economic system\" starting with the fact that it called for the postponement of some consumption in favor of investment. This led to overproduction and a downward spiral of lower wages, protectionism, trade wars and desperate attempts to export surplus production and capital through imperialist invasions of other countries, finally ending in \"the destruction of the whole society as every learned economist knows\". \n\nOn the other hand, socialism — by putting control of the means and distribution of production in the hands of the government — concentrates power to such an extent it inevitably leads to enslavement of the masses. Socialists sought to end economic exploitation and poverty by structural changes and putting an end to private ownership of production and property. But in fact poverty and exploitation is caused not by the profit motive but by the lack of \"virtue and public welfare\" among the wealthy, which in turn comes from a lack of adherence to \"sharia\" law. In an Islamic society, greed, selfishness and dishonesty would be replaced by virtue, eliminating the need for the state to make any significant intervention in the economy.\n\nAccording to Maududi, this system would strike a \"golden mean\" between the two extremes of \"laisse faire\" capitalism and a regimented socialist/communist society, embodying all of the virtues and none of the vices of the two inferior systems. It would not be some kind of mixed economy/social democratic compromise, because by following Islamic law and banning alcohol, pork, adultery, music, dancing, interest on loans, gambling, speculation, fraud, and \"other similar things\", it would be distinct and superior to all other systems.\n\nBefore the economy (like the government, and other parts of society) could be Islamized, an Islamic revolution-through-education would have to take place to develop this virtue and create support for total \"sharia\" law. This put Maududi at a political disadvantage with populist and socialist programs because his solution was \"neither immediate nor tangible\".\n\nOf all the elements of Islamic laws dealing with property and money (payment of zakat and other Islamic taxes, etc.), Maududi emphasised the elimination of interest on loans (riba. (According to one scholar, because in British India Hindus dominated the money lending trade.)\n\nMaududi opposed any and all interest on loans as unIslamic \"riba\". He taught that there \nis hardly a country of the world in which moneylenders and banks are not sucking the blood of poor labouring classes, farmers and low income groups ... A major portion of the earning of a working man is expropriated by the moneylenders, leaving the poor man with hardly enough money to feed himself and his family. While the Quran forbid many sins, it saved its \"severest terms\" of punishment — according to Maududi — for use of interest. \n\nHe believed there was no such thing as a low \"reasonable rate of interest\" and that even \"the smallest and apparently harmless form\" of interest was intolerable in Islam as rates would inevitably increased over time when the \"capitalists\" (moneylenders) squeezed the entrepreneurs (borrowers) eliminating any entrepreneurial profit. To replace interest-based finance he proposed \"|direct equity investment\" (Profit and loss sharing), which he asserted would favor \"societally profitable\" ventures such as low-income housing that conventional finance ignores in favour of commercially profitable ones. To eliminate the charging of interest he proposed penal punishment with the death penalty for repeat offenders.\n\nCritics (Feisal Khan) complain that Maududi had no training as an economist and his description of interest-based finance resembles that of the dynamic between South Asian peasant and village moneylender rather than between modern conventional bank and borrower, and further that Maududi gives no explanation why direct equity finance would lead to any more investment in what is good for society but not commercially profitable than interest-based lending has.\n\nUnlike Islamists like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Maududi had a visceral antipathy to socialism, which he spent much time denouncing as \"godless\" as well as being unnecessary and redundant in the face of the Islamic state.\nA staunch defender of the rights of property he warned workers and peasants that \"You must never take the exaggerated view of your rights which the protagonists of class war present before you.\"\nHe also did not believe in intervention in the economy to provide universal employment.\nIslam does not make it binding on society to provide employment for each and every one of its citizens, since this responsibility cannot be accepted without thorough nationalisation of the country's resources.\n\nMaududi held to this position despite his florid denunciations of how the rich were \"sucking the blood\" and enslaving the poor, the popularity of populism among many Pakistanis, and despite the poverty and vast gap between rich and poor in Pakistan (which is often described an \"feudal\" (\"jagirdari\") in its large landholdings and rural poverty). Maududi openly opposed land reform proposals for Punjab by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan in the 1950s, going so far as to justify feudalism by pointing to Islam's protection of property rights. He later softened his views, extolling economic justice and equity (but not egalitarianism), but cautioned the government against tampering with \"lawful \"Jagirdari\"\", and continuing to emphasise the sanctity of private property.\n\nMaududi believed that Islam supported modernization but not Westernization. He agreed with Islamic Modernists that Islam contained nothing contrary to reason, and that it was superior in rational terms to all other religious systems. He disagreed with their practice of examining the Quran and the Sunnah using reason as the standard, instead of starting from the proposition that \"true reason is Islamic\" and accepting the Book and the Sunnah, rather than reason, as the final authority.\nHe also took a narrow view of \"ijtihad\", limiting the authority to use it to those with thorough grounding in Islamic sciences, faith in the \"sharia\", and then only to serve the needs of his vision of an Islamic state.\n\nAt the same time, one scholar, Maryam Jameelah, has noted the extensive use of modern, non-traditionally Islamic ideas and \"Western idioms and concepts\" in Maududi's thought.\nIslam was a \"revolutionary ideology\" and a \"dynamic movement\", the \"Jama'at-e-Islami\", was a \"party\", the \"Shari'ah\" a complete \"code\" in Islam's \"total scheme of life.\" His enthusiasm for [Western idioms and concepts] was infectious among those who admired him, encouraging them to implement in Pakistan all his \"manifestos\", \"programmes\" and \"schemes'\", to usher in a true Islamic \"renaissance\".\n\nAbul A'la Maududi, condemned Mughal Emperor Akbar's belief in an individual's \"personal religious equilibrium\" (controversially known as the Din-e Ilahi, or \"Religion of God\") as a form of apostasy. (Contemporary scholars such as S. M. Ikram argue that Akbar's true intentions were to create an \"iradat\" or \"muridi\" (discipleship) and not a new religion.\n\nMaududi did not see secularism as a way for the state/government to dampen tensions and divisions in multi-religious societies by remaining religiously neutral and avoid choosing sides. Rather, he believed, it removed religion from society (he translated secularism into Urdu as \"la din\", literally \"religionless\"). Since (he believed) all morality came from religion, this would necessarily mean \"the exclusion of all morality, ethics, or human decency from the controlling mechanisms of society.\" It was to avoid the \"restraints of morality and divine guidance\", and not out of pragmatism or some higher motive, that some espoused secularism.\n\nMaududi believed \"modern science was a 'body' that could accommodate any 'spirit'—philosophy or value system—just as radio could broadcast Islamic or Western messages with equal facility.\"\n\nMaududi strongly opposed the concept of nationalism, believing it to be \"shirk\" (polytheism), and \"a Western concept which divided the Muslim world and thus prolonged the supremacy of Western imperialist powers\". After Pakistan was formed, Maududi and the JI forbade Pakistanis to take an oath of allegiance to the state until it became Islamic, arguing that a Muslim could in clear conscience render allegiance only to God.\n\nMaududi also criticized traditionalist clergy or ulama for their \"moribund\" scholastic style, \"servile\" political attitudes, and \"ignorance\" of the modern world\". He believed traditional scholars were unable to distinguish the fundamentals of Islam from the details of its application, built up in elaborate structures of medieval legal schools of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). To rid Islam of these obscure laws Muslims should return to the Quran and Sunna, ignoring judgments made after the reign of the first four \"rightfully guided\" caliphs (\"al-Khulafāʾu ar-Rāshidūn\") of Islam.\n\nMaududi also believed there would be little need for the traditional roll of ulama as \"leaders, judges, and guardians of the community\", in a \"reformed and rationalized Islamic order\" where those trained in modern as well as traditional subjects would practice ijtihad and where Muslims were educated properly in Arabic, the Quran, Hadith, etc.\n\nHowever, over time Maududi became more orthodox in his attitudes, including toward the ulama, and at times allied himself and his party with them after the formation of Pakistan.\n\nLike other contemporary revivalists, Maududi was critical of Sufism and its historical influence in the early days.\nBut he also went on record denying any antagonism toward Sufism by himself or the Jama'at. (According to at least one biographer, this change in position was a result of the importance of Sufism in Pakistan not only among the Muslim masses but the ulama as well.)\nAt that time, Maududi distinguished between the Sufism of Shaikhs like `Alau'ddin Shah (which he approved of) and the shrines, festivals, and rituals of popular Sufism (which he did not).\nHe also \"redefined\" Sufism, describing it not in the traditional sense as the form and spirit of an \"esoteric dimension\" of Islam, but as the way to measure \"concentration\" and \"morals\" in religion, saying: \"For example, when we say our prayers, \"Fiqh\" will judge us only by fulfillment of the outward requirements such as ablution, facing toward the Ka'ba ... while \"Tasawwuf\" (Sufism) will judge our prayers by our concentration ... the effect of our prayers on our morals and manners.\" From the mid-1960s onward, \"redefinition\" of Islam \"increasingly gave way to outright recognition of Sufism,\" and after Maududi's death the JI amir Qazi Hussain Ahmad went so far as to visit the Sufi Data Durbar shrine in Lahore in 1987 as part of a tour to generate mass support for JI.\n\nMaududi believed that sharia was not just a crucial command that helped define what it meant to be a Muslim, but something without which a Muslim society could not be Islamic:\nThat if an Islamic society consciously resolves not to accept the sharia, and decides to enact its own constitution and laws or borrow them from any other source in disregard of the sharia, such a society breaks its contract with God and forfeits its right to be called 'Islamic.'\"\n\nMany unbelievers agreed that God was the creator, what made them unbelievers was their failure to submit to his will, i.e. to God's law. Obedience to God's law or will was \"the historical controversy that Islam has awakened\" throughout the world. It brought not only heavenly reward, but earthly blessing. Failure to obey, or \"rebellion\" against it, brought not only eternal punishment, but evil and misery here on earth.\n\nThe source of sharia, was to be found not only in the Quran but also in the Sunnah (the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), since the Quran proclaimed \"Whoever obeys the messenger [i.e. Muhammad] obeys Allah.\"\nSharia was perhaps most famous for calling for the abolition of interest-bearing banks, hadd penalties such as flogging and amputation for alcohol consumption, theft, fornication, adultery and other crimes. Hadd penalties have been criticized by Westernized Muslims as cruel and in violation of international human rights but Maududi argued that any cruelty was far outweighed by the cruelty in the West that resulted from the absence of these punishments, and in any case would not be applied until Muslims fully understood the teachings of their faith and lived in an Islamic state.\n\nBut in fact \"sharia\" was much more than these laws. It recognizes no division between religion and other aspects of life, in Maududi's view, and there was no area of human activity or concern which the \"sharia\" did not address with specific divine guidance.\n\nFamily relationships, social and economic affairs, administration, rights and duties of citizens, judicial system, laws of war and peace and international relations. In short it embraces all the various departments of life ... The \"sharia\" is a complete scheme of life and an all-embracing social order where nothing is superfluous and nothing lacking.\n\nA \"very large part\" of sharia required \"the coercive power and authority of the state\" for its enforcement. Consequently, while a state based on Islam has a legislature which the ruler must consult, its function \"is really that of law-finding, not of law-making.\"\n\nAt the same time, Maududi states (\"somewhat astonishingly\" according to one scholar) \"there is yet another vast range of human affairs about which \"sharia\" is totally silent\" and which an Islamic state may write \"independent\" legislation.\n\nAccording to scholar Vali Nasr, Maududi believed that the \"sharia\" needed to be \"streamlined, reinterpreted, and expanded\" to \"address questions of governance to the extent required for a state to function.\" For example, \"sharia\" needed to \"make clear the relation between the various branches of government\".\n\nThough the phrase \"Islamic Revolution\" is commonly associated with the 1979 Iranian Revolution, (or General Zia's Islamisation), Maududi coined and popularized it in the 1940s. The process Maududi envisioned—changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or \"da'wah\"—was very different than what happened in Iran, or under Zia ul-Haq. Maududi talked of Islam being \"a revolutionary ideology and a revolutionary practice which aims at destroying the social order of the world totally and rebuilding it from scratch\", but opposed sudden change, violent or unconstitutional action, and was uninterested in grassroots organizing or socio-economic changes.\n\nHis \"revolution\" would be achieved \"step-by-step\" with \"patience\", since \"the more sudden a change, the more short-lived it is.\"\nHe warned against the emotionalism of \"demonstrations or agitations, ... flag waving, slogans ... impassioned speeches ... or the like\", He believed that \"societies are built, structured, and controlled from the top down by conscious manipulation of those in power,\" not by grassroots movements. The revolution would be carried out by training a cadre of pious and dedicated men who would lead and then protect the Islamic revolutionary process. To facilitate this far-reaching program of cultural change, his party \"invested heavily\" in producing and disseminating publications.\n\nMaududi was committed to non-violent legal politics \"even if the current methods of struggle takes a century to bear fruit.\" In 1957 he outlined a new Jama'at policy declaring that \"transformation of the political order through unconstitutional means\" was against \"sharia\" law. Even when he and his party were repressed by the Ayub Khan or People's Party (in 1972) governments, Maududi kept his party from clandestine activity. It was not until he retired as emir of JI that JI and Jam'iat-e Tulabah \"became more routinely involved in violence.\"\n\nThe objective of the revolution was to be justice (\"`adl\") and benevolence (\"ihsan\"), but the injustice and wrong to be overcome that he focused on was immorality (\"fahsha`\") and forbidden behavior (\"munkarat\"). Maududi was interested in ethical changes, rather than socio-economic changes of the sort that drive most historical revolutions and revolutionary movements. He did not support these (for example, opposing land reform in the 1950s as an encroachment on property rights) and believed the problems they addressed would be solved by the Islamic state established by the revolution.\n\nAll this left at least one commentator, (Vali Nasr), to wonder if Maudidi had any actual interest in \"revolution\" (or \"ideology\"), or saw them simply as buzzwords necessary to indicate commitment to \"progress, justice, and political idealism\" in the anti-colonialist political milieu of 20th century South Asia.\n\nThe modern conceptualization of the \"Islamic state\" is also attributed to Maududi. This term was coined and popularized in his book, \"The Islamic Law and Constitution\" (1941), and in subsequent writings.\n\nMaududi's Islamic state is both ideological and all-embracing, based on \"Islamic Democracy,\" and will eventually \"rule the earth\". In 1955 he described it as a \"God-worshipping democratic Caliphate, founded on the guidance vouchsafed to us through Muhammad.\" Ultimately though, Islam was more important and the state would be judged by its adherence to \"din\" (religion and the Islamic system) and not democracy.\n\nUnlike the Islamic state of Ayatollah Khomeini, it would not establish and enforce Islamisation, but \"follow\" the Islamisation of society. As Maududi became involved in politics, this vision was \"relegated to a distant utopia\".\n\nThree principles underlying it: \"tawhid\" (oneness of God), \"risala\" (prophethood) and \"khilafa\" (caliphate). The \"sphere of activity\" covered by the Islamic state would be \"co-extensive with human life ... In such a state no one can regard any field of his affairs as personal and private.\"\n\nThe Islamic state recognizes the sovereignty of God, which meant God was the source of all law. The Islamic state acts as the vicegerent or agent of God on earth and enforces Islamic law, which as mentioned above is both all-embracing and \"totally silent\" on a \"vast range of human affairs\". While the government follows the \"sharia\" law, when it comes to a question about which no explicit injunction is to be found in the \"sharia\", the matter is \"settled by consensus among the Muslims.\"\n\nThe state can be called a caliphate, but the \"caliph\" would not be the traditional descendant of the Quraysh tribe but (Maududi believed) the entire Muslim community, a \"popular vicegerency\". (Although there would also be an individual leader chosen by the Muslim community.) Thus the state would be not a \"theocracy\", but a \"theodemocracy\".\nMaududi believed that the sovereignty of God (\"hakimiya\") and the sovereignty of the people are mutually exclusive.\nSovereignty of human beings is simply the domination of man by man, the source of most human misery and calamity.\nGovernance based on sovereignty other than that of God's does not just lead to inferior governance and \"injustice and maladministration\", but \"evil.\"\n\nTherefore, while Maududi used the term democracy to describe his state, (in part to appeal to Westernized Muslim intellectuals), his \"Islamic democracy\" was to be the antithesis of secular Western democracy which transfers \"hakimiya\" (God's sovereignty) to the people, who may pass laws without regard for God's commands.\n\nThe Islamic state would conduct its affairs by mutual consultation (\"shura\") among all Muslims.\nThe means of consultation should suit the conditions of the particular time and place but must be free and impartial. While the government follows the \"sharia\" law, when it comes to a question about which no explicit injunction is to be found in the \"sharia\", the matter is \"settled by consensus among the Muslims.\" Maududi favored giving the state exclusive right to the power of declaring \"jihad\" and \"ijtihad\" (establishing an Islamic law through \"independent reasoning\"), traditionally the domain of the \"ulama\".\n\nWhile no aspect of life was to be considered \"personal and private\" and the danger of foreign influence and conspiracies was ever present, (nationalism, for example, was \"a Western concept which divided the Muslim world and thus prolonged the supremacy of Western imperialist powers\"), there would also be personal freedom and no suspicion of government.\nMaududi's time spent in jail as a political prisoner led him to have a personal interest in individual rights, due process of law, and freedom of political expression.\nMaududi stated:\n\nThis espionage on the life of the individual cannot be justified on moral grounds by the government saying that it is necessary to know the secrets of the dangerous persons... This is exactly what Islam has called as the root cause of mischief in politics. The injunction of the Prophet is: \"When the ruler begins to search for the causes of dissatisfaction amongst his people, he spoils them\" (Abu Dawud).\n\nHowever, the basic human right in Islamic law was to demand an Islamic order and to live in it. Not included were any rights to differ with its rulers and defy its authority.\n\nAccording to Maududi, Islam had an \"unwritten constitution\" that needed \"to be transformed into a written one\". The constitution would not be the \"sharia\" (or the Quran, as Saudi Arabia's constitution is alleged to be) but a religious document based on \"conventions\" of the \"rightly guided caliphs\", and the \"canonized verdicts of recognized jurists\" (i.e. the \"sharia\") as well as the Quran and hadith.\n\nIn expanding on what the government of an Islamic state should look like in his book \"The Islamic Law and Constitution\", Maududi took as his model the government of Muhammad and the first four caliphs (\"al-Khulafāʾu ar-Rāshidūn\"). The head of state should be the supreme head of legislature, executive and judiciary alike, but under him these three organs should function \"separately and independently of one another.\" This head of state should be elected and must enjoy the country's confidence, but he is not limited to terms in office. No one is allowed to nominate him for the office, nor to engage in electioneering or run for office, according to another source.\nBecause \"more than one correct position\" could not exist, \"pluralism\", i.e. competition between political views/parties, would not be allowed, and there would be only one party.\n\nOn the other hand, Maududi believed the state had no need to govern in the Western sense of the term, since the government and citizenry would abide by the same \"infallible and inviolable divine law\", power would not corrupt and no one would feel oppressed. Power and resources would be distributed fairly. There would be no grievances, no mass mobilizations, demands for political participation, or any other of the turmoil of non-Islamic governance. Since the prophet had told early Muslims \"My community will never agree on an error\", there was no need for establishing concrete procedures and mechanisms for popular consultation.\n\nSince the state would be defined by its ideology—not by boundaries or ethnicity—its \"raison d'etre\" and protector would be ideology, the purity of which must be protected against any efforts to subvert it. Naturally it must be controlled and run exclusively by Muslims, and not just any Muslims but only \"those who believe in the ideology on which it is based and in the Divine Law which it is assigned to administer\".\n\nThe state's legislature \"should consist of a body of such learned men who have the ability and the capacity to interpret Quranic injunctions and who in giving decisions, would not take liberties with the spirit or the letter of the \"sharia\"\".\nTheir legislation would be based on the practice of \"ijtihad\" (a source of Islamic law, relying on careful analogical reasoning, using both the Qu'ran and Hadith, to find a solution to a legal problem), making it more a legal organ than a political one.\nThey must also be \"persons who enjoy the confidence of the masses\". They may be chosen by \"the modern system of elections\", or by some other method which is appropriate to \"the circumstances and needs of modern times.\" Since upright character is essential for office holders and desire for office represents greed and ambition, anyone actively seeking an office of leadership would be automatically disqualified.\n\nNon-Muslims or women may not be a head of state but could vote for separate legislators.\n\nOriginally Maududi envisioned a legislature only as a consultative body, but later proposed using a referendum to deal with possible conflicts between the head of state and the legislature, with the loser of the referendum resigning. Another later rule was allowing the formation of parties and factions during elections of representatives but not within the legislature.\n\nIn the judiciary, Maududi originally proposed the inquisitional system where judges implement law without discussion or interference by lawyers, which he saw as un-Islamic. After his party was \"rescued\" from government repression by the Pakistani judiciary he changed his mind, supporting autonomy of the judiciary and accepting the adversarial system and right of appeal.\n\nSecular Western representative democracy—despite its free elections and civil rights—is a failure (Maududi believed) for two reasons. Because secular society has \"divorced\" politics and religion (Maududi believed), its leaders have \"ceased to attach much or any importance to morality and ethics\" and so ignore their constituents' interests and the common good. Furthermore, without Islam \"the common people are incapable of perceiving their own true interests\". An example being the Prohibition law in the United States, where despite the fact that \"it had been rationally and logically established that drinking is injurious to health, produces deleterious disorder in human society\" (Maududi states), the law banning alcohol consumption was repealed by the American Congress.\n\nMaududi believed that copying cultural practices of non-Muslims was forbidden in Islam, having\nvery disastrous consequences upon a nation; it destroys its inner vitality, blurs its vision, befogs its critical faculties, breeds inferiority complexes, and gradually but assuredly saps all the springs of culture and sounds its death-knell. That is why the Holy Prophet has positively and forcefully forbidden the Muslims to assume the culture and mode of life of the non-Muslims.\n\nHe was appalled at (what he saw as) the satanic flood of female liberty and licence which threatens to destroy human civilisation in the West.\n\nMaududi strongly opposed the small Ahmadiyya sect, a Muslim sect which Maududi and many other Muslims do not consider as Muslim. He preached against Ahmadiyya in his pamphlet \"The Qadiani Question\" and the book \"The Finality of Prophethood\".\n\nThe rights of non-Muslims are limited under Islamic state as laid out in Maududi's writings. Although non-Muslim \"faith, ideology, rituals of worship or social customs\" would not be interfered with, non-Muslims would have to accept Muslim rule.\nIslamic 'jihad' does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which, in the view of Islam, is evil. Furthermore, Islamic 'jihad' also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an Islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of Islam.\"\n\nNon-Muslims would be eligible for \"all kinds of employment\", but must be \"rigorously excluded from influencing policy decisions\" and so not hold \"key posts\" in government and elsewhere.\nThey would not have the right to vote in presidential elections or in elections of Muslim representatives. This is to ensure that \"the basic policy of this ideological state remains in conformity with the fundamentals of Islam.\" An Islamic Republic may however allow non-Muslims to elect their own representatives to parliament, voting as separate electorates (as in the Islamic Republic of Iran). While some might see this as discrimination, Islam has been the most just, the most tolerant and the most generous of all political systems in its treatment of minorities, according to Maududi.\n\nNon-Muslims would also have to pay a traditional special tax known as jizya. Under Maududi's Islamic state, this tax would be applicable to all able-bodied non-Muslim men—elderly, children and women being exempt—in return from their exemption from military service, (which all adult Muslim men would be subject to). Those who serve in the military are exempted. Non-Muslims would also be barred from holding certain high level offices in the Islamic state. Jizya is thus seen as a tax paid in return for protection from foreign invasion, but also as a symbol of Islamic sovereignty.\n\n... Jews and the Christians ... should be forced to pay Jizya in order to put an end to their independence and supremacy so that they should not remain rulers and sovereigns in the land. These powers should be wrested from them by the followers of the true Faith, who should assume the sovereignty and lead others towards the Right Way.\n\nMaududi's first work to come to public attention was \"Al Jihad fil-Islam\" (\"Jihad in Islam\"), which was serialized in a newspaper in 1927, when he was only twenty-four. In it he maintained that because Islam is all-encompassing, the Islamic state was for all the world and should not be limited to just the \"homeland of Islam\". \"Jihad\" should be used to eliminate un-Islamic rule and establish the worldwide Islamic state:\n\nIslam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of Islam, regardless of the country or the nation which rules it. The purpose of Islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme, regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard-bearer of\nIslam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological Islamic State. Islam requires the earth—not just a portion, but the whole planet... because the entire mankind should benefit from the ideology and welfare programme [of Islam] ... Towards this end, Islam wishes to press into service all forces which can bring about a revolution and a composite term for the use of all these forces is 'Jihad'... the objective of the Islamic 'jihād' is to eliminate the rule of an un-Islamic system and establish in its stead an Islamic system of state rule. \n\nMaududi taught that the destruction of the lives and property of others was lamentable (part of the great sacrifice of jihad), but that Muslims must follow the Islamic principle that it is better to \"suffer a lesser loss to save ourselves from a greater loss\". Though in jihad \"thousands\" of lives may be lost, this cannot compare \"to the calamity that may befall mankind as a result of the victory of evil over good and of aggressive atheism over the religion of God.\"\nHe explained that jihad was not only combat for God but any effort that helped those waging combat (\"qitaal\"), including non-violent work:\nIn the jihad in the way of Allah, active combat is not always the role on the battlefield, nor can everyone fight in the front line. Just for one single battle preparations have often to be made for decades on end and the plans deeply laid, and while only some thousands fight in the front line there are behind them millions engaged in various tasks which, though small themselves, contribute directly to the supreme effort.\n\nAt the same time he took a more conservative line on jihad than other revivalist thinkers (such as Ayatollah Khomeini and Sayyid Qutb). In general, he argued that jihad should not denote \"a crazed faith ... blood-shot eyes, shouting \"Allahu akbar\", decapitating an unbeliever wherever they see one, cutting off heads while invoking \"La ilaha illa-llah\" [there is no god but God]\". During a cease-fire with India (in 1948), he opposed the waging of jihad in Kashmir, stating that Jihad could be proclaimed only by Muslim governments, not by religious leaders.\n\nAs Jama'at amir, he remained in close contact with JI members, conducting informal discussions everyday in his house between Asar and Maghrib salat prayers, although according to some, in later years discussion was replaced by answers to members questions with any rebuttals ignored.\n\nFor his votaries in Jama'at, Maududi was not only a \"revered scholar, politician, and thinker, but a hallowed \"Mujaddid\".\"\nAdding to his mystic was his survival of assassination attempts, while the Jama'at's enemies (Liaquat Ali Khan, Ghulam Muhammad, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Ayub Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, \"fell from grace\" or were killed.\n\nHe had a powerful command of \"Urdu\" language which he insisted on using, in order to \"free Muslims minds from the influence of English.\"\n\nIn private he has been described as \"strict but not rigid\", taciturn, poised, composed, uncompromising and unyielding. His biographers have talked of his \"karanat\" (special gifts) and \"haybah\" (great presence).\"\n\nHis public speaking style has been described as having \"great authority\". Maududi would make his argument step-by-step with Islamic edicts, rather than attempting to excite his audience with oratory.\n\nAlthough he did not publicize the fact, Maududi was a practitioner of traditional medicine or \"unani tibb\".\n\nMaududi has been described as close to his wife, but not able to spend much time with his six sons and three daughters due to his commitments to religious dawah and political action. Only one of his offspring, ever joined the JI. And only his second daughter Asma, showed \"any scholarly promise\".\n\nMaududi suffered from a kidney ailment most of his life. He was often bedridden in 1945 and 1946, and in 1969 was forced to travel to England for treatment.\n\nIn April 1979, Maududi's long-time kidney ailment worsened and by then he also had heart problems. He went to the United States for treatment and was hospitalized in Buffalo, New York, where his second son worked as a physician. Following a few surgical operations, he died on 22 September 1979, at the age of 75. His funeral was held in Buffalo, but he was buried in an unmarked grave at his residence in Ichhra, Lahore after a very large funeral procession through the city.\n\nIn Pakistan, (where the JI claims to be the oldest religious party) it is \"hard to exaggerate the importance\" of that country's \"current drift\" toward Maududi's \"version of Islam\", according to scholar Eran Lerman.\nHis background as a journalist, thinker, scholar and political leader has been compared to Indian independence leader Abul Kalam Azad by admiring biographers.\n\nHe and his party are thought to have been the most important factors in Pakistan working to generate support for an Islamic state. They are thought to have helped inspire General Zia-ul-Haq to introduce \"Sharization\" to Pakistan,\n\nIn return Maududi's party was greatly strengthened by Zia with 10,000s of members and sympathizers given jobs in the judiciary and civil service early in Zia's rule.\n\nOutside of South Asia, Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna and jihadist Sayyid Qutb read him, according to historian Philip Jenkins. Qutb \"borrowed and expanded\" Maududi's concept of Islam being modern, Muslims having fallen into pre-Islamic ignorance (\"Jahiliyya\"), and of the need for an Islamist revolutionary vanguard movement. His ideas influenced Abdullah Azzam, the Palestinian Islamist jurist and renewer of jihad in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The South Asian diaspora, including \"significant numbers\" in Britain, were \"hugely influenced\" by Maududi's work. Maududi even had a major impact on Shia Iran, where Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is reputed to have met Maududi as early as 1963 and later translated his works into Persian. \"To the present day, Iran's revolutionary rhetoric often draws on his themes.\" According to Youssef M. Choueiri, \"all the major contemporary radicalist\" Islamist movements (the Tunisian Islamic Tendency, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization, and the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria), \"derive their ideological and political programmes\" from the writings of Maududi and Sayyid Qutb.\n\n\nMaududi had produced 73 books at the time of his death, written more than 120 books and pamphlets, and made more than 1000 speeches and press statements. His magnum opus was the 30 years in progress translation (tafsir) in Urdu of the Qur’an, \"Tafhim ul-Qur’an\" (\"The Meaning of the Qur'an\"), intended to give the Qur’an a self-claim interpretation. It became widely read throughout the South Asia and has been translated into several languages.\n\nSome of his books translated into English.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Milgram experiment in 1961 was the classic experiment that established its existence.\n\nHumans usually have deep-seated duty to authority, and tend to comply when requested by an authority figure.\n\nIn any society, a diverse and widely accepted system of authority allows the development of sophisticated structures for the production of resources, trade, expansion and social control. Since the opposite is anarchy, we are all trained from birth to believe that obedience to authority is right. Notions of submission and loyalty to legitimate rule of others are accorded values in schools, the law, the military and in political systems. The strength of the bias to obey a legitimate authority figure comes from systemic socialization practices designed to instill in people the perception that such obedience constitutes correct behavior. Different societies vary the terms of this dimension. As we grow up, we learn that it benefits us to obey the dictates of genuine authority figures because such individuals usually possess higher degrees of knowledge, wisdom and power. We tend to do what our doctor advises. Consequently, deference to authority can occur in a mindless fashion as a kind of decision-making short cut.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3781766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3781766", "title": "Bano Qudsia", "text": "Bano Qudsia\n\nBano Qudsia (‎; 28 November 1928 – 4 February 2017), also known as Bano Aapa, was a Pakistani novelist, playwright and spiritualist. She wrote literature in Urdu, producing novels, dramas and short stories. Qudsia is best known for her novel \"Raja Gidh.\" Qudsia also wrote for television and stage in both Urdu and Punjabi languages. Her play \"Aadhi Baat\" has been called \"a classic\". Bano Qudsia died in Lahore on 4 February 2017.\n\nBano Qudsia was born on 28 November 1928 in Firozpur, British India, as Qudsia Chattha. Her father was a Bachelor of Agriculture and her brother Pervaiz Chattah was a painter. She migrated to Lahore with her family after the partition of India and had begun writing short stories while studying in class 5. She graduated from the Kinnaird College in Lahore and then joined the Government College University (Lahore) (GCU) to do her masters in Urdu literature which she completed in 1951.\n\nQudsia married writer Ashfaq Ahmed whom she had met at the Government College University (Lahore). They had three sons Aneeque, Anees and Aseer. The couple had been considered inseparable in their social lives.\n\nQudsia's novel \"Raja Gidh\" (The King Vulture) is considered a modern Urdu classic. Among her more prominent writings are \"Aatish-i-zer-i-paa\", \"Aik Din,\"Asay Pasay\", \"Chahar Chaman\", \"Chhotaa Sheher Baray Log\", \"Footpath ki Ghaas\", \"Haasil Ghaat\" and \"Hawa Kay Naam\". The most well known plays she wrote include \"Tamasil\", \"Hawa ke Naam\", \"Seharay and Khaleej\".\n\nHer critically acclaimed play \"Aadhi Baat\" was about a retired headmaster. The play examined the headmaster's day-to-day life problems and had Qavi Khan acting as the lead character. The play's director was Agha Nasir and it was produced by Tauqeer Nasir. \"Aadhi Baat\" was performed in May 2010 in Islamabad at a three-day event which was organized by the Pakistan National Council of the Arts. Ashfaq Ahmed's autobiography \"Baba Saheba\" was incomplete at the time of his death in September 2004. Qudsia completed the biography and the second part of it was published as \"Rah-i-Rawaan\". The contrast in the narrative styles of the couple is evident in these two books; while the first half is considered \"provoking, lucid and utterly spellbinding\" by critics, the second half takes the feeling of sorrow. Qudsia credits Ahmed for transforming her after their marriage and eventually allowing her to devote to her writing. Qudsia's novel \"Raah-e-Rawaan - راہ ِرواں\" was published in 2011. It is an analytical look at Ashfaq Ahmed's philosophical thinking and how it may relate to certain aspects of life itself. Qudsia had the highest regards for her husband and she has placed Ashfaq Ahmed on a very high pedestal. However she does not even claim to understand the man she lived with for more than five decades. So, an attempt at writing the biography of Ashfaq Ahmed took her beyond that ‘one person’— and she started to write about his ancestry, the family including his grandfather, father, uncles, brothers, sisters and their children so as to fully understand the enigma that was Ashfaq Ahmed. \n\nQudsia’s novel \"[Haasil Ghaat]\" was published in 2005 and was noted for its diction but also criticized then for usages of English slangs than her usual traditional Urdu narrative. The language however became popular amongst other writers in future.\n\nBano Qudsia also wrote a book about Qudrat Ullah Shahab titled \"Mard-e-Abresham\" \"مردِابریشم\". The book mainly portrays Shahab's life and how it was connected with Ashfaq Ahmed and his family both on social and spiritual level.\n\nBano Qudsia died on 4 February 2017 at the Ittefaq Hospital in Lahore at the age of 88. Her son Aseer Ahmed informed that she died around the time for Maghrib prayers (after sunset). She was buried at Lahore on 5 February and prayer services were held at Model Town, Lahore.\n\nIn 1983, Qudsia was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz (\"Star of Excellence\") by the Government of Pakistan. In 2010, the Pakistani government awarded her the Hilal-i-Imtiaz (\"Crescent of Excellence\") for her services in literature. In 2012, the Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) awarded Qudsia the Kamal-e-Fun Award, which is a lifetime achievement award. In 2016, the GCU’s Old Ravians Union (GCU-ORU) at its annual reunion conferred on her a lifetime achievement award. The same year, the Pakistan Life Care Foundation (PLCF) also awarded the lifetime achievement award to Qudsia.\n\n\n\n"}

Such oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase. Neural tissue can generate oscillatory activity driven by mechanisms within individual neurons, as well as by interactions between them. They may also adjust frequency to synchronize with the periodic vibration of external acoustic or visual stimuli.\n\nThe activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of neural ensembles in the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations. These phenomena can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG). The electroencephalographic representations of those oscillations are typically denoted by the term 'brainwaves' in common parlance.\n\nThe technique of recording neural electrical activity within the brain from electrochemical readings taken from the scalp originated with the experiments of Richard Caton in 1875, whose findings were developed into electroencephalography (EEG) by Hans Berger in the late 1920s.\n\nThe functional role of neural oscillations is still not fully understood; however they have been shown to correlate with emotional responses, motor control, and a number of cognitive functions including information transfer, perception, and memory. Specifically, neural oscillations, in particular theta activity, are extensively linked to memory function, and coupling between theta and gamma activity is considered to be vital for memory functions, including episodic memory.\n\nEntrainment is a term originally derived from complex systems theory, and denotes the way that two or more independent, autonomous oscillators with differing rhythms or frequencies, when situated in a context and at a proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on coupling force, such that they adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency.\nExamples include the mechanical entrainment or cyclic synchronization of two electric clothes dryers placed in close proximity, and the biological entrainment evident in the synchronized illumination of fireflies.\n\nEntrainment is a concept first identified by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens in 1665 who discovered the phenomenon during an experiment with pendulum clocks: He set them each in motion and found that when he returned the next day, the sway of their pendulums had all synchronized.\n\nSuch entrainment occurs because small amounts of energy are transferred between the two systems when they are out of phase in such a way as to produce negative feedback. As they assume a more stable phase relationship, the amount of energy gradually reduces to zero, with systems of greater frequency slowing down, and the other speeding up.\n\nSubsequently, the term 'entrainment' has been used to describe a shared tendency of many physical and biological systems to synchronize their periodicity and rhythm through interaction. This tendency has been identified as specifically pertinent to the study of sound and music generally, and acoustic rhythms specifically. The most ubiquitous and familiar examples of neuromotor entrainment to acoustic stimuli is observable in spontaneous foot or finger tapping to the rhythmic beat of a song.\n\nBrainwaves, or neural oscillations, share the fundamental constituents with acoustic and optical waves, including frequency, amplitude and periodicity. Consequently, Huygens' discovery precipitated inquiry into whether or not the synchronous electrical activity of cortical neural ensembles might not only alter in response to external acoustic or optical stimuli but also entrain or synchronize their frequency to that of a specific stimulus.\n\nBrainwave entrainment is a colloquialism for such 'neural entrainment', which is a term used to denote the way in which the aggregate frequency of oscillations produced by the synchronous electrical activity in ensembles of cortical neurons can adjust to synchronize with the periodic vibration of an external stimuli, such as a sustained acoustic frequency perceived as pitch, a regularly repeating pattern of intermittent sounds, perceived as rhythm, or of a regularly rhythmically intermittent flashing light.\n\nChanges in neural oscillations, demonstrable through electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, are precipitated by listening to music, which can modulate autonomic arousal ergotropically and trophotropically, increasing and decreasing arousal respectively. Musical auditory stimulation has also been demonstrated to improve immune function, facilitate relaxation, improve mood, and contribute to the alleviation of stress. These findings have contributed to the development of neurologic music therapy, which uses music and song as an active and receptive intervention, to contribute to the treatment and management of disorders characterized by impairment to parts of the brain and central nervous system, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, cerebral palsy, Alzheimer's disease, and autism.\n\nMeanwhile, the therapeutic benefits of listening to sound and music is a well-established principle upon which the practice of receptive music therapy is founded. The term 'receptive music therapy' denotes a process by which patients or participants listen to music with specific intent to therapeutically benefit; and is a term used by therapists to distinguish it from 'active music therapy' by which patients or participants engage in producing vocal or instrumental music. Receptive music therapy is an effective adjunctive intervention suitable for treating a range of physical and mental conditions.\n\nThe Frequency following response (FFR), also referred to as Frequency Following Potential (FFP), is a specific response to hearing sound and music, by which neural oscillations adjust their frequency to match the rhythm of auditory stimuli. The use of sound with intent to influence cortical brainwave frequency is called auditory driving, by which frequency of neural oscillation is 'driven' to entrain with that of the rhythm of a sound source.\n\n\n\n"}

A Harvard graduate who taught at his alma mater for most of his career, he published little but was a teacher and a critic of the work of his colleagues (Floyd & Shieh 2001).\n\nDreben was a rare combination of expert logician, and careful historian of ideas and interpreter of historical texts. In the 1950s, he found a copy of Jacques Herbrand's Ph.D. thesis, submitted to the University of Paris in 1929 and thought lost. (Herbrand died in 1931 before either marrying or starting his career.) Dreben found a number of significant errors in the thesis, as well as evidence of haste and carelessness in its preparation. In particular, in Herbrand's proof a crucial lemma was fatally flawed, but Dreben found another way of proving the essential conclusions of the thesis. Dreben's introduction to the translation of Herbrand's thesis in includes a concise description of his work on Herbrand's writings.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dreben and Warren Goldfarb wrote a book on the decision problem.\n\nFrom 1978 onwards, Dreben gave a series of lectures at Harvard which had as their primary topics the works of Ludwig Wittgenstein and W.V. Quine. Dreben took from Wittgenstein the lesson that philosophers always went wrong when they tried to provide general accounts of reality, epistemology, or metaphysics. He was in agreement with Wittgenstein's later view that philosophical problems mostly arise when language goes on holiday. Dreben took the history of philosophy as itself a proof of Wittgenstein's thesis that much philosophizing is nonsense; Dreben attempted to show how the history of philosophy is a history of people talking past one another.\n\nDreben interpreted Quine as attempting to show that philosophy does not provide the foundations of science. According to Dreben's interpretation of Quine, philosophy at its best merely answers a number of general questions from within science itself. However, Dreben saw even in Quine a tendency to generalize most successfully resisted by the later Wittgenstein, whose unflagging alertness to specifics Dreben took as a model.\n\nHarvard University awarded Dreben an A.B. and an A.M. in 1949 and 1955, respectively. He taught at the University of Chicago, 1955–56, at Harvard 1956-90, and at Boston University for the remainder of his life. He was a Fulbright Fellow at Oxford 1950-51, a member of the Harvard Society of Fellows 1952-55, a Guggenheim Fellow from 1957–58, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1963.\n\nAt Harvard, he was Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1973-75, a special assistant to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with oversight over the academic tenure process, Chair of the Society of Fellows 1976-90, and Edgar Pierce Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.\n\nAt the Association for Symbolic Logic, he was twice a treasurer, and an editor of its journal.\n\nDreben was a highly influential teacher of philosophy. The \"Harvard Crimson\" described him as\n\n\"A mathematical logician by training, his writings set new standards of clarity for the historical study of 20th-century philosophy. His lectures at Harvard and later at Boston University, where he taught from 1991 until his death, were famous for their wit, bravado, and intellectual excitement, attracting students and faculty alike and shaping several generations of philosophers. His mastery of the texts of 20th-century analytic philosophy was unmatched.\"\n\nDreben became known for his close reading and detailed comments on the draft writings of his Harvard colleagues W.V. Quine, John Rawls, Hilary Putnam, Stanley Cavell, Charles Parsons, and Warren Goldfarb. Quine often thanked Dreben in print for his advice and corrections and dedicated \"Pursuit of Truth\" to Dreben. Dreben also had a significant influence on many students and junior faculty at Harvard, including Warren Goldfarb, Thomas Ricketts, James F. Conant, Michael Friedman, Gary Ebbs, David H. Helman, and others.\n\nIn his later years, Dreben was a guest lecturer in Scandinavia, Israel, and Europe, giving seminars on the nature and significance of 20th-century philosophy.\n\nDuring the student revolt of the late 1960s, Dreben helped mediate the conflicts and disputes between Harvard students and administration. Among his students was Harry R. Lewis.\n\nDreben was first married to Massachusetts Judge Raya Spiegel Dreben, with whom he had two children. He later married the philosopher Juliet Floyd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a proponent of formalist film theory.\n\nBalázs was the son of German-born parents, adopting his \"nom de plume\" in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the Eötvös Collegium.\n\nBalázs was a moving force in the Sonntagskreis or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos Fülep, Arnold Hauser, György Lukács and Károly (Karl) Mannheim. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Balázs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.\n\nHe is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of \"Bluebeard's Castle\" which he originally wrote for his roommate Zoltán Kodály, who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, Béla Bartók. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet \"The Wooden Prince\".\n\nThe collapse of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic under Béla Kun in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union.\n\nIn Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, \"Der Sichtbare Mensch\" (\"The Visible Man\") (1924), helped found the German \"film as a language\" theory, which also exerted an influence on Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for G. W. Pabst's film of \"Die Dreigroschenoper\" (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by Brecht (who admitted to not reading the script) during production.\n\nLater, he co-wrote (with Carl Mayer) and helped Leni Riefenstahl direct the film \"Das Blaue Licht\" (1932). Riefenstahl later removed Balázs's and Mayer's names from the credits because they were Jewish. One of his best known films is \"Somewhere in Europe\" (\"It Happened in Europe\", 1947), directed by Géza von Radványi.\n\nHis last years were marked by petty vexations at home and ever increasing recognition in the German-speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in Hungary, the Kossuth Prize. Also in 1949, he finished \"Theory of the Film\", published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the Béla Balázs Prize was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in cinematography.\n\n\n\n"}

She wrote her autobiography, \"Learning True Love: How I Learned & Practiced Social Change in Vietnam\" in 1993.\n\nChân Không was born Cao Ngoc Phuong in 1938 in Ben Tre, Vietnam in the center of the Mekong Delta. As the eighth of nine children in a middle-class family, her father taught her and her siblings the value of work and humility. She quotes her father as saying: \"...never bargain with a poor farmer because for you a few dong may not be much, but for him it is enough to support his children.\"\n\nIn 1958 she enrolled in the University of Saigon to study biology. She was also involved in political action, becoming the student leader at the University, spending much of her time helping the poor and sick in the slums of the city.\n\nShe first met Thích Nhất Hạnh in 1959 and considered him her spiritual teacher. In 1963 she left for Paris to finish her degree in biology which was awarded in 1964. She returned to Vietnam later that year and joined Thích Nhất Hạnh in founding the Van Hanh University and the School for Youth and Social Service (SYSS). She was central in many of the activities of the SYSS which organized medical, educational and agricultural facilities in rural Vietnam during the war. At one stage the SYSS involved over 10,000 young peace workers who rebuilt many villages ravaged by the fighting. When Thích Nhất Hạnh returned to the United States, Chân Không ran the day-to-day operations.\n\nOn February 5, 1966 Chân Không was ordained as one of the first six members of the Order of Interbeing, sometimes called the \"Six Cedars\". Following her ordination, she was given the name Sister Chân Không, True Emptiness. In explaining the meaning of the name, she says: \"In Buddhism, the word 'emptiness' is a translation of the Sanskrit sunyata. It means 'empty of a separate self.' It is not a negative or despairing term. It is a celebration of interconnectedness, of interbeing. It means nothing can exist by itself alone, that everything is inextricably interconnected with everything else. I know that I must always work to remember that I am empty of a separate self and full of the many wonders of this universe, including the generosity of my grandparents and parents, the many friends and teachers who have helped and supported me along the path, and you dear readers, without whom this book could not exist. We inter-are, and therefore we are empty of an identity that is separate from our interconnectedness.\"\n\nThe Order of Interbeing was to be composed of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. The first six ordainees were free to choose whether they preferred to live and practice as formal monastics or as laypersons. The first three women chose to live celibate lives like nuns, although they didn't shave their heads, while the three men chose to marry and practice as lay Buddhists. Among the three women was Nhat Chi Mai, who immolated herself for peace just a year later.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1972 she worked with Thích Nhất Hạnh in Paris organizing the Buddhist Peace Delegation which campaigned for peace in Vietnam. Since then she has worked with Thích Nhất Hạnh establishing first the Sweet Potato community near Paris, then Plum Village Sangha in 1982. She accompanies and assists Thích Nhất Hạnh when he travels. In addition, she has continued to organize relief work for those in need in Vietnam, coordinating relief food parcels for poor children and medicine for the sick, and helps organize activities at Plum Village.\n\nSister Chân Không ordained as a nun by Thích Nhất Hạnh in 1988 on Vultures Peak, in India.\n\nDuring the three-month return to Vietnam (January to early April, 2005), Thích Nhất Hạnh spoke to thousands of people throughout the country - bureaucrats, politicians, intellectuals, street vendors, taxi drivers, artists. In addition to Thich Thích Nhất Hạnh's Dharma talks, Sister Chân Không also taught and conducted additional mindfulness practices. She led the crowds in singing Plum Village songs, chanting, and leading \"total relaxation\" sessions. Other times, it was her simple application of Vietnamese heritage to modern ways of life that appealed to the people they met. During Tết (Vietnamese new year) celebrations in February, she performed an \"oracle reading\" for hundreds of Buddhist followers.\n\nIn 2014, for the first time in history major Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian leaders, as well as Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders (including Chân Không, representing Thích Nhất Hạnh), met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020.\n\n\n\n"}

It was orally narrated by the saint Samarth Ramdas to his disciple, Kalyan Swami. The \"Dāsbodh\" provides readers with spiritual guidance on matters such as devotion and acquiring knowledge. Besides this, it also helps in answering queries related to day-to-day life and how to find solutions to it.\n\nThe \"Dāsbodh\" was written in 1654 by Samarth Ramdas Swāmi (1608-1681), a satguru, a Hindu poet from Maharashtra, in the local Marathi language. It is a comprehensive volume in verse form providing instructions on the religious life, presented in the format of a conversation between a Guru and disciple. The narration is believed to have taken place in a cave called Shivatharghal in the Raigad district of Maharashtra.\n\"Dāsbodh\" is written in the verse form known as \"owi\" (\"ōvyā\") in Marathi. The volume comprises 7751 \"owi\" and is divided into 20 chapters, each chapter consisting of ten sub-chapters. Each of these sub-chapters varies in the number of stanzas, but averages around 30-40 stanzas (ovi) per sub-chapter, with some being considerably longer.\n\n\"Dāsbodh\" prescribes the path of devotion to God or \"Bhakti mārg\", and the path of Knowledge or \"Jñana Marg\" for liberation. Through knowledge, Ramdas clears away all doubts and gives the understanding of one's \"True Self\". Ramdas also reveals the true meaning and significance of \"Discrimination\" and \"Detachment\".\n\nIt deals with diverse aspects of human life such as politics, conducting business dealings and taking care of one's body and family life. One of the key messages given by Saint Ramdas is to not be lazy, as he always encouraged aspirants to earn the livelihood in a virtuous manner. The person who is ready to work will always be fortunate. Common man normally does not want to work and expects everything from God without an effort.\n\nIn \"Dasbodh\", Samartha Ramdas presents the essence of many Vedic texts. \"Dasbodh\" is a manual for life, in the highest sense, and is somewhat unusual among spiritual literature in that it not only expounds the classic themes of discrimination between the true and the untrue and the detachment commonly found in Vedic literature, but also provides a detailed instruction on how to function and excel in society from a place of deep spiritual understanding.\n\nContained within the chapters of \"Dasbodh\", Ramdas outlines the path of liberation through Devotion and Knowledge. Through knowledge, Ramdas clears away all doubts and gives the understanding of one's \"True Self.\" Ramdas also reveals the true meaning and significance of \"Discrimination\" and \"Detachment.\" Entire volumes could be written in trying to describe all that is contained within the text. It draws upon ancient Vedic texts including, but not limited to; The Vedas, the Shashtras, the Upanishads, the Avadhut Gita, the \"Bhagavad Gita\", the Rama Gita, the Yogavasishtha, the Guru Gita, and the Brahma Sutras, to name a few. Mainly what is presented in \"Dasbodh\" is the voice of direct experience itself.\n\n\"Dasbodha\" is an epic written by Shree Samarth. Whatever he wanted to tell the world he has conveyed through \"Dasbodha\" in a candid manner. As per the tradition in his times he wrote it in the Owi form. The contents of the book are simple, straightforward and easy to understand. It is so simple that sometimes it seems to be a prose. \"Dasbodha\" is divided in 20 main parts called as Dashak each of which contains 10 sub parts which are called as Samasas. The total Owis number 7751. Each Owi is made up of 4 lines. After being blessed by Lord Ram he wrote the Old \"Dasbodha\". One finds the freshness, fearlessness and candidness of a person blessed with the ultimate knowledge just recently in it. After a while he started with the continuation of the work and completed up to the 7th Dashak to which he added the Dashak he had written earlier, called the Dashak of knowledge. Then throughout his life he continued writing for the Dasbodha which amounted to another 12 Dashaks. These were added to the earlier 8 ones and the final volume of the Dasbodha as we know it now was prepared just 2 months prior to the time when Shree Samarth left his mortal body. At the end of the book he has unassumingly asked the readers to study, ponder over, introspect and not just only read the whole \"Dasbodha\".\n\n\"Dāsbodh\" has been popular for many years in India. Only recently has it begun to receive recognition in the West. \"Dāsbodh\" is recommended by the Inchegeri Sampradaya, including Shri Siddharameshwar Maharaj.\n\n\"Dāsbodh\" has been translated into many Indian and other languages including German, English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujrathi and Sindhi.\n\n\n"}

Some arguments are nationalistic or what some critics claim to be \"xenophobic\", or ones similar to arguments against free trade, favouring protectionism.\n\nWar-related chaos can lead to the breakdown of borders and allow for \"de facto\" free immigration. The natural attempts to flee strife, or escape a conquering enemy, can quickly lead to millions of refugees. Even where border controls are in place they can be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people. Once settled into refugee camps, these reluctant immigrants may take decades to be either repatriated back or naturalized into their new country. This has been the situation with the Palestinians in Jordan.\n\nDuring the Cold War, a migration paradox arose in which some of the communist states forbade emigration, while the \"Free World\" would freely accept the defectors. This policy persists for Cubans and the Hmong, who are both allowed particular forms of free immigration to the United States based on their automatic refugee status.\n\n\nAll people regardless of citizenship are allowed to live and work in Svalbard without a visa or residence permit, as long as they demonstrate they are able to support themselves.\n\nThrough numerous situations and encounters, immigration can be a test of mental fortitude rather than physical ability. In Buddhism, a bodhisattva is considered to be a guide to awakening and to the Pure Lands. \"The Buddha declares that we are all bodhisattvas destined to attain full Awakening. It seems that each of us, then, is engaged in 'spiritual immigration'. The Buddha asserts that everyone is a bodhisattva, or a 'spiritual immigrant', who must attain various virtues which ultimately leads to \"prajnaparamita\", or 'transcendent wisdom'. The existence of Buddhas and Mahasattvas'great beings' who have achieved a high level on the path to awakeninghave created various branches of belief like Mahayana Buddhism, which is a form of 'spiritual immigration'. \"Buddhism is a type of immigration from the world of suffering to nirvana...We are all immigrants who, paradoxically, are seeking to and the land in which we already dwell\". In terms of 'spiritual immigration', the path of the bodhisattva is a change of mental capacity rather than cosmic location.\n\nAccording to Buddhist teaching, the purpose of a 'spiritual immigration' is to help guide the individual onto their future path. The Pure Land is the state of untainted mind: reaching this land of purity requires persistent effort and practice. Along the journey, individuals learn to envision their future as a land of opportunity. The intention of the pure land is to assure that the individual achieves their personal goals in lifethe betterment of oneself in order to reach nirvana. Alongside these goals, practitioners also learn about the relationship of 'self' and 'others', resulting in the renewal of all beings. The concept of the pure lands enforces the idea of 'spiritual immigration' as a form of mental encouragement.\n\nMigration is a spiritual journey that establishes a point of communication between the human and divine. Religious figures migrate from one place to another as immigrants: \"In Christianity, God migrated to this world in the form of human Jesus; the Hindu God Krishna descended to earth to become a charioteer, a human being (Bhagavad Gita 1:20-47); and the Buddha 'becomes Awakened' when he became a wanderer and a stranger\". Adherents believe that religious figures have travelled from an unpurified state to a purified state: Buddha traveled from his privileged life to a life of poverty to gain divinity and knowledge; therefore divine figures like Gautam Buddha viewed migration as purification. The Qur’an states that \"they could migrate from their oppressed positions to another land of God\". \n\nThe doctrine of \"Hijrah\" suggest that freedom of movement is a human right as well as a duty to God. Globalization affects religious perspectives on migration which seek to prevent the \"destruction to the sanctity of human life and dignity\". Religious figures like Buddha and Jesus practised \"a theology of migration\". According to adherents, immigrants should have the same rights as legal residents because world religions believe everyone is divine. It is also mentioned in the Qur’an that \"strangers are entitled to the equal distribution of wealth\". Despite the acquisition of wealth in verse 8:41, the Qur’an states that \"know that one-fifth of your battle gains belongs to the God and the messenger, to close relatives and orphans or to the needy and travellers (strangers).”\n\nAccording to Collier and Strain, the Roman Catholic Church has been helping migrants for decades. The Christian faith receives a sense of justice for migrants from Abrahamic faith traditions. Catholics follow these guidelines to help immigrants: \"for all persons on the move\". The reasons to help those on the move were established in 1952 when leaders of the Roman Catholic Church published written material that reinforced the teachings of the church. One of the quotes from the Bible used to justify hospitality is \"when an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God\" (Leviticus 19:33). \n\nStrangers or those on the move should be treated equally, no less than anyone else. The modern nation state should open its borders because people may be migrating due to unfavorable circumstances. The Catholic Church believes everyone has a right to migrate to support their families; this idea of free migration allows \"the human person [to precede] the state\".” In some circumstances, the Church provides assistance to migrants and refugees. Some Catholic organizations offer educational activities on the legal process of immigration to the United States. Other types of aid include spiritual companionship, ESL classes for those who want to learn to speak better English, basic hygiene, and food. The Roman Catholic Church believes that helping those in need enables the growth of the human spirit.\n\nBefore the Columbian exchange, there was an open border policy in the Americas that gave Native Americans access to travel freely and have open trade with other cultures. There was widespread trade among many First Nations that created free movement and travel for many foreigners. At the time, there was little border control which allowed migrants to travel to various areas to settle. Immigration policy shifted towards control and nationalism after 1492. In the 20th century, immigration policy solidified borders in America, but many Native Americans advocated free movement and hospitality towards strangers. Native Americans historically have welcomed strangers with hospitality, sometimes making them relatives through an informal adoption system. Migration in America can be understood through the religious and cultural perspectives of Native American. \n\nMost Native American groups have shown hospitality towards strangers, and guests are given gifts from the host, which are known as 'give-aways'. Hospitality to visitors and other members of one's community is a value of many Native Americans groups, and they consider their belongings and other possessions as blessings. The concept of borders and walls (both artificial and real) were not practised in pre-Columbian times when Native Americans inhabited present day Canada, Central Amaerica, Mexico, and the U.S. Instead, hospitality and gift giving were the traditions that were honored and shared among visitors and other people.\n\nMany nation states have agreed and disagreed on the topic of open borders and free migration, with some countries allowing people to travel freely from country to country and state to state without the risk of deportation or punishment. The consensus within the open borders debate is to “establish a view of migration that reflects the liberal commitment to the equal moral worth of all people which applies to a truly global view of migration.” Various ideas have been applied to a global view of migration, such as the ideas of other journalists such as Johnathan Wolff and Avnir De-Shalit to migration. Wolff and De-Shalit’s state that the use of law and ethics is a positive factor in the debate over free migration. The debate of free migration does not apply to a specific country but extends beyond, and continues on to a broader spectrum for introducing a freedom of movement amongst all people, for all countries. However, this concept is especially significant to the places that experience the most migration-including both host and receiving countries or states. Free migration is not limited to a certain time period, but has been more relevant and controversial in recent years, especially in the United States. In the U.S., it has become a more controversial topic since 9/11.\n\nFree migration is a concept to consider when comparing basic human rights and migration. \"Constraining movement in most cases is therefore, unjustified and immoral\". The topic of free migration is not a matter to be only exclusively debated amongst national governments of varying nations, but a worldwide discussion for all people of all nations on the debate of open borders and free migration. In that case, nations and people from all over the world can learn from each other where everyone is involved in the attempt to come to a just conclusion and solution to the problems surrounding both immigration and free migration alike. Free Migration has been slowly restricted throughout recent history due to the inevitable progression of society, causing more independent societies to create tighter laws, policies, and regulations concerning immigration. With nations closing themselves off and shutting their borders from non-residents, it is difficult for free migration to become secure, as well as having members of society prioritize an institutional issue such as this.\n\nImmigration officers and agents must maintain a code of conduct based on policy to provide equal treatment to any and all immigrants. Officers must put their political views behind them and revert to policy law; leaving behind their personal moral conflicts and ethics to abide by law and policy. Political philosophers focus on free movement as a human right and aid for those in poverty or serious global inequality. Although there is not a necessary definition for something considered to be morally, ethically, or legally accepted in a society, everyone has an individual connection to what may be considered good for society and what may be considered bad for society. The United States government has placed many strict laws on immigration that it proposes will produce a better immigration system. Other countries, through United Nations consensus, allow a minimum two year system for refugee relocation, with other countries such as Canada and Switzerland operating within a four year system.\n\nAccording to John Kennan’s (2012) data simulations (collected in multiple countries to simulate the effects of open borders), there would be large economic gains between Mexico and the United States of America through the implementation of open borders. Liberal economic reasoning advocates for open borders to prevent economic inequality between countries where country A is more efficient than country B due to restrictions on immigration creating production efficiency gaps between the two countries. Labor share data estimates that there would be more economic gains through free migration between countries. These gains are expressed through the economic and labor growth in the country along with economic gain for foreign and resident workers in that country. Economic simulations show that migration lowers the real wage for both countries receiving and sending immigrants; however, the effect of this decrease is based on the goods and services consumed by an individual. According to Kennan “these gains are associated with a relatively small reduction in the real wage in developed countries, and even this effect disappears as the capital–labor ratio adjusts over time.” Therefore, the number of workers in both receiving and sending countries would double by the current population of workers.\n\nAccording to Mirko Bagaric and John Morss (2005), nations discriminate against immigrants through certain immigration policies like the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), the body of law governing current immigration policy, which provides for an annual worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family members. Nations such as: North/South America, Europe and Australia use their power to regulate migration control by selecting individuals and placing them where they may not be able to succeed. “Nation states have the right to determine which people are permitted to enter within their geographical borders.” This causes people to choose places they did not want to go, making them displaced persons. Over the past decade, there have been 12-18 million displaced persons. Countries usually put restrictions on migrants because they could be a security risk. “The most persuasive argument in favour of strict immigration controls is expressed by the view that ‘we made it and own it and don’t want it ruined by others.’” \n\nSome nations discriminate against immigrants wanting to come in because many citizens have a preconceived notion that the ones coming in are criminals who want to abuse government funding. “Unless we radically loosen migration controls we must accept that we are endorsing a racist policy.” Multiple nations spend billions of dollars every year on border security. Many nations do not realize how much immigrants can benefit their nation. They perform tasks that most individuals may not want to do, such as low paying jobs that involve hard labor. Ultimately, immigrants can benefit every nation, if they were given the chance to prove themselves and really show who they are. Free migration means migrants can choose whatever country they wish to go to. If strict migration laws and border security shut people out, then they do not have a chance for a new life.\n\n\n\n"}

This Phrase is the word of Thomas Aquinas (c. 1224–1274). He observes, grace does not destroy nature, but fulfills its potential (Summa Theologiae, I, I, 8 ad 2). \n\"Since therefore grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, natural reason should minister to faith as the natural bent of the will ministers to charity.\" Thomas maintains that the truth of human nature finds total fulfilment through sanctifying grace, since this is \"perfectio naturae rationalis creatae\" (Quodlib., 4, 6). He stated that grace does not contradict nature. God's creation cannot be totally corrupted by human sin; grace heals the incomplete natural notion of God.\nAquinas divides grace into two basic kinds(ST I-II, III). One is gratia gratum faciens. It commonly is translated as sanctifying grace. This is the grace that sanctifies an individual, granting the person a participation in the divine nature and ordering him to God as to one’s supernatural end. It is this grace that receives the much greater part of the attention in the treatise on grace. The other kind of grace is gratia gratis data, commonly translated as gratuitous grace. The phrase is not altogether happy; after all, the first kind of grace is also gratuitously, in the sense of freely, given by God. This gratuitous grace, in the technical sense, is given bot for the sanctification of the recipient, but to allow the recipient to help others to God(I-II. III, 1c).\n\n"}

He has taught at the University of New Hampshire, Trent University and University of Massachusetts at Amherst (1986-1992) and is currently a professor in the Department of Humanities at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nAngus' early intellectual formation began with a dual engagement with 20th-century phenomenology, particularly the work of Edmund Husserl, and the Frankfurt school of critical theory around the problems of technology and modern capitalism. Focusing on the notion of \"instrumental reason\" as a legitimating principle of technology, his first book \"Technique and Enlightenment\" (1984) argues for a form of technological assessment that is both ethical and acknowledges its role within the larger problematic of the construction of human identity. His subsequent work branched into a wider conception of the problem of modernity in critical engagement with discourse theory, post-structuralism, and rhetorical theory. In \"Primal Scenes of Communication\" (2000) \"the complex linguistic model Angus has created regards the immanent link of identity creation involved in communication theories, but ... his concerns deal with this struggle for, and the shaping of, our faculties of attention.\"\n\nAngus' commitment to Canadian social and political thought was a consequence of his estimation in the 1970s that the left wing of Canadian nationalism contained the possibility for a transformation of Canadian society in a more egalitarian direction. In his most influential book in the area of Canadian Studies, \"A Border Within\" (1997), he works toward thinking English Canadian identity in relation to internal diversity and environmental-local embeddedness. He does so by exploring the question: \"What are the possibilities for an English-Canadian national identity in an age of corporate globalization- a phenomenon that appears to undermine national identities around the world?\" Angus rejects the tendency to wholly situate identity as simply constructed locally or universally, but instead maintains that it is in the very acknowledgement of otherness, both environmental and ethnic, that an English Canadian identity could be rethought.\nHis subsequent book \"Identity and Justice\" (2008) traces political thought and cultural politics insofar as they are integrated into philosophy. \"It is not a book about Canadian philosophy, but rather a philosophical book that self-consciously situates itself in a particular place, in order to talk about this place.\" In 2013, Angus published a collection of essays on Canada under the title \"The Undiscovered Country: Essays in Canadian Intellectual Culture\" through Athabasca University Press in which he collected together his critiques of Canadian thinkers and emphasized that a philosophy which does not criticize empire becomes ideology.\n\nAngus' work on the university draws on years of activism and public deliberation on the issues surrounding it. He applies philosophical critique on an institutional level. This allows him to examine the transformation of knowledge as it relates to the external pressures of network capitalism and technoscience. The contemporary university can be defined by \"three separate questions focusing on teaching, research and application, and technological change.\" Maria Victoria Guglietti's review explains that \"the transmission of knowledge...undermines enlightenment because it discourages any enquiry into the nature and limits of knowledge.\" This amounts to the university losing its \"critical and self reflexive role\" because its main purpose is to feed the specific needs of the larger system. This corporate arrangement of the university produces an anxiety as it relates to self-knowledge because of the explicit integration of education into the commodity form. Angus concludes with a realistic but hopeful analysis of the possibilities for the construction of new forms of enlightenment within the university. Though his work is primarily on the Canadian university, it has been widely praised for its applicability to the situation in the UK and US.\n\n"}
{"id": "39525578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39525578", "title": "J. L. Schellenberg", "text": "J. L. Schellenberg\n\nJ. L. Schellenberg (born 1959) is a Canadian philosopher best known for his work in philosophy of religion. He has a DPhil in Philosophy from the University of Oxford, and is Professor of Philosophy at Mount Saint Vincent University and Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Graduate Studies at Dalhousie University.\n\nSchellenberg’s early development of an argument from divine hiddenness for atheism has been influential. In a subsequent series of books he has arrived at a form of religion called ‘skeptical religion’ which he regards as being compatible with atheism. In 2013 the Cambridge University Press journal \"Religious Studies\" published a special issue devoted to critical discussion of Schellenberg’s philosophy of religion.\n\nSchellenberg’s first book, \"Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason\" (Cornell University Press, 1993), developed the argument from divine hiddenness (or hiddenness argument) against the existence of God. Discussion of Schellenberg’s argument continues today, in academic journals, anthologies, and other books, as well as online.\n\nSchellenberg’s most recent statement of the hiddenness argument may be summarized as follows. A God (construed as a perfect personal being) could not be less than perfectly loving, and a perfectly loving God would always be open to a meaningful conscious relationship with finite persons who are capable of participating in such a relationship and don’t resist it. This implies that if there is a God, every finite person who fits that description is able to exercise his or her capacity and be part of such a relationship. But this can’t be the case unless everyone who fits that description believes that God exists (for to have a conscious relationship with someone you have to believe they exist). It follows that if there is a God, there is no one who fits that description and fails to believe that God exists, i.e., there are no ‘nonresistant nonbelievers.’ But there are. Therefore, there is no God.\n\nCritics have argued that even a loving God might have reasons to be hidden generated by such things as the requirements of human freedom, human unreadiness for relationship with God, or the religious value of doubt. Schellenberg has replied that philosophers have no reason to assume that the persons God would create would be human persons existing in a world like ours, and that there are various ways in which the same good states of affairs to which critics appeal would be capable of being experienced in the context of a relationship with God.\n\nSchellenberg’s work after 1993 includes a trilogy on philosophy of religion (also published by Cornell: 2005, 2007, 2009). This project aims to address the most fundamental issues in that field and to set an agenda for future inquiry.\n\nThe first volume, \"Prolegomena to a Philosophy of Religion\", examines basic concepts in philosophy of religion such as ‘religion’, ‘belief’, ‘faith’ and ‘skepticism’ (or ‘doubt’) and proposes what Schellenberg regards as ways of revamping the discipline, including a new understanding of faith without belief.\nThe second volume, \"The Wisdom to Doubt: A Justification of Religious Skepticism\", offers various different arguments for religious skepticism that are intended to prepare the reader for the third book – \"The Will to Imagine: A Justification of Skeptical Religion\".\n\nIn the third book, Schellenberg argues for a religious orientation grounded not in belief, but in the sort of imaginative faith detailed in the first volume. Instead of focusing on theism, or any other specific idea from today’s religions, this sort of religion, which Schellenberg calls ‘skeptical religion,’ is focused on a proposition to which he gives the name ‘ultimism.’ Ultimism, as he defines it, is more general than other religious ‘isms’ – it is the proposition that \"something\" is ultimate in the nature of things, ultimately valuable, and the source of our ultimate good, but the details of that something it leaves open.\n\nSchellenberg suggests that arguments criticized as unable to support traditional belief in God can be adapted to support skeptical religion. In his view, skeptical religion therefore offers a solution to the problem of faith and reason.\n\nA central feature of Schellenberg’s trilogy is his suggestion that if we alter our perspective on time – looking into the \"deep future\" as well as the deep past – we will see that we may be at a very early stage in our development as a species (given that it is possible that the Earth will remain habitable for another billion years). With this vast stretch of time before us, he asks, why would we think that our best ideas – even ideas about religion – are behind us? At this stage in our development, Schellenberg argues, religion of a different sort from what we have seen before is called for.\n\nCritics have argued that if Schellenberg is skeptical or doubting about ultimism on the basis of future possibilities, then he should also be skeptical about theism instead of being an atheist, and that the idea of skeptical religion might be hard to put into practice. Schellenberg has said that there is a danger here of \"crying over unspilt milk\" since we have hardly begun to think about skeptical religion. He has also suggested reasons for distinguishing between theism (which he says may be disbelieved) and ultimism (which he says should only be doubted) on the basis of the former’s detailed content.\n\nSchellenberg’s \"Evolutionary Religion\" (Oxford University Press, 2013) aims to be a more widely accessible account of his arguments in the trilogy. It seeks to place these arguments into an evolutionary framework and maintains that skeptical religion provides a new way of responding to the science and religion debate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5202057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5202057", "title": "James D. Strauss", "text": "James D. Strauss\n\nJames Dean Strauss (born July 3, 1929; died March 19, 2014) is an American theologian who was professor of theology and philosophy at Lincoln Christian Seminary from 1967-1994. He has been described by many as the Einstein of the Restoration Movement.\n\nHe was born on July 3, 1929 to Earnest and Cleo Strauss in the small town of Herrin, Illinois. His father was a World War I veteran who worked as a coal miner and bookkeeper for Peabody Coal Company. His mother worked as a nurse and decorations designer for a department store. His father was a heavy gambler, but a very intelligent man. Dr. Strauss seems to have inherited his father's intelligence and his mother's creativity, combining them into a mind to be reckoned with. His family moved to Catlin, Illinois when James was in the second grade, where he spent the rest of his childhood and youth. He lived a rather normal childhood, playing baseball with boys in the neighborhood and listening to The Shadow and The Lone Ranger at night on the radio with his family. He displayed a sharp mind even while in high school, graduating as salutatorian in his class and voted \"most likely to succeed\" by his fellow students.\n\nJames Strauss died on March 19th, 2014.\n\nDr. Strauss's father was a Disciples of Christ member and his mother a Baptist, but neither attended church during James' childhood. One day James was invited to the Catlin Church of Christ by a consumer at the grocery store he worked at as a youth. James went, was converted, and brought his parents. Upon his conversion, James' father quit gambling, and, as a consequence, their family grew closer. James was mentored by the elders at that church, who taught him Biblical study methods and Greek. \n\nWhen James graduated from high school, he went to Cincinnati Christian College to study under R. C. Foster and Grayson Ensign. Proceeding on from there, he attended Christian Theological Seminary and studied under Walter Sykes. By the time he finished his time as a student, he had collected over 500 hours of graduate credit because his mentor died unexpectedly right before he was about to graduate with his 1st doctorate and the program that he was a part of collapsed, so he had to start over. He earned a B.A. and M.A. from Butler University, a Bachelor of Divinity from Christian Theological Seminary, and a Th.M. from the Chicago Graduate School of Theology. He fulfilled his Ph.D candidacy requirements at Indiana University, but due to a change over in the faculty from one year to the next he did not finish the degree. He does have a D.Min. from Eden Theological Seminary, Webster Groves, MO.\n\nDr. Strauss became Associate Professor of Theology and Philosophy at Lincoln Christian Seminary in 1967 after working for many years as a pastor. The position had opened up because the professor previously occupying the related position had been released because of the unorthodox views that he held. The student body at the time protested this move, as the released professor was popular among the students. Only later, however, did they realize what they had received in return. Strauss went on to very nearly \"be\" the seminary, as he taught most of the classes offered in a range of programs. One year the Seminary catalog listed him as teaching forty-seven courses. There is a cassette tape recording from 1977 of Dr. Strauss listing and briefly describing the classes he would be offering one year, which took over an hour to finish. Most of his syllabi were approximately 100 pages in length, single-spaced, nonetheless. He taught classes on Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Hegel, linguistics, artificial intelligence and the mind, philosophy of science, Biblical exegesis, preaching, theories of knowledge, astrophysics in relation to Christianity, apologetics, archaeology, the nature of man, creative imagination, the Enlightenment, Immanuel Kant, pluralism, classical philosophy, history of philosophy, classical theology, evolution, theology of sin, theology of promise, etc. Upon his retirement in 1994, he was given the honorary title of Professor Emeritus of Theology and Philosophy.

However, he was actually born in \"Green Arbour\" (near the Old Bailey), London, the son of Francis Heydon (of Sidmouth in Devonshire) and Mary (née Chandler, of Worcestershire); he was baptised at St. Sepulchre's Church. He had one sibling, a sister, Anne, two years his junior.\n\nAccording to his own account, he was educated at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, among his mother's friends. He studied Latin and Greek with a tutor and was apprenticed to the study of law; however, his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the English Civil War and, as a young man, he was said to have served in the royalist army. In 1651 he went abroad, travelling to Italy, Spain, Egypt, Arabia, and Persia.\n\nOn returning to England, he trained in law, and was articled as a clerk in 1652. In 1655, he was living in Clifford's Inn, practising as an attorney and also casting horoscopes. Heydon married the widow of Nicholas Culpeper in 1656, and is thought to have fathered a daughter. After 1658, he lived in \"Spitalfields, near Bishopsgate, next to the \"Red Lion\".\n\nHe attracted attention in royalist and occultist circles for predicting the future, including the death of Oliver Cromwell, then Protector. Their royalist connections caused both Francis and John Heydon to be imprisoned in the final years of the Commonwealth era. The Restoration of 1660 resolved Heydon's incarceration – though he was imprisoned briefly later in 1663 for dealing in suspect (treasonous) literature, and in 1664 for debt.\n\nIn 1665, Heydon published \"Psonthonphanchia, or a Quintuple Rosiecrucian Scourge for the due Correction of that Pseudo-chymist and Scurrilous Emperick, Geo. Thomson\", a fierce response to a pamphlet issued by physician George Thomson criticising the conduct of those members of the Royal College of Physicians who left the city during the Great Plague of London of 1665–66.\n\nIn 1667, Heydon was imprisoned, again, in the Tower of London for his part in the treasonous plots of his patron, the Duke of Buckingham. He was accused of \"treasonable practices in sowing sedition in the navy and engaging persons in a conspiracy to seize the Tower\". He claimed however, that he was innocent and was the victim of someone paid to inform against him.\n\nHeydon was accused of plagiarising Sir Thomas Browne, Thomas Vaughan, and other writers; his \"Physician's Guide\" of 1662 largely derives from Sir Francis Bacon's \"New Atlantis.\" He was referred to as \"an ignoramus and a cheate\" by Elias Ashmole; Frances Yates termed him a \"strange character...an astrologer, geomancer, alchemist, of a most extreme type.\"; while A. E. Waite considered that all that was of value in his mysticism was derived from anterior writers.\n\nThe precise date of Heydon's death is unknown. Care should be taken not to confuse him with Sir John Heydon (1588–1653), a royalist military officer and mathematician.\n\nHeydon published a remarkable volume of work in the last twelve years of his life.

{"id": "32937594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32937594", "title": "John Nicholas Muscat", "text": "John Nicholas Muscat\n\nGio' Niccolo' Muscat (1735-\"c.\"1800) was a Maltese doctor of law, and a major philosopher. His area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly jurisprudence.\n\nMuscat was born into a very poor family on March 8, 1735. He seems to have lost his parents at a very young age, for it was his aunt who raised him. Despite her poverty, this aunt worked hard to pay for the young Muscat's formal education. Unfortunately, it is however as yet unknown where he undertook his initial studies. His aunt also paid for his university studies. Again, all that is known is that he studied law but it is not certain where. It might have been at the Collegium Melitense of the Jesuits in Valletta.\n\nAfter finishing his law degree and became a lawyer, Muscat was lucky enough to encounter the good favours of one of the legal scribes (called \"uditore\") of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, who took him under his wing. This helped Muscat build up a stead clientele which brought him some stable income. At this time he was most likely still in his early twenties.\n\nConsidering his firm social improvement and advancement, it might be expected that Muscat would be particularly susceptible to social mores and customs. However, this was not so. When it came to tying the knot, Muscat chose to flouted convention completely. In fact, at the age of twenty-eight, in 1763, he married a widow with three children who was much older than him. Her name was Maria Salamone.\n\nMuscat's earliest extant writings date back to when he was twenty-three years old. A long poetic work in Italian, called Sonnetto (Sonnet), which he composed in 1758 was dedicated to Giammaria Azopardi Castelletti, Adriano Montana and Giuseppe Agius. The first was the Vicar General, and the others Assessors, to the Bishop of Malta Bartolomeo Rull. The work had never been published, and is extant in manuscript form. This document is evidence that Muscat did not harbour ‘dangerous’ doctrines (as came out afterwards) since always. During this period of his life he seems to have been quite convinced of the traditional political structures of his time and, particularly, with the supreme power exerted by the pope.\n\nAnother early writing, this time from 1771, when Muscat had thirty-six years of age, is called Replica delli Creditori (A Creditors’ Response). This too is in Italian. It was published in Palermo, Sicily, at the printing press of Baron Giacomo Epir, and contains 87 pages. The work was written in response to a publication issued by a certain Giacobbe Berard, who had responded to yet another book. Muscat's book, in fact, reproduced the same title of Berard's work. The subject of all three publications concerned a particular legal case of localised importance. Nevertheless, in his book Muscat touches upon a theme pertaining to political philosophy which he would go on to develop in other writings, namely the legal independence of a local government from outside interference (including the pope, his bishops or the Inquisition.\n\nThis was no transitory feeling which Muscat had expressed so boldly. His was a position emanating from the study of Illuminist writings. Indeed, here, as elsewhere, Muscat did not go as far as rejecting religion or calling forth the establishment of a republic. That would have been not only impractical in a society such as that of Malta but also probably did not tally with Muscat's own beliefs. In general, he seems to have believed in the political system adhered to by the Knights Hospitallers, albeit perhaps with a stronger dose of some egalitarian rights, and did not seem to have harbour any thoughts of overturning their government. As regards religion, he certainly seems to have been a deeply religious person, and his sole intensely felt objections seem to have been directed towards ecclesiastical and clerical authoritarianism and impertinence.\n\nNevertheless, Muscat certainly believed in the separation of Church and State, and, in later years, he also succeeded in gaining the ear of the Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitallers whom he served. Indeed, the Knights Hospitallers were a sort of religious order, and in this regard ultimately subject to the pope. Nevertheless, in matters pertaining to sovereign government, they could claim autonomy (just like other jurisdictions in Italy and elsewhere enjoyed).\n\nIn Malta’s current political context such a philosophy could have been explosive. However, for some time Muscat had no opportunity to put it into practice. That time came when the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, appointed him as his \"avvocato del principato\" (which more or less corresponds to the office of an Attorney General). This was at the beginning of Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc’s reign, around 1775.\n\nThe potential menace did not escape the local inquisitor, Giovanni Filippo Gallarati Scotti, who said about Muscat: ‘Since some time ago, the ministers of this secular government, and especially the principality’s attorney general, seem to have changed their way of thinking. [...] The new spirit, which began to take hold of this man’s mind with the Grand Master’s approval, has come out with various decisions which are offensive to the liberty of the Church’.\n\nThe ‘offensive decisions’ which Scotti referred to were the attempts made by Muscat to curb the effective authority of the pope over the jurisdiction and deliberations of the local government. Certainly, he must have had Muscat's \"Replica\" in mind. All of this of course could not please the local inquisitor or the bishop.\n\nThe inquisitor saw to it that his convictions became known to his authorities in Rome and to the Grand Master. He was not of course prepared to sit pretty while such an affront was levelled against the authority of the Church.\n\nOn the other hand, however, neither Muscat was ready to sit pretty. In fact, in the years which followed he intensified his assault by penning down other noteworthy works. The first seems to have appeared in 1779, called La Giurisprudenza Vindicata (A Reprisal for Jurisprudence). This is a 19-page booklet written in old Italian, and published at the printing press of the Knights Hospitallers under the direction of Giovanni Mallia. Its subtitle is simply \"Apologia\" (A Defence). The work is an unbroken discourse in twenty paragraphs dedicated to the Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc. Muscat's writing is elaborate and sometimes difficult to follow. Nevertheless, his message is clear enough. Muscat takes on his adversaries by insisting that they are calumnious and misrepresented his intentions. Of course, they hadn't. In fact, Muscat goes on to confirm and further substantiate the claims he had upheld in favour of the sovereignty and independence of Malta’s government in all decisions within his jurisdiction. While retracting not a single point of his philosophy, Muscat provides a long presentation on the origin of Roman law, and even presents the philosophical basis of his position.\n\nFour years after this work, in 1783, Muscat goes on to publish Apologia a Favore dell’Inclita Nazione Maltese (A Defence in Favour of the Renowned Maltese Nation). The very words ‘Maltese nation’ must have sent shivers down the spines of both the local inquisitor and the bishop. These were definitely words with feared and hated illuminist overtones. Muscat's book, written in old Italian, has 124 pages, and (as if to add insult to injury) was published in Rome, Italy, at the printing press of the Lazzarini family. The above-mentioned title continues with the words \"‘... Suoi Tribunali, Segnatura, e Legisti’\" (... its Tribunals, its Secretariat of State, and its Law Consulates). The work is divided in three parts, each containing a number of chapters. Muscat composed it in response to a book, called \"Ragionamenti\" (Reasonings), by Giandonato Rogadeo, who sustained that the jurisdiction of Malta's government was limited by the supreme authority of the pope and by his institutions. With frank and candid language, and also with conviction and philosophical clarity, Muscat leaves no doubt on which side of the fence he stands.\n\nIf this was not enough to make both the local inquisitor and the bishop to go wild with anxiety, the year after the appearance of Muscat's \"Apologia\" a publication of great consequence was issued by the Grand Master, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, in which Muscat's hand surely had a part. This was in 1784, and the publication was the Diritto Municipale di Malta (Malta's Domestic Law).\n\nUsually called simply the \"Codice De Rohan\", this book was basically a revision of the entire corpus of laws and legal customs of Malta. For its time it was a masterpiece of jurisprudence. However, in it the Catholic Church not only was she not given the absolute authority she expected to have but reasons were brought forward to retract some of the authority she still retained.\n\nA second publication, issued two years later, in 1786, under the title Bando e Prammatica da Valere in Perpetuo (A Law and Procedure to Stand in Perpetuity), was even more explicit than the \"Diritto Municipale\". It acknowledged that the prince had the right to sanction or abolish the execution of any legal instrument issued by a foreign authority, including the pope, the congregations of the Holy See, and the Inquisition.\n\nInquisitor Scotti identified Muscat as the one responsible for such pernicious doctrines. According to him, Muscat was one of ‘those modern philosophers of Malta’ \"‘cui il nome pur solo, e l’ombra della Chiesa, e delle Ecclesiastiche preprogative e invidioso e odiosissimo’\" (for whom the very name and the shadow of the Church, and of ecclesiastical prerogatives, is detestable and hateful).\n\nTo defend himself from such accusations, in 1788 Muscat published a tract entitled Memoria (A Memo). However, this did little to dissipate the opposition which had been building up against him. This was exacerbated a year later, in 1789, when Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc demanded the suspension of the notorious papal bull \"In Cœna Domini\", and Muscat \"personally\" went to stop Bishop Vincenzo Labini from publicly reading the bull. Of course, though such a slur was not heeded by the bishop, the incident certainly did not improve things.\n\nMuscat was determined to put into practice his philosophy. A little after the confrontation with the bishop, he informed the inquisitor that henceforth he would not submit any case before the pope, even those related to the faith, without first tendering them to the Grand Master for his approval. This sent the inquisitor up the wall.\n\nMuscat was unrelenting in his attack. A few years after clashing with the inquisitor, in 1791, he became involved in another incident which tipped the scales. Muscat maintained that the Church could exert its jurisdiction \"solely\" in matters pertaining to the sacraments, the faith, morals, and ecclesiastical discipline.\n\nThis seemed to go over the top. Pope Pius VI threatened Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc that, if Muscat was not immediately removed from Attorney General, the Holy See will \"disband\" the order of Knights Hospitallers!\n\nThough this was no light warning, Muscat defended himself most vigorously. He avowed to have been, was, and always will be, a true and faithful son of the Church. Of course, neither his faith nor his faithfulness was the point of the issue. Nevertheless, the inquisitor did not flinch from twisting the knife in the wound. He reminded the pope that, some time back, Muscat himself had declared that ‘This is no longer the century of the Church!’, and ‘If it were in my power I would leave the bishop with only the crosier and the mitre!’ The inquisitor went as far as to inform the pope that (as he had it from his spies), on receiving the news of his requested removal from office, Muscat stated: ‘Puh, as if this would make me lose my appetite!’\n\nMuscat was removed from office in January 1792, and sent to live outside the walls of the capital city, Valletta.\n\nDespite his removal from office, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc did not appoint anyone in his stead as Attorney General. He waited for the racket to settle down. Then, just three months after, in April 1792, he reinstated Muscat in his former offices.\n\nTrue to form, Muscat's former impertinence resumed. Just two months later, in June 1792, the pope was compelled again to demand the Grand Master to remove him straight away from all government responsibilities. There was no choice in the matter for Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc. This time around, he was also constrained in sending Muscat abroad.\n\nBefore leaving Malta, Muscat gathered all his dependencies and encouraged them not to fear acting as he had. He hoped to return in fifty days. However, he told them, even if this were not to be so, he confessed that he was proud to have pulled off ‘a glorious confrontation with the pope’.\n\nAccorded full honours by the Grand Master, Muscat left Malta in July 1792.\n\nMuscat went to Naples, Italy, and then to Messina, Sicily. He returned to Malta in October 1792. Though he became once more part of government, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc warned him to be prudent and stay out of the limelight. However, Muscat does not seem to have been a man to shy away from bothering the Church.\n\nAt one point, he denied the bishop the right to judge a case of divorce since he claimed that marriage was a social contract recognised only by the civil authority. This irked the bishop immensely. Later, defending his responsibility in resisting and curtailing the interference of Rome in the affairs of state, he publicly announced the ‘at long last the pope will have to relinquish all [the power] he has’. Muscat even went as far as to defend the Maltese from being arraigned before the ecclesiastical courts.\n\nEmbarrassing the Grand Master without end, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc resolved to give up trying to protect his subject any more. Encouraged by this turn of events, the new local inquisitor, Giulio Carpegna, decided to act quickly. Lest Muscat could be able to backtrack the Grand Master, he wanted him definitely removed.\n\nIn the meantime, in July 1793, Muscat wrote the pope a Memorandum with the intention of restoring him to his former offices. He avowed his faithfulness to the pope and his resolution to defend the jurisdictional rights of the Catholic Church in Malta. ‘Every interference in the matters of the Church,’ he declared, ‘now seem absolutely dangerous because I see that they bring me between the Devil and the deep sea.’\n\nThe ruse seemed to have worked. For in September 1793, the Grand Master reinstated Muscat to all his former offices. To the great consternation of the inquisitor, the pope had actually given his blessing for such a restoration of Muscat's fortunes. The pope, however, had approved ‘on the condition that Muscat does not meddle with ecclesiastical affairs’.\n\nThe official reinstatement was carried out with great pomp and ceremony. Muscat himself declared that his enemies – all except \"‘la briga papalina’\" (the papist gang), meaning the Inquisition - were now no more.\n\nNonetheless, Inquisitor Carpegna was enemy more than Muscat thought. Just one month after the ostentatious reinstatement, he succeeded, around October 1793, in removing Muscat. This time for good. Despite being mercifully forestalled the humiliation of being deposed once more, Muscat was forced to retire against a pension.\n\nThis time the inquisitor made sure that neither Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc nor his successor, Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, would change their mind. In the meantime, Muscat was simply waiting in the wings to reclaim his honour.\n\nA good moment came when, five years later, in July 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte brought to an end the 268-year era of the Knights Hospitallers in Malta, together with that of the local Inquisition. Muscat was actually part of the delegation aboard Napoleon Bonaparte’s ship, \"l’Orient\", to negotiate the Knights Hospitallers’ capitulation.\n\nDuring the next two months, during the French tenure of Malta, Muscat was appointed President of the Civil Courts. However, when the revolt against the Napoleonic forces began, in September 1798, he was forced to barricade himself within the walls of Valletta together with the French government.\n\nMuscat remained blockaded until November 1798. On being constrained to leave the city, the British expeditionary force took him prisoner and incarcerated him on the island of Gozo. He remained there at least for two years, until around 1800. He was sixty-five years of age.\n\nOn his release, Muscat exiled himself and left Malta for Sardinia, off the Italian peninsula. Nothing is yet known of his whereabouts after that.\n\nHe probably died at Sardinia.\n\nGio' Nicolo' Muscat can certainly be described as a most outstanding and stupendous philosopher. He dared challenge the hegemony of the Catholic Church in an age when it was right across-the-board. What's more, he did this with philosophical acumen and perspicuity. His personality and contribution is all the more intriguing because he hailed from the lower classes of society, and not only made it to the top but also attempted to affect some real change by applying his philosophical knowledge to good effect.\n\nMuscat's persona and endeavour came to light in 1993 by the splendid work done by historian Frans Chiappara. However, much more research work is needed to uncover the lacking documentary evidence which could substantiate the still unknown aspects of Muscat's interesting life, especially those (but not only) related to his last years away from Malta.\n\nAlso, the thorough study of the \"Diritto Municipale di Malta\" and the \"Bando e Prammatica\" is still to be made in order to establish the as yet unacknowledged contributions which Muscat made to these important 18th century documents.\n\nFinally, it is a pity that Muscat's philosophy has still to be analysed holistically and critically. Undoubtedly, his vision and enterprise are worth discovering in their entirety, not only for their historical value but furthermore for their relevance today.\n\n\n\nPhilosophy in Malta\n"}

Interest in Luz's work was revived around the time of the Cuban Revolution, and new editions of his work published, as he was regarded as a source of intellectual autonomy for the country.\n\nLuz took his degree in philosophy in 1817 at the Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Gerónimo in Havana, and took a degree in law at the Seminario de San Carlos. From 1837 to 1841, he travelled extensively in North America and Europe, coming into contact with a number of important intellectuals of the time, including Sir Walter Scott, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Georges Cuvier, the German philosopher Karl Krause, and the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.

(English: Sister Joan Agnes of the Cross; 12 November 1648 – 17 April 1695), was a self-taught scholar and student of scientific thought, philosopher, composer, and poet of the Baroque school, and Hieronymite nun of New Spain. She was known as a nun who demonstrated the courage to challenge opinions and speak out for her beliefs. Her outspoken opinion granted her lifelong names such as, \"The Tenth Muse\", \"The Phoenix of America\", or the \"Mexican Phoenix\".\n\nSor Juana lived during Mexico's colonial period, making her a contributor both to early Mexican literature as well as to the broader literature of the Spanish Golden Age. Beginning her studies at a young age, Sor Juana was fluent in Latin and also wrote in Nahuatl, and became known for her philosophy in her teens. Sister Juana educated herself in her own library, which was mostly inherited from her grandfather. After joining a nunnery in 1667, Sor Juana began writing poetry and prose dealing with such topics as love, feminism, and religion. Her criticism of misogyny and the hypocrisy of men led to her condemnation by the Bishop of Puebla, and in 1694 she was forced to sell her collection of books and focus on charity towards the poor. She died the next year, having caught the plague while treating her fellow nuns.\n\nShe was born Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana in San Miguel Nepantla (now called Nepantla de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in her honor) near Mexico City. She was the illegitimate child of a Spanish Captain, Pedro Manuel de Asbaje, and a Criolla woman, Isabel Ramírez. Her father, according to all accounts, was absent from her life. She was baptized 2 December 1651 and described on the baptismal rolls as \"a daughter of the Church\". She was raised in Amecameca, where her maternal grandfather owned an \"Hacienda\".\n\nAs a child, Juana often hid in the \"Hacienda\" chapel to read her grandfather's books from the adjoining library, something forbidden to girls. She learned how to read and write Latin at the age of three. By age five, she reportedly could do accounts. At age eight, she composed a poem on the Eucharist.\n\nBy adolescence, Juana had mastered Greek logic, and at age thirteen she was teaching Latin to young children. She also learned the Aztec language of Nahuatl and wrote some short poems in that language.\nIn 1664, at the age of 16, Juana was sent to live in Mexico City. She asked her mother's permission to disguise herself as a male student so that she could enter the university there. Not being allowed to do this, she continued her studies privately. She was a lady-in-waiting at the colonial viceroy's court, where she came under the tutelage of the Vicereine Leonor Carreto, wife of the Viceroy of New Spain Antonio Sebastián de Toledo. The viceroy (whom \"Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography\" names as the Marquis de Mancera), wishing to test the learning and intelligence of this 17-year-old, invited several theologians, jurists, philosophers, and poets to a meeting, during which she had to answer many questions unprepared and explain several difficult points on various scientific and literary subjects. The manner in which she acquitted herself astonished all present and greatly increased her reputation. Her literary accomplishments garnered her fame throughout New Spain. She was much admired in the viceregal court, and she received several proposals of marriage, which she declined.\n\nIn 1667, she entered the Monastery of St. Joseph, a community of the Discalced Carmelite nuns, as a postulant. She chose not to enter that order, which had strict rules. Later, in 1669, she entered the monastery of the Hieronymite nuns, which had more relaxed rules. She chose to become a nun so that she could study as she wished since she wanted \"to have no fixed occupation which might curtail my freedom to study.\"\n\nIn the convent and perhaps earlier, Sor Juana became friends with fellow savant, Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, who visited her in the convent's locutorio. She stayed cloistered in the Convent of Santa Paula of the Hieronymite in Mexico City from 1669 until her death, and there she studied, wrote, and collected a large library of books. The Viceroy and Vicereine of New Spain became her patrons; they supported her and had her writings published in Spain. She addressed some of her poems to paintings of her friend and patron María Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga, daughter of Vespasiano Gonzaga, Duca di Guastala, Luzara e Rechiolo and Inés María Manrique, 9th Countess de Paredes, which she also addressed as Lísida.\n\nOne noted critic of her writing was the bishop of Puebla, Manuel Fernández de Santa Cruz, who in November of 1690 published Sor Juana's critique of a 40-year-old sermon by Father António Vieira, a Portuguese Jesuit preacher. In addition to publishing that without her permission, under the pseudonym of Sor Filotea, he told her to focus on religious instead of secular studies. He published his criticisms to use them to his advantage against the Priest and while he agreed with her criticisms, he believed that as a woman, she should devote herself to prayer and give up her writings.\nIn response to critics of her writing, Juana wrote a letter, \"Respuesta a Sor Filotea de la Cruz\" (\"Reply to Sister Philotea\"), in which she defended women's right to education: \"Oh, how much harm would be avoided in our country\" if women were able to teach women in order to avoid the danger of male teachers in intimate setting with young female students. She said that such hazards \"would be eliminated if there were older women of learning, as Saint Paul desires, and instructions were passed down from one group to another, as in the case with needlework and other traditional activities.\"\n\nShe famously remarked by quoting an Aragonese poet and echoing St. Teresa of Ávila: \"One can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper.\" In response, Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas, Archbishop of Mexico joined other high-ranking officials in condemning Sor Juana's \"waywardness.\"\n\nBy 1693, she seemingly ceased to write, rather than risking official censure. However, there is no undisputed evidence of her renouncing devotion to letters, but there are documents showing her agreeing to undergo penance.\n\nHer name is affixed to such a document in 1694, but given her deep natural lyricism, the tone of the supposed handwritten penitentials is in rhetorical and autocratic Church formulae ; one is signed \"\"Yo, la Peor de Todas\" (\"I, the worst of all women\"\"). She is said to have sold all her books, then an extensive library of over 4,000 volumes, and her musical and scientific instruments as well. Other sources report that her defiance toward the church led to all of her books and instruments being confiscated although the bishop himself agreed with the contents of her letters.\n\nOnly a few of her writings have survived, which are known as the \"Complete Works\". According to Octavio Paz, her writings were saved by the vicereine.\n\nShe died after ministering to other nuns stricken during a plague, on 17 April 1695. Sigüenza y Góngora delivered the eulogy at her funeral.\n\n\"The Dream\", a long philosophical and descriptive \"silva\" (a poetic form combining verses of 7 and 11 syllables), \"deals with the shadow of night beneath which a person falls asleep in the midst of quietness and silence, where night and day animals participate, either dozing or sleeping, all urged to silence and rest by Harpocrates. The person's body ceases its ordinary operations, which are described in physiological and symbolical terms, ending with the activity of the imagination as an image-reflecting apparatus: the Pharos. From this moment, her soul, in a dream, sees itself free at the summit of her own intellect; in other words, at the \"apex\" of an own pyramid-like mount, which aims at God and is luminous.\n\nThere, perched like an eagle, she contemplates the whole creation, but fails to comprehend such a sight in a single concept. Dazzled, the soul's intellect faces its own shipwreck, caused mainly by trying to understand the overwhelming abundance of the universe, until reason undertakes that enterprise, beginning with each individual creation, and processing them one by one, helped by the Aristotelic method of ten categories.\n\nThe soul cannot get beyond questioning herself about the traits and causes of a fountain and a flower, intimating perhaps that his method constitutes a useless effort, since it must take into account all the details, accidents, and mysteries of each being. By that time, the body has consumed all its nourishment, and it starts to move and wake up, soul and body are reunited. The poem ends with the Sun overcoming Night in a straightforward battle between luminous and dark armies, and with the poet's awakening.\"\n\nDramas\n\nIn addition to the two comedies outlined here (\"Pawns of a House\" [Los empeños de una casa] and \"Love is More a Labyrinth\" [Amor es mas laberinto]), Sor Juana is attributed as the author of a possible ending to the comedy by Agustin de Salazar: \"The Second Celestina\" (La Segunda Celestina). In the 1990s, Guillermo Schmidhuber found a release of the comedy that contained a different ending than the otherwise known ending. He proposed that those one thousand words were written by Sor Juana. Some literary critics, such as Octavio Paz, Georgina Sabat-Rivers, and Luis Leal) have accepted Sor Juana as the co-author, but others, such as Antonio Alatorre and Jose Pascual Buxo, have refuted it.\n\nComedies\n\nIn the scholarly article, “Humor in Spain’s American Colonies: The Case of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz,” author Julie Greer Johnson describes how Sor Juana protested against the rigorously defined relationship between genders through her full-length comedies and humor. While literary dramas “became secularized and levity was added to otherwise austere moral themes,” women often emerged as comic characters, frequently exemplifying negative behavior. Although “such misconduct was regarded as serious, presenting the commission of folly within a humorous context was thought to make the lesson to women more palatable.” Humor “reinforced male authority and attempted to control female sexuality,” but Sor Juana was undaunted and ultimately turned this attitude to her advantage. By recognizing the power of laughter, she “endeavored to appropriate it on behalf of colonial women,” deducing that humor “has the capacity to defuse contention or even silence opposition,” and “the potential to provoke an imaginative framework in which reality may be restructured without provoking disapproval.” Through her use of humor, she “could call attention to the inequality of male-female images of femininity imposed upon them.”\n\nPawns of a House\n\nThe work was first performed on October 4, 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes’ first son’s birth. However, some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas’ entrance to the capital, even though this theory is not considered reliable.\n\nThe story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together. This comedy of errors is considered one of the most prominent works of late baroque Spanish-American literature. One of its most peculiar characteristics is that the driving force in the story is a woman with a strong, decided personality who expresses her desires to a nun. The protagonist of the story, Dona Leonor, fits the archetype perfectly.\n\nIt is often considered the peak of Sor Juana’s work and even the peak of all New-Hispanic literature. \"Pawns of a House\" is considered a rare work in colonial Spanish-American theater due to the management of intrigue, representation of the complicated system of marital relationships, and the changes in urban life.\n\nLove is More a Labyrinth\n\nThe work premiered on February 11, 1689, during the celebration of the inauguration of the viceroyalty Gaspar de la Cerda y Mendoza. However, in his Essay on Psychology, Ezequiel A. Chavez mentions Fernandez del Castillo as a coauthor of this comedy.\n\nThe plot takes on the well-known theme in Greek mythology of Theseus: a hero from Crete Island. He fights against the Minotaur and awakens the love of Ariadne and Fedra. Sor Juana conceived Theseus as the archetype of the baroque hero, a model also used by her fellow countryman Juan Ruis de Alarcon. Theseus’ triumph over the Minotaur does not make Theseus proud, but instead allows him to be humble.\n\nSor Juana and Music\n\nBesides poetry and philosophy, Sor Juana was interested in science, mathematics and music. The latter represents an important aspect because, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called El Caracol (unfortunately lost) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.\nIn the writings of Juana Ines, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidents of musical notation.\n\nPropiedad es de natura<br>\nque entre Dios y el hombre media,<br>\ny del cielo el be cuadrado<br>\njunto al be bemol de la tierra.<br>\n\nOn the other, Sarah Finley offers an interesting idea. She argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana. As an example of this, Finley points out that Narciso falls in love with a voice, and not with a reflection.\n\n\nThere is a vast amount of scholarly literature on Sor Juana in Spanish, English, French, and German.\n\nHer works have appeared in translation. An early translation of Sor Juana's work into English was \"Ten Sonnets from Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz [sic], 1651-1695: Mexico's Tenth Muse\", published in Taxco, Guerrero, in 1943. The translator was Elizabeth Prall Anderson who settled in Taxco. One musical work attributed to Sor Juana survives from the archive at Guatemala Cathedral. This is a 4-part villancico, \"Madre, la de los primores\".\n\nAn important translation to English of a work by Juana Inés de la Cruz for a wide readership is published as \"Poems, Protest, and a Dream\" in a 1997 Penguin Classics paperback, which includes her response to authorities censuring her.\n\nArguably the most important book devoted to Sor Juana, written by Nobel Prize laureate Octavio Paz in Spanish and translated to English in 1989 as \"\" (translated by Margaret Sayers Peden). This work examines and contemplates Sor Juana's poetry and life in the context of the history of New Spain, particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Paz describes how he had been drawn to her work by the enigmas of Sor Juana's personality and life paths. \"Why did she become a nun? How could she renounce her lifelong passion for writing and learning?\"However, it wasn't only the enigmas that attracted Paz to research on the nun's life and works. Octavio Paz's book on Sor Juana is perhaps his most personal search. It is unavoidable to see the coincidences between these two writers, separated by more than 3 centuries, and who are the product of a Mexico that has yet to resolve its own historical identity. Sor Juana, who possessed an admirable genius, was trapped within a context that did not understand, nor accept her completely. On the other hand, we have an Octavio Paz who also felt a fractured connection with his own country. A country he constantly tried to comprehend through his writings.\nIn his book, Paz makes a thorough analysis of Sor Juana's poetry and traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the Golden Age and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted Jesuit scholar of her era, Athanasius Kircher. Paz analyses Sor Juana's most ambitious and extensive poem, \"First Dream\" (\"Primero Sueño\") as largely a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of hermetic symbols, albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana's works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman.\n\nAn equally valuable feminist analysis and interpretation of Sor Juana’s life and work is found in \"The Answer/La Respuesta by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz\" by Electa Arenal, a Sor Juana scholar who is recognized among feminists who changed America, and Amanda Powell, a poet and translator. The original publication, released in 1994 by The Feminist Press, was re-released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by The Feminist Press. The bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana’s response to church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography. \"The Answer\" applies a valuable gender lens to Sor Juana’s writings and life.\nTarsicio Herrera Zapién, a classical scholar, has devoted much of his career to the study of Sor Juana's works. Some of his publications (in Spanish) include \"Buena fe y humanismo en Sor Juana: diálogos y ensayos: las obras latinas: los sorjuanistas recientes\" (1984); \"López Velarde y sor Juana, feministas opuestos: y cuatro ensayos sobre Horacio y Virgilio en México\" (1984); \"Poemas mexicanos universales: de Sor Juana a López Velarde\" (1989) and \"Tres siglos y cien vidas de Sor Juana\" (1995).\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Theresa Yugar who has written her Master's and Doctoral theses on Sor Juana, wrote \"Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz: Feminist Reconstruction of Biography and Text\", a book in which she discusses the life of Sor Juana through a feminist lense and analyzes Sor Juana's \"La Respuesta\" and \"El Sueño\". Dr. Yugar argues Sor Juana is the first feminist of the Americas and even one of the first ecofeminists. She claims that Sor Juana was ahead of her time and was able to intelligently critique the oppressive, patriarchal structures of the church.\n\nSor Juana was a famous and controversial figure in the seventeenth century. In the modern era, she has been honored in Mexico as well as being the part of a political controversy in the late twentieth century. During renovations at the cloister in the 1970s, bones were found that are believed to be those of Sor Juana. Also found at the same time was a medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Sor Juana. The medallion was kept by Margarita López Portillo, the sister of President José López Portillo (1976-1982). During the tercentennial of Sor Juana's death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita López Portillo to return the medallion, which she said she had taken for \"safekeeping\". She returned it to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in \"The New York Times\" a month later. Whether or not the medallion is Sor Juana's, the incident sparked discussions about Sor Juana and abuse of official power in Mexico.\n\nShe was honored by the Mexican government in significant ways.\n\nSor Juana has been the inspiration for film makers and authors of poetry, plays, opera, and literary fiction.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5356924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5356924", "title": "Kaibara Ekken", "text": "Kaibara Ekken\n\nKaibara was born into a family of advisors to the \"daimyō\" of Fukuoka Domain in Chikuzen Province (modern-day Fukuoka Prefecture). He accompanied his father to Edo in 1648, and was sent in 1649 to Nagasaki to study Western science. At his father's urging, he continued his studies in Nagasaki as a rōnin from 1650 through 1656. He then re-entered service to Kuroda, which led to his continuing studies in Kyoto. After his father's death in 1665, he returned to Fukuoka.\n\nKaibara's two most significant contributions to Japanese culture were the study of nature based on a blend of Western natural science and Neo-Confucianism, and the translation of the complex writings of Neo-Confucianism into vernacular Japanese. His synthesis of Confucian ideas and Western science influence the formation of Shinto, especially State Shinto, and reflect similar concerns to the Kokugaku movement.\nKaibara's science was confined to Botany and Materia medica and focused on the \"natural law\". Kaibara became as famous in Japan as people such as Charles Darwin when it came to science. He advanced the study of botany in Japan when he wrote \"Yamato honzō,\"(Medicinal herbs of Japan) which was a seminal study of Japanese plants. The 19th-century German Japanologist Philipp Franz von Siebold called him the \"Aristotle of Japan\".\n\nKaibara was known for his manuals of behavior, such as changing his Confucian ethical system based on the teachings of Zhu Xi (also known as Chu Hsi) into an easy \"self-help\" manuals. As an educator and philosopher, it appears that Kaibara's main goal in life was to further the process of weaving Neo-Confucianism into Japanese culture. In this context, he is best known for such books as \"Precepts for Children\" and \"Greater Learning for Women\" (\"Onna daigaku\"); but modern scholarship argues that it was actually prepared by other hands. Although the genesis of the work remains unchallenged, the oldest extant copy (1733) ends with the lines \"as related by our teacher Ekiken Kaibara\" and the publisher's colophon states that the text was written from lectures of our teacher Kaibara.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13070", "title": "LGBT social movements", "text": "LGBT social movements\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) social movements are social movements that advocate for LGBT+ people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Earlier movements focused on self-help and self-acceptance, such as the homophile movement of the 1950s. Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT+ people and their interests, numerous LGBT rights organizations are active worldwide. The earliest organizations to support LGBT+ rights were formed in the 19th century.\n\nA commonly stated goal among these movements is social equality for LGBT people, but there is still denial of full LGBT+ rights. Some have also focused on building LGBT+ communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from biphobia, homophobia, and transphobia. There is a struggle for LGBT rights today. LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of political activism and cultural activity, including lobbying, street marches, social groups, media, art, and research.\n\nSociologist Mary Bernstein writes: \"For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity, homophobia, and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual nuclear family (heteronormativity). Political goals include changing laws and policies in order to gain new rights, benefits, and protections from harm.\" Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres.\n\nAs with other social movements, there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education. There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together. Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities. Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails \"LGBTIQ\". For example, transgender people found that other members of the community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks. Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these people would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.\n\nLGBT movements have often adopted a kind of identity politics that sees gay, bisexual, and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a minority group or groups, and this is very common among LGBT communities. Those using this approach aspire to liberal political goals of freedom and equal opportunity, and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society. In arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian, and bisexual people into heterosexuals (\"conversion therapy\") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in religious beliefs that perceive gay, lesbian, and bisexual activity as immoral.\n\nHowever, others within LGBT movements have criticised identity politics as limited and flawed, elements of the queer movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive, and attempted to deconstruct those categories, which are seen to \"reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the nonheterosexual as inferior.\"\n\nAfter the French Revolution the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the Napoleonic Code made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws. However, in Protestant countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century.\n\nIn eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe, same-sex sexual behaviour and cross-dressing were widely considered to be socially unacceptable, and were serious crimes under sodomy and sumptuary laws. There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th century cross dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of William Shakespeare's plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in Elizabethan theater were always performed by males, usually prepubescent boys).\n\nThomas Cannon wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, \"Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify'd\" (1749). Although only fragments of his work have survived, it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy, written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject. It contains the argument: \"Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts: Are not they, however constructed, and consequently impelling, Nature?\"\nSocial reformer Jeremy Bentham wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, at a time when the legal penalty for buggery was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his utilitarian philosophy, in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings. However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.\n\nThe emerging currents of secular humanist thought which had inspired Bentham also informed the French Revolution, and when the newly formed National Constituent Assembly began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant \"sodomite-citizens\" in Paris petitioned the Assemblée nationale, the governing body of the French Revolution, for freedom and recognition. In 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, who was one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code. With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in 1808, the Duchy of Warsaw also decriminalized homosexuality.\n\nIn 1830, the new Penal Code of the Brazilian Empire did not repeat the title XIII of the fifth book of the \"Ordenações Philipinas\", which made sodomy a crime. In 1833, an anonymous English-language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls, who had been sentenced to death in London for sodomy:\n\n<poem>Whence spring these inclinations, rank and strong?\nAnd harming no one, wherefore call them wrong?</poem>\n\nThree years later in Switzerland, Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of \"Eros: Die Männerliebe der Griechen\" (English: \"Eros: The Male Love of the Greeks\"), another defence of same-sex love.\n\nIn many ways, social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late Victorian era. In 1885, the Labouchere Amendment was included in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which criminalized 'any act of gross indecency with another male person'; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright Oscar Wilde in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.\n\nFrom the 1870s, social reformers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret. A secret British society called the \"Order of Chaeronea\" campaigned for the legalisation of homosexuality, and counted playwright Oscar Wilde among its members in the last decades of the 19th century. The society was founded by George Cecil Ives, one of the earliest gay rights campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the \"Cause\". Ives met Oscar Wilde at the Authors' Club in London in 1892. Oscar Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his moustache, and once kissed him passionately in the Travellers' Club. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the Order of Chaeronea. Members included Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson.\n\nJohn Addington Symonds was a poet and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote \"A Problem in Greek Ethics\", a work of what would later be called \"gay history.\" Although the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" credits the medical writer C.G. Chaddock for introducing \"homosexual\" into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in \"A Problem in Greek Ethics\".\n\nSymonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as \"Eudiades\", which has been called \"the most famous of his homoerotic poems\". While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality, his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male-male sexual love in English literature. By the end of his life, Symonds' homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds' memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form the earliest known self-conscious homosexual autobiography.\n\nAnother friend of Ives was the English socialist poet Edward Carpenter. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offence. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, \"The Intermediate Sex\", would become a foundational text of the LGBT movements of the 20th century. Scottish anarchist John Henry Mackay also wrote in defense of same-sex love and androgyny.\n\nEnglish sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called \"Sexual Inversion\" it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a pathology or a crime and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society. He also studied what he called 'inter-generational relationships' and that these also broke societal taboos on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term 'homosexual', but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of Greek and Latin.\n\nThese early proponents of LGBT rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as 'free love'; a critique of Victorian sexual morality and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, also spoke in defence of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.\n\nAn early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer Magnus Hirschfeld. In 1897 he formed the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee campaign publicly against the notorious law \"Paragraph 175\", which made sex between men illegal. Adolf Brand later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld's medical view of the \"intermediate sex\", seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use \"outing\" as a political strategy, claiming that German Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow engaged in homosexual activity.\n\nThe 1901 book \"Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht\" (English: \"Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex\") by Aimée Duc was as much a political treatise as a novel, criticising pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women. Anna Rüling, delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld, became the first female Uranian activist. Rüling, who also saw \"men, women, and homosexuals\" as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women's and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause. Women only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader Helene Stöcker became a prominent figure in the movement. Friedrich Radszuweit published LGBT literature and magazines in Berlin (e.g., \"Die Freundin\").\n\nHirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women's rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be drastically reversed with the rise of Nazism, and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933. The Swiss journal Der Kreis was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era.\n\nUSSR's Criminal Code of 1922 decriminalised homosexuality. This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time – which was very backward economically and socially, and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed. This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women's rights – including legalising abortion, granting divorce on demand, equal rights for women, and attempts to socialise housework. During Stalin's era, however, USSR reverted all these progressive measures – re-criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion.\n\nIn 1928, English writer Radclyffe Hall published a novel titled \"The Well of Loneliness\". Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\", and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted. Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud's theory that same-sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was curable.\n\nIn the United States, several secret or semi-secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century, but little is known about them. A better documented group is Henry Gerber's Society for Human Rights formed in Chicago in 1924, which was quickly suppressed.\n\nImmediately following World War II, a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the Western world, in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term \"homophile\" to \"homosexual\", emphasizing love over sex. The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, France, Britain and elsewhere. ONE, Inc., the first public homosexual organization in the U.S, was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man Reed Erickson. A U.S. transgender rights journal, \"Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress\", also published two issues in 1952.\n\nThe homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability. Radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being assimilationist. Any demonstrations were orderly and polite. By 1969, there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U.S, and a national organization had been formed, but they were largely ignored by the media. A 1962 gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, Gene Compton's Cafeteria.\n\nThe Wolfenden Report was published in Britain on 4 September 1957 after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well-known men, including Lord Montagu. Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day, the committee recommended that \"homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence\". All but James Adair were in favour of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses' evidence at that time, found that \"homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects.\" The report added, \"The law's function is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others … It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour.\"\n\nThe report eventually led to the introduction of the Sexual Offences Bill 1967 supported by Labour MP Roy Jenkins, then the Labour Home Secretary. When passed, The Sexual Offences Act decriminalised homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age \"in private\" in England and Wales.\n\nBisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the 1960s in the United States. In 1966 bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk) founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group. Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967. Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time.\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association removed \"homosexuality\" from the diagnostics manual of mental illness in 1973.\nThe new social movements of the sixties, such as the Black Power and anti-Vietnam war movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and Women's Liberation throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical, and the Gay Liberation movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the Stonewall riots of 1969, when a group of gay men, lesbians, and drag queens at a bar in New York resisted a police raid.\n\nImmediately after Stonewall, such groups as the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and the Gay Activists' Alliance (GAA) were formed. Their use of the word \"gay\" represented a new unapologetic defiance—as an antonym for \"straight\" (\"respectable sexual behaviour\"), it encompassed a range of non-normative sexualities and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone, rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual. According to Gay Lib writer Toby Marotta, \"their Gay political outlooks were not homophile but liberationist\". \"Out, loud and proud,\" they engaged in colourful street theatre. The GLF's \"A Gay Manifesto\" set out the aims for the fledgling gay liberation movement, and influential intellectual Paul Goodman published \"The Politics of Being Queer\" (1969). Chapters of the GLF were established across the U.S. and in other parts of the Western world. The Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France.\n\nThe Gay Liberation movement overall, like the gay community generally and historically, did not welcome transgender individuals. The GLF allowed but was not inclusive toward transgender people from its creation, and the GAA specifically excluded transgender people from its agenda, mission and activism. Transgender communities formed their own organizations, including STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), Queen's Liberation Front (QLF), and the Transsexual Activist Organization. Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson founded STAR in 1970 to provide transgender street kids with a free & safe place to live, food, clothing, and an education. QLF was founded by Lee Brewster and Bunny Eisenhower to combat the erasure of drag and transgender visibility in the first LGBT pride march, demonstrating how quickly and fully the gay liberation movement excluded transgender activists despite their key role in the Stonewall Riots and previous LGBTQ activism. TAO, founded by Angela K. Douglas in 1970, was the first international grassroots transgender community organization, and is known for publishing the \"Moonshadow\" and \"Mirage\" newsletters.\n\nBisexual activist Brenda Howard is known as the \"Mother of Pride\" for her work in coordinating the first LGBT pride march; the first Christopher Street Liberation Day March eventually occurred in New York on June 27, 1970. Howard also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June. Additionally, Howard along with bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk) and L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word \"Pride\" to describe these festivities. As bisexual activist Tom Limoncelli put it, \"The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'\"\n\nOne of the values of the movement was gay pride. Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots, Craig Rodwell, proprietor of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop in lower Manhattan, persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. Liberation groups, including the Gay Liberation Front, Queens, the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR) all took part in the first Gay Pride Week. Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day. Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the London School of Economics on 13 October 1970. Bob Mellors and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle.\n\nBy 1971, the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press, holding weekly meetings of 200 to 300 people. The GLF Manifesto was published, and a series of high-profile direct actions, were carried out.\n\nThe disruption of the opening of the 1971 Festival of Light was the best organised of GLF action. The Festival of Light, whose leading figures included Mary Whitehouse, met at Methodist Central Hall. Groups of GLF members in drag invaded and spontaneously kissed each other; others released mice, sounded horns, and unveiled banners, and a contingent dressed as workmen obtained access to the basement and shut off the lights.\n\nIn 1971 the gay liberation movement in Germany, Austria and Switzerland started with Rosa von Praunheims movie It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives.\n\nEaster 1972 saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Undergraduates Union (students union) building at the University of Birmingham.\n\nBy 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement's splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, \"Gay News\", and Icebreakers. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources. GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local \"Gayline\", which is still active today and has received funding from the National Lottery. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the \"Leicester Mercury\", which refused to advertise Gayline's services at the time.\n\nFrom 1970 activists protested the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness by the American Psychiatric Association in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and in 1974 it was replaced with a category of \"sexual orientation disturbance\" then \"ego-dystonic homosexuality,\" which was also deleted, although \"gender identity disorder\" (a term used for Gender dysphoria) remains.\n\nIn 1972, Sweden became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by legislation to surgically change their sex and provide free hormone replacement therapy. Sweden also permitted the age of consent for same-sex partners to be at age 15, making it equal to heterosexual couples.\n\nIn Japan, LGBT groups were established in the 1970s. In 1971, ran for the Upper House election.\n\nBisexuals became more visible in the LGBT rights movement in the 1970s. In 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the \"Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality\" supporting bisexuals. In that same year the National Bisexual Liberation Group formed in New York. In 1976 the San Francisco Bisexual Center opened.\n\nFrom the anarchist Gay Liberation movement of the early 1970s arose a more reformist and single-issue Gay Rights movement, which portrayed gays and lesbians as a minority group and used the language of civil rights—in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period. In Berlin, for example, the radical Homosexuelle Aktion Westberlin was eclipsed by the Allgemeine Homosexuelle Arbeitsgemeinschaft.\n\nGay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one's sexual orientation does not reflect on one's gender; that is, \"you can be a man and desire a man... without any implications for your gender identity as a man,\" and the same is true if you are a woman. Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices, and butch \"bar dykes\" and flamboyant \"street queens\" were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays. Veteran activists such as Sylvia Rivera and Beth Elliot were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender.\n\nIn 1974, Maureen Colquhoun came out as the first Lesbian MP for the Labour Party in the UK. When elected she was married in a heterosexual marriage.\n\nIn 1975, the groundbreaking film portraying homosexual gay icon Quentin Crisp's life, The Naked Civil Servant was transmitted by Thames Television for the British Television channel ITV. The British journal Gay Left also began publication. After British Home Stores sacked an openly gay trainee Tony Whitehead, a national campaign subsequently picketed their stores in protest.\n\nIn 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors becoming the first openly gay man in the United States elected to public office. Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor Dan White in 1978.\n\nIn 1977, a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson, Anita Bryant, began a campaign \"Save Our Children,\" in Dade County, Florida (greater Miami), which proved to be a major set-back in the Gay Liberation movement. Essentially, she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual.\n\nIn 1979, a number of people in Sweden called in sick with a case of \"being homosexual,\" in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness. This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the National Board of Health and Welfare. Within a few months, Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness.\n\nLesbian feminism, which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. As with Gay Liberation, this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement. Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed \"lesbian separatism,\" influenced by writings such as Jill Johnston's 1973 book \"Lesbian Nation\". Organizers at the time focused on this issue. Diane Felix, also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene, is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA. She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women, especially in Latino American community. These places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors. Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the lesbian sex wars, clashing in particular over views on sadomasochism, prostitution and transsexuality. The term \"gay\" came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.\n\nIn Canada, the coming into effect of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.\n\nMark Segal, often referred to as the dean of American gay journalism, disrupted the CBS evening news with Walter Cronkite in 1973, an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60% of American households, many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time.\n\nAnother setback in the United States occurred in 1986, when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case \"Bowers v. Hardwick\". (This ruling would be overturned two decades later in \"Lawrence v. Texas).\n\nSome historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of AIDS, which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many. This era saw a resurgence of militancy with direct action groups like AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots Queer Nation (1990) and the Lesbian Avengers (1992). Some younger activists, seeing \"gay and lesbian\" as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using \"queer\" as a defiant statement of all sexual minorities and gender variant people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with \"gay\". Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various acronyms like \"LGBT\", \"LGBTQ\", and \"LGBTI\", where the \"Q\" and \"I\" stand for \"queer\" or \"questioning\" and \"intersex\", respectively.\n\nA 1987 essay titled \"The Overhauling of Straight America\", by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill), lays out a six-point plan for a campaign, which was first published in \"Guide\" magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans \"to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders\". Then \"your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won\". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book \"After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s.\" The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the gay liberation phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of \"Newsweek\", \"Time\" and \"The Washington Post\". The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as Focus on the Family as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged \"homosexual agenda\".\n\nA \"War Conference\" of 200 gay leaders was held in Warrenton, VA in 1988. The closing statement of the conference set out a plan for a media campaign: \nThe statement also called for an annual planning conference \"to help set and modify our national agenda.\" The Human Rights Campaign lists this event as a milestone in gay history and identifies it as where National Coming Out Day originated.\n\nOn June 24, 1994, the first Gay Pride march was celebrated in Asia in the Philippines. In the Middle East, LGBT organizations remain illegal, and LGBT rights activists face extreme opposition from the state. The 1990s also saw the emergence of many LGBT youth movements and organizations such as LGBT youth centers, gay-straight alliances in high schools, and youth-specific activism, such as the National Day of Silence. Colleges also became places of LGBT activism and support for activists and LGBT people in general, with many colleges opening LGBT centers.\n\nThe 1990s also saw a rapid push of the transgender movement, while at the same time a \"sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual.\" In the English-speaking world, Leslie Feinberg published \"Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come\" in 1992. Gender-variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements. Hijra activists campaigned for recognition as a third sex in India and Travesti groups began to organize against police brutality across Latin America while activists in the United States formed direct-confrontation groups such as the Transexual Menace.\n\nThe Netherlands was the first country to allow same-sex marriage in 2001. Following with Belgium in 2003 and Canada in 2005. , same-sex marriages are also recognized in Sweden, Argentina, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Uruguay, Brazil, France, Colombia, New Zealand, Mexico, Israel (though not performed there), United Kingdom, and the United States. South Africa became the first African nation to legalize same-sex marriage in 2006, and is currently the only African nation where same-sex marriage is legal. During this same period, some municipalities have been enacting laws against homosexuality. For example, Rhea County, Tennessee unsuccessfully tried to \"ban homosexuals\" in 2006.\n\nIn 2003, in the case \"Lawrence v. Texas\", the Supreme Court of the United States struck down sodomy laws in fourteen states, making consensual homosexual sex legal in all 50 states, a significant step forward in LGBT activism and one that had been fought for by activists since the inception of modern LGBT social movements.\n\nFrom 6 to 9 November 2006, The Yogyakarta Principles on application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted by an international meeting of 29 specialists, the International Commission of Jurists and the International Service for Human Rights.\nThe UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2008.\n\nOn 22 October 2009, the assembly of the Church of Sweden, voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples, including the use of the term marriage, (\"matrimony\").\n\nIceland became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage through a unanimous vote: 49-0, on 11 June 2010. A month later, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nSouth Africa became the first African nation to legalize same-sex marriage in 2006, and it remains the only African country where same-sex marriage is legal. Despite this uptick in tolerance of the LGBT community in South Africa, so-called corrective rapes have become prevalent in response, primarily targeting the poorer women who live in townships and those who have no recourse in responding to the crimes because of the notable lack of police presence and prejudice they may face for reporting assaults.\n\nThe 1993 \"Don't ask, don't tell\" law, forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military, was repealed in 2010. This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation. In 2012, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs. The new regulations ensure that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nIn early 2014 a series of protests organized by Add The Words, Idaho and former state senator Nicole LeFavour, some including civil disobedience and concomitant arrests, took place in Boise, Idaho which advocated adding the words \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" to the state's Human Rights act.\n\nOn June 26, 2015, in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 that the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live in the United States. With this ruling, the United States became the 17th country to legalize same-sex marriages entirely.\n\nBetween September 12 and November 7, 2017, Australia held a national survey on the subject of same sex marriage; 61.6% of respondents supported legally recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. This cleared the way for a private member's bill to be debated in the federal parliament.\n\nLGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations. They may have a personal, moral, political or religious objection to gay rights, homosexual relations or gay people. Opponents say same-sex relationships are not marriages, that legalization of same-sex marriage will open the door for the legalization of polygamy, that it is unnatural and that it encourages unhealthy behavior. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermines the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. As society has become more accepting of homosexuality, there therefore has also been the emergence of many groups that desire to end homosexuality; during the 1990s, one of the best known groups that was established with this goal is the ex-gay movement.\n\nSome people worry that gay rights conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, and the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations that hold opposing social and cultural views to LGBT rights. There is also concern that religious organizations might be forced to accept and perform same-sex marriages or risk losing their tax-exempt status.\n\nEric Rofes author of the book, \"A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?\", argues that the inclusion of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals. As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality. According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that \"something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur.\"The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti-gay rights activists such as John Briggs. Former California senator, John Briggs proposed Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be \" the corruption of the children's minds\". The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation. Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth, stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.\n\nDavid Campos, author of the book, \"Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook\", illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth. It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.\n\nMany opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals. In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely. In her book entitled \"Gay and Lesbian Movement,\" Margaret Cruickshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelovich polls which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.\nIt had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards same-sex marriage as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.\nLocation also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of rural and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges, including: sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas, generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas, and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas. In order to combat this problem that the LGBT community faces, social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for \"LGBT individuals with like-minds\" that are \"enabled to connect, share, and feel the heartbeat of the community as one.\"\n\nIn a study conducted by Darren E. Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the Southern Illinois University Carbondale, researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LBGT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage—generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.\n\nStudies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than Protestants; 63% of African Americans claim that they are Baptist or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. Religion, as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by Jews, liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not \"systematically condemned homosexual behaviors\" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by Evangelical Protestants. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.\n\nFiction literature also has an increased role in shaping people's attitude towards same-sex marriages. An original idea appears in Rafael Grugman dystopian fiction book \"Nontraditional Love\" (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man and a woman who unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. Underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25850319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25850319", "title": "Margaret Masterman", "text": "Margaret Masterman\n\nMargaret Masterman (4 May 1910 – 1 April 1986) was a British linguist and philosopher, most known for her pioneering work in the field of computational linguistics and especially machine translation. She founded the Cambridge Language Research Unit.\n\nMargaret Masterman was born in London on 4 May 1910 to Charles F. G. Masterman, a politician, and Lucy Blanche Lyttelton, a politician, poet and writer. In 1932 she married Richard Bevan Braithwaite, a philosopher. They had a son and a daughter.\n\nMargaret Masterman was one of six students in Wittgenstein's course of 1933–34 whose notes were compiled as \"The Blue Book\". In 1955 she founded and directed the Cambridge Language Research Unit (CLRU), which grew from an informal discussion group to a major research centre in computational linguistics in its time. She was a student at Newnham College, Cambridge and read modern languages and then Moral Sciences (as philosophy was then called). The Cambridge Language Research Unit was founded in a small but beautiful building called Adie's Museum which had housed far eastern art: small buddhist sculptures were built into its walls and carved doors. For a period of twenty years starting in 1953 it was a source of significant research in machine translation, computational linguistics, and quantum physics even though outside the official university structures in Cambridge. It was funded by grants from US agencies (AFOSR, ONR, NSF), UK Government agencies (OSTI) and later, from EU funds in Luxembourg. Its computing facilities were primitive—an ancient ICL 1202 computer---and most of its more serious computation was done either on the Cambridge university machine, in the then Mathematical Laboratory—or by CLRU visitors at sites in the US. One measure of its impact, and from a staff that never exceeded ten people, was that of the Annual Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Association for Computational Linguistics in the US, three have been awarded to CLRU alumni: Martin Kay, Karen Spärck Jones and Yorick Wilks.\n\nMargaret Masterman was ahead of her time by some twenty years: many of her beliefs and proposals for language processing by computer have now become part of the common stock of ideas in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine translation (MT) fields. She was never able to lay adequate claim to them because they were unacceptable when she published them, and so when they were written up later by her students or independently “discovered” by others, there was no trace back to her, especially in these fields where little or nothing over ten years old is ever reread.\n\nThe core of her beliefs about language processing was that it must reflect the coherence of language, its redundancy as a signal. This idea was a partial inheritance from the old “information theoretic” view of language: for her, it meant that processes analysing language must take into account its repetitive and redundant structures and that a writer goes on saying the same thing again and again in different ways; only if the writer does that can the ambiguities be removed from the signal. This sometimes led her to overemphasise the real and explicit redundancy she would find in rhythmical and repetitive verse and claim, implausibly, that normal English was just like that if only we could see it right.\n\nThis led in later years to the key role she assigned to rhythm, stress, breathgroupings and the boundaries they impose on text and the processes of understanding. To put it crudely, her claim was that languages are the way they are, at least in part, because they are produced by creatures that breathe at fairly regular intervals. It will be obvious why such claims could not even be entertained while Chomsky's views were preeminent in language studies. However she could never give systematic surface criteria by which the breathgroups and stress patterns were to be identified by surface cues, or could be reduced to other criteria such as syntax or morphology, nor would she become involved in the actual physics of voice patterns.\n\nHer views on the importance of semantics in language processing (which, she continued to defend in the high years of Chomskyan syntax between 1951 and 1966) were much influenced by R. H. Richens' views on classification and description by means of a language of semantic primitives with its own syntax. These, along with associated claims about semantic pattern matching onto surface text, were developed in actual programs, from which it might be assumed that she was a straightforward believer in the existence of semantic primitives in some Katzian or Schankian sense. Nothing could be further from the truth: for she was far too much a Wittgensteinian sceptic about the ability of any limited sublanguage or logic to take on the role of the whole language. She always argued that semantic primitives would only make sense if there were empirical criteria for their discovery and a theory that allowed for the fact that they, too, would develop exactly the polysemy of any higher or natural language; and she always emphasised the functional role of primitives in, for example, resolving sense ambiguity and as an interlingua for MT.\n\nShe hoped that the escape from the problem of the origin of semantic primitives would lie in either empirical classification procedures operating on actual texts (in the way some now speak of deriving primitives by massive connectionist learning), or by having an adequate formal theory of the structure of thesauri, which she believed to make explicit certain underlying structures of the semantic relations in a natural language: a theory such that “primitives” would emerge naturally as the organizing classification of thesauri. For some years, she and colleagues explored lattice theory as the underlying formal structure of such thesauri.\n\nTwo other concerns that went through her intellectual life owe much to the period when Michael Halliday, as the University Lecturer in Chinese at Cambridge, was a colleague at C.L.R.U. She got from him the idea that syntactic theory was fundamentally semantic or pragmatic, in either its categories and their fundamental definition, or in terms of the role of syntax as an organizing principle for semantic information. She was the first AI researcher to be influenced by Halliday, long before Terry Winograd. Again, she became preoccupied for a considerable period with the nature and function of Chinese ideograms, because she felt they clarified in an empirical way problems that Wittgenstein had wrestled with in his so-called picture-theory-of-truth. This led her to exaggerate the generality of ideogrammatic principles and to seem to hold that English was really rather like Chinese if only seen correctly, with its meaning atoms, highly ambiguous and virtually uninflected. It was a view that found little or no sympathy in the dominant linguistic or computational currents of the time.\n\nHer main creation in 1953, one which endured for twenty years, was the Cambridge Language Research Unit, which grew out of an informal discussion group with a very heterogeneous membership interested in language from philosophical and computational points of view. Subsequently, the attempt to build language processing programs which had a sound philosophical basis was a distinctive feature of the Unit's work. This approach to language processing, and the specific form it took in the use of a thesaurus as the main vehicle for semantic operations, will probably come to be seen as the Unit's major contributions to the field as a whole, and it was Margaret who was primarily responsible for them. Her vision of language processing and its possibilities was remarkable at a time when computers were very rudimentary: indeed much of the C.L.R.U.'s work had to be done on the predecessors of computers, namely Hollerith punched card machines. Equally, Margaret's determination in establishing and maintaining the Unit, with the enormous effort in fund raising that this involved, was very striking: the fact that it could continue for decades, and through periods when public support for such work was hard to come by, is a tribute to Margaret's persistence and charm. It is difficult for us now, in these days of artificial intelligence in the ordinary market place, and very powerful personal computers, to realise how hard it was to get the financial resources needed for language-processing research, and the technical resources to do actual experiments.\n\nPerhaps the best comment on Margaret's initiative in embarking on language processing research, and specifically on machine translation work, comes from a somewhat unexpected source. Machine translation, after an initial period of high hopes, and some large claims, was cast into outer darkness in 1966 by funding agencies who saw little return for their money. Reviewing twenty five years of artificial intelligence research in his presidential address to the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1985, Woody Bledsoe, one of the long-standing leaders of the field, though in areas quite outside language, said of those who attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties: \"They may have failed, but they were right to try; we have learned so much from their attempts to do something so difficult\".\n\nWhat she and C.L.R.U. were trying to do was far ahead of its time. Efforts were made to tackle fundamental problems with the computers of the day that had the capacity of a modern digital wrist watch. Despite every kind of problem, the Unit produced numerous publications on language and related subjects, including information retrieval and automatic classification. For over ten years the Unit's presence was strongly felt in the field, always with an emphasis on basic semantic problems of language understanding. Margaret had no time for those who felt that all that needed doing was syntactic parsing, or that complete parsing was necessary before you did anything else. Now that the semantics of language are regarded as a basic part of its understanding by machine, the ideas of C.L.R.U. seem curiously modern.\n\nMargaret's main contribution to the life of CLRU was in the continual intellectual stimulus she gave to its research, and through this to the larger natural language processing community: she had wide ranging concerns, and lateral ideas, which led her, for example, to propose the thesaurus as a means of carrying out many distinct language processing tasks, like indexing and translation. Margaret's emphasis on algorithms, and on testing them, was vital for the development of CLRU's work on language processing; but her ideas were notable, especially for those who worked with her, not just for their Intellectual qualities, but for their sheer joyousness.\n\nSerious research stopped at CLRU about 1978 and Margaret tried to restart the CLRU in 1980 with William Williams in the hope that the new breed of micro-computers could be used to develop her algorithms for natural language translation. Margaret walked the 7 miles from Millington Road in Cambridge to Orwell and purchased two North Star Horizon computers from Intelligent Artefacts (see ST Robotics). These were installed with the Forth programming language, written by David Sands and used by various students from the University of Cambridge who programmed Margaret's algorithms into the computers. Margaret's approach to natural language translation at this time was to split a sentence into \"breath group\" segments. Since each breath group had a unique meaning it could be translated into the target language and the target sentence reconstructed using the translated breath groups. This contrasted with the predominant language translation techniques of the time, notably Systran which used a dictionary and rule based system still used today. When Margaret died in 1986 William Williams closed down CLRU and its unique library of early MT documents were dumped into a skip, even though two university bodies had offered to give it a home.\n\nShe was one of cofounders of Lucy Cavendish College and its first Vice-President (1965–1975). She was a great-niece of Lucy Cavendish after whom the college is named. She also was a founder and the major inspiration of the Epiphany Philosophers, a group which shared some membership with the CLRU and was dedicated to the study of the relationship of science and religion and the forms of religious practice.\n\nIn 1965, Margaret Masterman read the work: \"The Nature of a Paradigm\" at the Fourth International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, in London. She conducted a detailed textual criticism of Thomas S. Kuhn's book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), characterizing the book as \"at once scientifically perspicuous and philosophically obscure.\" Masterman praised Kuhn as \"one of the outstanding philosophers of science of our time\" and his concept of paradigms as \"a fundamental idea and a new one in the philosophy of science.\" She criticised Thomas Kuhn for his vague and inconsistent use of the concept \"Paradigm,\" noting that it is used in at least 21 different senses, which can be summarized in three groups: metaparadigms, sociological paradigms, and artefact or construct paradigms. Masterman proposed that Kuhn's critics in the philosophy of science dealt only with metaparadigms and explored the insights and implications of the various conceptions. This criticism was accepted by Thomas Kuhn and was crucial in the shift of the concept \"Paradigm\" to \"Incommensurability\".\n\n"}

He certainly took the degree of M.D., but at what university is not known. \n\nFrom Duplessis-Mornay, he was appointed governor of Saumur by Henry IV in 1589; he received the post of professor of philosophy in the University of Saumur, of which he subsequently became regent. \n\nDuncan is said to have been versed in mathematics and theology, as well as in philosophy, and to have acquired such a reputation for medical skill that James I offered him the post of physician in ordinary at the English court, and even forwarded to him the necessary patent; but to have declined the royal invitation out of regard to his wife (a French lady), who was reluctant to leave her native land.\n\nDuncan lived at Saumur until his death, which took place in 1640, to the regret, it is said, of Protestants and Catholics alike.\n\nDuncan published in 1612 \"Institutiones Logicæ\", to which Burgersdijck, in the preface to his own \"Institutiones Logicæ\" (second edition 1634), acknowledged himself much indebted, and which indeed seems to have served as a model to the latter work; also (anon.) in 1634, \"Discours de la Possession des Religieuses Ursulines de Loudun\", an investigation of the supposed cases of demoniacal possession among the Ursuline nuns of Loudun. The phenomena had been attributed to the sorcery of Urbain Grandier, curé and canon of Loudun, who had been burned at the stake in consequence.\nDuncan explained them, at much risk to himself, as the result of melancholy. He is said to have been shielded from the vengeance of the clergy only by the influence of the wife of the Maréchal Urbain de Maillé-Brézé, then governor of Saumur.\n\nThis work elicited an answer in the shape of a \"Traité de la Mélancholie\" by the Sieur de la Menardière, and that in its turn an \"Apologie pour Mr. Duncan, Docteur en Médecine, dans laquelle les plus rares effects de la Mélancholie et de l'imagination sont expliquez contre les reflexions du Sieur de la M par le Sieur de la F.

The faulty Greek of the title, which should have been \"Aglossostomatographie\", was very severely criticised in prose and verse by a rival physician of Saumur, named Benoit.\n\nDuncan had three sons, who took the names respectively Mark Duncan de Cérisantis, Saint Helène, and Montfort.\n\n"}
{"id": "4426000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4426000", "title": "Moheyan", "text": "Moheyan\n\nHeshang Moheyan () was a late 8th century Buddhist monk associated with the East Mountain Teaching. He became famous for representing Chan Buddhism in the so called \"Council of Lhasa,\" a debate between adherents of the Indian teachings of \"gradual enlightenment\" and the Chinese teachings of \"sudden enlightenment,\" which according to tradition was won by the \"gradual teachings.\"\n\n\"Hvashang\" is a Tibetan approximation of the Chinese \"héshang\" \"Buddhist monk (). This, in turn, comes from the Sanskrit title \"upādhyāya\" \"teacher\".\n\nWhilst the East Mountain Teachings (pejoratively known as the \"Northern School\" Chan) were in decline, having been attacked by Shenhui (a student of Huineng) as a supposed \"gradual enlightenment\" teaching, Moheyan traveled to Dunhuang, which at the time belonged to the Tibetan Empire, in 781 or 787. For Moheyan, this was a new opportunity for the spread of (Northern) Chan.\n\nAfter teaching in the area of Dunhuang, Moheyan was invited by Trisong Detsen of the Tibetan Empire to settle at Samye, then the center of emerging Tibetan Buddhism. Moheyan promulgated a variety of Chan Buddhism and disseminated teachings from Samye where he attracted a considerable number of followers.\n\nHowever, in 793 Trisong Detsen resolved that Moheyan did not hold the true Dharma. Following intense protests from Moheyan’s supporters, Trisong Detsen proposed to settle the matter by sponsoring a debate. The most famous of these debates has become known as the \"Council of Lhasa\", although it may have taken place at Samye, a considerable distance from Lhasa. For the famed Council of Lhasa, an Indian monk named Kamalaśīla was invited to represent Indian Buddhism, while Moheyan represented East Mountain Teachings and Chinese Buddhism.\n\nWhile Moheyan took a subitist approach to enlightenment, his position was weakened when conceding that practices such as the perfection of morality, studying the sutras and teachings of the masters, and cultivating meritorious actions were appropriate. These types of actions were seen as part of the \"gradualist\" school, and Moheyan held that these were only necessary for those of \"dim\" facility and \"dull\" propensity. Those of \"sharp\" and \"keen\" facility and propensity do not need these practices, as they have \"direct\" access to the truth through meditation. This concession to the \"gradualists\", that not everyone can achieve the highest state of meditation, left Moheyan open to the charge that he had a dualistic approach to practice. To overcome these inconsistencies in his thesis, Moheyan claimed that when one gave up all conceptions, an automatic, all-at-once attainment of virtue resulted. He taught that there was an \"internal\" practice to gain insight and liberate one-self, and an \"external\" practice to liberate others (upaya, or skillful means). These were seen as two independent practices, a concession to human psychology and scriptural tradition.\n\nMost Tibetan sources state that the debate was decided in Kamalaśīla's favour (though many Chinese sources claim Moheyan won) and Moheyan was required to leave the country and that all sudden-enlightenment texts were gathered and destroyed by royal decree. This was a pivotal event in the history of Tibetan Buddhism, which would afterward continue to follow the late Indian model with only minor influence from China.\n\nNevertheless, Chan texts were produced until the 10th century in Tibet, which casts doubt on these Tibetan sources.\n\nMoheyan’s teachings were a mixture of the East Mountain Teachings associated with Yuquan Shenxiu and Baotang Chan. Broughton gives the following nomenclature:\nThe dichotomy of the gradual north and sudden south is a historical construction, as both Northern and Southern Schools contained \"gradualist teachings\" and \"sudden teachings\" and practices.\n\nGōmez gives a detailed account of the doctrinary differences that were at stake at the \"council of Lhasa\", based on Buton Rinchen Drub's \"Chos-'yun\", which in turn may have been based on Kamalaśīla's \"Third Bhāvanākrama\". Buton Rinchen Drub had chosen two points to summarize the conflict, which entails complex doctrinal and historical issues.\n\nMost of what is known of Moheyan’s teaching comes from fragments of writings in Chinese and Tibetan found in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang (now in Gansu, China). The manuscript given the appellation \"IOL Tib J 709\" is a collection of nine Chan texts, commencing with the teachings of Moheyan.\n\nAccording to Buton Rinchen Drub, the conflict centered around two theses set out by Moheyan:\n\nyet, a principal point of Moheyan's teaching is that according to Moheyan, the root cause of samsara is the creation of false distinctions, \"vikalpa-citta\". As long as these false distinctions are being created, one is bound to samsara.\n\nAccording to Buton Rinchen Drub, Moheyan taught that carrying out good or evil acts binds one to transmigration. Moheyan's point is that the concept of good or false is itself still conceptual thinking, which obscures enlightenment. If all thought, good or bad, obscures enlightenment, then all actions must be based on the simplest principles of conduct. To achieve proper conduct, all conceptions, without exception should be seen as false: \nSam van Schaik notes that Moheyan \"didn’t advocate the suppression of thoughts,\" but rather advised, in his own words:\nBy practicing \"dhyana\", awareness should be reverted toward this awareness itself:\nBy turning the attention inward, one discovers that no \"self-nature\" can be found in the movements of the mind. Eventually, dhyana leads to the realisation that awareness is empty, and cannot be grasped by concepts:\nThe teachings of Moheyan and other Chan masters were unified with the Kham Dzogchen (\"Great Perfection\") lineages through the \"Kunkhyen\" (Tibetan for \"omniscient\"), Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo. The Dzogchen of the Nyingma was often identified with the subitist (\"sudden enlightenment\") of Moheyan, and was called to defend itself against this charge by avowed members of the Sarma lineages that held to the staunch view of \"gradual enlightenment\"\n\nAccording to Ying Chua, Moheyan is often iconographically depicted holding a \"shankha\" (Sanskrit) and a \"mala\" (Sanskrit):\nAn iconographic thangka depiction of Moheyan is held in the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art (SAMA) collection, St. Francis College, Loretto, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3091798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3091798", "title": "Phenomenology of Perception", "text": "Phenomenology of Perception\n\nPhenomenology of Perception () is a 1945 book by the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, in which the author expounds his thesis of \"the primacy of perception\". The work established Merleau-Ponty as the pre-eminent philosopher of the body, and is considered a major statement of French existentialism. The relationship between \"Phenomenology of Perception\" and Merleau-Ponty's late, unfinished work has received much scholarly discussion.\n\nMerleau-Ponty begins by attempting to define phenomenology, which according to him has not yet received a proper definition. He asserts that phenomenology contains a series of apparent contradictions, which include the fact that it attempts to create a philosophy that would be a rigorous science while also offering an account of space, time and the world as people experience them. Merleau-Ponty denies that such contradictions can be resolved by distinguishing between Edmund Husserl's views and those of Martin Heidegger, commenting that Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" (1927) \"springs from an indication given by Husserl and amounts to no more than an explicit account of the 'natürlicher Weltbegriff' or the 'Lebenswelt' which Husserl, toward the end of his life, identified as the central theme of phenomenology, with the result that the contradiction appears in Husserl's own philosophy\".\n\nFollowing the work of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty attempts to reveal the phenomenological structure of perception. He writes that while the \"notion of sensation...seems immediate and obvious\", it is in fact confused. Merleau-Ponty asserts that because \"traditional analyses\" have accepted it, they have \"missed the phenomenon of perception.\" Merleau-Ponty argues that while sensation could be understood to mean \"the way in which I am affected and the experiencing of a state of myself\", there is nothing in experience corresponding to \"pure sensation\" or \"an atom of feeling\". He writes that, \"The alleged self-evidence of sensation is not based on any testimony of consciousness, but on widely held prejudice.\" Merleau-Ponty's central thesis is that of the \"primacy of perception.\" He critiques of the Cartesian stance of \"cogito ergo sum\" and expounds a different conception of consciousness. Cartesian dualism of mind and body is called into question as the primary way of existing in the world, and is ultimately rejected in favor of an intersubjective conception or dialectical and intentional concept of consciousness. The body is central to Merleau-Ponty's account of perception. In his view, the ability to reflect comes from a pre-reflective ground that serves as the foundation for reflecting on actions.\n\nMerleau-Ponty's account of the body helps him undermine what had been a long-standing conception of consciousness, which hinges on the distinction between the for-itself (subject) and in-itself (object), which plays a central role in the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre, whose \"Being and Nothingness\" was released in 1943. The body stands between this fundamental distinction between subject and object, ambiguously existing as both. Merleau-Ponty devotes a chapter to \"The Body in its Sexual Being\", in which he suggests that the body \"can symbolize existence because it brings it into being and actualizes it.\"\n\n\"Phenomenology of Perception\" was first published in 1945. An English translation by Colin Smith was published in 1962; another English translation, by Donald Landes, was published in 2013.\n\nThe philosopher A. J. Ayer, writing in \"Philosophy in the Twentieth Century\" (1982), criticized Merleau-Ponty's arguments against the sense datum theory of perception, finding them inconclusive. He described Merleau-Ponty's inclusion of a chapter on sexuality as \"surprising\", suggesting that Merleau-Ponty included it to give him an opportunity to revisit the Hegelian dialectic of the master and the slave. He compared Merleau-Ponty's views on sex to those of Sartre in \"Being and Nothingness\". Murray S. Davis, writing in \"Smut: Erotic Reality/Obscene Ideology\" (1983), observes that Merleau-Ponty's view that aspects of psychoanalysis, such as its attribution of meaning to all human actions and the diffusing of sexuality throughout the whole of human existence, are similar to phenomenology is controversial, and that other authors would view psychoanalysis as \"materialistic and mechanical\". Helmut R. Wagner, writing in \"Phenomenology of Consciousness and Sociology of the Life-world\" (1983), described \"Phenomenology of Perception\" as an important contribution to phenomenology. The philosopher Roger Scruton, writing in \"Sexual Desire\" (1986), described Merleau-Ponty's chapter on sexuality as \"surprisingly unhelpful\".\n\nThe philosopher David Abram, writing in \"The Spell of the Sensuous\" (1996), observed that while \"the sensible thing\" is \"commonly considered by our philosophical tradition to be passive and inert\", Merleau-Ponty consistently describes it in the active voice in \"Phenomenology of Perception\". He rejected the idea that Merleau-Ponty's \"animistic turns of phrase\" are the result of poetic license, arguing that Merleau-Ponty \"writes of the perceived things as entities, of sensible qualities as powers, and of the sensible itself as a field of animate presences, in order to acknowledge and underscore their active, dynamic contribution to perceptual experience.\" Stephen Priest, writing in \"Merleau-Ponty\" (1998), commented that, following the publication of \"Phenomenology of Perception\", Merleau-Ponty decided that in it he had taken \"subject-object dualism as phenomenologically primitive\" and \"made use of a comparatively superficial psychologistic vocabulary\" that he wished to replace.\n\nG. B. Madison, writing in \"The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy\" (1999), observed that \"Phenomenology of Perception\" was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism, and is best known for Merleau-Ponty's central thesis of \"the primacy of perception\". According to Madison, Merleau-Ponty was criticized on the grounds that, by grounding all intellectual and cultural acquisitions in the prereflective and prepersonal life of the body, the \"Phenomenology of Perception\" promotes reductionism and anti-intellectualism and undermines the ideals of reason and truth, and that Merleau-Ponty sought to respond to this charge in his subsequent work in the 1940s and 1950s. Madison further states that the relationship between the book and Merleau-Ponty's late, unfinished work \"The Visible and the Invisible\", edited by the philosopher Claude Lefort, has received much scholarly discussion, with some commentators seeing a significant shift in direction in his later thought, and others emphasizing the continuity of his work.\n\nThe philosopher Robert Bernasconi, writing in \"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" (2005), observed that \"Phenomenology of Perception\" established Merleau-Ponty as the pre-eminent philosopher of the body, and along with Merleau-Ponty's other writings, found a more receptive audience among analytic philosophers than the works of other phenomenologists.\n\nIn a 1999 interview with the critic Louis Menand in \"The New Yorker\", American vice president Al Gore mentioned \"Phenomenology of Perception\" as an inspiration.\n\n"}

Process theories are often contrasted with variance theories, that is, systems of ideas that explain the variance in a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. While process theories focus on how something happens, variance theories focus on why something happens. Examples of process theories include evolution by natural selection, continental drift and the nitrogen cycle.\n\nProcess theories come in four common archetypes. Evolutionary process theories explain change in a population through variation, selection and retention—much like biological evolution. In a dialectic process theory, “stability and change are explained by reference to the balance of power between opposing entities” (p. 517). In a teleological process theory, an agent “constructs an envisioned end state, takes action to reach it and monitors the progress” (p. 518). In a lifecycle process theory, “the trajectory to the final end state is prefigured and requires a particular historical sequence of events” (p. 515); that is, change always conforms to the same series of activities, stages, phases, like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly.\n\nProcess theories are important in management and software engineering. Process theories are used to explain how decisions are made how software is designed and how software processes are improved.\n\nMotivation theories can be classified broadly into two different perspectives: Content and Process theories. \n\nProcess theories are also used in education, psychology, geology and many other fields; however, they are not always called \"process theories\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46588001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46588001", "title": "Rangtong-Shentong", "text": "Rangtong-Shentong\n\nRangtong and shentong are two distinctive views on emptiness (sunyata) and the two truths doctrine within Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\"Rangtong\" (; \"empty of self-nature\") is a philosophical term in Tibetan Buddhism that is used to distinguish the majority Madhyamaka teaching on the nature of śūnyatā or \"emptiness\", namely that all phenomena are empty of an enduring and/or unchanging essence or \"self,\" and that this emptiness is not an absolute reality, but a mere nominal characterisation of phenomena. It is related to the \"prasangika\" approach, which argues that no syllogistic forms of reasoning should be used to debate the notion of inherent existence, but only arguments which show the logical implications and absurdity of positions based upon inherent existence. This position is the mainstream Gelugpa interpretation of Madhyamaka, one of the main Mahayana schools, which dominates Vajrayana Buddhism.\n\n\"Shentong\" (, also transliterated \"zhäntong\" or \"zhentong\"; literally \"other-emptiness\") is a position within Tibetan Madhyamaka. It applies \"śūnyatā\" in a specific way, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality (\"Paramarthasatya\") is \"non-dual Buddhajnana\" and \"empty\" () only of \"other,\" () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty and \"truly existing.\" This absolute reality is described by positive terms, an approach which helps \"to overcome certain residual subtle concepts\" and \"the habit [...] of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind.\" It destroys false concepts, as does \"prasangika\", but it also alerts the practitioner \"to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated.\"\n\nShentong was systematized and articulated under that name by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), who identified absolute reality with the Buddha-nature. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the Gelug authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its monks and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nAfter this suppression various shentong views were propagated mainly by Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas. The 19th century saw a revival of Shentong-views, and continued with the Rimé movement. Nowadays Shentong is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the Jonang school, although it is also taught by the Sakya and Kagyu schools, where it is identified with centerless awareness.\n\nThe term \"rangtong\" is not an autonym but rather arose from the shentong theorist Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, who coined the term \"shentong\" to characterise his own teachings and \"rangtong\" to refer to the teachings he opposed.\n\n\"Shentong\" literally means \"other-emptiness\", \"empty\" () of \"other\" (), i.e., empty of all qualities other than its own inherent existent. Yet, the term \"shentong\" also refers to Yogacara teachings, or \"Yogacara Madhyamaka\", which includes the teachings of Śāntarakṣita. In the Gelugpa understanding of the Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction, \"Yogacara Madhyamaka\" is labeled as \"svatantrika\", and set against a strict \"prasaṅgika\" approach which rejects any inherent existence.\n\nAnother translation of \"shentong\" is \"extrinsic emptiness,\" a term which is also used to refer to \"Great Mādhyamaka\" (\"dbu ma chen po\"), a term which has also been used by Klong chen pa and Mipham to refer to Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka, and Tsongkhapa has also used this term.\n\n\"Rangtong\" is the majority Tibetan teaching on the nature of śūnyatā or \"emptiness\", namely that all phenomena are empty of a self-nature in both the relative and absolute sense, without positing anything beyond that. This position is the mainstream Tibetan interpretation of Madhyamaka, especially by the followers of Prasaṅgika Mādhyamaka\n\nTsongkhapa (1357–1419), who also wrote in response to \"shentong\", is the most outspoken defendant of \"rangtong\". He saw emptiness as a consequence of dependent designation, the teaching that no \"thing or phenomenon\" has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence upon conceptual designation by a conscious mind. (See Designation & \"Conventional Truth\")\n\nTsongkhapa's view on \"ultimate reality\" is condensed in the sort text \"In Praise of Dependent Arising\" c.q. \"In Praise of Relativity\" c.q. \"The Essence of Eloquency\". It states that \"things\" \"do\" exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefore void of inherent existence:\nThis means that conventionally things \"do\" exist, and that there is no use in denying that. But it also means that ultimately those things have no 'existence of their own', and that cognizing then as such results from cognitive operations, not from some unchangeable essence. Tsongkhapa:\nIt also means that there is no \"transcendental ground,\" and that \"ultimate reality\" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind. Susan Kahn further explains:\n\"Shentong\" views the two truths doctrine as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is \"empty\" () only of \"other\" () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty. This absolute reality is the \"ground or substratum\" which is \"uncreated and undestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination.\" Dolpopa identified this absolute reality with the Buddha-nature.\n\nThe shentong-view is related to the Ratnagotravibhāga sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of Śāntarakṣita. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.\n\nHookham explains the Shentong position, referring to her Kagyu teacher Khenpo Tsultrim's \"Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness\". Khenpo Tsultrim presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches:\n\nThe notion of \"sentong\" grew out the Tibetan attempts to reconcile the contradiction between the Madhyama stance on the emptiness of phenomena, and the later notion of an eternal Buddha-nature.\n\nThe earliest shentong views are usually asserted to have been presented in a group of treatises variously attributed jointly to Asanga and Maitreyanātha, especially in the treatise known as the \"Unsurpassed Continuum\" (\"Uttaratantraśāstra\", also called the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\"), and in a body of Mādhyamaka treatises attributed to Nāgārjuna (e.g., the \"Dharmadhātustava\", \"In praise of the Dharmadhatu\").\n\nThe first exposition of a shentong view is sometimes attributed to Śāntarakṣita ( 725–788), but most scholars argue that his presentation of Madhyamaka thought is more accurately labeled \"Yogācāra-Svātantrika-Madhyamaka\". The eleventh-century Tibetan master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, a student of the Kashmiri scholar Somanatha, was possibly the first Tibetan master to articulate a shentong view, after his experiences during a Kālacakra retreat.\n\nShentong was systematized and articulated under that name by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), who originally was Sakya-trained lama, and joined the Jonang school with which \"shentong\" is strongly associated. In 1321 Dolpopa visited Tsurphu Monastery for the first time, and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339) about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his shentong method. Dolpopa claimed to have extraordinary insights, and his meditational experience seems to have played a great role in the development of his \"shentong\"-stance. Dolpopa developed a new philosophical vocabulary, based on Sanskrit and Tibetan, to express his insights, presenting provisional statements on absolute reality and Buddha-nature as statements of definitive meaning, which didn't requite further interpretation.\n\nChödrak Gyatso, 7th Karmapa Lama (1454–1506), and the Sakya scholar Sakya Chokden (, 1428–1507) were also important proponents of a shentong view. In the Jonang tradition, Tāranātha [1575–1635] is second in importance only to Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen himself. He was responsible for the short-lived renaissance of the school as a whole in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and of the widespread revitalization of the shentong theory in particular.\n\nAfter the suppression of the Jonang school and its texts and the texts of Sakya Chokden by the Tibetan government in the seventeenth century, various shentong views were propagated mainly by Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas. In particular, the eighth Tai Situpa (1700–1774) and Katok Tsewang Norbu (1698–1755)—Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas, respectively, and close colleagues—were very instrumental in reviving shentong among their sects.\n\nAlso instrumental was Situ Panchen (1700–1774), senior court chaplain in the Kingdom of Derge, a student of Katok Tsewang Norbu. \"In the end it would be Situ more than anyone who would create the environment for the widespread acceptance of the Shentong theories in the next century. This revival was continued by Jamgon Kongtrul, a nineteenth-century ecumenical (\"rimé\") scholar and forceful exponent of shentong. shentong views were also advanced recently by the eminent Kagyu Lamas Kalu Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche.\n\nShentong views have often come under criticism by followers of all four of the main Tibetan Buddhist schools, but particularly by the Gelug. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the Gelug authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its monks and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\"Exclusive Rangtongpas\", as the contemporary western Kagyu scholar S.K. Hookham would call them, have claimed that shentong views are inconsistent with the basic Mahāyāna teaching of emptiness, because Shentongpas posit an absolute. They sometimes label \"shentong\" Madhyamaka \"eternalistic Madhyamaka.\"\n\nThe great fourteenth-century Sakya master Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364) was very critical of shentong views. Gyaltsab Je and Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama, two of Gelug founder Je Tsongkhapa’s primary disciples, were also particularly critical of the shentong views of their time.\n\nAmong Kagyupas and Nyingmapas, the noted nineteenth-century Nyingma lama Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso wrote works both supportive and critical of shentong positions, as did Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama.\n\nAccording to Burchardi, limited attention given in academic studies to the various interpretations of \"gzhan stong\".\n\nThe contemporary western Kagyu scholar Karl Brunnhölzl argues that there is no such thing as \"shentong Madhyamaka,\" but rather that orthodox Yogācāra philosophy (when understood properly) is entirely compatible with Madhyamaka, and therefore shentong is not a novel position. He argues that Yogācāra has often been mischaracterized and unfairly marginalized in Tibetan Buddhist curricula.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25879", "title": "Roger Bacon", "text": "Roger Bacon\n\nRoger Bacon (; or \"\", also \" Rogerus\"; ), also known by the scholastic accolade Doctor , was an English philosopher and Franciscan friar who placed considerable emphasis on the study of nature through empiricism. In the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head. He is sometimes credited (mainly since the 19th century) as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by Aristotle and by the Arab scientist Alhazen. \n\nHis linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a universal grammar. However, more recent re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his \"experimental\" knowledge obtained from books in the scholastic tradition. He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the medieval university curriculum, which saw the addition of optics to the traditional \"\". A survey of how Bacon's work was received over the centuries found that it often reflected the concerns and controversies that were central to his readers. \n\nBacon's major work, the \"Opus Majus\", was sent to Pope Clement IV in Rome in 1267 upon the pope's request. Although gunpowder was first invented and described in China, Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula.\n\nRoger Bacon was born in Ilchester in Somerset, England, in the early 13th century, although his date of birth is sometimes narrowed down to , \"1213 or 1214\", or \"1215\". However, modern scholars tend to argue for the date of , but there are disagreements on this. The only source for his birth date is a statement from his 1267 ' that \"forty years have passed since I first learned the '\". The latest dates assume this referred to the alphabet itself, but elsewhere in the \" it is clear that Bacon uses the term to refer to rudimentary studies, the trivium or quadrivium that formed the medieval curriculum. His family appears to have been well off.\n\nBacon studied at Oxford. While Robert Grosseteste had probably left shortly before Bacon's arrival, his work and legacy almost certainly influenced the young scholar and it is possible Bacon subsequently visited him and William of Sherwood in Lincoln. Bacon became a master at Oxford, lecturing on Aristotle. There is no evidence he was ever awarded a doctorate. (The title \" was posthumous and figurative.) A caustic cleric named Roger Bacon is recorded speaking before the king at Oxford in 1233.\nIn 1237 or at some point in the following decade, he accepted an invitation to teach at the University of Paris. While there, he lectured on Latin grammar, Aristotelian logic, arithmetic, geometry, and the mathematical aspects of astronomy and music. His faculty colleagues included Robert Kilwardby, Albertus Magnus, and Peter of Spain, the future Pope John XXI. The Cornishman Richard Rufus was a scholarly opponent. In 1247 or soon after, he left his position in Paris.\nAs a private scholar, his whereabouts for the next decade are uncertain but he was likely in Oxford –1251, where he met Adam Marsh, and in Paris in 1251. He seems to have studied most of the known Greek and Arabic works on optics (then known as \"perspective\", '). A passage in the ' states that at some point he took a two-year break from his studies.\n\nBy the late 1250s, resentment against the king's preferential treatment of his émigré Poitevin relatives led to a coup and the imposition of the Provisions of Oxford and Westminster, instituting a baronial council and more frequent parliaments. Pope Urban IV absolved the king of his oath in 1261 and, after initial abortive resistance, Simon de Montfort led a force, enlarged due to recent crop failures, that prosecuted the Second Barons' War. Bacon's own family were considered royal partisans: De Montfort's men seized their property and drove several members into exile.\nIn 1256 or 1257, he became a friar in the Franciscan Order in either Paris or Oxford, following the example of scholarly English Franciscans such as Grosseteste and Marsh. After 1260, Bacon's activities were restricted by a statute prohibiting the friars of his order from publishing books or pamphlets without prior approval. He was likely kept at constant menial tasks to limit his time for contemplation and came to view his treatment as an enforced absence from scholarly life.\n\nBy the mid-1260s, he was undertaking a search for patrons who could secure permission and funding for his return to Oxford. For a time, Bacon was finally able to get around his superiors' interference through his acquaintance with Guy de Foulques, bishop of Narbonne, cardinal of Sabina, and the papal legate who negotiated between England's royal and baronial factions.\n\nIn 1263 or 1264, a message garbled by Bacon's messenger, Raymond of Laon, led Guy to believe that Bacon had already completed a summary of the sciences. In fact, he had no money to research, let alone copy, such a work and attempts to secure financing from his family were thwarted by the Second Barons' War. However, in 1265, Guy was summoned to a conclave at Perugia that elected him . William Benecor, who had previously been the courier between Henry III and the pope, now carried the correspondence between Bacon and Clement. Clement's reply of 22 June 1266 commissioned \"writings and remedies for current conditions\", instructing Bacon not to violate any standing \"prohibitions\" of his order but to carry out his task in utmost secrecy.\n\nWhile faculties of the time were largely limited to addressing disputes on the known texts of Aristotle, Clement's patronage permitted Bacon to engage in a wide-ranging consideration of the state of knowledge in his era. In 1267 or '68, Bacon sent the Pope his \"\", which presented his views on how to incorporate Aristotelian logic and science into a new theology, supporting Grosseteste's text-based approach against the \"sentence method\" then fashionable.\n\nBacon also sent his ', ', \"\", an optical lens, and possibly other works on alchemy and astrology. The entire process has been called \"one of the most remarkable single efforts of literary productivity\", with Bacon composing referenced works of around a million words in about a year.\n\nPope Clement died in 1268 and Bacon lost his protector. The Condemnations of 1277 banned the teaching of certain philosophical doctrines, including deterministic astrology. Some time within the next two years, Bacon was apparently imprisoned or placed under house arrest. This was traditionally ascribed to Franciscan Minister-General Jerome of Ascoli, probably acting on behalf of the many clergy, monks, and educators attacked by Bacon's 1271 \"\".\n\nModern scholarship, however, notes that the first reference to Bacon's \"imprisonment\" dates from eighty years after his death on the charge of unspecified \"suspected novelties\" and finds it less than credible. Contemporary scholars who do accept Bacon's imprisonment typically associate it with Bacon's \"attraction to contemporary prophesies\", his sympathies for \"the radical 'poverty' wing of the Franciscans\", interest in certain astrological doctrines, or generally combative personality rather than from \"any scientific novelties which he may have proposed\".\n\nSometime after 1278, Bacon returned to the Franciscan House at Oxford, where he continued his studies and is presumed to have spent most of the remainder of his life. His last dateable writing – the \"\" – was completed in 1292. He seems to have died shortly afterwards and been buried at Oxford.\n\nMedieval European philosophy often relied on appeals to the authority of Church Fathers such as St Augustine, and on works by Plato and Aristotle only known at second hand or through (sometimes highly inaccurate) Latin translations. By the 13th century, new works and better versions—in Arabic or in new Latin translations from the Arabic—began to trickle north from Muslim Spain. In Roger Bacon's writings, he upholds Aristotle's calls for the collection of facts before deducing scientific truths, against the practices of his contemporaries, arguing that \"thence cometh quiet to the mind\".\n\nBacon also called for reform with regard to theology. He argued that, rather than training to debate minor philosophical distinctions, theologians should focus their attention primarily on the Bible itself, learning the languages of its original sources thoroughly. He was fluent in several of these languages and was able to note and bemoan several corruptions of scripture, and of the works of the Greek philosophers that had been mistranslated or misinterpreted by scholars working in Latin. He also argued for the education of theologians in science (\"natural philosophy\") and its addition to the medieval curriculum.\n\nBacon's \"Greater Work\", the ' or ', contains treatments of mathematics, optics, alchemy, and astronomy, including theories on the positions and sizes of the celestial bodies. It is divided into seven sections: \"The Four General Causes of Human Ignorance\" ('), \"The Affinity of Philosophy with Theology\" ('), \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" ('), \"The Usefulness of Mathematics in Physics\" ('), \"On the Science of Perspective\" ('), \"On Experimental Knowledge\" ('), and \"A Philosophy of Morality\" (\"\").\n\nIt was not intended as a complete work but as a \"persuasive preamble\" ('), an enormous proposal for a reform of the medieval university curriculum and the establishment of a kind of library or encyclopedia, bringing in experts to compose a collection of definitive texts on these subjects. The new subjects were to be \"perspective\" (i.e., optics), \"astronomy\" (inclusive of astronomy proper, astrology, and the geography necessary in order to use them), \"weights\" (likely some treatment of mechanics but this section of the ' has been lost), alchemy, agriculture (inclusive of botany and zoology), medicine, and \"experimental science\", a philosophy of science that would guide the others. The section on geography was allegedly originally ornamented with a map based on ancient and Arabic computations of longitude and latitude, but has since been lost. His (mistaken) arguments supporting the idea that dry land formed the larger proportion of the globe were apparently similar to those which later guided Columbus.\n\nIn this work Bacon criticises his contemporaries Alexander of Hales and Albertus Magnus, who were held in high repute despite having only acquired their knowledge of Aristotle at second hand during their preaching careers. Albert was received at Paris as an authority equal to Aristotle, Avicenna, and Averroës, a situation Bacon decried: \"never in the world [had] such monstrosity occurred before.\"\n\nIn Part I of the \"Opus Majus\" Bacon recognizes some philosophers as the \"Sapientes\", or gifted few, and saw their knowledge in philosophy and theology as superior to the \"vulgus philosophantium\", or common herd of philosophers. He held Islamic thinkers between 1210 and 1265 in especially high regard calling them \"both philosophers and sacred writers\" and defended the integration of Islamic philosophy into Christian learning.\n\nIn Part IV of the \"\", Bacon proposed a calendrical reform similar to the later system introduced in 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII. Drawing on ancient Greek and medieval Islamic astronomy recently introduced to western Europe via Spain, Bacon continued the work of Robert Grosseteste and criticized the then-current Julian calendar as \"intolerable, horrible, and laughable\".\n\nIt had become apparent that Eudoxus and Sosigenes's assumption of a year of 365¼ days was, over the course of centuries, too inexact. Bacon charged that this meant the computation of Easter had shifted forward by 9 days since the First Council of Nicaea in 325. His proposal to drop one day every 125 years and to cease the observance of fixed equinoxes and solstices was not acted upon following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268. The eventual Gregorian calendar drops one day from the first three centuries in each set of 400 years.\n\nIn Part V of the \"\", Bacon discusses physiology of eyesight and the anatomy of the eye and the brain, considering light, distance, position, and size, direct and reflected vision, refraction, mirrors, and lenses. His treatment was primarily oriented by the Latin translation of Alhazen's \"Book of Optics\". He also draws heavily on Eugene of Palermo's Latin translation of the Arabic translation of Ptolemy's \"Optics\"; on Robert Grosseteste's work based on Al-Kindi's \"Optics\"; and, through Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), on Ibn Sahl's work on dioptrics.\n\nA passage in the ' and another in the ' are usually taken as the first European descriptions of a mixture containing the essential ingredients of gunpowder. Partington and others have come to the conclusion that Bacon most likely witnessed at least one demonstration of Chinese firecrackers, possibly obtained by Franciscans—including Bacon's friend William of Rubruck—who visited the Mongol Empire during this period. The most telling passage reads:\nWe have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e. a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpetre [together with sulphur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning. \n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Henry William Lovett Hime of the Royal Artillery published the theory that Bacon's \"\" contained a cryptogram giving a recipe for the gunpowder he witnessed. The theory was criticized by Thorndike in a 1915 letter to \"Science\" and several books, a position joined by Muir, Stillman, Steele, and Sarton. Needham et al. concurred with these earlier critics that the additional passage did not originate with Bacon and further showed that the proportions supposedly deciphered (a 7:5:5 ratio of saltpetre to charcoal to sulphur) as not even useful for firecrackers, burning slowly with a great deal of smoke and failing to ignite inside a gun barrel. The ~41% nitrate content is too low to have explosive properties.\n\nBacon attributed the \"Secret of Secrets\" (\"\"), the Islamic \"Mirror of Princes\" (), to Aristotle, thinking that he had composed it for Alexander the Great. Bacon produced an edited edition complete with his own introduction and notes and his writings of the 1260s and 1270s cite it far more than his contemporaries did. This led Easton and others including Robert Steele to argue that the text spurred Bacon's own transformation into an experimentalist. (Bacon never described such a decisive impact himself.) The dating of Bacon's edition of the \"Secret of Secrets\" is a key piece of evidence in the debate, with those arguing for a greater impact giving it an earlier date, but it certainly influenced the elder Bacon's conception of the political aspects of his work in the sciences.\n\nBacon has been credited with a number of alchemical texts.\n\nThe \"Letter on the Secret Workings of Art and Nature and on the Vanity of Magic\" ('), also known as \"On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature\" ('), a likely-forged letter to an unknown \"William of Paris,\" dismisses practices such as necromancy but contains most of the alchemical formulae attributed to Bacon, including one for a philosopher's stone and another possibly for gunpowder. It also includes several passages about hypothetical flying machines and submarines, attributing their first use to Alexander the Great. \"On the Vanity of Magic\" or \"The Nullity of Magic\" is a debunking of esoteric claims in Bacon's time, showing that they could be explained by natural phenomena.\n\nBacon's early linguistic and logical works are the \"Overview of Grammar\" ('), ', and the ' or '. These are mature but essentially conventional presentations of Oxford and Paris's terminist and pre-modist logic and grammar. His later work in linguistics is much more idiosyncratic, using terminology and addressing questions unique in his era.\n\nIn his \"Greek\" and \"Hebrew Grammars\" (' and '), in his work \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" (Book III of the \"\"), and in his \"Compendium of the Study of Philosophy\", Bacon stresses the need for scholars to know several languages. Europe's vernacular languages are not ignored—he considers them useful for practical purposes such as trade, proselytism, and administration—but Bacon is mostly interested in his era's languages of science and religion: Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.\n\nBacon is less interested in a full practical mastery of the other languages than on a theoretical understanding of their grammatical rules, ensuring that a Latin reader will not misunderstand passages' original meaning. For this reason, his treatments of Greek and Hebrew grammar are not isolated works on their topic but contrastive grammars treating the aspects which influenced Latin or which were required for properly understanding Latin texts. He pointedly states, \"I want to describe Greek grammar for the benefit of Latin speakers\". It is likely only this limited sense which was intended by Bacon's boast that he could teach an interested pupil a new language within three days.\n\nPassages in the \"Overview\" and the Greek grammar have been taken as an early exposition of a universal grammar underlying all human languages. The Greek grammar contains the tersest and most famous exposition:\n\nHowever, Bacon's lack of interest in studying a literal grammar underlying the languages known to him and his numerous works on linguistics and comparative linguistics has prompted Hovdhaugen to question the usual literal translation of Bacon's \" in such passages. She notes the ambiguity in the Latin term, which could refer variously to the structure of language, to its description, and to the science underlying such descriptions: i.e., linguistics.\n\nBacon states that his \"Lesser Work\" (') and \"Third Work\" (') were originally intended as summaries of the ' in case it was lost in transit. Easton's review of the texts suggests that they became separate works over the course of the laborious process of creating a fair copy of the ', whose half-million words were copied by hand and apparently greatly revised at least once.\n\nOther works by Bacon include his \"Tract on the Multiplication of Species\" ('), \"On Burning Lenses\" ('), the ' and ', the \"Compendium of the Study of Philosophy\" and \"of Theology\" (' and '), and his \"Computus\". The \"Compendium of the Study of Theology\", presumably written in the last years of his life, was an anticlimax: adding nothing new, it is principally devoted to the concerns of the 1260s.\n\n\"The Mirror of Alchimy\" (\"\"), a short treatise on the origin and composition of metals, is traditionally credited to Bacon. It espouses the Arabian theory of mercury and sulphur forming the other metals, with vague allusions to transmutation. Stillman opined that \"there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon's style or ideas, nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries\", and Muir and Lippmann also considered it a pseudepigraph.\n\nThe cryptic Voynich manuscript has been attributed to Bacon by various sources, including by its first recorded owner, but historians of science Lynn Thorndike and George Sarton dismissed these claims as unsupported. and the vellum of the manuscript has since been dated to the 15th century.\n\nBacon was largely ignored by his contemporaries in favor of other scholars such as Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas, although his works were studied by Bonaventure, John Pecham, and Peter of Limoges, through whom he may have influenced Raymond Lull. He was also partially responsible for the addition of optics (\"\") to the medieval university curriculum.\n\nBy the early modern period, the English considered him the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of forbidden knowledge, a Faust-like magician who had tricked the devil and so was able to go to heaven. Of these legends, one of the most prominent was that he created a talking brazen head which could answer any question. The story appears in the anonymous 16th-century account of \"The Famous Historie of Fryer Bacon\", in which Bacon speaks with a demon but causes the head to speak by \"the continuall fume of the six hottest Simples\", testing his theory that speech is caused by \"an effusion of vapors\".\n\nAround 1589, Robert Greene adapted the story for the stage as \"The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay\", one of the most successful Elizabethan comedies. As late as the 1640s, Thomas Browne was still complaining that \"Every ear is filled with the story of Frier Bacon, that made a brazen head to speak these words, \"Time is\"\". Greene's Bacon spent seven years creating a brass head that would speak \"strange and uncouth aphorisms\" to enable him to encircle Britain with a wall of brass that would make it impossible to conquer.\n\nUnlike his source material, Greene does not cause his head to operate by natural forces but by \"nigromantic charms\" and \"the enchanting forces of the devil\": i.e., by entrapping a dead spirit or hobgoblin. Bacon collapses, exhausted, just before his device comes to life and announces \"Time is\", \"Time was\", and \"Time is Past\" before being destroyed in spectacular fashion: the stage direction instructs that \"a lightening flasheth forth, and a hand appears that breaketh down the Head with a hammer\".\n\nA necromantic head was ascribed to Pope Sylvester II as early as the 1120s, but Browne considered the legend to be a misunderstanding of a passage in Peter the Good's \"Precious Pearl\" where the negligent alchemist misses the birth of his creation and loses it forever. The story may also preserve the work by Bacon and his contemporaries to construct clockwork armillary spheres. Bacon had praised a \"self-activated working model of the heavens\" as \"the greatest of all things which have been devised\".\n\nAs early as the 16th century, natural philosophers like Bruno, Dee, and Francis Bacon were attempting to rehabilitate Bacon's reputation and to portray him as a scientific pioneer who had avoided the petty bickering of his contemporaries to attempt a rational understanding of nature. By the 19th century, commenters following Whewell considered that \"Bacon... was not appreciated in his age because he was so completely in advance of it; he is a 16th or 17th century philosopher, whose lot has been by some accident cast in the 13th century\". His assertions in the \"\" that \"theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data, aided by instruments, and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses\" were (and still are) considered \"one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record\".\n\nThis idea that Bacon was a modern experimental scientist reflected two views of the period: that the principal form of scientific activity is experimentation and that 13th-century Europe still represented the \"Dark Ages\". This view, which is still reflected in some 21st-century popular science books, portrays Bacon as an advocate of modern experimental science who emerged as a solitary genius in an age hostile to his ideas. Based on Bacon's apocrypha, he is also portrayed as a visionary who predicted the invention of the submarine, aircraft, and automobile.\n\nHowever, in the course of the 20th century, Husserl, Heidegger, and others emphasized the importance to modern science of Cartesian and Galilean projections of mathematics over sensory perceptions of nature; Heidegger in particular noted the lack of such an understanding in Bacon's works. Although Crombie, Kuhn, and Schramm continued to argue for Bacon's importance to the development of \"qualitative\" areas of modern science, Duhem, Thorndike, Carton, and Koyré emphasized the essentially medieval nature of Bacon's \"\".\n\nResearch also established that Bacon was not as isolated—and probably not as persecuted—as was once thought. Many medieval sources of and influences on Bacon's scientific activity have been identified. In particular, Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste: his work on optics and the calendar followed Grosseteste's lead, as did his idea that inductively-derived conclusions should be submitted for verification through experimental testing. \n\nBacon noted of William of Sherwood that \"nobody was greater in philosophy than he\"; praised Peter of Maricourt (the author of \"A Letter on Magnetism\") and John of London as \"perfect\" mathematicians; Campanus of Novara (the author of works on astronomy, astrology, and the calendar) and a Master Nicholas as \"good\"; and acknowledged the influence of Adam Marsh and lesser figures. He was clearly not an isolated genius. The medieval church was also not generally opposed to scientific investigation and medieval science was both varied and extensive.\n\nAs a result, the picture of Bacon has changed. Bacon is now seen as part of his age: a leading figure in the beginnings of the medieval universities at Paris and Oxford but one joined in the development of the philosophy of science by Robert Grosseteste, William of Auvergne, Henry of Ghent, Albert Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham. Lindberg summarised:\nBacon was not a modern, out of step with his age, or a harbinger of things to come, but a brilliant, combative, and somewhat eccentric schoolman of the thirteenth century, endeavoring to take advantage of the new learning just becoming available while remaining true to traditional notions... of the importance to be attached to philosophical knowledge\".\n\nA recent review of the many visions of Bacon across the ages says contemporary scholarship still neglects one of the most important aspects of his life and thought: his commitment to the Franciscan order. \nHis was a plea for reform addressed to the supreme spiritual head of the Christian faith, written against a background of apocalyptic expectation and informed by the driving concerns of the friars. It was designed to improve training for missionaries and to provide new skills to be employed in the defence of the Christian world against the enmity of non-Christians and of the Antichrist. It cannot usefully be read solely in the context of the history of science and philosophy.\n\nWith regard to religion's influence on Bacon's philosophy, Charles Sanders Peirce noted, \"To Roger Bacon... the schoolmen's conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth... [but] Of all kinds of experience, the best, he thought, was interior illumination, which teaches many things about Nature which the external senses could never discover, such as the transubstantiation of bread.\"\n\nIn Oxford lore, Bacon is credited as the namesake of Folly Bridge for having gotten himself placed under house arrest nearby. Although this is probably untrue, it had formerly been known as \"Friar Bacon's Bridge\". Bacon is also honoured at Oxford by a plaque affixed to the wall of the new Westgate shopping centre.\n\nTo commemorate the 700th anniversary of Bacon's approximate year of birth, Prof. J. Erskine wrote the biographical play \"A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century\", which was performed and published by Columbia University in 1914. A fictionalized account of Bacon's life and times also appears in the second book of James Blish's \"After Such Knowledge\" trilogy, the 1964 \"Doctor Mirabilis\". Bacon serves as a mentor to the protagonists of Thomas Costain's 1945 \"The Black Rose\", Umberto Eco's 1980 \"The Name of the Rose\", and David Flusfeder's \"John the Pupil\". He is the protagonist's sidekick in John Bellairs's \"The Face in the Frost\".\n\nGreene's play prompted a less successful sequel \"John of Bordeaux\" and was recast as a children's story for James Baldwin's 1905 \"Thirty More Famous Stories Retold\". \"The Brazen Head of Friar Bacon\" also appears in Daniel Defoe's 1722 \"Journal of the Plague Year\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1843 \"The Birth-Mark\" and 1844 \"The Artist of the Beautiful\", William Douglas O'Connor's 1891 \"The Brazen Android\" (where Bacon devises it to terrify King Henry into accepting Simon de Montfort's demands for greater democracy), John Cowper Powys's 1956 \"The Brazen Head\", and Robertson Davies's 1970 \"Fifth Business\".\n\nA campground at Phish's 11th music festival was named after Roger.

{"id": "6082936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6082936", "title": "Seder hishtalshelus", "text": "Seder hishtalshelus\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Hasidic philosophy, seder hishtalshelus or hishtalshelut () refers to the chain-like descent of spiritual worlds (\"Olam/Olamot\") between God and Creation. Each spiritual world denotes a complete realm of existence, resulting from its general proximity or distance to Divine revelation. Each realm is also a form of consciousness reflected in this world through the psychology of the soul.\n\nThe theosophical tradition in Kabbalah is concerned with defining in great detail the esoteric nature, particular divine manifestations, and functional role of each level between the infinite and the finite. Each spiritual realm embodies a creative stage God continually uses to go from his self to the creation of the physical world, the material Universe being the end of the chain, and the only physical realm. Hasidic thought applies the Kabbalistic scheme to its own concern of perceiving divine omnipresence in this material world. In this, Hasidism varies in its use of Kabbalah, Mainstream-Hasidism avoiding Kabbalistic focus, while Habad thought explains \"seder hishtalshelus\" in relation to man's psychology. In contrast to the functional aim of Kabbalah, this contemplates \"seder hishtalshelus\" as a vehicle for relating to the divine unity with creation.\n\nThe term \"Seder Hishtalshelus\" is sometimes used restrictively to refer to the actually emergent Created Order (the comprehensive Four Worlds). More broadly, all preceding levels are included, as their function underlies resulting Existence. This page lists and links to all the main spiritual levels described in Lurianic Kabbalah, the scheme of Isaac Luria (1534–1572), the basis of modern Jewish mysticism. Its listing incorporated, expanded and explained earlier Medieval/Classical Kabbalah. After Luria, esoteric Kabbalists broadened explanation within the Lurianic listing. The supra-rational doctrines of Luria described Chokhmah-Wisdom levels of Divinity (Tzimtzum, Shevira) that preceded the \"rationally\" perceived Binah-Understanding levels of Medieval Kabbalah and Moshe Cordovero. In turn, the Habad Hasidic exploration described Keter-Will levels of Divine intention that preceded Creation.\n\n\"Seder hishtalshelus\" (Hebrew: ) means the \"order of development\" or \"order of evolution\", where the word \"Hishtalshelus\" (or \"Hishtalshelut\") is derived from the reduplicated quadriliteral root ŠLŠL \"to chain\", and so literally means \"the chain-like process\".\n\nPreparatory stages in the \"Ohr Ein Sof\" (\"God's Infinite Light\") before the beginning of the creative process. The \"Ohr Ein Sof\" is a paradoxical form of divine self-revelation. These are above any world/limitation. Kabbalah considered the functional question whether the \"Ein Sof\" represents God's divine essence or God as First Cause. Habad intellectual Hasidic thought explores \"Atzmut\" (divine essence) in the purpose of Creation:\n\n\nThree stages of the \"Sod HaTzimtzum\" (\"Secret of Contraction\") taught in the new doctrines of Lurianic Kabbalah. These received differing interpretations after Luria, from the literal (more mythological) to the metaphorical (more philosophical). In this dynamic myth, the first act in Creation was Divine Self-Withdrawal, the opposite of Creative revelation. \"Tzimtum\" is a paradox as Creation depends on God also being present in the vacuum and resulting existence:\n\nAdam Kadmon (\"Primordial Man\"), an anthropomorphic term, is the revelation of the specific Divine Will for Creation after the Tzimtzum. Its paradoxical nature is expressed as both Adam (creation) and \"Kadmon\" (\"primary\" divinity). As the level of Keter (\"Crown\") divine will, it is pure light, with no vessels, bounded by its future potential to create vessels. It is sometimes counted as the first of the Five Worlds, but its supreme transcendence is prior to the emergence of the sephirot and \"Shevirat Hakeilim\" (\"Shattering of their Vessels\"):\n\nThree Worlds of \"lights\" and \"vessels\" resulting from the interacting lights that emanated from Adam Kadmon, in the Lurianic Kabbalah. Each embodies different stages in the emergence of the 10 \"sephirot\" (\"Divine Attributes\"). Their progression corresponds to the archetypal realms of \"Tohu\" and \"Tikun\" (\"Chaos and Rectification\") described in the new doctrines of Luria. \"Tohu\" causes \"Shevirat HaKeilim\" (\"Shattering of the sephirot Vessels\"), the catastrophic exile in Creation:\n\nThe World of Atzilut (\"Emanation\") is the first of the comprehensive Four Worlds (ABiY\"A) of our Created Order, which are collectively the realm of \"Tikun\" (\"Rectification\") of the Shattered Vessels from \"Tohu\". \"Atzilut\" completes the Upper rectification, which began in \"Berudim\", through the \"sephirot\" transforming into \"Partzufim\" (\"Divine Countenances\"). \"Partzufim\" harmonise the \"sephirot\" in the scheme of \"Yosher\" (\"Upright\") full interacting configurations in the form of Man. Rectification of \"Atzilut\" begins with rectification of its \"Keter\" (\"Crown\") Will. Eight rectification stages in \"Keter D'Atzilut\" (\"The Crown of Emanation\"):\n\n\nRectification of \"Olam Ha'Atzilut\" (the \"World of Emanation\"), first of the Four Worlds, is completed with ten stages of Partzufim (Divine \"Countenances\") after \"Keter\". Each of the 6 Primary and 12 Secondary \"Partzufim\" correspond to the 10 Sephirot arranging around one of their number. Interaction of the \"Partzufim\" rectifies \"Atzilut\" eternally, completing Upper rectification. Redemption of the fallen sparks by Man rectifies the time-related three lower Worlds Below. \"Atzilut\" is separated from the three independent lower Worlds by its exclusive consciousness of Divine Unity, without self-awareness, the level of \"Chokhmah\" (\"Wisdom\"). Creation from Nothing is seen from the view of \"Ayin\" (\"Nothing\"):\n\nThe 10 \"sephirot\" shine in each of the Four Worlds, the last \"sephirah\" \"Malkuth\" (\"Kingship\") of a World becoming the first \"sephirah\" \"Keter\" (\"Crown\") of the next Realm. \"Malkuth\" of \"Atzilut\", called \"God's speech\", is the general source of independent Creation.\n\n\"Olam Ha'Beriah\" (the \"World of Creation\")\n\n\"Olam Ha'Yetzirah\" (the \"World of Formation\")\n\n\"Olam Ha'Assiah\" (the \"World of Action\")\n\n\"Asiyah Gashmit\" (\"Physical Action\")\n\nThe basic stations of this process from above to below are:\n\n\nAlthough these are the basic stations, each level contains innumerable details. To understand Seder Hishtalshelus properly, one must first understand how all of the analogies exist in a person. Once one has understood this, one can begin to see how all of these levels exist in the world. Then, one will be able to take any event or aspect of creation and trace it up the chain to God Himself, then back down to the original view and see how God is literally here with us, relating to us directly through his creations.\n\nThe purpose of learning about Seder Hishtalshelus in Hasidic thought is not merely to know about many distinct levels, rather, the purpose is to see how all the levels in between us and God are transparent and irrelevant, and in truth God is relating to us directly, and there is \"none besides for Him\". (Deuteronomy 4:35) Because of this, the Tanya states that learning about the Seder Hishtalshelus will bring a person to a \"complete heart\".\n\nThis is much like two friends talking on the phone. There are many stages one's voice must undergo before it reaches the other. Yet, the two people are talking to each other, not to their phones. The stages in between become irrelevant and transparent in such a situation.\n\nOne can understand these levels through the analogy of a man who wants a house. The hishtalshelus is generally broken down into two general stages, called the \"Upper Unity\" and the \"Lower Unity\". Below are the relevant analogies for all the basic stations of the hishtalshelus in the analogy of a man who wants a house starting from the top (primordial desires) and going down (until the desire is actualized).\n\n\nWhile the Hasidic texts offer many analogies of how Seder Hishtalshelus exists within a person, such as the one given above, they also emphasize that these are only analogies and the analogue is nothing like the analogies. These analogies are meant only to give a glimpse into Seder Hishtalshelus in a way that we are familiar with, but the true analogue deals with how God interrelates with our world. Much like a house, God desires a \"dwelling place\" in this world. This means He desired that his Essence be revealed through the medium of this world much like a person might wish his own essence to be revealed through the medium of his house. While analogies are a necessary step, the true goal of studying Seder Hishlshelus must be to pick out the point that unites all of the analogies and apply it to the analogue i.e. how God is being revealed in our world directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the analogies are not vague, These analogies are precise and exact, much scholarly work has been dedicated to understanding and analyzing why particular analogies have been used, some that are not, and some that are inconsistent in application (i.e. a text may use different analogies to demonstrate the same point - the analysis required is to understand and examine the deficiency in each analogy, and how they can be reconciled with each other)\n\nStudy and contemplation of Seder Hishtalshelus is central to the Intellectual-Hasidism school of Chabad. Some speculate that the recent Hasidic explanations of Seder Hishtalshelus may have been influenced by certain principles in Western philosophy. Various dichotomies mentioned in philosophy are strikingly similar to those mentioned in late Hasidic texts: Form/Matter, Sense/Feeling, Initial Cognition/Semiotic Cognition/Semiotic Transition. Furthermore, the prose of the Rebbe Rashab is almost identical to that of G. W. F. Hegel.\n\nOthers counter that the dichotomies meantioned in Hasidic texts originate in sources predating Western philosophy. Proponents of Hasidic philosophy, counter that since Intellectual-Hasidut is an essential wisdom that is higher than, and includes all other wisdoms it would necessarily make reference to all other forms of wisdom, whether Western or otherwise. They would argue that such similarities are not proof of influence of Western philosophy, but rather are evidence that Hasidic philosophy touches upon, unites, and enlightens every other wisdom, whether it be Torah or secular.\n\nThe website and books of Sanford Drob bring the Seder Hishtalshelut theosophical scheme of Lurianic Kabbalah into dialogue with Modern and Postmodern Philosophy and Psychology. In our age when Western philosophy deconstructs the possibility of metaphysics, he sees the Lurianic scheme as an essence-myth that transcends and incorporates secular disciplines, allowing it to re-open the possibilities of philosophy. This process both enriches the secular disciplines, while giving intellectual insights into the Lurianic myth through revealing its facets in human life. This dialogue includes Hegelian dialectics and its application in Marxism, Freud, Jung and Deconstructionism, as well as ancient systems of thought.\n\n\n"}

Keeling, was a British philosopher, formerly a Reader at University College London (UCL). He is best known for his 1934 monograph \"Descartes\", printed in a second edition in 1968, which for decades served as the standard English introduction to the philosophy of Descartes. Keeling is also known for his 1934 annotated edition of \"Philosophical Studies\" by J. M. E. McTaggart. Honoring his passion for ancient, especially Greek, philosophy the UCL Department of Philosophy administer an annual memorial lecture, biennial colloquium and a postgraduate scholarship in Ancient Philosophy in his name.\n\nStanley Keeling was born in Islington on 9 August 1894 and studied at Southend Secondary School in Essex, where he remained until c.1911.\n\nAs a conscientious objector to World War I, Keeling refused to submit to conscription as demanded by the Military Service Act 1916. He was thus arrested and convicted in court martial in January 1917. He was incarcerated at Wormwood Scrubs and, later, at Dartmoor, being released not long before 10 April 1919.\n\nIn June 1919 Keeling enrolled at University College London but it was not until October 1920 that he took on an advised curriculum. This was under George Dawes Hicks who, in 1904, had become the first appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at UCL (the Chair having previously gone unfilled). After his death, Keeling would describe Hicks as a teacher \"wholly engrossed in philosophy\" who \"firmly believed that it, as no other subject, could impart to his students an influence and a training such as would render them habitually reflective about their existence and destiny\".\n\nKeeling was befriended by Bertrand Russell who, along with Alfred North Whitehead, convinced him to continue his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was admitted to the same in October 1922 and awarded his BA there in 1924. The philosophy taught at Cambridge at the time was, however, largely a disappointment to him. The sole exception reportedly being J. M. E. McTaggart who Keeling \"held in the highest esteem as the only original metaphysician\" of the century. Richard Wollheim. a later colleague at UCL from 1949, described Keeling as \"a disciple of McTaggart who thought him right \"on nearly all topics\" (apart from \"one which left.. a bitter taste\" - whilst Keeling was a pacifist, \"McTaggart was rabidly militaristic\").\n\nKeeling was then to spend two years studying in France. He first attended the University of Toulouse where he was awarded a \"certificat d'études supérieures\", then the University of Montpellier, where, in 1925, he presented his thesis \"La nature de l'expérience chez Kant et chez Bradley\" (which Russell is known to have read) and was awarded his \"Docteur ès Lettres (D. ès L.).\" Keeling was also to be honored in France as an \"officier d' Académie\". The scholar's obituary in \"The Times\" noted that although philosophy was his \"consuming passion from early adolescence\" Keeling \"found a second love in the wine and food and conversation of France\". And that during his working life \"he returned whenever possible to France, to Provence or to his splendid apartment in... Paris\". (Indeed Richard Wollheim described Keeling as having lived in Paris and come over weekly to deliver his lectures).\n\nIt is recorded in \"\" that, in 1925, Keeling received a letter from Russell in recommendation for a post in philosophy - the online records of the Bertrand Russell Archives at McMasters University clarify that the same is dated 20 December of that year and is not so much a letter but a testimonial. Keeling was awarded a degree of MA with distinction by UCL in 1926. Declining a fellowship at Harvard University, Keeling took up a position as a philosophy lecturer at UCL in 1927 where he was successively appointed as senior lecturer and then reader. University College London would also award Keeling a D. Litt. As was noted in his obituary, Keeling's combination of the \"Docteur ès Lettres\" and \"Doctor Litterarum\" was an \"unusual distinction\". The latter was awarded in 1939 - at the end of the decade during which Keeling had published his most famous scholarly works - and shortly before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nWollheim recalls that A.J. Ayer (who was at UCL as Grote Professor from 1944 until 1959) liked Keeling, and particularly. talking to him in French but that \"the feeling was not reciprocated\". On the announcement of Keeling's decision to retire, Ayer paid for an expensive dinner in his honor but that Keeling \"without waiting for Freddie's panegyric, announced to us all that he had been chased out of philosophy by some new wave, of which 'you' he said pointing at Freddie, 'are a major agent—no', he went on, 'I flatter you, you could never be more than a minor agent'\". Ayer, Wollhein reports, was amused: \"'What a rogue' he used to say afterwards—'rogue' being quite a term of endearment which he applied to most of his older philosophical colleagues in the other London colleges\".\n\nThe \"Times\" obituary report's that Keeling's \"thirst for depth and precision\" could be satisfied \"only precariously among his philosophical colleagues at London\". But that he had found \"some relief\" whilst employed at UCL through the conversations he had had with Émile Meyerson, Leon Robin and Etienne Gilson during his frequent returns to France. (The latter of which he had described in \"Descartes\" as a \"prince among Cartesian scholars\".) Keeling retired in 1954 to Paris with his wife and died there on 28 November 1979.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44340", "title": "Steven Pinker", "text": "Steven Pinker\n\nSteven Arthur Pinker (born September 18, 1954) is a Canadian-American cognitive psychologist, linguist, and popular science author. He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, and is known for his advocacy of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind.\n\nPinker's academic specializations are visual cognition and psycholinguistics. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and grammar, and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including euphemism, innuendo, emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with Alan Prince published in 1989 critiqued the connectionist model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding \"-ed\" to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.\n\nIn his popular books, he has argued that the human faculty for language is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of eight books for a general audience. Five of these, \"The Language Instinct\" (1994), \"How the Mind Works\" (1997), \"Words and Rules\" (2000), \"The Blank Slate\" (2002), and \"The Stuff of Thought\" (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\" (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline.\n\nHis seventh book, \"The Sense of Style\" (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand. His eighth book, \"Enlightenment Now\" (2018), continues the optimistic thesis of \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\" by using social science data from various sources to argue for a general improvement of the human condition over recent history.\n\nPinker has been named as one of the world's most influential intellectuals by various magazines. He has won awards from the American Psychological Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Institution, the Cognitive Neuroscience Society and the American Humanist Association. He delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 2013. He has served on the editorial boards of a variety of journals, and on the advisory boards of several institutions. He has frequently participated in public debates on science and society.\n\nPinker was born in Montreal, Quebec, in 1954, to a middle-class Jewish family. His parents were Roslyn (Wiesenfeld) and Harry Pinker. His grandparents emigrated to Canada from Poland and Romania in 1926, and owned a small necktie factory in Montreal. His father, a lawyer, first worked as a manufacturer's representative, while his mother was first a home-maker then a guidance counselor and high-school vice-principal. He has two younger siblings. His brother Robert is a policy analyst for the Canadian government, while his sister, Susan Pinker, is a psychologist and writer who authored \"The Sexual Paradox\" and \"The Village Effect\".\n\nPinker married Nancy Etcoff in 1980 and they divorced in 1992; he married Ilavenil Subbiah in 1995 and they too divorced. His third wife, whom he married in 2007, is the novelist and philosopher Rebecca Goldstein. He has two stepdaughters: the novelist Yael Goldstein Love and the poet Danielle Blau.\n\nPinker graduated from Dawson College in 1973. He received a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from McGill University in 1976, and earned his Doctorate of Philosophy in experimental psychology at Harvard University in 1979 under Stephen Kosslyn. He did research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a year, after which he became an assistant professor at Harvard and then Stanford University.\n\nFrom 1982 until 2003, Pinker taught at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, was the co-director of the Center for Cognitive science (1985–1994), and eventually became the director of the Center for Cognitive neuroscience (1994–1999), taking a one-year sabbatical at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1995–96. As of 2003, he is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard; from 2008 to 2013 he also held the title of Harvard College Professor in recognition of his dedication to teaching. He currently gives lectures as a visiting professor at the New College of the Humanities, a private college in London.\n\nAbout his Jewish background Pinker has said, \"I was never religious in the theological sense ... I never outgrew my conversion to atheism at 13, but at various times was a serious cultural Jew.\" As a teenager, he says he considered himself an anarchist until he witnessed civil unrest following a police strike in 1969, when:\n\nPinker identifies himself as an equity feminist, which he defines as \"a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology\". He reported the result of a test of his political orientation that characterized him as \"neither leftist nor rightist, more libertarian than authoritarian.\" He describes himself as having \"experienced a primitive tribal stirring\" after his genes were shown to trace back to the Middle East, noting that he \"found it just as thrilling to zoom outward in the diagrams of my genetic lineage and see my place in a family tree that embraces all of humanity\".\n\nPinker also identifies himself as an atheist. In the 2007 interview with the Point of Inquiry podcast, Pinker states that he would \"defend atheism as an empirically supported view.\" He sees theism and atheism as competing empirical hypotheses, and states that \"we're learning more and more about what makes us tick, including our moral sense, without needing the assumption of a deity or a soul. It's naturally getting crowded out by the successive naturalistic explanations.\"\n\nPinker's research on visual cognition, begun in collaboration with his thesis adviser, Stephen Kosslyn, showed that mental images represent scenes and objects as they appear from a specific vantage point (rather than capturing their intrinsic three-dimensional structure), and thus correspond to the neuroscientist David Marr's theory of a \"two-and-a-half-dimensional sketch.\" He also showed that this level of representation is used in visual attention, and in object recognition (at least for asymmetrical shapes), contrary to Marr's theory that recognition uses viewpoint-independent representations.\n\nIn psycholinguistics, Pinker became known early in his career for promoting computational learning theory as a way to understand language acquisition in children. He wrote a tutorial review of the field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition, and a series of experiments on how children acquire the passive, dative, and locative constructions. These books were\n\"Language Learnability and Language Development\" (1984), in Pinker's words \"outlin[ing] a theory of how children acquire the words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue\", and \"Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure\" (1989), in Pinker's words \"focus[ing] on one aspect of this process, the ability to use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different combinations of complements and indirect objects\". He then focused on verbs of two kinds that illustrate what he considers to be the processes required for human language: retrieving whole words from memory, like the past form of the irregular verb \"bring\", namely \"brought\"; and using rules to combine (parts of) words, like the past form of the regular verb \"walk\", namely \"walked\".\n\nIn 1988 Pinker and Alan Prince published an influential critique of a connectionist model of the acquisition of the past tense (a textbook problem in language acquisition), followed by a series of studies of how people use and acquire the past tense. This included a monograph on children's regularization of irregular forms and his popular 1999 book, \"Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language\". Pinker argued that language depends on two things, the associative remembering of sounds and their meanings in words, and the use of rules to manipulate symbols for grammar. He presented evidence against connectionism, where a child would have to learn all forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory, in favour of the older alternative theory, the use of words and rules combined by generative phonology. He showed that mistakes made by children indicate the use of default rules to add suffixes such as \"-ed\": for instance 'breaked' and 'comed' for 'broke' and 'came'. He argued that this shows that irregular verb-forms in English have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually, and that the children making these errors were predicting the regular \"-ed\" ending in an open-ended way by applying a mental rule. This rule for combining verb stems and the usual suffix can be expressed as\n\nwhere V is a verb and d is the regular ending. Pinker further argued that since the ten most frequently occurring English verbs (be, have, do, say, make ... ) are all irregular, while 98.2% of the thousand least common verbs are regular, there is a \"massive correlation\" of frequency and irregularity. He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as 'took', 'came' and 'got', has to be committed to memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized. Any irregular verb that falls in popularity past a certain point is lost, and all future generations will treat it as a regular verb instead.\n\nIn 1990, Pinker, with Paul Bloom, published the paper \"Natural Language and Natural Selection\", arguing that the human language faculty must have evolved through natural selection. The article provided arguments for a continuity based view of language evolution, contrary to then current discontinuity based theories that see language as suddenly appearing with the advent of \"Homo sapiens\" as a kind of evolutionary accident. This discontinuity based view was prominently argued by two of the main authorities, linguist Noam Chomsky and Stephen Jay Gould. The paper became widely cited and created renewed interest in the evolutionary prehistory of language, and has been credited with shifting the central question of the debate from \"did language evolve?\" to \"how did language evolve\". The article also presaged Pinker's argument in \"The Language Instinct\".\n\nPinker's research includes delving into human nature and what science says about it. In his interview on the Point of Inquiry podcast in 2007, he provides the following examples of what he considers defensible conclusions of what science says human nature is:\n\n\nHe informs the listeners that one can read more about human nature in his book, \"Blank Slate\".\n\nPinker also speaks about evolutionary psychology in the podcast and believes that this area of science is going to pay off. He cites the fact that there are many areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied.\n\nPinker's 1994 \"The Language Instinct\" was the first of several books to combine cognitive science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.\n\nPinker states in his introduction that his ideas are \"deeply influenced\" by Chomsky; he also lists scientists whom Chomsky influenced to \"open up whole new areas of language study, from child development and speech perception to neurology and genetics\" — Eric Lenneberg, George Miller, Roger Brown, Morris Halle and Alvin Liberman. Brown mentored Pinker through his thesis; Pinker stated that Brown's \"funny and instructive\" book \"Words and Things\" (1958) was one of the inspirations for \"The Language Instinct\".\n\nThe reality of Pinker's proposed language instinct, and the related claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by many linguists. One prominent opponent of Pinker's view is Geoffrey Sampson whose 1997 book, \"Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate\" has been described as the \"definitive response\" to Pinker's book. Sampson argues that while it may seem attractive to argue the nature side of the 'nature versus nurture' debate, the nurture side may better support the creativity and nobility of the human mind. Sampson denies there is a language instinct, and argues that children can learn language because people can learn anything. Others have sought a middle ground between Pinker's nativism and Sampson's culturalism.\n\nThe assumptions underlying the nativist view have also been criticised in Jeffrey Elman's \"Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development\", which defends the connectionist approach that Pinker attacked. In his 1996 book \"Impossible Minds\", the machine intelligence researcher Igor Aleksander calls \"The Language Instinct\" excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the 'Standard Social Sciences Model' or SSSM (Pinker's term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn't support the SSSM, \"a cultural repository of language just seems the easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic state machine to play.\"\n\nTwo other books, \"How the Mind Works\" (1997) and \"The Blank Slate\" (2002), broadly surveyed the mind and defended the idea of a complex human nature with many mental faculties that are adaptive (Pinker is an ally of Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins in many disputes surrounding adaptationism). Another major theme in Pinker's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models. On the debate around \"The Blank Slate\", Pinker called Thomas Sowell's book \"A Conflict of Visions\" \"wonderful\", and explained that \"The Tragic Vision\" and the \"Utopian Vision\" are the views of human nature behind right- and left-wing ideologies.\n\nIn \"Words and Rules: the Ingredients of Language\" (1999), Pinker argues from his own research that regular and irregular phenomena are products of computation and memory lookup, respectively, and that language can be understood as an interaction between the two. \"Words and Rules\" is also the title of an essay by Pinker outlining many of the topics discussed in the book. Critiqueing the book from the perspective of generative linguistics Charles Yang, in the \"London Review of Books\", writes that \"this book never runs low on hubris or hyperbole\". The book's topic, the English past tense, is in Yang's view unglamorous, and Pinker's attempts at compromise risk being in no man's land between rival theories. Giving the example of German, Yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes, governed by rules, and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long 'words': they can't be learnt individually, as there are untold numbers of combinations. \"All Pinker (and the connectionists) are doing is turning over the rocks at the base of the intellectual landslide caused by the Chomskian revolution.\"\n\nIn \"The Stuff of Thought\" (2007), Pinker looks at a wide range of issues around the way words related to thoughts on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.\n\nPinker is critical of theories about the evolutionary origins of language that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a spandrel — a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In \"How the Mind Works\", Pinker reiterates Immanuel Kant's view that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to \"auditory cheesecake\", stating that \"As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless\". This argument has been rejected by Daniel Levitin and Joseph Carroll, experts in music cognition, who argue that music has had an important role in the evolution of human cognition. In his book \"This Is Your Brain On Music\", Levitin argues that music could provide adaptive advantage through sexual selection, social bonding, and cognitive development; he questions the assumption that music is the antecedent to language, as opposed to its progenitor, noting that many species display music-like habits that could be seen as precursors to human music.\n\nPinker has also been critical of \"whole language\" reading instruction techniques, stating in \"How the Mind Works\", \"...the dominant technique, called 'whole language,' the insight that [spoken] language is a naturally developing human instinct has been garbled into the evolutionarily improbable claim that \"reading\" is a naturally developing human instinct.\" In the appendix to the 2007 reprinted edition of \"The Language Instinct\", Pinker cited \"Why Our Children Can't Read\" by cognitive psychologist Diane McGuinness as his favorite book on the subject and noted:\n\nOne raging public debate involving language went unmentioned in \"The Language Instinct\": the \"reading wars,\" or dispute over whether children should be explicitly taught to read by decoding the sounds of words from their spelling (loosely known as \"phonics\") or whether they can develop it instinctively by being immersed in a text-rich environment (often called \"whole language\"). I tipped my hand in the paragraph in [the sixth chapter of the book] which said that language is an instinct but reading is not. Like most psycholinguists (but apparently unlike many school boards), I think it's essential for children to be taught to become aware of speech sounds and how they are coded in strings of letters.\n\nIn \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\", published in 2011, Pinker argues that violence, including tribal warfare, homicide, cruel punishments, child abuse, animal cruelty, domestic violence, lynching, pogroms, and international and civil wars, has decreased over multiple scales of time and magnitude. Pinker considers it unlikely that human nature has changed. In his view, it is more likely that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and those that counteract them, the \"better angels of our nature\". He outlines six 'major historical declines of violence' that all have their own socio/cultural/economic causes:<ref name=\"http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence\"></ref>\n\n\nThe book was welcomed by many critics and reviewers, who found its arguments convincing and its synthesis of a large volume of historical evidence compelling. It also aroused criticism on a variety of grounds, such as whether deaths per capita was an appropriate metric, Pinker's atheism, lack of moral leadership, excessive focus on Europe (though the book covers other areas), the interpretation of historical data, and its image of indigenous people.\n\nIn his seventh popular book, \"The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century\" (2014), Pinker attempts to provide a writing style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.\n\nIn a November 2014 episode of the Point of Inquiry podcast, host Lindsay Beyerstein, asked Pinker how his style guide was different from the many guides that already exist. His answer,\n\nHe also indicated that the 21st century was applicable because language and usage change over time and it has been a long time since William Strunk wrote \"Elements of Style\".\n\nPinker is a frequent participant in public debates surrounding the contributions of science to contemporary society. Social commentators such as Ed West, author of \"The Diversity Illusion\", consider Pinker important and daring in his willingness to confront taboos, as in \"The Blank Slate\". This doctrine (the \"tabula rasa\"), writes West, remained accepted \"as fact, rather than fantasy\" a decade after the book's publication. West describes Pinker as \"no polemicist, and he leaves readers to draw their own conclusions\".\n\nIn January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, president of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap in mathematics and science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such hypotheses ought to be the subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.\n\nIn 2009, Pinker wrote a mixed review of Malcolm Gladwell's essays in \"The New York Times\" criticizing his analytical methods. Gladwell replied, disputing Pinker's comments about the importance of IQ on teaching performance and by analogy, the effect, if any, of draft order on quarterback performance in the National Football League. Advanced NFL Stats addressed the issue statistically, siding with Pinker and showing that differences in methodology could explain the two men's differing opinions.\n\nIn 2009, David Shenk criticized Pinker for siding with the \"nature\" argument and for \"never once acknowledg[ing] gene-environment interaction or epigenetics\" in an article on nature versus nurture in \"The New York Times\". Pinker responded to a question about epigenetics as a possibility for the decline in violence in a lecture for the BBC World Service. Pinker said it was unlikely since the decline in violence happened too rapidly to be explained by genetic changes. Helga Vierich and Cathryn Townsend wrote a critical review of Pinker's sweeping \"Civilizational\" explanations for patterns of human violence and warfare in response to a lecture he gave at Cambridge University in September 2015.\n\nSteven Pinker is also noted for having identified the rename of Phillip Morris to Altria as an \"egregious example\" of phonesthesia, with the company attempting to \"switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values\".\n\nPinker continued to court controversy through his 2018 book \"Enlightenment Now\", in which he argues that enlightenment rationality has driven tremendous progress and should be defended against attacks from both the left and right. \"The\" \"Guardian\" criticized the book as a \"triumphalist\" work that has a \"curious relationship to intellectual history\" and overestimates the role of campus activists in mainstream discourse. While promoting the book on the NPR show 1A, Pinker caused a minor social media backlash when he said that \"I don't think Malcolm X did the world much good.\"\n\nPinker was named one of \"Time's\" 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and one of \"Prospect\" and \"Foreign Policy\"s 100 top public intellectuals in both years the poll was carried out, 2005 and 2008; in 2010 and 2011 he was named by \"Foreign Policy\" to its list of top global thinkers. In 2016, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHis research in cognitive psychology has won the Early Career Award (1984) and Boyd McCandless Award (1986) from the American Psychological Association, the Troland Research Award (1993) from the National Academy of Sciences, the Henry Dale Prize (2004) from the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and the George Miller Prize (2010) from the Cognitive Neuroscience Society. He has also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Newcastle, Surrey, Tel Aviv, McGill, Simon Fraser University and the University of Tromsø. He was twice a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, in 1998 and in 2003. On May 13, 2006, he received the American Humanist Association's Humanist of the Year award for his contributions to public understanding of human evolution.\n\nPinker has served on the editorial boards of journals such as Cognition, Daedalus, and PLOS One, and on the advisory boards of institutions for scientific research (e.g., the Allen Institute for Brain Science), free speech (e.g., the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education), the popularization of science (e.g., the World Science Festival and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry), peace (e.g., the Peace Research Endowment), and secular humanism (e.g., the Freedom from Religion Foundation and the Secular Coalition for America).\n\nSince 2008, he has chaired the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and wrote the essay on usage for the fifth edition of the Dictionary, which was published in 2011.\n\nIn February 2001 Steven Pinker, \"whose hair has long been the object of admiration, and envy, and intense study\", was nominated by acclamation as the first member of the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists (LFHCfS) organized by the \"Annals of Improbable Research\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3047155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3047155", "title": "Summa Theologica", "text": "Summa Theologica\n\nThe Summa Theologiae (written 1265–1274 and also known as the Summa Theologica or simply the Summa) is the best-known work of Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274). Although unfinished, the \"Summa\" is \"one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature\". It is intended as an instructional guide for theology students, including seminarians and the literate laity. It is a compendium of all of the main theological teachings of the Catholic Church. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The \"Summa\"'s topics follow a cycle: God; Creation, Man; Man's purpose; Christ; the Sacraments; and back to God.\n\nThe \"Summa\" is Aquinas' \"most perfect work, the fruit of his mature years, in which the thought of his whole life is condensed\". Among non-scholars, the \"Summa\" is perhaps most famous for its five arguments for the existence of God, which are known as the \"five ways\" (). The five ways, however, occupy only one of the \"Summa\"'s 3,125 articles.\n\nThroughout the \"Summa\", Aquinas cites Christian, Muslim, Hebrew, and Pagan sources including but not limited to Christian Sacred Scripture, Aristotle, Augustine of Hippo, Avicenna, Averroes, Al-Ghazali, Boethius, John of Damascus, Paul the Apostle, Dionysius the Areopagite, Maimonides, Anselm, Plato, Cicero, and Eriugena.\n\nThe \"Summa\" is a more structured and expanded version of Aquinas's earlier \"Summa contra Gentiles\". These works were written for different purposes, the \"Summa Theologiae\" to explain the Christian faith to beginning theology students, and the \"Summa contra Gentiles\" to explain the Christian faith and defend it in hostile situations, with arguments adapted to the intended circumstances of its use, each article refuting a certain belief or a specific heresy.\n\nAquinas conceived the \"Summa\" specifically as a work suited to beginning students: \"Because a doctor of catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners. As the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 3: 1–2, \"as to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat\", our proposed intention in this work is to convey those things that pertain to the Christian religion, in a way that is fitting to the instruction of beginners.\"\n\nIt was while teaching at the Santa Sabina \"studium provinciale\", the forerunner of the Santa Maria sopra Minerva \"studium generale\" and College of Saint Thomas, which in the 20th century would become the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\", that Aquinas began to compose the \"Summa\". He completed the \"Prima Pars\" (first part) in its entirety and circulated it in Italy before departing to take up his second regency as professor at the University of Paris (1269–1272).\n\nNot only has the \"Summa Theologiae\" been one of the main intellectual inspirations for Thomistic philosophy, but it also had such a great influence on Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy,\" that Dante's epic poem has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse.\"\nEven today, both in Western and Eastern Catholic Churches, Orthodoxy, and the mainstream original Protestant denominations (Anglicanism and Episcopalianism, Lutheranism, Methodism, and Presbyterianism), it is very common for the Summa Theologiae to be required or strongly urged reading, in whole or in part, for all those seeking ordination to the diaconate or priesthood, or to professed male or female religious life, or for laypersons studying philosophy and theology at the collegiate level.\n\nThe \"Summa\" is structured into three Parts which are subdivided into 614 Questions or \"QQ\". Questions, in turn, are subdivided into 3,125 Articles. \"Questions\" are specific topics of discussion, while their articles are even more specific questions, facets of the parent question. For example, Part I, Question 2, \"The Existence of God\" is divided into three articles: \"Whether the existence of God is self-evident?\", \"Whether it can be demonstrated that God exists?\", and \"Whether God exists?\" Additionally, questions on a broader theme are grouped into Treatises, though the category of treatise is reported differently, depending on the source.\n\nThe \"Summa's\" three parts have a few other major subdivisions.\n\n\nThe \"Summa\" has a standard format for each article, which can be explained by taking another article (Pt. III, Q. 40, Art. 3) as an example: \"Whether Christ should have led a life of poverty in this world?\", a facet of the larger question \"Of Christ's Manner of Life.\" \n\n\nThis method of exposition is derived from Averroes, to whom Aquinas refers respectfully as \"the Commentator\".\n\nThe \"Summa\" makes many references to certain thinkers held in great respect in Aquinas's time. The arguments from authority, or \"sed contra\" arguments, are almost entirely based on citations from these authors. Some were called by special names:\n\n\nThe structure of the \"Summa Theologiae\" is meant to reflect the cyclic nature of the cosmos, in the sense of the emission and return of the Many from and to the One in Platonism, cast in terms of Christian theology: The procession of the material universe from divine essence, the culmination of creation in man, and the motion of man back towards God by way of Christ and the Sacraments.\n\nThe structure of the work reflects this cyclic arrangement. It begins with God and his existence in Question 2. The entire first part of the \"Summa\" deals with God and his creation, which reaches its zenith in man. The First Part, therefore, ends with the treatise on man.\n\nThe second part of the \"Summa\" deals with man's purpose (the meaning of life), which is happiness. The ethics detailed in this part are a summary of the ethics (Aristotelian in nature) that man must follow to reach his intended destiny.\n\nSince no man on his own can truly live the perfect ethical life (and therefore reach God), it was necessary that a perfect man bridge the gap between God and man. Thus God became man. The third part of the \"Summa\", therefore, deals with the life of Christ.\n\nIn order to follow the way prescribed by this perfect man, in order to live with God's grace (which is necessary for man's salvation), the Sacraments have been provided; the final part of the \"Summa\" considers the Sacraments.\n\nThe following is from the \"New Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge\" (a public-domain work):\n\nSt. Thomas's greatest work was the \"Summa\", and it is the fullest presentation of his views. He worked on it from the time of Clement IV (after 1265) until the end of his life. When he died, he had reached Question 90 of Part III (on the subject of penance). What was lacking was added afterwards from the fourth book of his commentary on the \"Sentences\" of Peter Lombard as a \"supplementum\", which is not found in manuscripts of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The \"Summa\" was translated into Greek (apparently by Maximus Planudes around 1327), Armenian, many European languages, and Chinese.\n\nIt consists of three parts. Part I treats of God, who is the \"first cause, himself uncaused\" (\"primum movens immobile\") and as such existent only in act (\"actu\") – that is, pure actuality without potentiality, and therefore without corporeality. His essence is \"actus purus et perfectus\". This follows from the fivefold proof for the existence of God; namely, there must be a first mover, unmoved, a first cause in the chain of causes, an absolutely necessary being, an absolutely perfect being, and a rational designer. In this connection the thoughts of the unity, infinity, unchangeability, and goodness of the highest being are deduced.\n\nAs God rules in the world, the \"plan of the order of things\" preexists in him; in other words, his providence and the exercise of it in his government are what condition as cause everything which comes to pass in the world. Hence follows predestination: from eternity some are destined to eternal life, while as concerns others \"he permits some to fall short of that end\". Reprobation, however, is more than mere foreknowledge; it is the \"will of permitting anyone to fall into sin and incur the penalty of condemnation for sin\". \n\nThe effect of predestination is grace. Since God is the first cause of everything, he is the cause of even the free acts of men through predestination. Determinism is deeply grounded in the system of St. Thomas; things (with their source of becoming in God) are ordered from eternity as means for the realization of his end in himself. \n\nOn moral grounds, St. Thomas advocates freedom energetically; but, with his premises, he can have in mind only the psychological form of self-motivation. Nothing in the world is accidental or free, although it may appear so in reference to the proximate cause. From this point of view, miracles become necessary in themselves and are to be considered merely as inexplicable to man. From the point of view of the first cause, all is unchangeable, although from the limited point of view of the secondary cause, miracles may be spoken of.\n\nIn his doctrine of the Trinity, Aquinas starts from the Augustinian system. Since God has only the functions of thinking and willing, only two \"processiones\" can be asserted from the Father; but these establish definite relations of the persons of the Trinity, one to another. The relations must be conceived as real and not as merely ideal; for, as with creatures relations arise through certain accidents, since in God there is no accident but all is substance, it follows that \"the relation really existing in God is the same as the essence according to the thing\". From another side, however, the relations as real must be really distinguished one from another. Therefore, three persons are to be affirmed in God.\n\nMan stands opposite to God; he consists of soul and body. The \"intellectual soul\" consists of intellect and will. Furthermore, the soul is the absolutely indivisible form of man; it is immaterial substance, but not one and the same in all men (as the Averroists assumed). The soul's power of knowing has two sides: a passive (the \"intellectus possibilis\") and an active (the \"intellectus agens\"). \n\nIt is the capacity to form concepts and to abstract the mind's images (\"species\") from the objects perceived by sense; but since what the intellect abstracts from individual things is universal, the mind knows the universal primarily and directly and knows the singular only indirectly by virtue of a certain \"reflexio\" (compare Scholasticism). As certain principles are immanent in the mind for its speculative activity, so also a \"special disposition of works\" – or the \"synderesis\" (rudiment of conscience) – is inborn in the \"practical reason\", affording the idea of the moral law of nature so important in medieval ethics.\n\nPart II of the \"Summa\" is divided into two parts. The first part comprises 114 \"quaestiones\", and the second part comprises 189. The two parts of the second part are usually presented as containing several \"treatises\". The contents are as follows:\n\nThe first part of the \"Summa\" is summed up in the premise that God governs the world as the \"universal first cause\". God sways the intellect; he gives the power to know and impresses the \"species intelligibiles\" on the mind, and he sways the will in that he holds the good before it as aim, creating the \"virtus volendi\". \"To will is nothing else than a certain inclination toward the object of the volition which is the universal good.\" God works all in all, but so that things also themselves exert their proper efficiency. Here the Areopagitic ideas of the graduated effects of created things play their part in St. Thomas's thought. The second part of the \"Summa\" (two parts, \"Prima Secundae\" and \"Secunda Secundae\") follows this complex of ideas. Its theme is man's striving for the highest end, which is the blessedness of the \"visio beata\". Here, St. Thomas develops his system of ethics, which has its root in Aristotle.\n\nIn a chain of acts of will, man strives for the highest end. They are free acts, insofar as man has in himself the knowledge of their end (and therein the principle of action). In that the will wills the end, it wills also the appropriate means, chooses freely and completes the \"consensus\". Whether the act is good or evil depends on the end. The \"human reason\" pronounces judgment concerning the character of the end; it is, therefore, the law for action. Human acts, however, are meritorious insofar as they promote the purpose of God and his honor.\n\nBy repeating a good action, man acquires a moral habit or a quality that enables him to do the good gladly and easily. This is true, however, only of the intellectual and moral virtues (which St. Thomas treats after the manner of Aristotle); the theological virtues are imparted by God to man as a \"disposition\", from which the acts here proceed; while they strengthen, they do not form it. The \"disposition\" of evil is the opposite alternative. An act becomes evil through deviation from the reason and from divine moral law. Therefore, sin involves two factors: its substance (or matter) is lust; in form, however, it is deviation from the divine law.\n\nSin has its origin in the will, which decides (against reason) for a \"changeable good\". Since, however, the will also moves the other powers of man, sin has its seat in these too. By choosing such a lower good as its end, the will is misled by self-love, so that this works as cause in every sin. God is not the cause of sin since, on the contrary, he draws all things to himself; but from another side, God is the cause of all things, so he is efficacious also in sin as \"actio\" but not as \"ens.\" The devil is not directly the cause of sin, but he incites the imagination and the sensuous impulse of man (as men or things may also do).\n\nSin is original sin. Adam's first sin passes through himself to all the succeeding race; because he is the head of the human race and \"by virtue of procreation human nature is transmitted and along with nature its infection.\" The powers of generation are, therefore, designated especially as \"infected\". The thought is involved here by the fact that St. Thomas, like other scholastics, believed in creationism; he therefore taught that souls are created by God. \n\nTwo things, according to St. Thomas, constituted man's righteousness in paradise – the \"justitia originalis\", or the harmony of all man's powers before they were blighted by desire, and the possession of the \"gratis gratum faciens\" (the continuous, indwelling power of good). Both are lost through original sin, which, in form, is the \"loss of original righteousness.\" The consequence of this loss is the disorder and maiming of man's nature, which shows itself in \"ignorance; malice, moral weakness, and especially in \"concupiscentia, \"which is the material principle of original sin.\" \n\nThe course of thought here is as follows: when the first man transgressed the order of his nature appointed by nature and grace, he (and with him the human race) lost this order. This negative state is the essence of original sin. From it follow an impairment and perversion of human nature in which thenceforth lower aims rule, contrary to nature, and release the lower element in man.\n\nSince sin is contrary to the divine order, it is guilt and subject to punishment. Guilt and punishment correspond to each other; and since the \"apostasy from the invariable good which is infinite,\" fulfilled by man, is unending, it merits everlasting punishment.\n\nGod works even in sinners to draw them to the end by \"instructing through the law and aiding by grace.\" The law is the \"precept of the practical reason.\" As the moral law of nature, it is the participation of the reason in the all-determining \"eternal reason\"; but since man falls short in his appropriation of this law of reason, there is need of a \"divine law\"; and since the law applies to many complicated relations, the \"practicae dispositiones\" of the human law must be laid down.\n\nThe divine law consists of an old and a new. Insofar as the old divine law contains the moral law of nature, it is universally valid; what there is in it, however, beyond this is valid only for the Jews. The new law is \"primarily grace itself\" and so a \"law given within\"; \"a gift superadded to nature by grace,\" but not a \"written law.\" In this sense, as sacramental grace, the new law justifies. It contains, however, an \"ordering\" of external and internal conduct and so regarded is, as a matter of course, identical with both the old law and the law of nature. The \"consilia \"show how one may attain the end \"better and more expediently\" by full renunciation of worldly goods.\n\nSince man is sinner and creature, he needs grace to reach the final end. The \"first cause\" alone is able to reclaim him to the \"final end.\" This is true after the fall, although it was needful before. Grace is, on one side, \"the free act of God\", and, on the other side, the effect of this act, the \"gratia infusa\" or \"gratia creata,\" a \"habitus infusus\" that is instilled into the \"essence of the soul,\" \"a certain gift of disposition, something supernatural proceeding from God into man.\" Grace is a supernatural ethical character created in man by God, which comprises in itself all good, both faith and love.\n\nJustification by grace comprises four elements: \"the infusion of grace, the influencing of free will toward God through faith, the influencing of free will respecting sin, and the remission of sins.\" It is a \"transmutation of the human soul,\" and takes place \"instantaneously\". A creative act of God enters, which, however, executes itself as a spiritual motive in a psychological form corresponding to the nature of man. Semipelagian tendencies are far removed from St. Thomas. In that man is created anew, he believes and loves, and now, sin is forgiven. Then begins good conduct; grace is the \"beginning of meritorious works.\" Aquinas conceives of merit in the Augustinian sense: God gives the reward for that toward which he himself gives the power. Man can never of himself deserve the \"prima gratis\",\" nor \"meritum de congruo\" (by natural ability; cf. R. Seeberg, \"Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte\", ii. 105–106, Leipsic, 1898).\n\nAfter thus stating the principles of morality, in the \"Secunda Secundae,\" St. Thomas comes to a minute exposition of his ethics according to the scheme of the virtues. The conceptions of faith and love are of much significance in the complete system of St. Thomas. Man strives toward the highest good with the will or through love; but since the end must first be \"apprehended in the intellect,\" knowledge of the end to be loved must precede love; \"because the will can not strive after God in perfect love unless the intellect have true faith toward him.\" \n\nInasmuch as this truth that is to be known is practical, it first incites the will, which then brings the reason to \"assent\"; but since, furthermore, the good in question is transcendent and inaccessible to man by himself, it requires the infusion of a supernatural \"capacity\" or \"disposition\" to make man capable of faith as well as love. \n\nAccordingly, the object of both faith and love is God, involving also the entire complex of truths and commandments that God reveals, insofar as they in fact relate to God and lead to him. Thus, faith becomes recognition of the teachings and precepts of the Scriptures and the Church (\"the first subjection of man to God is by faith\"). The object of faith, however, is, by its nature, object of love; therefore, faith comes to completion only in love (\"by love is the act of faith accomplished and formed\").\n\nAccording to Question 90, Article Four of the Second Part of the \"Summa\", law \"is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated.\" All law comes from the eternal law of Divine Reason that governs the universe, which is understood and participated in by rational beings (such as men and angels) as the natural law. The natural law, when codified and promulgated, is the human law. \n\nIn addition to the human law, dictated by reason, man also has the divine law, which, according to Question 91, is dictated through revelation, that man may be \"directed how to perform his proper acts in view of his last end,\" \"that man may know without any doubt what he ought to do and what he ought to avoid,\" because \"human law could not sufficiently curb and direct interior acts,\" and since \"human law cannot punish or forbid all evil deeds: since while aiming at doing away with all evils, it would do away with many good things, and would hinder the advance of the common good, which is necessary for human intercourse.\" Human law is not all-powerful; it cannot govern a man's conscience, nor prohibit all vices, nor can it force all men to act according to its letter, rather than its spirit. \n\nFurthermore, it is possible that an edict can be issued without any basis in law as defined in Question 90; in this case, men are under no compulsion to act, save as it helps the common good. This separation between law and acts of force also allows men to depose tyrants, or those who flout the natural law; while removing an agent of the law is contrary to the common good and the eternal law of God, which orders the powers that be, removing a tyrant is lawful as he has ceded his claim to being a lawful authority by acting contrary to law.\n\nThe way which leads to God is Christ, the theme of Part III. It can be asserted that the incarnation was absolutely necessary. The \"Unio\" between the Logos and the human nature is a \"relation\" between the divine and the human nature, which comes about by both natures being brought together in the one person of the Logos. An incarnation can be spoken of only in the sense that the human nature began to be in the eternal hypostasis of the divine nature. So Christ is \"unum\" since his human nature lacks the hypostasis. \n\nThe person of the Logos, accordingly, has assumed the impersonal human nature, and in such way that the assumption of the soul became the means for the assumption of the body. This union with the human soul is the \"gratia unionis\", which leads to the impartation of the \"gratia habitualis\" from the Logos to the human nature. Thereby, all human potentialities are made perfect in Jesus. Besides the perfections given by the vision of God, which Jesus enjoyed from the beginning, he receives all others by the \"gratia habitualis\". Insofar, however, as it is the limited human nature which receives these perfections, they are finite. This holds both of the knowledge and the will of Christ. \n\nThe Logos impresses the \"species intelligibiles\" of all created things on the soul, but the \"intellectus agens\" transforms them gradually into the impressions of sense. On another side, the soul of Christ works miracles only as instrument of the Logos, since omnipotence in no way appertains to this human soul in itself. Concerning redemption, St. Thomas teaches that Christ is to be regarded as redeemer after his human nature but in such way that the human nature produces divine effects as organ of divinity. \n\nThe one side of the work of redemption consists herein, that Christ as head of humanity imparts \"ordo\", \"perfectio\", and \"virtus\" to his members. He is the teacher and example of humanity; his whole life and suffering as well as his work after he is exalted serve this end. The love wrought hereby in men effects, according to Luke vii. 47, the forgiveness of sins.\n\nThis is the first course of thought. Then follows a second complex of thoughts, which has the idea of satisfaction as its center. To be sure, God as the highest being could forgive sins without satisfaction; but because his justice and mercy could be best revealed through satisfaction, he chose this way. As little, however, as satisfaction is necessary in itself, so little does it offer an equivalent, in a correct sense, for guilt; it is rather a \"superabundant satisfaction\", since on account of the divine subject in Christ in a certain sense his suffering and activity are infinite. \n\nWith this thought, the strict logical deduction of Anselm's theory is given up. Christ's suffering bore personal character in that it proceeded \"out of love and obedience\". It was an offering brought to God, which as a personal act had the character of merit. Thereby, Christ \"merited\" salvation for men. As Christ, exalted, still influences men, so does he still work on their behalf continually in heaven through the intercession (\"interpellatio\"). \n\nIn this way, Christ as head of humanity effects the forgiveness of their sins, their reconciliation with God, their immunity from punishment, deliverance from the devil, and the opening of heaven's gate; but inasmuch as all these benefits are already offered through the inner operation of the love of Christ, Aquinas has combined the theories of Anselm and Abelard by joining the one to the other.\n\nThe doctrine of the sacraments follows the Christology; the sacraments \"have efficacy from the incarnate Word himself\". They are not only signs of sanctification, but also bring it about. It is inevitable that they bring spiritual gifts in sensuous form, because of the sensuous nature of man. The \"res sensibiles\" are the matter, the words of institution the form of the sacraments. Contrary to the Franciscan view that the sacraments are mere symbols whose efficacy God accompanies with a directly following creative act in the soul, St. Thomas holds it not unfit to agree with Hugo of St. Victor that \"a sacrament contains grace\", or to teach that they \"cause grace\".\n\nSt. Thomas attempts to remove the difficulty of a sensuous thing... producing a creative effect, by distinguishing between the \"causa principalis et instrumentalis\". God, as the principal cause, works through the sensuous thing as the means ordained by him for his end. \"Just as instrumental power is acquired by the instrument from this, that it is moved by the principal agent, so also the sacrament obtains spiritual power from the benediction of Christ and the application of the minister to the use of the sacrament. \n\nThere is spiritual power in the sacraments in so far as they have been ordained by God for a spiritual effect.\" This spiritual power remains in the sensuous thing until it has attained its purpose. At the same time, St. Thomas distinguished the \"gratia sacramentalis\" from the \"gratia virtutum et donorum\", in that the former perfects the general essence and the powers of the soul, whilst the latter in particular brings to pass necessary spiritual effects for the Christian life. Later, this distinction was ignored.\n\nIn a single statement, the effect of the sacraments is to infuse justifying grace into men. That which Christ effects is achieved through the sacraments. Christ's humanity was the instrument for the operation of his divinity; the sacraments are the instruments through which this operation of Christ's humanity passes over to men. Christ's humanity served his divinity as \"instrumentum conjunctum\", like the hand; the sacraments are \"instrumenta separata\", like a staff; the former can use the latter, as the hand can use a staff. For a more detailed exposition, cf. Seeberg, \"ut sup.\", ii. 112 sqq.\n\nOf St. Thomas's eschatology, according to the commentary on the \"Sentences\", this is only a brief account. Everlasting blessedness consists in the vision of God - this vision consists not in an abstraction or in a mental image supernaturally produced, but the divine substance itself is beheld, and in such manner that God himself becomes immediately the form of the beholding intellect. God is the object of the vision and, at the same time, causes the vision. \n\nThe perfection of the blessed also demands that the body be restored to the soul as something to be made perfect by it. Since blessedness consists in \"operatio, \"it is made more perfect in that the soul has a definite \"operatio\" with the body, although the peculiar act of blessedness (in other words, the vision of God) has nothing to do with the body.\n\nEarly partial editions were printed still in the 15th century, as early as 1463; \nan edition of the first section of part 2 was printed by Peter Schöffer of Mainz in 1471. A full edition was printed by Michael Wenssler of Basel in 1485.\nFrom the 16th century, numerous commentaries on the \"Summa\" were published, notably by Peter Crockaert (d. 1514), Francisco de Vitoria and by Thomas Cajetan (1570).\n\n\nThe most accessible English translation of the work is that originally published by Benziger Brothers, in five volumes, in 1911 (with a revised edition published in 1920). \nThe translation is entirely the work of Laurence Shapcote (1864-1947), an English Dominican friar. Wanting to remain anonymous, however, he attributed the translation to the Fathers of the English Dominican Province. Father Shapcote also translated various of Aquinas's other works.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the husband of author, essayist and political commentator Spomenka Hribar.\n\nHe was born in the small village of Goričica near Ihan in central Slovenia (then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). He studied philosophy and sociology at the University of Ljubljana. He continued his studies at the University of Zagreb under the supervision of Croatian phenomenologist philosopher Vanja Sutlić. In 1971 he started teaching philosophy and sociology at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana. In 1975 he was fired from the University, together with fellow sociologist Veljko Rus, because of his non-Marxist attitudes. In 1981 he co-founded the alternative journal \"Nova revija\".\n\nIn 1987 Hribar was among the editors of the famous \"Contributions to the Slovenian National Program\", published in a special number of the journal \"Nova revija\", in which sixteen authors demanded a democratic and sovereign Slovenia. Between 1989 and 1991 he was an active member of the Slovenian Democratic Union, one of the central parties within the DEMOS coalition that won the first free elections in Slovenia in April 1990. Hribar and Peter Jambrek and France Bučar were the party's main strategists. After the party broke up in 1991, Hribar joined the left liberal Democratic Party, but withdrew from active engagement in politics.\n\nIn 1992 Hribar became a professor at the University of Ljubljana again. In 1995 he became a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nHribar's role in Slovenian public life after 1991 caused controversy. In the early 1990s he warned against the recurrence of clericalism in Slovenia, and was critical of his former coalition partners of the Slovene Christian Democrats, especially the former Prime Minister Lojze Peterle. After 1994 he became a critic of conservative opposition leader Janez Janša, his former party colleague and close collaborator between 1989 and 1991. In the 1990s Hribar supported the ruling centre-left Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. In 2004 however, he turned against the ruling left-wing coalition, accusing it of fostering a \"vulgar type of liberalism\". He co-founded the liberal conservative civic platform Rally for the Republic, which publicly supported the centre-right electoral coalition led by Janez Janša. This sudden and radical turn in Hribar's political affiliation was widely criticized, especially by post-Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek, Hribar's former collaborator from the late 1970s.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2008, Hribar was relatively supportive of the policies of Janša's government, especially the Slovenian Democratic Party, which he had fiercely criticized in the 1990s. He has nevertheless maintained his thoroughly anti-clerical and, to a certain extent, anti-Catholic position.\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections of 2008, which brought the left wing to power in Slovenia, Hribar adopted critical stance towards the Slovenian left, accusing it of abusing power for personal privileges. He maintained a critical, but substantially favourable attitude towards the Slovenian secular right wing parties, especially to the Slovenian Democratic Party and its leader Janez Janša, whom he nevertheless accused of an excessively moralizing political discourse.\n\n\n\n"}

Transcendental arguments may have additional standards of justification that are more demanding than those of traditional deductive arguments.\n\nTypically, a transcendental argument starts from some accepted aspect of experience, and then deduces what must be true for that type of experience to be possible. Transcendental arguments are often used as arguments against skepticism, usually about the reality of the external world or other minds.\n\nSo-called progressive transcendental arguments begin with an apparently indubitable and universally accepted statement about people's experiences of the world, and use this to make substantive knowledge-claims about the world, e.g., that it \"is\" causally and spatiotemporally related. They start with what is left at the \"end\" of the skeptics process of doubting.\n\nRegressive transcendental arguments, on the other hand, \"begin at the same point\" as the skeptic, e.g., the fact that we have experience as of a causal and spatiotemporal world, and show that certain notions are implicit in our conceptions of such experience. Regressive transcendental arguments are more conservative in that they do not purport to make substantive ontological claims about the world.\n\nAn example is used by Kant in his refutation of idealism. Idealists believe that the experience of objects independent of our mind is not legitimate. Briefly, Kant shows that\n\n\nHe has not established that outer objects exist, but only that the concept of them is legitimate, contrary to idealism.\n\nNot all use of transcendental arguments are intended to counter skepticism, however. The Dutch philosopher, Herman Dooyeweerd, used transcendental critique to establish the conditions that make a theoretical attitude of thought (not just the process of thinking, as in Kant) possible. In particular he showed that theoretical thought cannot be neutral, rather, must be based on presuppositions that are \"religious\" in nature (in the sense of pre-theoretical commitment).\n\nIt was Immanuel Kant who gave transcendental arguments their name and notoriety. It is controversial, though, whether his own transcendental arguments should be classified as progressive or regressive.\n\nIn the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781) Kant developed one of philosophy's most famous transcendental arguments in 'The Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding'. In the 'Transcendental Aesthetic', Kant used transcendental arguments to show that sensory experiences would not be possible apart from our contributing to them their spatial and temporal form.\n\nAs stated above, one of the main uses of transcendental arguments is to use one thing we can know, the nature of our experiences, to counter skeptics' arguments that we cannot \"know\" something or other about the nature of the world. One need not be a skeptic about those matters, however, to find transcendental arguments unpersuasive. There are a number of ways that one might deny that a given transcendental argument gives us knowledge of the world. The following responses may suit some versions and not others.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7766414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7766414", "title": "Transcendental perspectivism", "text": "Transcendental perspectivism\n\nTranscendental perspectivism is a hybrid philosophy developed by German-born philosopher, Werner Krieglstein. A blending of Friedrich Nietzsche's perspectivism and the utopian ideals of the transcendentalism movement, transcendental perspectivism challenges Nietzsche's claim that there are no absolute truths while fully accepting his observation that all truth can only be known in the context of one's own perception. This is accomplished through an appreciation of the emotional relationship between two perceptions (the \"perceiver\" and the \"other\").\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche argued that no purely objective science can exist because no ideation or thought can exist outside the influences of an individual perception. The ideation of any single perception is limited not only by the physics of its existence, but also by its own assumptions and beliefs which are formed by the perceiver's unique culture and history. A conclusion of this philosophy is that no absolute (or transcendental) truth can exist because in order to be a transcendental truth it would need to transcend the limits of perception.\n\nFor any given truth, a perceiver must realize it. In any given relationship, that truth can be shared with another perceiver (the \"other\"). In the traditional sense of objective reality, a transcendental truth known by one perceiver would be equally valid for the \"other\", because it transcends each of their unique perceptions. This relationship is unequal in that the transcendental truth is right and the \"other\" is wrong. Knowers of a transcendental truth are then provided with unique authority over the \"other\" which does not know the same truth.\n\nIn Perspectivism, the absence of any transcendental truth leaves the perceiver with truth that is only valid from the perceiver's own perspective. Truth becomes arbitrary and the \"other\" becomes a pawn in the formulations of the perceiver's self-perceived truths. This led Nietzsche to ponder the justification of things like authoritarianism that conflict with the moral positions of many philosophers.\n\nTranscendental perspectivism argues that each truth is the product of the perceiver; however, if two perceivers share a truth, then that truth transcends each individual perceiver. This is achieved not by one perceiver convincing the \"other\" about the validity of a held truth, but rather by the union of two truths held by each perceiver. The \"other's\" perception plays an equal role in the development of a transcendental truth. A key artifact of transcendental perspectivism is that the transcendence of a truth can not be achieved through force. That is, if a truth held by a perceiver is forced on the \"other\", then that truth has not transcended both perceptions. Domination of the \"other\" has only produced subjugation, and can not produce acceptance of a shared truth because the perspective of the \"other\" was not involved in the development of the truth and thus the truth is not true for the \"other\". In order to avoid domination and to truly develop a transcendental truth, the perceiver must experience empathy and compassion for the perception of the \"other\".\n\nA logic formula developed by Krieglstein's son for this process reads as such:\n\nformula_1\n\nIn that, formula_2 is a given phenomenon, formula_3 is the perceiver's perspective of that phenomenon, formula_4 is one or more other people's perception of that phenomenon, and formula_5 is an error term. The result is formula_6 which is a truth about the given phenomenon that is shared by the perceiver and the other, but transcends the limited perception of either to become a transcendental truth. It is important to note that formula_6is not necessarily just the sum total of two perspectives, but rather a new and unique truth that is only achieved through sharing.\n\nTranscendental perspectivism's call for compassion of the \"other\" has gained it widespread acceptance in the partnership field founded by Riane Eisler. The philosophy's unique perspective on the role consciousness plays in the development of physical truths has gained it some recognition in the field of consciousness research. To help focus the practical acceptance of transcendental perspectivism, Krieglstein wrote a manifesto containing 11 key facets of the philosophy.\n\n1. Transcendental perspectivism recognizes truth as experiential and personal, but not as objective and universal. Therefore, all religious beliefs including agnosticism and atheism are respected equally, as long as they do not impose their values on others.\n\n2. Transcendental perspectivism prefers diversity and difference over singularity. These are assumed to be more natural and beneficial in evolutionary terms.\n\n3. Transcendental perspectivism rejects domination in all its forms. It especially rejects domination of men over women. For this reason Transcendental Perspectivism embraces a reevaluation of the philosophical canon from a feminist perspective.\n\n4. Transcendental perspectivism aims for cooperation and connectedness over competition and survival of the fittest. This, too, is seen to be more natural and adaptive.\n\n5. Transcendental perspectivism assumes that there is a unique perspective, an inside-out view for everything that exists, including Nothingness. This puts consciousness at the center.\n\n6. Central to transcendental perspectivism is the search for the Other. Since all is consciousness we can communicate with all. This makes transcendental perspectivism a shamanistic philosophy.\n\n7. Transcendental perspectivism assumes a holistic view of the human body. Mind and body are one. Healing the body can never be seen in isolation and vice versa, a sickness of the mind affects the body.\n\n8. As a shamanistic philosophy transcendental perspectivism provides the basis for a reanimation of the natural (material or inanimate) world. This will not result in a new superstition, but will be complemented by mathematical structure and empirical verification.\n\n9. Transcendental perspectivism bridges the gap between the sciences and the humanities. It reunites the various fields of the cognitive enterprise of humanity by providing a new and in depth understanding of the physical world on which all human knowledge is based.\n\n10. By providing a full and in-depth understanding of the physical nature of the human being transcendental perspectivism initiates a renaissance of the body. It invites a physical celebration of the human being within a physical world. This reevaluation of the human body will lead to a third enlightenment, the Enlightenment of the Body.\n\n11. By reconnecting humanity with the rest of the physical world transcendental perspectivism will initiate a new spirituality. This has been called a cosmic spiritually. It is cosmic consciousness because these new individuals will be fully aware of being members of a larger whole, as they themselves are the composite symphony of numerous smaller wholes.\n\n\n"}

Each is used in the generic and non-technical sense of \"mind\" in general, but the three are sometimes used in sequence to refer to one's mental processes as a whole. Their primary uses are, however, distinct.\n\nThis section considers the Buddhist concept primarily in terms of Early Buddhism's Pali literature as well as in the literature of other Buddhist schools.\n\nThroughout Pali literature, \"viññāa\" can be found as one of a handful of synonyms for the mental force that animates the otherwise inert material body.\nIn a number of Pali texts though, the term has a more nuanced and context-specific (or \"technical\") meaning. In particular, in the Pali Canon's \"Discourse Basket\" (\"Suttapitaka\"), \"viññāa\" (generally translated as \"consciousness\") is discussed in at least three related but different contexts:<br>\nIn the Pali Canon's Abhidhamma and in post-canonical Pali commentaries, consciousness (\"viññāa\") is further analyzed into 89 different states which are categorized in accordance with their kammic results.\n\nIn Buddhism, the six sense bases (Pali: '; Skt.: ') refer to the five physical sense organs (cf. receptive field) (belonging to the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body), the mind (referred to as the sixth sense base) and their associated objects (visual forms, sounds, odors, flavors, touch and mental objects). Based on the six sense bases, a number of mental factors arise including six \"types\" or \"classes\" of consciousness (\"viññāa-kāyā\"). More specifically, according to this analysis, the six types of consciousness are eye-consciousness (that is, consciousness based on the eye), ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mind-consciousness.\n\nIn this context, for instance, when an ear's receptive field (the proximal stimulus, more commonly known by Buddhists as a sense base, or sense organ) and sound (the distal stimulus, or sense object) are present, the associated (ear-related consciousness) arises. The arising of these three elements (\"dhātu\") – e.g. ear, sound and ear-consciousness – lead to the percept, known as \"contact\" and in turn causes a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral \"feeling\" to arise. It is from such feeling that \"craving\" arises. (See Fig. 1.)\n\nIn a discourse entitled, \"The All\" (\"Sabba Sutta\", SN 35.23), the Buddha states that there is no \"all\" outside of the six pairs of sense bases (that is, six internal and six external sense bases). The \"To Be Abandoned Discourse\" (\"Pahanaya Sutta\", SN 35.24) further expands the All to include first five aforementioned sextets (internal sense bases, external sense bases, consciousness, contact and feeling). In the famed \"Fire Sermon\" (\"Ādittapariyāya Sutta\", SN 35.28) the Buddha declares that \"the All is aflame\" with passion, aversion, delusion and suffering (\"dukkha\"); to obtain release from this suffering, one should become disenchanted with the All.\n\nHence, in this context, \"viññāa\" includes the following characteristics:\n\nIn Buddhism, consciousness (\"viññāa\") is one of the five classically defined experiential \"aggregates\" (Pali: \"khandha\"; Skt.: \"skandha\"). As illustrated (Fig. 2), the four other aggregates are material \"form\" (\"rupa\"), \"feeling\" or \"sensation\" (\"vedana\"), \"perception\" (\"sanna\"), and \"volitional formations\" or \"fabrications\" (\"sankhara\").\n\nIn SN 22.79, the Buddha distinguishes consciousness in the following manner:\nThis type of awareness appears to be more refined and introspective than that associated with the aggregate of perception (\"saññā\") which the Buddha describes in the same discourse as follows:\nSimilarly, in the traditionally venerated 5th-century CE commentary, the Visuddhimagga, there is an extended analogy about a child, an adult villager and an expert \"money-changer\" seeing a heap of coins; the child's experience is likened to perception, the villager's experience to consciousness, and the money-changer's experience to true understanding (\"paňňā\").\nThus, in this context, \"consciousness\" denotes more than the irreducible subjective experience of sense data suggested in the discourses of \"the All\" (see prior section); it additionally entails a depth of awareness reflecting a degree of memory and recognition.\n\nAll of the aggregates are to be seen as empty of self-nature; that is, they arise dependent on causes (\"hetu\") and conditions (\"paticca\"). In this scheme, the cause for the arising of consciousness (\"viññāa\") is the arising of one of the other aggregates (physical or mental); and the arising of consciousness in turn gives rise to one or more of the mental (\"nāma\") aggregates. In this way, the chain of causation identified in the aggregate (\"khandha\") model overlaps the chain of conditioning in the Dependent Origination (\"paticcasamuppāda\") model.\n\nConsciousness (\"viññāa\") is the third of the traditionally enumerated Twelve Causes (\"nidāna\") of Dependent Origination (Pali: \"\"; Skt.: \"pratītyasamutpāda\"). Within the context of Dependent Origination, different canonical discourses represent different aspects of consciousness. The following aspects are traditionally highlighted:\n\nNumerous discourses state:\n\nIn three discourses in the Samyutta Nikaya, the Buddha highlights three particular manifestations of ' as particularly creating a \"basis for the maintenance of consciousness\" (') that could lead to future existence, to the perpetuation of bodily and mental processes, and to craving and its resultant suffering. As stated in the common text below (in English and Pali), these three manifestations are intending, planning and enactments of latent tendencies (\"obsessing\")\n\nThus, for instance, in the \"Intention Discourse\" (\"Cetanā Sutta\", SN 12.38), the Buddha more fully elaborates:\n\nThe language of the post-canonical Samyutta Nikaya commentary and subcommentary further affirm that this text is discussing the means by which \"kammic consciousness\" \"yield[s] fruit in one's mental continuum.\" In other words, certain intentional or obsessive acts on one's part inherently establish in present consciousness a basis for future consciousness's existence; in this way, the future existence is conditioned by certain aspects of the initial intention, including its wholesome and unwholesome qualities.\n\nConversely, in the \"Attached Discourse\" (\"Upaya Sutta\", SN 22.53), it states that if passion for the five aggregates (forms and mental processes) are abandoned then:\n\nNumerous discourses state:\nIn addition, a few discourses state that, simultaneously, the converse is true:\n\nIn the \"Sheaves of Reeds Discourse\" (\"Nalakalapiyo Sutta\", SN 12.67), Ven. Sariputta uses this famous analogy to explain the interdependency of consciousness and name-form:\n\nAs described above in the discussion of mental fabrications' conditioning of consciousness, past intentional actions establish a kammic seed within consciousness that expresses itself in the future. Through consciousness's \"life force\" aspect, these future expressions are not only within a single lifespan but propel kammic impulses (\"kammavega\") across samsaric rebirths.\n\nIn the \"Serene Faith Discourse\" (\"Sampasadaniya Sutta\", DN 28), Ven. Sariputta references not a singular conscious entity but a \"stream of consciousness\" (\"viññāa-sota\") that spans multiple lives:\n\nThe \"Great Causes Discourse\" (\"Mahanidana Sutta\", DN 15), in a dialogue between the Buddha and the Ven. Ananda, describes \"consciousness\" (\"viññāa\") in a way that underlines its \"life force\" aspect:\n\nDiscourses such as this to describe a consciousness that is an animating phenomenon capable of spanning lives thus giving rise to rebirth.\n\nAn Anguttara Nikaya discourse provides a memorable metaphor to describe the interplay of kamma, consciousness, craving and rebirth:\n\nThe Patthana, part of the Theravadin Abhidharma, analyzes the different states of consciousness and their functions. The Theravāda school method is to study every state of consciousness. Using this method, some states of consciousness are identified as positive, some negative and some neutral. This analysis is based on the principle of karma, the main point in understanding the different consciousness. All together according to the Abhidhamma, there are 89 kinds of consciousness, 54 are of the \"sense sphere\" (related to the five physical senses as well as craving for sensual pleasure), 15 of the \"fine-material sphere\" (related to the meditative absorptions based on material objects), 12 of the \"immaterial sphere\" (related to the immaterial meditative absorptions), and eight are supramundane (related to the realization of Nibbāna).\n\nMore specifically, a \"viññāa\" is a single moment of conceptual consciousness and normal mental activity is considered to consist of a continual succession of \"viññāa\"s.\n\n\"Viññāa\" has two components: the awareness itself, and the object of that awareness (which might be a perception, a feeling etc.). Thus, in this way, these \"viññāa\"s are not considered as ultimate (underived) phenomena as they are based on mental factors (\"cetasika\"). For example, jhānic (meditative) states are described as based on the five ultimate mental factors of applied thought (\"vitakka\"), sustained thought (\"vicara\"), rapture (\"piti\"), serenity (\"sukha\") and one-pointedness (\"ekaggatā\").\n\nAccording to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the post-canonical Pali commentary uses the three terms \"viññāa\", \"mano\" and \"citta\" as synonyms for the mind sense base (\"mana-ayatana\"); however, in the Sutta Pitaka, these three terms are generally contextualized differently:\n\nThe citta is called \"luminous\" in A.I.8-10.\n\nWhile most Buddhist schools identify six modes of consciousness, one for each sense base, some Buddhist schools have identified additional modes.\n\nAs described above, in reference to the \"All\" (\"sabba\"), the Sutta Pitaka identifies six vijñānas related to the six sense bases: \n\nThe Yogacara / Cittamatra school consider two more consciousnesses. \n\nAccording to Walpola Rahula, the \"store consciousness\" of Yogacara thought exists in the early texts as well, as the \"citta.\"\n\nThe (), \"immaculate consciousness\", is considered by some Yogācāra schools as a ninth level of consciousness. This \"pure consciousness is identified with the nature of reality (parinispanna) or Suchness.\" Alternatively, amalavijñāna may be considered the pure aspect of ālāyavijñāna.\n\nSome buddhists also suggest hrdaya (Heart) consciousnesses (一切一心識), or an eleven consciousnesses theory or an infinity consciousness ().\n\n\"Viññāna\" is used in Thai Buddhism to refer specifically to one's consciousness or life-force after it has left the body at the moment of death. Thais differentiate between winyaan and \"jid-jai\" (จิตใจ), which is the consciousness while it is still connected to a living body. Even though the jid-jai leaves the body while you dream at night and can also externalize during advanced meditation practice, it is still connected to the body.\n\nSri Ramakrishna defines \"vijñāna\" as\n\nBased on ancient texts, V.S.Apte (1890, rev. 1957-59) provides the following definition for \"vijñānam\" (विज्ञानम्):\n\nIn addition, Monier Williams (1899; rev. 2008) provides the following definition:\n\n\n\n"}

Brown (born November 28, 1955) is an American political theorist. She is Class of 1936 First Professor of Political Science and a core faculty member in The Program for Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nWendy Brown received her BA in both Economics and Politics from UC Santa Cruz, and her M.A and Ph.D in political philosophy from Princeton University. Before she took a position at UC Berkeley in 1999, Brown taught at Williams College and UC Santa Cruz. At Berkeley, beyond her primary teaching roles in Political Theory and Critical Theory, Brown is also an affiliated faculty member of the Department of Rhetoric, the Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program, the Designated Emphasis in Women, Gender and Sexuality, and the Designated Emphasis in Early Modern Studies.\n\nBrown lectures around the world and has held numerous visiting and honorary positions, including at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, the Goethe University in Frankfurt, the UC Humanities Research Institute in Irvine, the Institute for the Humanities Critical Theory Summer School at Birkbeck, University of London (2012, 2015), a Senior Invited Fellow of the Center for Humanities at Cornell University (2013), a Visiting Professor at Columbia University (2014), a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Lecturer (2014), a Visiting Professor of Law and Government at Cornell University (2015), the Shimizu Visiting Professor of Law at the London School of Economics (2015), and a Visiting Professor at the European Graduate School (2016).\n\nAmong the honorary lectures Brown has delivered are the Beaverbrook Annual Lecture at McGill University (2015); the Pembroke Center keynote at Brown University (2015); a keynote at the Zolberg Institute on Migration and Mobility (2016); the fourth \"Democracy Lecture\" – following Thomas Piketty, Naomi Klein, and Paul Mason – in the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin (2017); a plenary speech at the European Sociological Association conference in Athens (2017); the Wellek Lectures at UC Irvine (2018); and the Gauss Lecture at Princeton University (2018).\n\nBrown's work has been translated into more than twenty languages and has received many awards. Brown served as Council Member of the American Political Science Association (2007–09) and as Chair of the UC Humanities Research Institute Board of Governors (2009–11). In 2012, her book Walled States, Waning Sovereignty won the David Eastman Award. Brown received the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award, UC Berkeley's most prestigious honor for teaching. She received a UC Presidents Humanities Research Fellowship (2017–18) and is currently a Guggenheim Fellow (2017–18).\n\nBrown's thinking on the decline of sovereignty and the hollowing out of democracy has found popular and journalistic audiences, with discussions of her arguments appearing in \"The Guardian\" and \"New York Times\" articles. Brown has appeared in documentary films including \"The Value of the Humanities\" (2014) and \"What is Democracy?\" (directed by Astra Taylor, 2017).\n\nTogether with Michel Feher, Brown is co-editor of the Zone Books' series Near Futures and its digital supplement Near Futures Online.\n\nBrown has established new paradigms in critical legal studies and feminist theory. She has produced a body of work drawing from Marx's critique of capitalism and its relation to religion and secularism, Nietzsche's usefulness for thinking about power and the ruses of morality, Max Weber on the modern organization of power, Freudian psychoanalysis and its implications for political identification, Foucault's work on governmentality and neoliberalism, as well as other contemporary continental philosophers. Bringing these resources together with her own thinking on a range of topics, Brown's work aims to diagnose modern and contemporary formations of political power, and to discern the threats to democracy entailed by such formations.\n\nIn this work Brown asks how a sense of woundedness can become the basis for individual and collective forms of identity. From outlawing hate speech to banning pornography, Brown argues, well-intentioned attempts at protection can legitimize the state while harming subjects by codifying their identities as helpless or in need of continuous governmental regulation. While breaking ground in political theory, this work also represents one of Brown's key interventions in feminist and queer theory. The book offers a novel account of legal and political power as constitutive of norms of sexuality and gender. Through the concept of \"wounded attachments\", Brown contends that psychic injury may accompany and sustain racial, ethnic, and gender categories, particularly in relation to state law and discursive formations. In this and other works Brown has criticized representatives of second wave feminism, such as Catharine MacKinnon, for reinscribing the category of \"woman\" as an essentialized identity premised on injury.\n\nThis book comprises a series of essays on contemporary political issues from the problem of moralism in politics to the legacies of past injustices in the present. Throughout her thematically overlapping chapters, Brown asks: \"What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken, when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous, when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom, when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective?\" Much of this book takes history and liberalism themselves as objects of theoretical reflection and sites of contestation. Drawing on a range of thinkers, such as Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin and Derrida, Brown rethinks the disorientation and possibility inherent to contemporary democracy.\n\nThis work consists of seven articles responding to particular occasions, each of which \"mimic, in certain ways, the experience of the political realm: one is challenged to think here, now, about a problem that is set and framed by someone else, and to do so before a particular audience or in dialogue with others not of one's own choosing.\" Each individual essay begins with a specific problem: what is the relationship between love, loyalty, and dissent in contemporary American political life?; how did neoliberal rationality become a form of governmentality?; what are the main problems of women's studies programs?; and so on. According to Brown, the essays do not aim to definitively answer the given questions but \"to critically interrogate the framing and naming practices, challenge the dogmas (including those of the Left and of feminism), and discern the constitutive powers shaping the problem at hand.\"\n\nIn this book, Brown subverts the usual and widely accepted notion that tolerance is one of the most remarkable achievements of Western modernity. She suggests that tolerance (or toleration) cannot be perceived as the complete opposite to violence. At times, it can also be used to justify violence. Brown argues that tolerance primarily operates as a discourse of subject construction and a mode of governmentality that addresses or confirms asymmetric relations between different groups, each of which must then \"tolerate\" other groups and categories or \"be tolerated\" by the dominant groups and categories.\n\nTo substantiate her thesis, Brown examines the tolerance discourse of figures like George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Samuel Huntington, Susan Okin, Michael Ignatieff, Bernard Lewis, and Seyla Benhabib and argues that \"tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant, it is always a certain expression of domination even as it offers protection or incorporation to the less powerful.\" Among those influenced by Brown's thinking on this subject are Joan Wallach Scott and Slavoj Žižek, whose respective works \"The Politics of the Veil\" (2007) and \"Violence: Six Sideways Reflections\" (2007) draw heavily on Brown's account of tolerance discourse.\n\nIn a debate with Rainer Forst at the ICI in Berlin Brown addressed this problematic again, later published as a co-authored book, The Power of Tolerance (2014). Here Brown argues against primarily moral or normative approaches to power and discourse, and warns against the dangers of uncritically celebrating the liberal ideal of tolerance, as frequently happens in Western notions of historical, civilizational or moral progress.\n\nPublished exclusively in French, \"Les habits neufs de la politique mondiale\" (\"The New Clothes of World Politics\") argues that the following political fact is irreversible: liberal democracy, as a global social and historical modality of statecraft, is dying. The two movements delivering such blows, neoliberalism and neoconservatism, feature both resonances and disonances. Brown argues that whilst the former acts as a political rationality, a mode of general regulation of behavior, the latter is both necessary to its survival, and parasitic of its survival. As a form of governmentality that redefines freedom, neoliberalism will moralize politics, limiting its scope; this is the function of neo-conservatism.\n\nThis book examines the revival of wall-building under shifting conditions of global capitalism. Brown not only problematizes the assumed functions of walls, such as the prevention of crime, migration, smuggling, and so on. She also argues that walling has taken on new a significance due to its symbolic function in an increasingly globalized and precarious world of financial capital. As individual identity as well as nation-state sovereignty are threatened, walls become objects invested with individual and collective desire. Anxious efforts to shore up national identity are thus projected onto borders as well as new material structures that would appear to secure them. The book was reprinted with a new preface by the author following the 2016 election of Donald Trump.\n\nBrown's study begins by engaging and revising key arguments in Michel Foucault's \"The Birth of Biopolitics\" with the aim of analyzing different ways that democracy is being hollowed out by neoliberal rationality. She describes neoliberalism as a thoroughgoing attack on the most foundational ideas and practices of democracy. The individual chapters of the book examine the effects of neoliberalization on higher education, law, governance, the basic principles of liberal democratic institutions, as well as radical democratic imaginaries.\n\nBrown treats \"neoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is 'economized' and in a very specific way: human beings become market actors and nothing but, every field of activity is seen as a market, and every entity (whether public or private, whether person, business, or state) is governed as a firm.\" To address such threats, Brown argues, democracy must be reinvigorated not only as an object of theoretical inquiry but also as a site of political struggle.\n\nBrown is currently researching right nationalism in the US, completing a book provisionally titled \"Neoliberalism's Frankenstein: Authoritarian Freedom, White Nationalism, and the Weaponization of Moral Values\". The book will shift between the frames of neoliberal governmentality, Nietzsche's social analysis and Marcuse's psychoanalysis to explain the production of a society unmoored from moral concerns (hence social justice), obligations to truth (the post-truth moment) and democratic interests (replaced by the self-interest of human capital). Brown draws from The Will to Power by Nietzsche and Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man, attributing these right energies to a combination of world-historical nihilism and forces of consumer culture in advance industrial society. Nihilism has, Brown argues, largely generated 'neoliberal reason itself, which posits no value apart from that generated by price and speculative markets.'\n\nA prominent public intellectual in the United States, Brown has written and spoken about issues of free speech, public education, political protest, LGBTQ issues, sexual assault, Donald Trump, conservatism, neoliberalism, and other matters of national and international concern.\n\nFor decades, Brown has been active in efforts to resist measures toward the privatization of the University of California system. In her capacity as co-chair of the Berkeley Faculty Association, she raised awareness, organized marches, and spoke publicly about the privatization of public education. She has been critical of the university's decision to cut costs by utilizing lecturers rather than hiring tenure and tenure track professors. Relatedly, she has voiced concern over the perils of the UC's proposed online education programs.\n\nBrown has criticized university administration for their response to sexual assault. \"I think many faculty feel there are repeat harassers on our faculty who are never charged ... Graduate students gave up on careers, and these perpetrators were allowed to continue, and that was wrong—never should have happened,\" she said.\n\nAt the \"99 Mile March\" to Sacramento she addressed her criticism to more general trends: \"We are marching to draw attention to the plight of public education in California and to implore Californians to re-invest in it. For all its resources, innovation and wealth, California has sunk to nearly the bottom of the nation in per student spending, and our public higher education system, once the envy of the world, is in real peril.\" Brown supported Occupy Wall Street as part of the UC faculty council, claiming that \"We understand this to be part of what (the movement) stands for. We are delighted by the protests and consider our campaign to be at one with it.\"\n\nBrown is a native of California and lives in Berkeley with her wife Judith Butler and son.\n\n\n\n\n"}
