{"id": "571478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571478", "title": "Bambi effect", "text": "Bambi effect\n\nThe \"Bambi effect\" is a term used anecdotally or in editorial media that refers to objections against the killing of charismatic megafauna (animals that are perceived as \"cute\" or \"adorable\", such as deer or dolphins), while there may be little or no objection to the suffering of organisms that are perceived as somehow repulsive or less than desirable, such as spiders or an endangered fungus and other woodland creatures.\n\nReferring to a form of purported anthropomorphism, the term is inspired by Walt Disney's animated film \"Bambi\", where an emotional high point is the death of the lead character's mother at the hands of the film's antagonist, a hunter known only as \"Man\".\n\nSome commentators have credited this purported effect with increasing public awareness of the dangers of pollution, for instance in the case of the fate of sea otters after the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill, and in the public interest in scaring birds off airfields in non-lethal ways. In the case of invasive species, perceived cuteness may help thwart efforts to eradicate non-native intruders, such as the white fallow deer in Point Reyes, California. The effect is also cited as the anthropomorphic quality of modern cinema: most people in modern Western civilization are not familiar with wildlife, other than \"through TV or cinema, where fuzzy little critters discuss romance, self-determination and loyalty like pals over a cup of coffee\", which has led to influences on public policy and the image of businesses cast in movies as polluting or otherwise harming the environment.\n\nThe effect was also cited in the events following record snowfall in the U.S. state of Colorado in 2007, when food for mule deer, pronghorns, and elk became so scarce that they began to starve; the Colorado Department of Wildlife was inundated with requests and offers to help the animals from citizens, and ended up spending almost $2 million feeding hungry wildlife. Among some butchers, the Bambi effect (and in general, Walt Disney's anthropomorphic characters) is credited with fueling the vegetarian movement; chefs use the term to describe customers' lack of interest in, for instance, whole fish: \"It's the Bambi effect – [customers] don't want to see eyes looking at them\".\n\nA secondary meaning is sometimes found in psychology, where the term may be used to refer to a perceived tendency in \"humans...to find animals attractive that have characteristics similar to those [of] human babies\". It is also claimed that this tendency is at work in human sexuality, since, according to some studies, most people prefer 'babylike' features in their sexual partners, that is, \"a large rounded forehead, large eyes, and rounded features\".\n"}

In 1901, he received his doctorate under Heinrich Rickert at Freiburg, which entitled him to teach some courses (one of his students was Rudolf Carnap later became a central figure of the Vienna Circle). Bauch completed his Habilitation, entitling him to a professorship, at the University of Halle in 1903. He taught as a \"titular professor\" at Halle from 1903 to 1910, and from 1911 onward as an \"ordinary professor\" at the University of Jena.\n\nAt Jena, he befriended Gottlob Frege and collaborated with the Neo-Kantian philosopher of language Richard Hönigswald. Bauch was an influential figure in the Kant-Gesellschaft (Kant Society) and helped publish the Prussian Academy's edition of Kant's collected works. Until 1916, he was editor of the Kant Society's journal, \"Kant-Studien\" (Kant Studies). He was forced to resign after publishing an anti-semitic article in a right-wing nationalist tabloid, which caused a storm of controversy in the Kant Society. (Many Neo-Kantians, including Bauch's subsequent colleague Hönigswald, were Jewish, and quite a few were social democrats.) In 1917, Bauch founded a philosophical society of his own, the German Philosophical Society, which issued the journal \"Beiträge zur Philosophie des Deutschen Idealismus\" (Contributions to the Philosophy of German Idealism). Frege was among its contributors. When the Nazis came to power, Bauch's political views stood him in good stead. While many Neo-Kantians had to emigrate and some ended up in concentration camps (including, for a year, Hönigswald), Bauch became head of the German Philosophical Society in 1934.\n\nHeinrich Rickert, whom Bauch studied under, was the most important leader of the so-called Badensian, or Southwest German School of Neo-Kantianism after Wilhelm Windelband. Unlike its main rival, the Marburg School, the Badensian Neo-Kantians were more interested in practical philosophy than in the philosophy of science. They emphasized the distinction between fact and value and sought to use the concept of \"value\" for epistemological and ontological purposes. For example, to say that a sentence is \"true\" is sometimes equated with saying that it 'commands assent' (i.e., that it \"ought\" to be believed). Bauch, however, was a rather unorthodox scion of the Badensian school, so much so that some commentators regard him as representing a distinct variety of Neo-Kantianism. While Bauch shared an interest in the philosophy of value, he also had a much more lively interest in the philosophy of mathematics and logic than was common among the Badensian Neo-Kantians. Unlike Rickert, he was sympathetic to Gottlob Frege's logicism (which Rickert had rejected on the old-fashioned Kantian grounds that logic was analytic, mathematics synthetic), and was conciliatory toward the Marburg Neo-Kantians' belief in the unity of logic and mathematics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3870", "title": "Bundle theory", "text": "Bundle theory\n\nBundle theory, originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, is the ontological theory about objecthood in which an object consists only of a collection (\"bundle\") of properties, relations or tropes.\n\nAccording to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even \"conceive\" of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties. Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties. In particular, there is no \"substance\" in which the properties are \"inherent\".\n\nThe difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.\n\nThe inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a \"bare particular\" (a \"substance\" without properties), an implication that directly opposes substance theory. The conceptual difficulty of \"bare particulars\" was illustrated by John Locke when he described a \"substance\" by itself, apart from its properties, as \"something, I know not what. [...] The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding.\"\n\nWhether a \"relation\" of an object is one of its properties may complicate such an argument. However, the argument concludes that the conceptual challenge of \"bare particulars\" leaves a bundle of properties and nothing more as the only possible conception of an object, thus justifying bundle theory.\n\nBundle theory maintains that properties are \"bundled\" together in a collection without describing how they are tied together. For example, bundle theory regards an apple as red, four inches (100 mm) wide, and juicy but lacking an underlying \"substance\". The apple is said to be a \"bundle of properties\" including redness, being four inches (100 mm) wide, and juiciness.\n\nCritics question how bundle theory accounts for the properties' \"compresence\" (the \"togetherness\" relation between those properties) without an underlying \"substance\". Critics also question how any two given properties are determined to be properties of the same object if there is no \"substance\" in which they both \"inhere\".\n\nTraditional bundle theory explains the \"compresence\" of properties by defining an object as a collection of properties \"bound\" together. Thus, different combinations of properties and relations produce different objects. Redness and juiciness, for example, may be found together on top of the table because they are part of a bundle of properties located on the table, one of which is the \"looks like an apple\" property.\n\nBy contrast, substance theory explains the \"compresence\" of properties by asserting that the properties are found together because it is the \"substance\" that has those properties. In substance theory, a \"substance\" is the thing in which properties \"inhere\". For example, redness and juiciness are found on top of the table because redness and juiciness \"inhere\" in an apple, making the apple red and juicy.\n\nThe \"bundle theory of substance\" explains \"compresence\". Specifically, it maintains that properties' compresence itself engenders a \"substance\". Thus, it determines \"substancehood\" empirically by the \"togetherness\" of properties rather than by a \"bare particular\" or by any other non-empirical underlying strata. The \"bundle theory of substance\" thus rejects the substance theories of Aristotle, Descartes, and more recently, J. P. Moreland, Jia Hou, Joseph Bridgman, Quentin Smith, and others.\n\nThe Buddhist Madhyamaka philosopher, Chandrakirti, used the aggregate nature of objects to demonstrate the lack of essence in what is known as the sevenfold reasoning. In his work, \"Guide to the Middle Way\" (Sanskrit: \"Madhyamakāvatāra\"), he says:\n\nHe goes on to explain what is meant by each of these seven assertions, but briefly in a subsequent commentary he explains that the conventions of the world do not exist essentially when closely analyzed, but exist only through being taken for granted, without being subject to scrutiny that searches for an essence within them.\n\nAnother view of the Buddhist theory of the self, especially in early Buddhism, is that the Buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. According to this understanding, the self can not be reduced to a bundle because there is nothing that answers to the concept of a self. Consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1690836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1690836", "title": "Confucian art", "text": "Confucian art\n\nConfucian art is art inspired by the writings of Confucius, and Confucian teachings. Confucian art originated in China, then spread westwards on the Silk road, southward down to southern China and then onto Southeast Asia, and eastwards through northern China on to Japan and Korea. While it still maintains a strong influence within Indonesia, Confucian influence on western art has been limited. While Confucian themes enjoyed representation in Chinese art centers, they are fewer in comparison to the number of artworks that are about or influenced by Daoism and Buddhism.\n\nWhen Confucius was elevated to the rank of Supreme Sage and the Uncrown King (\"Su Wang\"), Confucian art became identified with the art of Confucius in recognition to the sage's central position in the transmission of the Chinese ancient culture. Notable elements of this art are calligraphy of Confucian writings and thoughts, often contained within Confucian temples and schools, as well as whiteware ceramics and pottery related to Confucian religious and scholarly practices. In China, Chinese scholar's rocks were part of this tradition. As most importantly the Korean stone art which continues to this day. Themes and subjects usually include the depiction of prominent Confucian figures such as statesmen, poets, and painters, among others. These are the subjects, for instance, of the paintings of Zhang Lu (1464-1538). Artworks also reflected prevailing interests during the Confucian period such as chess, music, and painting in addition to the depiction of the didactic pictorial narratives of the life of Confucius and the twenty-four paragons of filial piety.\n\nConfucian art is demonstrated in the Six Classics: \"The Book of Odes\", which describes the will; the \"Book of Documents\", which describes events; \"The Book of Ritual,\" which focuses on conduct; \"The Book of Music\", which is about harmony; the \"Book of Changes\" for the concept of the yin and yang; and, The Spring and Autumn Annals, which describes titles and functions.\n\nConfucian art may also be distinguished between classical early period, neo-Confucianism, and post-modern Confucian art.\n\nEvery one of Confucius' students had his own character. Some were modest and keen to learn; some were strong and argumentative; some were cowardly and slow to improve. However, Confucius would teach each student according to his nature guiding him along the way so that he/she may become a useful and talented person.\n\nRan Qiu was a very talented person. He really hoped to improve his political abilities and obtain the opportunity to be promoted to become a government official after learning from Confucius.\n\nOfficials in ancient times had to understand poetry, literature, ritual, and music, only when they had a good understanding of this knowledge could they work for the people. In order to improve on these abilities to become a government official, Ran Qiu followed Confucius as his teacher and diligently studied a variety of subjects and skills.\n\nAfter some time, however, Confucius found that Ran Qiu had become idle and lazy and was no longer curious to understand and discuss the principles taught in the class. Therefore, one day after the class, Confucius asked Ran Qiu the reason for this.\n\nRan Qiu said, \"It is not that I don't like the principles that you teach. It is just because I am lacking in ability!\"\n\nIn fact, Ran Qiu thought that the principles that Confucius taught were too high and were different from what he had expected them to be. Ran Qiu had only planned to learn from Confucius the abilities necessary to become a government official. Then, with the help of Confucius' reputation, he would get the chance to start his political career. But when he came to Confucius's school, he found that the principles Confucius taught seemed to be apart from society. Though the ideals were high, it was not easy to follow them in practice.\n\nHolding such thoughts, Ran Qiu started to become lazy and felt it was useless no matter how much more he learned. In addition, Ran Qiu also attributed his poor performance in the class to his own insufficient abilities. He thought that, since he was not capable enough, he would never be able to achieve the level that Confucius was teaching, so why did he need to study carefully?\n\nConfucius however didn't think that Ran Qiu's declining performance was due to a lack of ability. Therefore, he told Ran Qiu, \"Look at those people who don't have enough ability. They usually stop and give up halfway, whereas you draw a boundary in front of yourself to restrict you from moving forward. How can you make progress that way?\"\n\nAfter hearing what Confucius had to say, Ran Qiu was ashamed and lowered his head. Confucius continued, \"Before you fully demonstrate your ability, you should not easily give up the effort to strive forward; you shouldn't feel so desperate about yourself so easily. As long as you try your best to do everything well, you will find that you have good potential!\"\n\nAfter Confucius had encouraged him, Ran Qiu was again full of confidence and resumed his usual earnest learning attitude. It was after this that Ran Qiu took note of Confucius' skills as a teacher!\n\n"}

Eligibility later extended to include \"Volksdeutsche\" (ethnic German) mothers from, for example, Austria and Sudetenland, that had earlier been incorporated into the German Reich.\n\nThe decoration was conferred from 1939 until 1945 in three classes: bronze, silver, and gold, to \"Reichsdeutsche\" mothers who exhibited probity, exemplary motherhood, and who conceived and raised at least four or more children in the role of a parent. A similar practice, that continues to this present day, was already established in France since 1920, by conferring the \"Médaille de la Famille française\" (Medal of the French Family), a tribute to the French mother who raised several children in an appropriate way.\n\nIn recognition of the substantial importance a woman's role and motherhood was in support of a strong Germany, the Cross of Honour of the German Mother was introduced by decree in Berlin on 16 December 1938 by Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor) Adolf Hitler. The preamble of the statutory decree declared:\n\nThe crosses were awarded annually on the second Sunday in May (Mothering Sunday or Mother's Day), but also extended to include other national annual occasions of celebration. So despite its institution in 1938, the first awards were rendered in May 1939.\n\nThe Mother's Cross was composed of three classes, and conferred to mothers in accordance with its statutory legislation: \"Verordnung des Führers und Reichskanzlers über die Stiftung des Ehrenkreuzes der Deutschen Mutter vom 16. Dezember 1938. Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBI) Teil I, 1938, Nr. 224, Seite 1923\" (In English: Statutory Order of the Leader and Chancellor on the establishment of the Cross of Honour of the German Mother of 16 December 1938. Imperial-(Reichs) Law Gazette (RGBl) Part I, 1938, No. 224, Page 1923), and its stringent nomination screening protocol.\n\n\nThe cross design is a slender elongated form of the Iron Cross or cross pattée and very similar in design to the Marian Cross of the Teutonic Knights Order (\"Marianerkreuz des Deutschen Ritterordens\"), enamelled translucent-blue with a slim opaque-white border. Resting on the centre radiant starburst rays is a metal roundel decorated with the words around an enamelled black straight centred “swastika” symbol, infilled white enamel. The cross design was the creation of the established Munich-based architect and sculptor Franz Berberich. The production of the cross involved several established \"Präsidialkanzlei\" (Presidential Chancellery) approved medal makers from across the German Reich. A maker's mark was never applied to the crosses produced; though each official house of manufacture did apply their name to the dark-blue presentation case (inside cover) for the 1st Class Gold Cross and the presentation sachets (reverse side) for each of the 2nd and 3rd Class Cross.\n\nInscribed on the reverse side of the cross, of which two official reverse-side styles exist, is the inscription \"Das Kind adelt die Mutter\" (The Child ennobles the Mother) found on the initial version produced on inception during the early part of 1939. On the succeeding version produced from 1939 to 1945 the initial former reverse inscription was replaced during production with the date of the decoration decree \"16. Dezember 1938\". Directly beneath each of the two styles is the inscribed facsimile signature of Adolf Hitler; a style variation in this signature exists between the initial and succeeding version produced.\n\nThe decoration is worn around the neck on its accompanying narrow blue and white ribbon of circa 60–70 cm in length. No other format of wear or placement was permitted.\n\nAccompanying the decoration was a deed of conferral (\"Besitzzeugnis\" otherwise \"Verleihungsurkunde\") sealed with the \"Hoheitszeichen des Deutschen Reiches\" (Great Seal of the German Reich) and the facsimile signature of Adolf Hitler and facsimile countersignature of the Minister of State Otto Meißner, head of the Office of the President of Germany (\"Präsidialkanzlei\"). An official pale-blue photo identification document (\"Ausweis\") was also available, this identified the holder and attested the bestowal of the decoration to the recipient mother, as well as provided instructions on the reverse side for correct wearing of the decoration, permitted at all \"formal\" state, celebrative and family occasions only.\n\nAn optional semi-official approved miniature version of the Mother's Cross measuring circa 2 cm with reverse-side inscription, attached to a blue-white ribbon bow, was also produced in each of its three classes; it was authorized for purposes of general everyday wear only. The wearing of the blue-white ribbon bow alone, without the miniature cross attached, was also authorized for same purpose. The miniature was an optional supplement, that could be purchased privately from relevant authorized supply stockists such as high-street jewellers or directly from the LDO (\"Leistungsgemeinschaft der Deutschen Ordenshersteller\") approved medal makers responsible for manufacturing private retail supply. Other formats made available by those manufacturers to recipients of the honour, such as brooches, were simply unofficial merchandising embellishments.\n\nThe Mother's Cross of Honour, upon the death of the honoured recipient mother, was permitted by statute to remain inheritable with the bereaved family as a keepsake remembrance.\n\nThe Cross of Honour of the German Mother represented the fundamental ideologies of the role of the mother (the role of women under National Socialism) and ethnic-nationalism (the \"Völkisch movement\") of that time period in Germany. Its inception followed the earlier \"Roaring Twenties\" or \"golden 1920s\" as it was later referred in Europe and a period during Germany's Weimar Republic, which saw young women breaking with traditional \"mores\" or likewise step aside from \"traditional\" lifestyle patterns.\n\nA recommendation presented collectively at the beginning of each month to the \"Präsidialkanzlei der Ordenskanzlei\" (Presidential Chancellery of the Chancellery of Honours) in Berlin for the Mother's Cross honour, could only be instigated by the local mayor’s office, or on application from the \"Ortsgruppenleiter\" (local political Party leader) of the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), or the \"Kreiswart des Reichsbundes der Kinderreichen\" (District Warden of the Reichs Union of Children-rich families).\n\nThe nomination involved a lengthy and exhaustive bureaucratic process. Not only were certain characteristics of the mother observed and eligibility studied thoroughly, but those too leading to the grandparents. The conferral of the Mother’s Cross was so highly regarded by the government in Berlin, that additional bureaucratic resources assigned to lesser civil and military decorations were pulled for the exhaustive administrative procedures that this decoration alone required. Its precedence especially during Germany’s wartime period saw all other civil honours and decorations but the Mother’s Cross temporarily suspended since the original purpose for its establishment was now more significant. Local government agencies such as the Social Welfare Agency (\"Wohlfahrtsamt\"), Public Health Department (\"Gesundheitsamt\"), Youth Welfare Agency (\"Jugendamt\"), Police (\"Polizei\") and other government agencies were all consulted in the eligibility investigation process. The decoration could and was only to be bestowed to the most honourable proven mothers. Accordingly, the following legislative prerequisites were to be strictly met:\n\n\nIn some detail, these criteria required, for example:\n\n\nIn the event the authorities were to find such discrepancies during their investigations leading to non-eligibility, the family risked being regarded or stigmatised as \"asozial\" (anti-social) or dysfunctional, which at that time was viewed as a risk and threat for the wellbeing of the German nation. It was declared inconceivable and abhorrent to consider or recommend any mother of such a family background for the Mother's Cross honour. In a further extract from the official application screening protocol, the local mayor's office was also encouraged, if his office was recommending a mother, to consider whether the mother in question, who has gifted her children life, has borne children likely to bear sacrifices in the interest of preserving the German nation, or whether the children posed a burden and peril to the future of the German nation, and the children perhaps should have better remained unborn.\n\nVarious privileges were bound to the honour, one example being preferential treatment, precedence and priority service within society and public services. As one recount recalls \"…they were always given the best of everything: housing, food, clothing, and schooling for their children. Old people even had to give up their seats on the bus or streetcar. They were treated like royalty with the greatest respect. No standing in line for them. At the butchers shop the best cuts of meat would go into their baskets. A helper or nurse was assigned by the government to help them take care of the brood and arrived first thing in the morning\". An annuity was also considered for a recipient mother of the decoration, but due to government budget constraints, this proved unworkable. Members of the Hitler Youth organization were also instructed; a wearer of the Mother's Cross was to be honourably greeted (saluted) when encountered. The \"Völkischer Beobachter\" (People's Observer) national newspaper (1938 Issue No. 25) stated: \"…the holder of the Mother’s Cross of Honour will in future enjoy all types of privileges that we by nature have accustomed to our nation's honoured comrades and our injured war veterans.\"\n\nThe receipt of the decoration was no guarantee of permanent recognition, it could be annulled on a case-by-case basis under certain circumstances on the advice of the \"Reichsminister des Innern\" (Reichs-Minister of Interior). For instance, it could be annulled if the mother ceased to be \"worthy\" by neglecting her children, marital infidelity, or exhibited other problematic behaviour.\n\nThe first public presentation ceremonies, following inception of the Mother's Cross in December 1938, were held on Mother's Day 21 May 1939 across Germany. However, due to the unexpected high number of mothers eligible for the decoration across all classes on its inception, despite a stringent nomination criteria, resulted in the initial presentations being restricted to mothers of age 60 and above due to various administrative and logistics limitations. The first year presentations were also extended to include 1 October 1939 \"harvest festival\" day (\"Erntedankfest\"), equivalent to thanksgiving, and 24 December 1939 Christmas Eve. It was not until Mother's Day 1940 onwards that eligible mothers aged below 60 were finally presented with their Mother's Cross decoration and once again these presentations were deferred until a later date that same year. A recipient mother who could not attend her official invitation to a local public presentation ceremony received her decoration delivered through the postal service. Some presentation ceremonies were also recorded filmed events chronicled by the \"Die Deutsche Wochenschau\" (The German Weekly Newsreel).\n\nExact total decorations bestowed throughout its existence are no longer traceable through the limited official records that survived the Second World War, the central application archives held at the \"Präsidialkanzlei\" (Presidential Chancellery) in Berlin were lost or otherwise destroyed by closing war events, however, it's estimated that up until September 1941 there were a total of 4.7 million recipient mothers honoured with the Mother's Cross decoration.\n\nAfter the end of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Mother's Cross was occasionally referred to as the \"Mütterverdienstkreuz\" (Mother's Cross of Merit). The Mother's Cross, however, belongs to the decorations and medals bestowed during the Third Reich era of Germany, and as such, incorporates by design the adopted swastika symbol; the wearing or display of which in public places, especially in Germany of such decorations since 26 July 1957, is restricted and regulated by German law (Ref. Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl) I, 1957, S. 844, §6) in accordance with the succeeding \"Law on Titles, Orders and Honours\" of the Federal Republic of Germany (\"Gesetz über Titel, Orden und Ehrenzeichen\").\n\n"}

However, it then explains that there are other divine truths, the knowledge of which is necessary for salvation, that are beyond the power of natural reason and can only be known through divine revelation.\n\nIt also decreed, \"If any one shall not receive as sacred and canonical the books of Holy Scripture, entire with all their parts, as the holy Synod of Trent has enumerated them, or shall deny that they have been divinely inspired: let him be anathema.\" \n\nThe draft presented to the council on 8 March 1870 drew no serious criticism. But a group of 35 English-speaking bishops, who feared that the opening phrase \"Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia\" might be construed as favouring the Anglican branch theory, raised objections to this expression, \"Holy Roman Catholic Church\". They proposed that the word \"Roman\" be omitted out of concern that use of the term \"Roman Catholic\" would lend support to proponents of branch theory. While the council overwhelmingly rejected this proposal, the text was finally modified to read \"The Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church\".\n\nThe words \"Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia\" were voted on three separate dates. On the first occasion, when this chapter alone was considered, two votes concerned the opening words. The first was on a proposal by a few English-speaking bishops to delete the word \"Romana\", thus changing \"Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia\" (The Holy Roman Catholic Church) to \"Sancta Catholica Ecclesia\" (The Holy Catholic Church). This was overwhelmingly defeated.\n\nThe second vote, held immediately afterwards, was on a proposal to insert a comma, so that \"Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia\" (The Holy Roman Catholic Church) would become \"Sancta Romana, Catholica Ecclesia\" (The Holy Roman, Catholic Church). This too was defeated, though not as overwhelmingly as the first proposal.\n\nIn a later vote, held on 12 April 1870, the text as a whole, which preserved the same opening words, was approved with 515 affirmative votes (\"placet\") and no opposing votes (\"non placet\"); but there were 83 \"placet iuxta modum\" votes, asking for retouches, many of them regarding the opening words of chapter I.\n\nIn view of the reservations thus expressed, the text presented for a final vote and approved unanimously on 24 April changed the order of the words and added \"Apostolica\", so that \"Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia\" became \"Sancta Catholica Apostolica Romana Ecclesia\" (The Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church).\n\n\n"}

Riso considered himself to be Enneagram type Four with a Three wing, although he did not actually disclose his type in his book \"Personality Types\".\n\nRiso grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana. He studied English and philosophy and received a M.A. from Stanford University. Around 1962, he joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) of the New Orleans Province, but later left the order without being ordained.\n\nIn the early 1970s, some members of the Jesuit order came in contact with the Enneagram material and it began to be taught in Jesuit and other Roman Catholic institutions in North America. In 1974, as a Jesuit seminarian in Toronto, Canada, Riso first learned of the Jesuit teaching on the Enneagram which, he has said, \"consisted of nine one-page impressionistic sketches of the personality types\" and fascinated him. In the following year, 1975, he left the order and began developing the brief type sketches to more detailed descriptions.\n\nRiso developed a number of original ideas regarding understanding the Enneagram, such as nine \"levels of development\" from \"redeemed\" or \"healthy\" to \"totally unhealthy\" and the \"harmonic groups\".\n\nIn 1987, Riso published his 12 years of Enneagram thinking in his first book, \"Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery\". This work showed the influence of Carl Gustav Jung and also of Karen Horney. Three years later he published \"Understanding the Enneagram\".\n\nIn 1991, Russ Hudson joined Riso, originally to create a questionnaire for indicating people's Enneagram types. The result was the Riso–Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator (RHETI). Several versions have since been developed, the present complete version consisting of 144 pairs of forced-choice statements.\n\nIn 1995, Riso and Hudson founded the Enneagram Institute in New York City. The institute has since moved to Stone Ridge, New York, where it offers workshops and trainings as well as publishing materials pertaining to the Enneagram. It is represented by the Enneagram Institute Network in more than 15 countries. Hudson participated in revising the book \"Personality Types\" for the second edition, which came out in 1996.\n\nRiso died on August 30, 2012, from metastasized pancreatic cancer. \n\n\n"}

The 'ECM' documents the history of the Greek text through the first millennium on the basis of Greek manuscripts, old translations, and New Testament citations in ancient Christian literature that are of significance to the history of transmission. On the basis of genealogical investigations of the material, first prepared with this completeness, the original text of the Greek New Testament is reconstructed.\nThe Editio Critica Maior project is supported by the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities. It is to be completed by the year 2030.\n\nSince the founding of the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung (INTF) in 1959 by Kurt Aland, manuscripts – some of which had previously been unknown or lost, were traced and photographed, and all known manuscripts were photographed and cataloged. The INTF thus acquired over 90% of the known material on microfilm or photo.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, a text program was developed. Uniform texts, which, as is well known, constituted the main part in the transmission of the high-middle age – have been dropped out. After the elimination of these texts, the material that is relevant to the textual history of the first millennium is now available: in addition to the manuscripts of this period, the numerous among later manuscripts, which reflect the older textual history. \nThe (still) very high number of relevant manuscripts is gradually transcribed and subjected to a complete text comparison (Vollkollation). The results are recorded in databases. For the first time this allows a computer-assisted exploration of the entire material. Above all, the acquisition of genealogical data is important, which illuminates the textual history and especially its beginnings. \n\nThe institute uses digital methods at all levels of its philological work: handwriting is captured in the highest possible quality as digital photos. These photos are the basis for the transcriptions to be made on the computer. Additionally digitized material from other institutes is taken into consideration. The software Collate is then used to prepare the critical edition. \n\nIn 1997 the first installment of this edition was published by Barbara Aland. The \"Catholic Letters\" and also \"The Acts of the Apostels\" are available printed and digitally (by using the New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room). In cooperation with the International Greek New Testament Project, the \"Johannesevangelium\" is in preparation. In addition an edition, that has been published in printed form, a digital platform - the New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room has been developed, which allows online access to all data collected during the work on the ECM. This includes above all the diplomatic transcripts of all the manuscripts used in the ECM and the databases on which the ECM is based on. \nThe recent editions of \"Nestle-Aland\" in the 28th edition and the 5th edition of the \"Greek New Testament\" of the \"United Bible Societies\" are in the text after the ECM, as far as it has been published so far.\n\nThe \"Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior\" is published by Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft (the German Bible Society).\n\nThe Acts of the Apostels\nCatholic Letters\nParallel Pericopes\n\n\n"}

It asks crucial questions about human environmental relations such as \"What do we mean when we talk about nature?\" \"What is the value of the natural, that is non-human environment to us, or in itself?\" \"How should we respond to environmental challenges such as environmental degradation, pollution and climate change?\" \"How can we best understand the relationship between the natural world and human technology and development?\" and \"What is our place in the natural world?\" As such, it uniquely positions itself as a field set to deal with the challenges of the 21st Century. Environmental philosophy includes environmental ethics, environmental aesthetics, ecofeminism, environmental hermeneutics, and environmental theology. Some of the main areas of interest for environmental philosophers are:\n\n\nModern issues within environmental philosophy include but are not restricted to the concerns of environmental activism as well as the questions raised by environmental science and technology. These include issues related to the depletion of finite resources and other harmful and permanent effects brought on to the environment by humans, as well as the ethical and practical problems raised by philosophies and practices of environmental conservation, restoration, and policy in general. A haunting question that has settled on the minds of modern environmental philosophers is \"Do rivers have rights?\" At the same time environmental philosophy deals with the value human beings attach to different kinds of environmental experience, particularly how experiences in or close to non-human environments contrast with urban or industrialized experiences, and how this varies across cultures.\n\nEnvironmental Philosophy re-emerged as a major social movement in the 1970s. The movement was an attempt to connect with humanity's sense of alienation from nature in a continuing fashion throughout history. This was very closely related to the development at the same time of ecofeminism, an intersecting discipline. Since then its areas of concern have expanded significantly.\n\nThe field is today characterized by a notable diversity of stylistic, philosophical and cultural approaches to human environmental relationships, from personal and poetic reflections on environmental experience and arguments for panpsychism to Malthusian applications of game theory or the question of how to put an economic value on nature's services. A major debate arose in the 1970s and 80s was that of whether nature has intrinsic value in itself independent of human values or whether its value is merely instrumental, with ecocentric or deep ecology approaches emerging on the one hand versus consequentialist or pragmatist anthropocentric approaches on the other.\n\nAnother debate that arose at this time was the debate over whether there really is such a thing as wilderness or not, or whether it is merely a cultural construct with colonialist implications. Since then, readings of environmental history and discourse have become more critical and refined. In this ongoing debate, a diversity of dissenting voices have emerged from different cultures across the globe questioning the dominance of Western assumptions, helping to transform the field.\n\nIn recent decades, there has been a significant challenge to deep ecology and the concepts of nature that underlie it, some arguing that there is not really such a thing as nature at all beyond some self-contradictory and even politically dubious constructions of an ideal other that ignore the real human-environmental interactions that shape our world and lives. This has been alternately dubbed the postmodern, constructivist, and most recently post-naturalistic turn in environmental philosophy. Environmental aesthetics, design and restoration have emerged as important intersecting disciplines that keep shifting the boundaries of environmental thought, as have the science of climate change and biodiversity and the ethical, political and epistemological questions they raise. Today, environmental philosophy is a burgeoning and increasingly relevant field.\n\nIn 1984, George Sessions and Arne Naess articulated the principles of the new Deep Ecology Movement.\nThese basic principles are:\n\n\n"}

He studied liberal arts at the University of Leuven and attended the Grand Séminaire of Liège. After his conversion to Calvinism in 1616 he went to the Dutch Republic. He studied theology at the Collège Wallon at Leiden, but he broke off his studies in 1621. The following ten years Reneri worked as a private tutor to the children of several Amsterdam merchant-regents, including Adriaan Pauw. In the meantime he studied medicine at Leiden University. In 1631 he found a position as professor of philosophy at the illustrious school of Deventer, the Illustre Gymnasium. From 1634 he held the same chair at the newly founded illustrious school of Utrecht, which was raised to the status of university in 1636. He died only three years later, at the age of 46.\n\nReneri mainly taught scholastic logic and natural philosophy. Apart from his professorship, he worked on a method of his own in the Ramist tradition. This method met especially with much enthusiasm within the Hartlib circle, the European network around the English pansophist Samuel Hartlib. Furthermore, Reneri was engaged in experiments and inventions in the fields of optics, thermometers, water clocks, alchemy and natural magic.\n\nReneri was one of the best friends of René Descartes and an admirer of his philosophy.

It was first published in 1984 as volume 53 of Heidegger's \"Gesamtausgabe\". The translation by William McNeill and Julia Davis was published in 1996 by Indiana University Press. \"Der Ister\" is a poem by Friedrich Hölderlin, the title of which refers to an ancient name for a part of the Danube River.\n\nIn 1942, in the darkest depths of World War II and the National Socialist period, Heidegger chose to deliver a lecture course on a single poem by Friedrich Hölderlin: \"\"Der Ister\",\" about the river Danube. The course explored the meaning of poetry, the nature of technology, the relationship between ancient Greece and modern Germany, the essence of politics, and human dwelling. The central third of the lecture course is a reading of Sophocles' \"Antigone\". Heidegger undertakes this reading of \"Antigone\" ostensibly because of the importance of this text for grasping the meaning of Hölderlin's poetry, but in doing so he repeats and extends a reading he had conducted in a different context in 1935. In terms of Heidegger's \"oeuvre\", the 1942 lecture course is significant in that it is Heidegger's most sustained discussion of the essence of politics. Heidegger was only able to deliver two-thirds of the written text of the lecture course.\n\nThe lecture course is divided into three parts.\n\n\nThe lecture course opens with a reflection on the Greek origin of the word \"hymn,\" meaning song of praise, specifically in praise of the gods, the heroes, or contest victors, in preparation of the festival. Heidegger cites a line from Sophocles' \"Antigone\" connecting the noun and verb forms of the word, and then indicates that the sense in which Hölderlin's works are hymns must initially remain an open question.\n\nHeidegger turns his attention to the first line of \"Der Ister\"—\"Now come, fire!\" What could this mean, if \"fire\" here indicates the sun or the dawn? What could it mean to call, or to have the vocation for such a calling, given that the dawn will come whether it is called or not? And what is meant by \"Now,\" by naming the time of such a calling? From these questions Heidegger is drawn to ask what it means to \"poetise,\" answering that poetising is always inaugurating something, that genuine poetising is always poetising \"anew.\" Thus the \"Now\" of the first line speaks not only of the present, but toward the future.\n\nHeidegger next focuses on the fact that it is clear that \"the rivers come to language\" in Hölderlin's poetry. On the one hand, the rivers are detached from human being, having their own \"spirit\"; on the other hand, the rivers are a locale at which human beings find their dwelling place. The question is thus that of the poetic essence of the river.\n\nRather than delving immediately into this question, Heidegger makes a detour, elaborating the \"metaphysical interpretation of art.\" He argues that metaphysical interpretations are incapable of comprehending Hölderlin's poetry.\n\nAccording to the metaphysical interpretation, art presents objects in nature such as rivers, but this presentation is at the service of something else, of their \"meaning\" in the artwork. Heidegger speaks in this regard of the etymology of the words \"allegory\" and \"metaphor.\" The metaphysical interpretation of art relies on the distinction between the sensuous and the non-sensuous, the aesthetic and the noetic, the sensible and the intelligible. And according to this interpretation the artwork exists not for itself, not \"as\" a sensuous object, but \"for\" the nonsensuous and suprasensuous, which is also named \"spirit.\" In this way the superior and the true come to be identified with the spiritual.\n\nAgainst the metaphysical interpretation of art, Heidegger asserts that the rivers in Hölderlin's poetry are in no way symbolic images of a higher or deeper content. He draws attention to the final lines of the poem—\"Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows\"—in order to indicate that, whatever the rivers are, or whatever the river does, remains an enigma. Even the poet knows only that the river flows, but not what is \"decided\" in that flowing.\n\nHeidegger then turns to a consideration of the river as the dwelling place of human beings. As such, the river is what brings human beings into their own and maintains them there. Yet what is their own often remains foreign to human beings for a long time, and can be abandoned by them because it threatens to overwhelm them. It is not something that produces itself, but must come to be appropriate, and needs to be appropriated. The river is of assistance in the becoming-homely of human beings, but this \"assistance\" is not an occasional support but a steadfast standing by.\n\nTo understand what this means, Heidegger considers some lines from another Hölderlin poem, \"Voice of the People,\" in which the rivers are referred to as \"vanishing\" and as \"full of intimation.\" That the rivers are vanishing means that they abandon the human landscape, without thereby being unfaithful toward that landscape. Yet as full of intimation, the rivers proceed into what is coming. Thus Heidegger sees Hölderlin as concerned with the temporality of the river in relation to the human, yet also with its spatiality—thus \"the river is the journeying.\" The river is, he says, the journeying of becoming homely or, rather, the very locality attained in and through the journeying. His claim is that the river is the locality of the dwelling of human beings as historical upon the earth.\n\nThe river is an enigma (\"\"). But Heidegger relates this to \"Raten\", giving counsel, and to \"Rat\", counsel, but also \"care.\" To give counsel means to take into care. That the river is an enigma does not mean it is a puzzle we should wish to \"solve.\" Rather, it means it is something we should bring closer to us \"as\" an enigma. We must understand this poetry, therefore, in something other than a calculative, technical way.\n\nLocality and journeying: this sounds like \"space and time.\" Succession takes its course in time, as a sequence of moments, as a \"flowing.\" But this is in fact only an understanding of space and time as an ordered, calculable, relationality. Whatever is subject to order must be posited in advance in such a way that it becomes accessible for order and control. Hence, for example, the reduction to co-ordinates. Yet for calculative observation, something is what it is only through what it performs. All modern thinking thinks in terms of order and performance. Human activity is thought as labour, equated with mechanical energy, and assessed according to the performative principle. Through such thinking space and time come to be considered so obvious as not to require any further thought.\n\nSuch modern thinking about space and time is essentially technological. Modern technology is different from every tool. Whereas the tool is a means, what is distinctive about modern technology is that this is no longer the case, and that it is instead unfolding a domination of its own. It demands its own kind of discipline and conquest. Thus, for example, the staged accomplishment of factories built for the purpose of fabricating machine tools for other factories. Modern machine technology is a specific kind of \"truth.\" We may believe that technology, as the control of space and time, is never undertaken without purpose, and is therefore no end in itself. This, however, is a misunderstanding grounded in a failure to grasp the essence of modern technology. And this results from failing to question that which underpins it—the order and unity of \"space and time.\"\n\nHeidegger then deconstructs the concepts of space and time, arguing firstly that these cannot be merely \"objects,\" as though they were some gigantic containers in which everything is accommodated. Yet neither can we conclude that they are merely subjective. Is space, over which wars erupt, merely imaginary? And is time, which tears us along and tears us away, merely subjective? Such metaphysical interpretations of space and time will be of no help in understanding the locality and journeying at the heart of Hölderlin's non-metaphysical poetising. Space and time comprise the framework for our calculative domination and ordering of the \"world\" through technology. But it remains undecided whether this process is turning human beings into mere planetary adventurers, or whether it is the beginning of another tendency, toward new forms of settlement and resettlement.\n\nAccording to Heidegger, that poetry of Hölderlin's taking the form of the \"hymn\" has taken into its care this becoming homely in one's own. He asserts that \"one's own\" is in this case the German fatherland, but immediately adds that \"coming to be at home is thus a passage through the foreign.\" This is why this poetry necessarily takes the form of a dialogue with foreign poets, specifically, Pindar and Sophocles. What must be carefully listened to in the hymnal poetry of Hölderlin is this \"resonance\" of Greek poetry, on which basis Heidegger turns to the interpretation of \"Antigone\".\n\nThe choral ode from the \"Antigone\" of Sophocles is according to Heidegger the singular work radiating throughout the poetry of Hölderlin. Heidegger had previously interpreted this ode in his 1935 lecture course, \"An Introduction to Metaphysics\", and in 1942 he both recapitulates and extends this interpretation.\n\nLike \"\"Der Ister\",\" the ode begins with a call to the dawning sun, yet it is clear the ode is equally concerned with darkness. Although the ode is concerned with the light and darkness of human being, this should not be interpreted to mean that the two main figures, Creon and Antigone, form an opposition. Each of these figures proceed from out of the unity of essence and nonessence, but differently in each case.\n\nThe decisive word, according to Heidegger, occurs at the beginning of the ode: \"deinon\". Heidegger translates this as \"das Unheimliche\", the uncanny. Heidegger emphasises what he calls the \"counterturning\" character of the term. \"Deinon\", he says, means the fearful, the powerful, and the inhabitual. But none of these definitional elements is one-dimensional. As the fearful, the \"deinon\" is also that which, as worthy of honour, can awaken awe. As the powerful, it may be that which looms over us, or that which is merely violent. As the inhabitual, the extraordinary, the extraordinariness of skill, it exceeds the ordinary, but it can do so as that which governs the ordinary and the habitual. As \"das Unheimliche\", \"deinon\" names the unity of all these meanings.\n\nThe ode names the human being as \"deinon\" in manifold ways, indeed as the \"most\" uncanny being, \"das Unheimlichste\". Heidegger ties this to his prior argument that human beings as poetised by Hölderlin are \"unhomely\" (\"unheimisch\"), that is, on the way toward becoming homely. The extraordinariness of human being is this being un-homely that is also a becoming homely. Heidegger makes clear that this being unhomely does not mean simply homelessness, wandering around, adventurousness, or lack of rootedness. Rather, it means that the sea and the land are those realms that human beings transform through skillfulness and use. The homely is that which is striven for in the violent activity of passing through the inhabitual. Yet even so, the homely is not attained in this activity: as the ode says, man \"comes to nothing.\"\n\nHuman being is thus the being which finds passage through everything, yet always comes up short, expressed in the couple \"pantoporos aporos\", where \"poros\" means that irruption of power that finds its way through. Infinitely skillful and artful, human beings nevertheless can never circumvent death. This is something known by human beings, but mostly in the form of evading this knowledge. Human beings are in fact those beings which comport themselves to beings as such, and because they understand being, human beings alone can also forget being. The uncanniness of human beings is that they alone are capable of \"catastrophe,\" in the sense of a reversal turning them away from their own essence.\n\nHeidegger next turns to the couple \"hypsipolis apolis\", \"towering high above the site,\" and \"forfeiting the site.\" This couple is based in the word \"polis\", and Heidegger notes that, if this is the \"origin\" of the word \"political,\" then it is a mistake to understand the former on the basis of the latter—the \"polis\" is precisely not a political concept. The \"political\" is conventionally understood in terms of consciousness, in a \"technical\" manner, as the way in which history is accomplished. It is thus marked by a failure to question itself.\n\nHeidegger asks whether the \"polis\" might not be the name of that realm which constantly becomes questionable anew and remains worthy of question. Perhaps the \"polis\" is that around which everything question-worthy and uncanny turns in an exceptional way. Heidegger uses the word \"Wirbel\", swirl, in this context, and speaks of the \"polis\" as essentially \"polar.\" The pre-political essence of the \"polis\", that which makes possible everything which we call political, is the open site from out of which all human relations toward beings are determined.\n\nIt is thus the essence of human being to both ascend within their site and to be without site. Human being bears within it this potential for reversal, a potential essentially grounded in the possibility of being mistaken, of taking nonbeings for beings and beings for nonbeings. Thus human beings are creatures of risk. They seek to become homely within a site, place everything at stake in this, and encounter the fact that the homely refuses itself to them.\n\nThis is the uncanniness of human being, and this is why \"deinon\" does not mean simply power and violence. Human beings do not themselves make themselves the most uncanny thing; it is not a matter of self-consciousness here. Only because human beings can say \"it is,\" Heidegger says, can they say \"I am.\" And only because they have a relation to being can they \"say\" at all, that is, can they be Aristotle's \"zoon logon echon\". It is the distinction of human beings, in other words, to \"see\" the open.\n\nThe closing words of the ode speak of the expulsion of the most uncanny from the hearth. If we were to interpret this as a rejection of Creon, according to Heidegger, then the choral ode would not be a \"high song of culture\" so much as a song in praise of mediocrity, of hatred toward the exception. To interpret otherwise than this means asking where Antigone herself stands in relation to the \"deinon\".\n\nIn the introductory dialogue between Antigone and Ismene, Ismene tries to dissuade her sister from her resolution to bury their brother. Antigone's \"pursuit\" is, she says, concerned with that against which nothing can avail. Antigone, in other words, takes the impossible as her point of departure. She says herself that she wishes to suffer or bear the uncanny. In this she is removed from all human possibilities, and is the supreme uncanny.\n\nWhat, then, of the hearth? The chorus speaks not only of expulsion, but of \"not sharing their delusion with my knowing.\" All knowledge of the \"deinon\" is sustained and guided by that knowing which knows the hearth. The content of this knowing is not stated directly, but it is, however, referred to as a \"phronein\", a meditating from the heart. If this knowledge takes the form of intimation, it is not mere opinion.\n\nIf mythology is not simply an \"immature\" invention, then thinking stands in an essential relation to poetising. Thinking is not the sediment left after the demythologising of myth. Such reflections are intended by Heidegger to assist in the following gesture: the assertion that the hearth, named by the chorus, is being. \"Being is the hearth.\" He then cites Plato on Hestia, the goddess named for the hearth. The expulsion referred to in the closing words of the choral ode is not a rejection of the unhomely, as much as an impulsion to be attentive to the homely, to risk belonging to it. Being unhomely is a not yet awakened, not yet decided, potential for being homely. This is Antigone's supreme action.\n\nIn Heidegger's translation, what determines this action is stated by Antigone as being beyond both the upper and lower gods, beyond Zeus and Dike, but neither can it be any human ordinance. Hence at stake in her action is the most uncanny risk. The closing words of the ode call in the direction of a knowledge of the proper essence of the unhomely one. In this most enigmatic part of his interpretation, Heidegger speaks of \"the risk of distinguishing and deciding between that being unhomely proper to human beings and a being unhomely that is inappropriate.\" To be this risk is Antigone's essence.\n\nThus Heidegger concludes that to understand the truth of \"Antigone\", it is necessary to think beyond the cult of the dead or the cult of blood-relatedness, which seem at first glance to be the motors of the tragedy. Antigone, he says, is herself the purest poem. Poetising is neither finding nor inventing, but a telling finding of being, revealing that which is always already revealed, the nearest of all that is near. The human potential for being, and the unhomely being homely of human beings upon the earth, is poetic. What is spoken in the choral ode remains indeterminate, but neither vague nor arbitrary. The indeterminate is, on the contrary, that which is undecided yet first to be decided. If this is the case, then the tragedy poetises that which is in the highest sense worthy of poetising. And this may be why this ode came to speak ever anew to the poet Hölderlin.\n\nSophocles' ode and Hölderlin's river hymns poetise the Same, yet they are not identical. To understand this, Heidegger turns to Hölderlin's famous letter to , which thematises the relations between Germany and Greece. According to Heidegger's reading, what for the Greeks is their own is what is foreign to the Germans, and what is foreign to the Germans is what is proper to the Greeks. Hölderlin is the first to experience poetically that becoming homely means being unhomely, thus to understand the need of being unhomely, which he does by venturing into an encounter with the (Greek) foreign.\n\nHeidegger then cites Hölderlin: \"namely at home is spirit / not at the commencement, not at the source.\" He asks: who is \"spirit\"? Despite the influence of German metaphysics, Heidegger argues that Hölderlin's use of this word was singular, as that which is alongside itself in thinking itself, and always as \"communal\" spirit. What spirit thinks is that which is fittingly destined for human beings, yet this is always that which is futural, never something that has been decided; it is something \"non-actual\" that is already \"acting.\" Poetising is the telling of the thoughts of spirit.\n\nSpirit is never \"at home\" in the beginning. At the beginning of the history of a people, their destiny is assigned, but what has been assigned is in coming; it is still veiled and equivocal. In the beginning, the ability to fit oneself to one's destiny is as yet disordered, unpracticed. Thus in spirit there prevails the longing for its own essence. But \"spirit loves colony,\" that is, in the foreign it wills the mother who is difficult to attain. And it loves \"bold forgetting,\" where forgetting means the readiness to learn from the foreign for the sake of what is one's own, so as to defer what is one's own until it is time. It is in this way that the law of being unhomely is the law of becoming homely.\n\nThe Greeks, too, had to pass through the foreign. What was proper to the Greeks was \"the fire from the heavens\"; what was foreign was the \"clarity of presentation.\" Through what was foreign to them they were able to build at the essential ground of the \"polis\". For the Germans, on the other hand, the clarity of presentation is natural—the formation of projects, frameworks, etc. What is foreign is the fire from heaven, and thus they must learn to be struck by this fire, and thereby impelled to the correct appropriation of their gift for presentation. Otherwise they shall be exposed to the weakness of suppressing every fire, of pursuing delimitation and institution only for the sake of it. Hölderlin is the one who has been struck by this fire, yet why must this be said poetically?\n\nHeidegger cites Hölderlin in order to seek an answer to this question. \"Full of merit, yet poetically / Humans dwell upon the earth.\" \"Full of merit\" refers, according to Heidegger, to all that humans achieve through the arts, through \"tekhne\", but all that is achieved this way amounts merely to culture. It can be achieved only on the basis of a \"dwelling\" which can be seized upon through making or achieving within the realm of the actual. Dwelling, the becoming homely of a being unhomely, is grounded in the poetic.\n\nBut what is poetry? There must be a poet who poetises in advance the essence of poetry. This will be the poet who ventures into the foreign, to let the fire come toward him. This is what occurs in Hölderlin's hymnal poetry. This river poetry never forgets the source, in its issuing and flowing from the source. What it says is the holy, which, \"beyond\" the gods, determines the gods. The poet stands between human beings and gods. The poet, and the river, are demigods.\n\nHeidegger speaks of the lines of the hymn concerning the invitation to Hercules. We can know nothing of the Ister or the hymn if we do not understand who this guest is. The appropriation of one's own \"is\" only as the encounter and guest-like dialogue with the foreign. The river must remain in the realm of its source in such a way that it flows toward it from out of the foreign, which is why it \"appears, however, almost / To go backwards.\" Heidegger again uses the word \"Wirbeln\" to indicate this swirling near the source.\n\nThis relation to the foreign is never an affirmation of the \"natural\" or the \"organic.\" These are foreign to the law of history. This law places historical humankind on the difficult path toward its essence. If humankind abandons the law of history, it falls into the unhistorical. Nature is ahistorical, but being \"un\"historical, as a \"rupture\" with the historical, is a particular kind of catastrophe. Heidegger's example of the unhistorical is Americanism.\n\nThe Ister remains enigmatic but historical, in the strange way it flows but also remains close to the source. It is the river in which the foreign is already present as a guest at its source, the river in whose flowing there constantly speaks the dialogue between one's own and the foreign. The rivers are the poets who found the poetic, upon whose ground human beings dwell. Thus the poetic spirit of the river makes arable the land—it prepares the ground for the hearth of the house of history, opening the time-space within which a belonging to the hearth is possible.\n\n\"A sign is needed\": Hölderlin speaks of the sign as having a mind (\"Gemüt\"), where mind is the ground of all mindful courage (\"Mut\"). It is the poet who is named here as the sign. What is needed is the poet's word. Heidegger cites the poem \"Andenken\": \"Yet what remains, the poets found.\" Heidegger relates the sign's showing to pain, to that knowing proper to being distinct. The sign, the demigod, the river, the poet: all these name poetically the singular ground of the becoming homely of human beings as historical, and the founding of this ground by the poet. At stake is a \"partaking in feeling\" with the gods, bearing the sun and moon, sharing the holy. This is for the benefit not only of human beings, but of the gods themselves, who are otherwise without feeling, without unity.\n\nThrough the sign, through the rivers, the heavenly find their unity with one another, a unity which does not diminish their singularity. The rivers are their \"joy.\" Hölderlin speaks of staircases on which the heavenly can descend. Where there are staircases, a dwelling place is also opened up poetically for humans. Poetising founding builds the stairs for this descent of the heavenly. The rivers are the children of the heavens, signs that bear sun and moon in mind, but at the same time the sons of the earth.\n\nThe hymn ends on an enigmatic note: \"Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows.\" What the vocation of the Ister is, it well knows, but the Rhine, which does not linger at its source but departs sideways, is altogether concealed. Yet the Ister hymn too breaks off—it shows, it makes manifest, yet it also conceals.\n\nHeidegger appends a concluding remark to his reading of the poem. His remarks on the hymn were intended to make us attentive to the poetising of the rivers. But because this is the poetising of the essence of poetry, concealed relations prevail. Such poetry cannot at all be referred to the poet's ego, or to \"subjectivity.\" The poet is the river, and vice versa. The unity of locality and journeying here cannot be conceived in terms of \"space\" and \"time,\" for these are themselves the offspring of the realm that lets their openness spring forth.\n\nThis poetry demands a transformation in our ways of thinking and experiencing, and we must think beyond representations, symbols, and images. But if we must find a new measure, it must be asked whether we are capable of it. Hölderlin asks about this measure, and concludes there is no such measure on earth. This sounds like despair. Yet what Hölderlin means is that we must dwell poetically upon this earth, bearing and suffering it rather than forcing and seizing it. If we are strong enough to think, it may be sufficient for us to ponder from afar the truth of this poetry and what it poetises, so that we may suddenly be struck by it. Heidegger ends with a quotation from yet another Hölderlin hymn, \"The Journey\":\n\nThe lecture course formed the basis of the 2004 film \"The Ister\".\n"}
{"id": "2049301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049301", "title": "Idealization (science philosophy)", "text": "Idealization (science philosophy)\n\nIdealization is the process by which scientific models assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. That is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an \"ideal case,\" then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case.\n\nIf an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive accuracy; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for air resistance when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. In this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. Although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity.\n\nIdealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. For example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of Stokes' law allowed the calculation of drag forces. Many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations.\n\nGalileo utilized the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of free fall. Galileo, in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. The crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency.\n\nThe most well-known example of idealization in Galileo's experiments is in his analysis of motion. Galileo predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires friction). This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance.\n\nGeometry involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. Perfect circles, spheres, straight lines and angles are abstractions that help us think about and investigate the world.\n\nAn example of the use of idealization in physics is in Boyle’s Gas Law:\n\"Given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa.\"\n\nIn physics, people will often solve for Newtonian systems without friction. While we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the force of friction is negligible.\n\nIt has been argued by the \"Poznań School\" (in Poland) that Karl Marx utilized idealization in the social sciences (see the works written by Leszek Nowak). Similarly, in economic models individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices. This assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations.\n\nIn psychology, idealization refers to a defence mechanism in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. This sometimes occurs in child custody conflicts. The child of a single parent frequently may imagine (\"idealize\") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. However, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. Upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had.\n\nWhile idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others. For instance, Edmund Husserl recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization.\n\nAlthough idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern science, it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the philosophy of science. For example, Nancy Cartwright suggested that Galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for extrapolation beyond what is the ideal case.\n\nThere is continued philosophical concern over how Galileo’s idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. Since the laws created through idealization (such as the ideal gas law) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. Laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed.\n\n"}

Other beliefs may be rationally justified, but they do not rise to the level of \"knowledge\" unless absolutely certain given one's evidence. Infallibilism's opposite, fallibilism, is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge, even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or can, given one's evidence, rationally doubt it. \n\nFallibilism is not to be confused with skepticism, which is the belief that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. René Descartes, an early proponent of infallibilism argued, “my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false” Infallibilism can be expressed in logic as \"if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p\". \n\nFallibilism is endorsed by most contemporary epistemologists, though many in epistemology have recently presented significant arguments against fallibilism, and for infalliblism.\n\nIn religion, infallibilism is the belief that certain texts or persons are incapable of being in the wrong. The most famous example of this is probably the Catholic doctrine of papal infallibility, under which the Pope is considered infallible in certain matters of doctrine, when his decisions are promulgated \"ex cathedra\". Since 1870, the Catholic Church has officially declared that its earthly head, the Pope, in certain circumstances, is so grounded in the mission of the church that he teaches \"infallibly\". Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of bishops as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.\n\n"}

Over the course of several decades, he planted and tended trees on a sandbar of the river Brahmaputra turning it into a forest reserve. The forest, called Molai forest after him, is located near Kokilamukh of Jorhat, Assam, India and encompasses an area of about 1,360 acres / 550 hectares. In 2015, he was honoured with Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. He is born in indigenous Mising tribe of Assam. \n\nIn 1979, Payeng, then 16, encountered a large number of snakes that had died due to excessive heat after floods washed them onto the tree-less sandbar. That is when he planted around 20 bamboo seedlings on the sandbar. He started working on the forest in 19 A.D.when the social forestry division of Golaghat district launched a scheme of tree plantation on 200 hectares at Aruna Chapori situated at a distance of 5 km from Kokilamukh in Jorhat district. Molai was one of the labourers who worked In that project which was completed after five years. He chose to stay back after the completion of the project even after other workers left. He not only looked after the plants, but continued to plant more trees on his own, in an effort to transform the area into a forest.\n\nThe forest, which came to be known as Molai forest, now houses Bengal tigers, Indian rhinoceros, and over 100 deer and rabbits. Molai forest is also Home to monkeys and several varieties of birds, Including a large number of vultures. There are several thousand trees, including valcol, arjun (\"Terminalia arjuna\"), ejar (\"Lagerstroemia speciosa\"), goldmohur (\"Delonix regia\"), koroi (\"Albizia procera\"), moj (\"Archidendron bigeminum\") and himolu (\"Bombax ceiba\"). Bamboo covers an area of over 300 hectares.\n\nA herd of around 100 elephants regularly visits the forest every year and generally stay for around six months. They have given birth to 10 calves in the forest in recent years.\n\nHis efforts became known to the authorities in 2008, when forest department officials went to the area in search of a herd of 115 elephants that had retreated into the forest after damaging property in the village of Aruna Chapori, which is about 1.5 km from the forest. The officials were surprised to see such a large and dense forest and since then the department has regularly visited the site.\n\nIn 2013, poachers tried to kill the rhinos staying in the forest but failed in their attempt due to Molai who alerted department officials. Officials promptly seized various articles used by the poachers to trap the animals.\n\nMolai is ready to manage the forest in a better way and to go to other places of the state to start a similar venture. Now his aim is to spread his forest to another sand bar inside of Brahmaputra.\n\nJadav Payeng belongs to a tribe called \"Mising\" in Assam, India. He lives in a small hut in the forest. Binita, his wife, and his 3 children (two sons and a daughter) accompany him. He has cattle and buffalo on his farm and sells the milk for his livelihood, which is his only source of income. In an interview from 2012, he revealed that he has lost around 100 of his cows and buffaloes to the tigers in the forest, but blames the people who carry out large scale encroachment and destruction of forests as the root cause of the plight of wild animals.\n\nJadav Payeng was honoured at a public function arranged by the School of Environmental Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University on 22 April 2012 for his remarkable achievement. He shared his experience of creating a forest in an interactive session, where Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh and JNU vice-chancellor Sudhir Kumar Sopory were present. Sopory named Jadav Payeng as \"Forest Man of India\". In the month of October 2013, he was honoured at Indian Institute of Forest Management during their annual event Coalescence. In 2015, he was honoured with Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India.\n\nPayeng has been the subject of a number of documentaries in the recent years. A locally made film documentary, produced by Jitu Kalita in 2012 \"The Molai Forest\", was screened at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Jitu Kalita, who lives near Payeng's house, has also been featured and given recognition for good reporting by projecting the life of Payeng through his documentary.\n\nThe 2013 film documentary \"Foresting life\", directed by the Indian documentary filmmaker Aarti Shrivastava, celebrates the life and work of Jadav Payeng in the Molai forest. These are also the focus of William Douglas McMaster's 2013 film documentary \"Forest Man\". With 8,327 USD pledged on its Kickstarter campaign, the film was brought to completion and taken to a number of film festivals.

{"id": "16143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16143", "title": "John Locke", "text": "John Locke\n\nJohn Locke (; 29 August 1632 – 28 October 1704) was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the \"Father of Liberalism\". Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Sir Francis Bacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nLocke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as David Hume, Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of consciousness. He postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate or \"tabula rasa\". Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception. This is now known as empiricism. An example of Locke's belief in empiricism can be seen in his quote, \"whatever I write, as soon as I discover it not to be true, my hand shall be the forwardest to throw it into the fire.\" This shows the ideology of science in his observations in that something must be capable of being tested repeatedly and that nothing is exempt from being disproven. Challenging the work of others, Locke is said to have established the method of introspection, or observing the emotions and behaviours of one’s self.\n\nLocke's father, also called John, was an attorney who served as clerk to the Justices of the Peace in Chew Magna; he had served as a captain of cavalry for the Parliamentarian forces during the early part of the English Civil War. His mother was Agnes Keene. Both parents were Puritans. Locke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched cottage by the church in Wrington, Somerset, about 12 miles from Bristol. He was baptised the same day. Soon after Locke's birth, the family moved to the market town of Pensford, about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural Tudor house in Belluton.\n\nIn 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious Westminster School in London under the sponsorship of Alexander Popham, a member of Parliament and his father's former commander. After completing studies there, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in the autumn of 1652 at the age of twenty. The dean of the college at the time was John Owen, vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found the works of modern philosophers, such as René Descartes, more interesting than the classical material taught at the university. Through his friend Richard Lower, whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the Royal Society, of which he eventually became a member.\n\nLocke was awarded a bachelor's degree in February 1656 and a master's degree in June 1658. He obtained a bachelor of medicine in February 1675, having studied medicine extensively during his time at Oxford and worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as Robert Boyle, Thomas Willis, Robert Hooke and Richard Lower. In 1666, he met Lord Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection. Cooper was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue.\n\nLocke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Shaftesbury's home at Exeter House in London, to serve as Lord Ashley's personal physician. In London, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of Thomas Sydenham. Sydenham had a major effect on Locke's natural philosophical thinkingan effect that would become evident in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\"\n\nLocke's medical knowledge was put to the test when Shaftesbury's liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Shaftesbury to undergo surgery (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst. Shaftesbury survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life.\n\nDuring this time, Locke served as Secretary of the Board of Trade and Plantations and Secretary to the Lords Proprietor of Carolina, which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics.\n\nShaftesbury, as a founder of the Whig movement, exerted great influence on Locke's political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Shaftesbury became Lord Chancellor in 1672. Following Shaftesbury's fall from favour in 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across France as tutor and medical attendant to Caleb Banks. He returned to England in 1679 when Shaftesbury's political fortunes took a brief positive turn. Around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury's prompting, Locke composed the bulk of the \"Two Treatises of Government\". While it was once thought that Locke wrote the \"Treatises\" to defend the Glorious Revolution of 1688, recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date. The work is now viewed as a more general argument against absolute monarchy (particularly as espoused by Robert Filmer and Thomas Hobbes) and for individual consent as the basis of political legitimacy. Although Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about natural rights and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history.\n\nLocke fled to the Netherlands in 1683, under strong suspicion of involvement in the Rye House Plot, although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme. The philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein argues that during his five years in Holland, Locke chose his friends \"from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as Spinoza's small group of loyal confidants. [Baruch Spinoza had died in 1677.] Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who... insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone.\" While she says that \"Locke's strong empiricist tendencies\" would have \"disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinoza's \"Ethics\", in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinoza's ideas, most particularly to the rationalist's well thought out argument for political and religious tolerance and the necessity of the separation of church and state.\"\n\nIn the Netherlands, Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time re-working the \"Essay\" and composing the \"Letter on Toleration.\" Locke did not return home until after the Glorious Revolution. Locke accompanied Mary II back to England in 1688. The bulk of Locke's publishing took place upon his return from exilehis aforementioned \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", the \"Two Treatises of Civil Government\" and \"A Letter Concerning Toleration\" all appearing in quick succession.\n\nLocke's close friend Lady Masham invited him to join her at the Mashams' country house in Essex. Although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks, he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs. During this period he discussed matters with such figures as John Dryden and Isaac Newton.\n\nHe died on 28 October 1704, and is buried in the churchyard of the village of High Laver, east of Harlow in Essex, where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691. Locke never married nor had children.\n\nEvents that happened during Locke's lifetime include the English Restoration, the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London. He did not quite see the Act of Union of 1707, though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in personal union throughout his lifetime. Constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy were in their infancy during Locke's time.\n\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Locke's \"Two Treatises\" were rarely cited. Historian Julian Hoppit said of the book, \"except among some Whigs, even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made 'a great noise')\". John Kenyon, in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke's theories were \"mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the [Glorious] Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them\" and that \"no one, including most Whigs, [were] ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke\". In contrast, Kenyon adds that Algernon Sidney's \"Discourses Concerning Government\" were \"certainly much more influential than Locke's \"Two Treatises\"\".\n\nIn the 50 years after Queen Anne's death in 1714, the \"Two Treatises\" were reprinted only once (except in the collected works of Locke). However, with the rise of American resistance to British taxation, the \"Second Treatise\" gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain. The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston.\n\nLocke exercised a profound influence on political philosophy, in particular on modern liberalism. Michael Zuckert has argued that Locke launched liberalism by tempering Hobbesian absolutism and clearly separating the realms of Church and State. He had a strong influence on Voltaire who called him \"\"le sage\" Locke\". His arguments concerning liberty and the social contract later influenced the written works of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and other Founding Fathers of the United States. In fact, one passage from the \"Second Treatise\" is reproduced verbatim in the Declaration of Independence, the reference to a \"long train of abuses\". Such was Locke's influence that Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"Bacon, Locke and Newton... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".\n\nBut Locke's influence may have been even more profound in the realm of epistemology. Locke redefined subjectivity, or self, and intellectual historians such as Charles Taylor and Jerrold Seigel argue that Locke's \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690) marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the self.\n\nLocke's theory of association heavily influenced the subject matter of modern psychology. At the time, the empiricist philosopher's recognition of two types of ideas, \"simple\" and \"complex\" ideas, more importantly their interaction through associationism inspired other philosophers, such as David Hume and George Berkeley, to revise and expand this theory and apply it to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world.\n\nLocke, writing his \"Letters Concerning Toleration\" (1689–1692) in the aftermath of the European wars of religion, formulated a classic reasoning for religious tolerance. Three arguments are central: (1) Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) Even if they could, enforcing a single \"true religion\" would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence; (3) Coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.\n\nWith regard to his position on religious tolerance, Locke was influenced by Baptist theologians like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, who had published tracts demanding freedom of conscience in the early 17th century. Baptist theologian Roger Williams founded the colony Rhode Island in 1636, where he combined a democratic constitution with unlimited religious freedom. His tract \"The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience\" (1644), which was widely read in the mother country, was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total separation of church and state. Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological, philosophical and political agenda, since Martin Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms in 1521, unless he would be proved false by the Bible.\n\nAppraisals of Locke have often been tied to appraisals of liberalism in general, and to appraisals of the United States. Detractors note that (in 1671) he was a major investor in the English slave-trade through the Royal African Company. In addition, he participated in drafting the \"Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina\" while Shaftesbury's secretary, which established a feudal aristocracy and gave a master absolute power over his slaves. For example, Martin Cohen notes that Locke, as a secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations (1673–1674) and a member of the Board of Trade (1696–1700), was in fact, \"one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude\". Some see his statements on unenclosed property as having been intended to justify the displacement of the Native Americans. Because of his opposition to aristocracy and slavery in his major writings, he is accused of hypocrisy and racism, or of caring only for the liberty of English capitalists. Locke also drafted implementing instructions for the Carolina colonists designed to ensure that settlement and development was consistent with the Fundamental Constitutions. Collectively, these documents are known as the Grand Model for the Province of Carolina.\n\nLocke uses the word \"property\" in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour. In Chapter V of his \"Second Treatise\", Locke argues that the individual ownership of goods and property is justified by the labour exerted to produce those goods or utilise property to produce goods beneficial to human society.\n\nLocke stated his belief, in his \"Second Treatise\", that nature on its own provides little of value to society, implying that the labour expended in the creation of goods gives them their value. This position can be seen as a labour theory of value. From this premise, Locke developed a labour theory of property, namely that ownership of property is created by the application of labour. In addition, he believed that property precedes government and government cannot \"dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily.\" Karl Marx later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his own social theory.\n\nLocke's political theory was founded on social contract theory. Unlike Thomas Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature is characterised by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allowed people to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a natural state all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend his \"life, health, liberty, or possessions\". Most scholars trace the phrase \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\" in the American Declaration of Independence, to Locke's theory of rights, though other origins have been suggested.\n\nLike Hobbes, Locke assumed that the sole right to defend in the state of nature was not enough, so people established a civil society to resolve conflicts in a civil way with help from government in a state of society. However, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day. Locke also advocated governmental separation of powers and believed that revolution is not only a right but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.\n\nAccording to Locke, unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature, but, with the introduction of \"durable\" goods, men could exchange their excessive perishable goods for goods that would last longer and thus not offend the natural law. In his view, the introduction of money marks the culmination of this process, making possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage. He also includes gold or silver as money because they may be \"hoarded up without injury to anyone,\" since they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor. In his view, the introduction of money eliminates the limits of accumulation. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property. Locke is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem. However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example, labour theory of value of the \"Two Treatises of Government\" stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory developed in a letter he wrote titled \"Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money\". Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but in the end upholds the unlimited accumulation of wealth.\n\nLocke's general theory of value and price is a supply and demand theory, which was set out in a letter to a Member of Parliament in 1691, titled \"Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money\". He refers to supply as \"quantity\" and demand as \"rent\". \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers,\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.\" The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on \"money answers all things\" (Ecclesiastes) or \"rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough,\" and \"varies very little...\" Locke concludes that as far as money is concerned, the demand is exclusively regulated by its quantity, regardless of whether the demand for money is unlimited or constant. He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For supply, he explains the value of goods as based on their scarcity and ability to be exchanged and consumed. He explains demand for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income. Locke develops an early theory of capitalisation, such as land, which has value because \"by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income.\" He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land; it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange. As a medium of exchange, he states that \"money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life,\" and for loanable funds, \"it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income... or interest.\"\n\nLocke distinguishes two functions of money, as a \"counter\" to measure value, and as a \"pledge\" to lay claim to goods. He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to paper money, are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it.\n\nLocke argues that a country should seek a favourable balance of trade, lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world money stock grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock. Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine exchange rates. He considers the latter less significant and less volatile than commodity movements. As for a country's money stock, if it is large relative to that of other countries, he says it will cause the country's exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do.\n\nHe also prepares estimates of the cash requirements for different economic groups (landholders, labourers and brokers). In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokers – middlemen – whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders, have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute.\n\nLocke defines the self as \"that conscious thinking thing, (whatever substance, made up of whether spiritual, or material, simple, or compounded, it matters not) which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends\". He does not, however, ignore \"substance\", writing that \"the body too goes to the making the man.\"\n\nIn his \"Essay\", Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind. Arguing against both the Augustinian view of man as originally sinful and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions, Locke posits an \"empty\" mind, a \"tabula rasa\", which is shaped by experience; and reflections being the two sources of all our ideas.\n\nLocke's \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" is an outline on how to educate this mind: he expresses the belief that education maketh the man, or, more fundamentally, that the mind is an \"empty cabinet\", with the statement, \"I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education.\"\n\nLocke also wrote that \"the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences.\" He argued that the \"associations of ideas\" that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the self: they are, put differently, what first mark the \"tabula rasa\". In his \"Essay\", in which both these concepts are introduced, Locke warns against, for example, letting \"a foolish maid\" convince a child that \"goblins and sprites\" are associated with the night for \"darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other.\"\n\nThis theory came to be called \"associationism\", and it strongly influenced 18th-century thought, particularly educational theory, as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of psychology and other new disciplines with David Hartley's attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his \"Observations on Man\" (1749).\n\nLocke was critical of Descartes' version of the dream argument, with Locke making the counterargument that people cannot have physical pain in dreams as they do in waking life.\n\nSome scholars have seen Locke's political convictions as being based from his religious beliefs. Locke's religious trajectory began in Calvinist trinitarianism, but by the time of the \"Reflections\" (1695) Locke was advocating not just Socinian views on tolerance but also Socinian Christology. However Wainwright (1987) notes that in the posthumously published \"Paraphrase\" (1707) Locke's interpretation of one verse, Ephesians 1:10, is markedly different from that of Socinians like Biddle, and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an Arian position, thereby accepting Christ's pre-existence.\nLocke was at times not sure about the subject of original sin, so he was accused of Socinianism, Arianism, or Deism. But he did not deny the reality of evil. Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes. Criminals had to be punished, even with the death penalty. With regard to the Bible Locke was very conservative. He retained the doctrine of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures. The miracles were proof of the divine nature of the biblical message. Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason (\"The reasonableness of Christianity\", 1695). Although Locke was an advocate of tolerance, he urged the authorities not to tolerate atheism, because he thought the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos. That excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises. In Locke's opinion the cosmological argument was valid and proved God's existence. His political thought was based on Protestant Christian views.\n\nLocke's concept of man started with the belief in creation. Like philosophers Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf, Locke equated natural law with the biblical revelation. Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts, in particular from Genesis 1 and 2 (creation), the Decalogue, the Golden Rule, the teachings of Jesus, and the letters of Paul the Apostle. The Decalogue puts a person's life, their reputation, and property under God's protection. \n\nLocke's philosophy on freedom is also derived from the Bible. Locke also derived basic human equality from the Bible, including the equality of the sexes, the starting point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. To Locke, one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed. \n\nFollowing Locke's philosophy, the American Declaration of Independence founded human rights partially on the biblical belief in creation. Locke's doctrine that governments need the consent of the governed is also central to the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lesk in 1986.\nThe Lesk algorithm is based on the assumption that words in a given \"neighborhood\" (section of text) will tend to share a common topic. A simplified version of the Lesk algorithm is to compare the dictionary definition of an ambiguous word with the terms contained in its neighborhood. Versions have been adapted to use WordNet. An implementation might look like this:\n\nA frequently used example illustrating this algorithm is for the context \"pine cone\". The following dictionary definitions are used:\n\nAs can be seen, the best intersection is Pine #1 ⋂ Cone #3 = 2.\n\nIn Simplified Lesk algorithm, the correct meaning of each word in a given context is determined individually by locating the sense that overlaps the most between its dictionary definition and the given context. Rather than simultaneously determining the meanings of all words in a given context, this approach tackles each word individually, independent of the meaning of the other words occurring in the same context.\n\n\"A comparative evaluation performed by Vasilescu et al. (2004) has shown that the simplified Lesk algorithm can significantly outperform the original definition of the algorithm, both in terms of precision and efficiency. By evaluating the disambiguation algorithms on the Senseval-2 English all words data, they measure a 58% precision using the simplified Lesk algorithm compared to the only 42% under the original algorithm.\n\nNote: Vasilescu et al. implementation considers a back-off strategy for words not covered by the algorithm, consisting of the most frequent sense defined in WordNet. This means that words for which all their possible meanings lead to zero overlap with current context or with other word definitions are by default assigned sense number one in WordNet.\"\n\nSimplified LESK Algorithm with smart default word sense (Vasilescu et al., 2004) \nThe COMPUTEOVERLAP function returns the number of words in common between two sets, ignoring function words or other words on a stop list. The original Lesk algorithm defines the context in a more complex way.\n\nUnfortunately, Lesk’s approach is very sensitive to the exact wording of definitions, so the absence of a certain word can radically change the results. Further, the algorithm determines overlaps only among the glosses of the senses being considered. This is a significant limitation in that dictionary glosses tend to be fairly short and do not provide sufficient vocabulary to relate fine-grained sense distinctions.\n\nA lot of work has appeared offering different modifications of this algorithm. These works use other resources for analysis (thesauruses, synonyms dictionaries or morphological and syntactic models): for instance, it may use such information as synonyms, different derivatives, or words from definitions of words from definitions.\n\nThere are a lot of studies concerning Lesk and its extensions:\n\n\n\n"}

Lewis, an Anglican, intended to describe the Christian common ground. In \"Mere Christianity\", he aims at avoiding controversies to explain fundamental teachings of Christianity, for the sake of those basically educated as well as the intellectuals of his generation, for whom the jargon of formal Christian theology did not retain its original meaning.\n\nLewis spends most of his defence of the Christian faith on an argument from morality, a point which persuaded him from atheism to Christianity. He bases his case on a moral law, a \"rule about right and wrong\" commonly known to all human beings, citing the example of Nazism; both Christians and atheists believed that Adolf Hitler's actions were morally wrong. On a more mundane level, it is generally accepted that stealing is violating this moral law. Lewis argues that the moral law is like the law of nature in that it was not contrived by humans. However, it is unlike natural laws in that it can be broken or ignored, and it is known intuitively, rather than through observation. After introducing the moral law, Lewis argues that thirst reflects the fact that people naturally need water, and there is no other substance which satisfies that need. Lewis points out that earthly experience does not satisfy the human craving for \"joy\" and that only God could fit the bill; humans cannot know to yearn for something if it does not exist.\n\nAfter providing reasons for his conversion to theism, Lewis goes over rival conceptions of God to Christianity. Pantheism, he argues, is incoherent, and atheism too simple. Eventually he arrives at Jesus Christ, and invokes a well-known argument now known as \"Lewis's trilemma\". Lewis, arguing that Jesus was claiming to be God, uses logic to advance three possibilities: either he really was God, was deliberately lying, or was not God but thought himself to be (which would make him delusional and likely insane). The book goes on to say that the latter two possibilities are not consistent with Jesus' character and it was most likely that he was being truthful.\n\nLewis claims that to understand Christianity, one must understand the moral law, which is the underlying structure of the universe and is \"hard as nails.\" Unless one grasps the dismay which comes from humanity's failure to keep the moral law, one cannot understand the coming of Christ and his work. The eternal God who is the law's source takes primacy over the created Satan whose rebellion undergirds all evil. The death and resurrection of Christ is introduced as the only way in which our inadequate human attempts to redeem humanity's sins could be made adequate in God's eyes.\n\nGod \"became a man\" in Christ, Lewis says, so that mankind could be \"amalgamated with God's nature\" and make full atonement possible. Lewis offers several analogies to explain this abstract concept: that of Jesus \"paying the penalty\" for a crime, \"paying a debt\", or helping humanity out of a hole. His main point, however, is that redemption is so incomprehensible that it cannot be fully appreciated, and he attempts to explain that the method by which God atones for the sins of humanity is not nearly as important as the fact that he does so.\n\nThe next third of the book explores the ethics resulting from Christian belief. He cites the four cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude. After touching on these, he goes into the three theological virtues: hope, faith, and charity. Lewis also explains morality as being composed of three \"layers\": relationships between man and man, the motivations and attitudes of the man himself, and contrasting worldviews.\n\nLewis also covers such topics as social relations and forgiveness, sexual ethics and the tenets of Christian marriage, and the relationship between morality and psychoanalysis. He also writes about \"the great sin\": pride, which he argues to be the root cause of all evil and rebellion.\n\nHis most important point is that Christianity mandates that one \"love your neighbour as yourself.\" He points out that all persons unconditionally love themselves. Even if one does not \"like\" oneself, one would still love oneself. Christians, he writes, must also apply this attitude to others, even if they do not like them. Lewis calls this one of the \"great secrets\": when one acts as if he loves others, he will presently come to love them.\n\nIn 2006, \"Mere Christianity\" was placed third in \"Christianity Today\" list of the most influential books amongst evangelicals since 1945. The title has influenced \"Touchstone Magazine: A Journal of Mere Christianity\" and William Dembski's book \"Mere Creation\". Charles Colson's conversion to Christianity resulted from his reading this book, as did the conversions of Francis Collins, Jonathan Aitken, Josh Caterer, and the philosopher C. E. M. Joad.\n\nA passage in the book also influenced the name of contemporary Christian Texan Grammy-nominated pop/rock group Sixpence None the Richer. The phrase, \"the hammering process\" was used by the Christian metal band Living Sacrifice for the name of their album \"The Hammering Process\". The metalcore band Norma Jean derived the title of their song \"No Passenger: No Parasite\" from the section in the book in which Lewis describes a fully Christian society as having \"No passengers or parasites\".\n\n"}

(17 March 1926 – 1 February 2015) was an Irish-American Jesuit priest, physicist, and philosopher of science. He was William A. Gaston Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University.\n\nPatrick A. Heelan was born in Dublin. He joined the Society of Jesus at 16, received his B.A. in 1947 and his M.A. in 1948, all with first-class Honors, in mathematics and mathematical physics at University College, Dublin during which time he also worked with Erwin Schrödinger and John Synge at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies both mathematicians famous for their work in General Relativity and Cosmology. In 1948, he won a prestigious fellowship (a Travelling Studentship that paid for doctoral studies abroad anywhere in the world) and his superior directed him to take his doctorate in geophysics and seismology at the Institute of Geophysics at St. Louis University as a junior Jesuit scholastic, where he specialised in the philosophy of science with a concentration on the philosophy of modern physics with a novel approach from the phenomenological and hermeneutical perspective of Husserl and Heidegger.\n\nHe then taught physics at UCD for several years before being asked by the Archbishop of Dublin to teach the philosophy of science. Patrick Heelan's sense that he needed more philosophy for this brought him, in two steps, first to an encounter with Bernard Lonergan's 1957 book \"Insight\" (starting with the original notes in Latin), and then after a two-year post-doc working with Eugene Wigner at Princeton University (1960–62) at the Institute for Advanced Studies, which also gave him, at the start his first experience at Fordham University, Dr Heelan returned to Europe to pursue a second doctorate in philosophy (September 1962 – 1964) at the Catholic University of Louvain at Leuven (in Belgium) where he worked with Jean Ladrière, studying both logic and Husserlian philosophy (Ladrière would write the biographical entries on Patrick Heelan, including his first book, for the French \"Encyclopédie Philosophique Universelle\"). He defended his dissertation (with \"félications du jury\") and published \"Quantum Mechanics and Objectivity\" in 1965 (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Table of Contents and Preface). During the same period he began his visits and correspondence with Werner Heisenberg himself at the Max-Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich, a contact Heelan maintained until Heisenberg's death in 1976.\n\nIn 1965, Heelan joined the philosophy department at Fordham University. He would leave in 1970 at the invitation of John Toll, then the president of State University of New York at Stony Brook, to chair (and to build) the department of philosophy where over the next 22 years he would also fill several major positions in the administration of the University. He published his second major study, \"Space Perception and the Philosophy of Science\" with the University of California Press in 1983, which examines the geometry of vision including the space of art and experience and draws on Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty. He came to Georgetown University as Executive Vice-President for the Main Campus in 1992 and in 1995, he became the William A. Gaston Professor of Philosophy. The year of 2002, saw the publication of a festschrift, edited by Babette Babich, \"Hermeneutic Philosophy of Science, Van Gogh's Eyes, and God: Essays in Honor of Patrick A. Heelan, S.J.\" which appeared as Volume 225 in the Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science. His third book, \"The Observable\", also edited by Babette Babich came out in 2016 although written almost a half a century before; completed while Heisenberg was still living, it dealt with Heisenberg, Bohr and Pauli in addition to Einstein. Patrick Heelan, who continued to write and to teach until he retired from the philosophy department in 2013, returned to Dublin in 2014. He died in Dublin in 2015.\n\n\n"}

He was appointed Stuart Professor of Philosophy in 1974, and retired in 2007 as the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy.\n\nBenacerraf was born in Paris to parents who were Sephardic Jews from Morocco and Algeria. In 1939 the family moved to Caracas and then to New York City. \n\nWhen the family returned to Caracas, Benacerraf remained in the United States boarding at the Peddie School in Hightstown, NJ. He attended Princeton University for both his undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\nBenacerraf is perhaps best known for his two papers \"What Numbers Could Not Be\" (1965) and \"Mathematical Truth\" (1973), and for his anthology on the philosophy of mathematics, co-edited with Hilary Putnam. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998.\n\nHis brother was the Venezuelan Nobel Prize-winning immunologist Baruj Benacerraf.\n\nIn \"What Numbers Could Not Be\" (1965), Benacerraf argues against a Platonist view of mathematics, and for structuralism, on the ground that what is important about numbers is the abstract structures they represent rather than the objects that number words ostensibly refer to. In particular, this argument is based on the point that Ernst Zermelo and John von Neumann give distinct, and completely adequate, identifications of natural numbers with sets (this argument is called Benacerraf's identification problem).\n\nIn \"Mathematical Truth\" (1973), he argues that no interpretation of mathematics offers a satisfactory package of epistemology and semantics; it is possible to explain mathematical truth in a way that is consistent with our syntactico-semantical treatment of truth in non-mathematical language, and it is possible to explain our knowledge of mathematics in terms consistent with a causal account of epistemology, but it is in general not possible to accomplish both of these objectives simultaneously (this argument is called Benacerraf's epistemological problem). He argues for this on the grounds that an adequate account of truth in mathematics implies the existence of abstract mathematical objects, but that such objects are epistemologically inaccessible because they are causally inert and beyond the reach of sense perception. On the other hand, an adequate epistemology of mathematics, say one that ties truth-conditions to proof in some way, precludes understanding how and why the truth-conditions have any bearing on truth.\n\nElizabeth Lloyd has alleged that while she was a PhD student at Princeton, Benacerraf \"petted and touched\" her every day. She said, “It was just an extra price I had to pay, that the men did not have to pay, in order to get my Ph.D.” Benacerraf has responded by denying the allegations, stating, “I am not the sort of person that she describes in her interview. Yet I do not doubt her sincerity or the depth of the feelings that she reports.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17673378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17673378", "title": "Peace congress", "text": "Peace congress\n\nA peace congress, in international relations, has at times been defined in a way that would distinguish it from a peace conference (usually defined as a diplomatic meeting to decide on a peace treaty), as an ambitious forum to carry out dispute resolution in international affairs, and prevent wars. This idea was widely promoted during the nineteenth century, anticipating the international bodies that would be set up in the twentieth century with comparable aims.\n\nThe genesis of the idea of a meeting of representatives of different nations to obtain by peaceful arbitrament a settlement of differences has been traced to the year 1623 in modern history, to a French monk, Émeric Crucé, who wrote a work entitled \"The New Cyneas\", a discourse showing the opportunities and the means for establishing a general peace and liberty of conscience to all the world and addressed to the monarch and the sovereign princes of the time. He proposed that a city, preferably Venice, should be selected where all the powers had ambassadors and that there should be a universal union, including all peoples. He suggested careful arrangement as to priority, giving the first place to the pope.\n\nTwo years after this publication, in 1625, appeared in Latin the work of Hugo Grotius \"On the Right of War and Peace\", pleading for a mitigation of some of the barbarous usages of war.\n\nWilliam Penn had a plan for the establishment of a \"European Dyet, Parliament or Estates\". He was followed by other writers of different nationalities.\n\nThe concept of a peaceful community of nations had also been outlined in 1795, when Immanuel Kant’s \"Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\" outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.\n\nInternational co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic War in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. This period also saw the development of international law with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n\nThe forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frédéric Passy in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of parliament, in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon I of France an international peace congress took place in Vienna called the Congress of Vienna in 1815.\n\nIn 1826, a congress composed of representatives of Spanish-American countries was planned by Bolívar for military as well as political purposes. One of its declared objects was \"to promote the peace and union of American nations and establish amicable methods for the settlement of disputes between them\". This congress failed, as only four Spanish-American countries were represented and only one ratified the agreement.\n\nIn 1831, however, Mexico took up the subject and proposed a conference of American Republics \"for the purpose of bringing about not only a union and close alliance for defence, but also the acceptance of friendly mediation for the settlement of disputes between them, and the framing and promulgation of a code of penal laws to regulate their mutual relations\". It does not appear that anything came of this congress, and in 1847 another was held at Lima, attended by representatives of Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, New Granada, and Peru, for the purpose of forming an alliance of American republics. The United States was invited but as it was then at war with Mexico it sent no representative.\n\nAnother congress was held by representatives from the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, and Venezuela, in 1864.\n\nAn effort to hold a congress was made by the governments of Chile and Colombia in 1880, \"to the end that the settlement by arbitration of each and every international controversy should become a principle of American public law\". This congress did not meet, however, owing to a war between Chile and Peru.\n\nIn 1881, the President of the United States invited the independent countries of North and South America to meet in a general congress at Washington, D.C. on 24 November 1882, \"for the purpose of considering and discussing methods of preventing war between the nations of America\". This meeting did not take place owing to a variety of reasons, but subsequently, by virtue of an Act of Congress of the United States an invitation was issued by the president to Mexico, the Central and South American Republics, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Brazil to join in a conference to be held in the city of Washington, the project being to consider:\n\n\nThe First International Conference of American States assembled at Washington on 2 October 1889. Eighteen American nations, including the United States, had their representatives. The conference adopted a plan of arbitration of international differences, together with various recommendations relating to trade, law, extradition, patents, customs, and sanitary regulations. It further declared arbitration to be a principle of American International Law and obligatory \"in all controversies concerning diplomatic and consular privileges, boundaries, territories, indemnities, the right of navigation, and the validity, construction and enforcement of treaties; and that it should be equally obligatory in all other cases, whatever might be their origin, nature or object, with the sole exception of those which in the judgment of one of the nations involved in the controversy, might imperil its independence; but that even in this case, while arbitration for that nation should be optional, it should be obligatory on the adversary power\" (7 Moore Int. Law Dig. p. 7). One notable result of the conference was the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics. All the republics of South America are represented in this bureau, which continues for periods of ten years subject to renewal.\n\nThe Peace Conference of 1861 was a last-ditch effort to avert the coming Civil War.\n\nFollowing an initial congress at London in 1843, an annual series of congresses called International Congress of the Friends of Peace or more informally \"International Peace Congress\" were organised from 1848 until 1853.\n\nElihu Burritt organized the Congress of 1848. The participants met at Brussels in September of that year. Among the distinguished delegates were Cobden, Thierry, Girardin, and Bastiat. The congress adopted resolutions urging limitation of armaments and the placing of a ban upon foreign loans for war purposes. Through the next decade, more congresses were convened in various cities without the development of anything new in principle or method.\n\n\nOn 12 August 1898, in a circular letter addressed to the representatives of different nations, the Emperor of Russia proposed to all governments, which had duly accredited representatives at the imperial court, the holding of a conference to consider the problem of the preservation of peace among nations. During the summer of 1900 the conference assembled at The Hague and on 4 September the formal notification of the ratification of the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes was given by the United States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Siam, Spain, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands, and subsequently by Japan. A Permanent Court of Arbitration was established at The Hague, composed representatives of each of the signatory powers appointed for a term of six years. Arbitrators called upon to form a competent tribunal may be chosen from a general list of the members of the court when any of the signatory powers desire to have recourse to the court for a settlement of any difference between them.\n\nThe South and Central American republics were not represented at the conference, but at the second International Conference of American States which was initiated by President McKinley and held in the City of Mexico, 22 October 1901, to 31 January 1902, a plan was adopted looking to adhesion to The Hague convention, the protocol being signed by all of the delegations except Chile and Ecuador, who subsequently gave their adhesion. The conference authorized the Governments of the United States and Mexico to negotiate with the other signatory powers for the adherence of other American nations. At this conference the project of a treaty for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was adopted, and the signatories agreed for a term of five years to submit to arbitration (preferably to the permanent court at The Hague) all claims for pecuniary loss or damage presented by their respective citizens and not capable of settlement through diplomatic channels, where they were of sufficient importance to warrant the expense of a court of arbitration.\n\nA second international peace conference was held at The Hague from 15 June to 18 October 1907. Forty-four States were represented, including the principal nations of Europe, North and South America, and Asia. The conference drew up thirteen conventions and one declaration. They are as follows: for the pacific settlement of international disputes; respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts relative to the opening of hostilities; respecting the laws and customs of war on land; respecting the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land; relative to the status of enemy merchant-ships at the outbreak of hostilities; relative to the conversion of merchant-ships into war-ships; relative to the laying of automatic submarine contact mines; respecting bombardment by naval forces in time of war; for the adaptation to naval war of the principles of the Geneva Convention; relative to certain restrictions with regard to the exercise of the right of capture in naval war; relative to the creation of an International Prize Court; concerning the rights and duties of neutral powers in naval war; and a declaration prohibiting the discharge of projectiles and explosives from balloons.\n\nThe International League of Peace and Liberty organised a series of international peace congresses.\n\n\nA series of international peace congresses called Universal Peace Congress (French: Congrès universel de la paix) took place between 1889 and 1939.\n\n\nThe Paris Peace Conference, that sought a lasting peace after World War I, approved the proposal to create the League of Nations (French: \"Société des Nations\", German: \"Völkerbund\") on 25 January 1919. The Covenant of the League of Nations was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles. On 28 June 1919, the Covenant was signed by 44 states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the Triple Entente or joined it during the conflict. Despite American President Woodrow Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919, the United States did not join the League.\n\nThe League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty came into force. In November, the headquarters of the League moved to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920 with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "478027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=478027", "title": "Pleroma", "text": "Pleroma\n\nPleroma (Greek ) generally refers to the totality of divine powers. The word means \"fullness\" from (\"I fill\") comparable to which means \"full\", and is used in Christian theological contexts: both in Gnosticism generally, and by St. Paul the Apostle in (the word is used 17 times in the NT).\n\nPleroma is also used in the general Greek language and is used by the Greek Orthodox Church in this general form since the word appears in the book of Colossians. Elaine Pagels of Princeton University views the reference in Colossians as something that was to be interpreted in the Gnostic sense.\n\nThe word itself is a relative term, capable of many shades of meaning, according to the subject with which it is joined and the antithesis to which it is contrasted. It denotes the result of the action of the verb \"pleroun;\" but \"pleroun\" is either \n\nand the verbal substantive in -\"ma\" may express either\n\n\nIt may emphasize totality in contrast to its constituent parts; or fulness in contrast to emptiness (\"kenoma\"); or completeness in contrast to incompleteness or deficiency (\"hysterema\" , , \"hettema\" ).\n\nA further ambiguity arises when it is joined with a genitive, which may be either subjective or objective, the fulness which one thing gives to another, or that which it receives from another.\n\nIn its semi-technical application it is applied primarily to the perfection of God, the fulness of His Being, 'the aggregate of the Divine attributes, virtues, energies': this is used quite absolutely in (\"oti en auto eudokesen pan to pleroma katoikesai\"), but further defined \n\nSecondarily, this same \"pleroma\" is transferred to Christ; it was embodied permanently in Him at the Incarnation (); it still dwells permanently in His glorified Body, \"en auto katoikei somatikos\" (); it is \"tou pleromatos tou christou\" (), the complete, moral, and intellectual perfection to which Christians aspire and with which they are filled (, \"este en auto pepleromenoi\". Cf. \"oti ek tou pleromatos autou emeis pantes elabomen\", where \"pleroma\" is the state of Him who is \"pleres charitos kai aletheias\", , cf. \"pleroumenon sophia\"). This indwelling emphasizes the completeness with which the Son represents the Father; it is the fulness of life which makes Him the representative, without other intermediary agencies, and ruler of the whole universe; and it is the fulness of moral and intellectual perfection which is communicable through Him to man; it is consistent with a gradual growth of human faculties (), therefore with the phrase \"eauton ekenosen\" of , which is perhaps intended as a deliberate contrast to it. One further application of the phrase is made in (, where it is used of the Church, \"to pleroma tou ta panta en pasin pleroumenou\". Here the genitive is perhaps subjective—the fulness of Christ, His full embodiment, that fulness which He supplies to the Church—emphasizing the thoroughness with which the Church is the receptacle of His powers and represents Him on earth. The analogy of the other uses of the word with the genitive of the person (, ), and the stress throughout these books on Christians being filled by Christ (, , , , , , , ), favours this view. But the genitive may be objective, 'the complement of Christ,' that which completes Him, which fills up by its activities the work which His withdrawal to heaven would have left undone, as the body completes the head. The analogy of the body, the stress laid on the action of the Church (), St. Paul's language about himself in (\"antanaplero ta hysteremata ton thlipseon tou christou\"), support this, and it is impossible to decide between the two. The former view has been most common since the thorough examination of the word by Fritzsche and Lightfoot (\"Col.\"), and was taken by von Soden (\"Hand-Comm.\"). But the latter view, which was that of Origen and Chrysostom, has been strongly advocated by Pfleiderer, and T. K. Abbott (\"International Critical Comm.\").\n\nOutside the NT the word occurs in Ignatius in a sense which is clearly influenced by the NT, and apparently in the meaning of the Divine fulness, as going forth and blessing and residing in the Church (\"Eph\". Inscr. \"te eulogemen en megethei theou patros pleromati\", and \"Trall\". Inscr. \"en kai aspazomai en to pleromati\", almost = \"en Christo\").\n\nIn Gnosticism the use becomes yet more stereotyped and technical, though its applications are still very variable. The Gnostic writers appeal to the use in the NT (e.g. ), and the word retains from it the sense of totality in contrast to the constituent parts; but the chief associations of \"pleroma\" in their systems are with Greek philosophy, and the main thought is that of a state of completeness in contrast to deficiency (\"hysterema\", ; Hippol. vi. 31), or of the fulness of real existence in contrast to the empty void and unreality of mere phenomena (\"kenoma\", ). Thus in Cerinthus it expressed the fulness of the Divine Life out of which the Divine Christ descended upon the man Jesus at his baptism, and into which He returned (, , ). In the Valentinian system it stands in antithesis to the essential incomprehensible Godhead, as 'the circle of the Divine attributes,' the various means by which God reveals Himself: it is the totality of the thirty aeons or emanations which proceed from God, but are separated alike from Him and from the material universe. It is at times almost localized, so that a thing is spoken of as 'within,' 'without,' 'above,' 'below' the Pleroma: more often it is the spirit-world, the archetypal ideal existing in the invisible heavens in contrast to the imperfect phenomenal manifestations of that ideal in the universe. Thus 'the whole Pleroma of the aeons' contributes each its own excellence to the historic Jesus, and He appears on earth 'as the perfect beauty and star of the Pleroma' (\"teleiotaton kallos kai astron tou pleromatos\", ). Similarly it was used by writers as equivalent to the full completeness of perfect knowledge (\"Pistis Sophia\", p. 15).\n\nAgain, each separate aeon is called a \"pleroma\" in contrast to its earthly imperfect counterpart, so that in this sense the plural can be used, \"pleromata\" (); and even each individual has his or her Pleroma or spiritual counterpart (\"to pleroma autes\" of the Samaritan woman,—Heracleon, \"ap.\" Origen, xiii. p. 205).\n\nIt thus expressed the various thoughts which we should express by the Godhead, the ideal, heaven; and it is probably owing to this ambiguity, as well as to its heretical associations, that the word dropped out of Christian theology. It is still used in its ordinary untechnical meaning, \"e.g.\" Theophylact speaks of the Trinity as \"pleroma tou theou\"; but no use so technical as that in Ignatius reappears.\n\nIn a neoplatonic manifestation of the concept, John M. Dillon in his \"Pleroma and Noetic Cosmos: A Comparative Study\" states that Gnosticism imported its concept of the ideal realm or pleroma from Plato's concept of the cosmos and Demiurge in Timaeus and of Philo's Noetic cosmos in contrast to the aesthetic cosmos. Dillon does this by contrasting the Noetic cosmos to passages from the Nag Hammadi, where the aeons are expressed as the thoughts of God. Dillon expresses the concept that pleroma is a Gnostic adaptation of Hellenic ideas, since before Philo there is no Jewish tradition that accepts that the material world or cosmos was based on an ideal world that exists as well.\n\nCarl Jung used the word in his mystical 1916 unpublished work, Seven Sermons to the Dead, which was finally published in \"Answer to Job\" (1952), and later in an appendix to the second edition of Jung's autobiography, \"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\" (1962). According to Jung, pleroma is both \"nothing and everything. It is quite fruitless to think about pleroma. Therein both thinking and being cease, since the eternal and infinite possess no qualities.\"\n\nIn his work on the Ecology of Mind, Gregory Bateson adopts and extends Jung's distinction between Pleroma (the non-living world that is undifferentiated by subjectivity) and Creatura (the living world, subject to perceptual difference, distinction, and information). What Bateson calls the \"myth of power\" is the epistemologically false application to Creatura of an element of Pleroma (non-living, undifferentiated).\n\n\n"}

It is part of his \"Essays: Second Series\", published in 1844. A premier philosopher, poet and leader of American transcendentalism, he used this essay to belie his feelings on government, specifically American government. His impact on New England thought and his views on pragmatism influenced the likes of Henry David Thoreau, Orestes Brownson, and Frederich Nietzsche, among others.\n\nAlthough not viewed as his most important essay in the second series, Emerson’s views on politics championed democracy and individualism, two ideas that are viewed today as undoubtedly American. By 1844, Emerson, then 41, had moved into a pragmatic balance of skepticism and idealism, happily providing him with “a way to dream as well as a way to live”. A quintessential American voice, Emerson believed that civilization was only beginning and could reach unfathomable places through moral force and creative intelligence. This alone is not a reason to blindly follow the footsteps before us. Remember, he says, “The law is only a memorandum.” This gives rise to the most popular quote in this essay: “The less government we have the better.”\n\nEmerson believed that an ideal government, aside from a nonexistent one dissolved when improvements in human character through love and wisdom could abolish the state, was one that advocated for the growth of the individual, and be able to protect one’s individual rights. The individual would only be ready for democracy when they had become completely independent and self-reliant. Then the abolishment of government could be achieved. The intelligence needed from each individual would triumph over business interests and politics, because the mind is the richest asset you can have.\n\nEmerson also questioned property rights in Politics, noting that they are built not on democracy, but instead on owning. Believing that “property will always follow persons,\" Emerson believed personal rights were much more important than property rights.\n\nEmerson’s overwhelming faith in the individual is completely opposite to his views on nations: “Every actual state is corrupt.” Political parties are “made out of necessity” of the time period and not out of any underlying theory. Emerson is very critical of both major parties in his essay. “From neither party, when in power, has the world any benefit to expect in science, art or humanity, at all commensurate with the resources of the nation.” Neither party is satisfactory for Emerson, and his essay he hints at the natural inequality this system adheres to, and its effects. Party politics are not the only organization Emerson has his eye on in his essay, however. Emerson also distrusts the pulpit and the press because they are conventional roles that require organizational persuasion.\n\n"}

The effect gets its name from the relationship between the protagonists in William Shakespeare's late 16th-century play, \"Romeo and Juliet,\" whose families were opposed to their union. The term was coined by Richard Driscoll who was the first author on a research paper which first suggested a there was a real world basis for the effect. \n\nAn early review of romantic love in the Western world emphasized the persistent association of obstacles or grave difficulties with the intensity of love, as in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In 1972, Richard Driscoll; along with Keith Davis and Milton Lipetz, published results from a longitudinal study on relationships, suggesting an underlying truth to the popular impressions. The research suggests that parental interference in a love relationship can intensify the feelings of romantic love between members of the couple, at least for a brief span of time. \nThe study interviewed 140 couples, both married and unmarried, via questionnaires and surveys. Couples joined the study to gain more knowledge about the state of their romantic affiliation. The researchers measured feelings about the spouse, about their perceived love, spousal trustworthiness, neediness, and parental interference. The couples completed these procedures at a first session, and then around 6 months to a year later, completed identical surveying sessions to see how their relationships have endured the past months. About 80% of the original participants completed the second session. Only a small portion of the original sample had ended their relationships or gotten divorced. In the results of the overall study, there was found to be an increase in love ratings for one's partner and parental interference. Interference did seem to have other frustrating effects, as it also was associated with decreased trust, increased criticalness, and increased frequency of negative, bothersome behaviors.\n\nSince the original findings of Driscoll's \"the Romeo & Juliet Effect,\" studies have attempted to find support of the original research. Although no exact replication has been done of the primary study, many researchers have kept on topic regarding relationship interference and relationship stability. \n\nIn 1983, Malcolm Parks conducted a study to determine influences of peers and families on relationship involvement, which showed little to no support of Driscoll's previous research. Opposition from the partner's family was not associated with greater emotional attachment. These findings set the path for many other studies on romantic involvement and support systems involvement and approval.\n\nIn recent years, much focus has been placed around the topic of a \"Romeo and Juliet Effect.\" In 2001, Diane Felmlee found similar findings to Malcolm Park's study. For instance, perceptions of approval from an individual's friends and approval from a partner's family members reduce the possibility that a relationship will end. \n\nSusan Sprecher's study further delved into the subject of the influence of social networks on relationships. It found that individuals from a social network believed that their personal opinions, whether of support or opposition, affected the romantic relationships they had earlier acknowledged as being in their social networks. \n\nH. Colleen Sinclair found that friends' approval or disapproval had a great effect on the participants' perception of a potential dating partner. Similarly to the previously discussed studies, Sinclair and colleagues found no significant support for the \"Romeo and Juliet Effect.\"\n\nThe Romeo and Juliet effect, though found to be supported through early research, in recent years has garnered very little support. Social network, not just parental opinions, do have an effect on a relationship, but different effects than Driscoll claimed. Parental and social network approval greatly increases relationship stability and duration, but disapproval can greatly affect the longevity or outcome of a romantic dating relationship.\n\nWhy the failures to replicate? The original research indicates that the intensification of romantic love seems to occur within a narrow window, between the time that parents first object and the youngsters unite and stand together, and somewhat later when the youngsters are worn out by the continuing turmoil. The effect may last several weeks or even several months, but it does not continue over longer spans of time and it is not a promising basis for a sound marriage. In Shakespeare's telling of the Romeo and Juliet story -- where the parents never actually learn about the love between the two main characters -- the intense feelings last a mere five days, and would hardly seem to have been the basis for a long and happy union.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1941913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941913", "title": "Self-knowledge (psychology)", "text": "Self-knowledge (psychology)\n\nSelf-knowledge is a term used in psychology to describe the information that an individual draws upon when finding an answer to the question \"What am I like?\".\n\nWhile seeking to develop the answer to this question, self-knowledge requires ongoing self-awareness and self-consciousness (which is not to be confused with consciousness). Young infants and chimpanzees display some of the traits of self-awareness and agency/contingency, yet they are not considered as also having self-consciousness. At some greater level of cognition, however, a self-conscious component emerges in addition to an increased self-awareness component, and then it becomes possible to ask \"What am I like?\", and to answer with self-knowledge.\n\nSelf-knowledge is a component of the self or, more accurately, the self-concept. It is the knowledge of oneself and one's properties and the \"desire\" to seek such knowledge that guide the development of the self-concept. Self-knowledge informs us of our mental representations of ourselves, which contain attributes that we uniquely pair with ourselves, and theories on whether these attributes are stable or dynamic.\n\nThe self-concept is thought to have three primary aspects:\n\nThe affective and executive selves are also known as the \"felt\" and \"active\" selves respectively, as they refer to the emotional and behavioral components of the self-concept.\nSelf-knowledge is linked to the cognitive self in that its motives guide our search to gain greater clarity and assurance that our own self-concept is an accurate representation of our \"true self\"; for this reason the cognitive self is also referred to as the \"known self\". The cognitive self is made up of everything we know (or \"think we know\" about ourselves). This implies physiological properties such as hair color, race, and height etc.; and psychological properties like beliefs, values, and dislikes to name but a few.\n\nSelf-knowledge and its structure affect how events we experience are encoded, how they are selectively retrieved/recalled, and what conclusions we draw from how we interpret the memory. The analytical interpretation of our own memory can also be called \"meta memory\", and is an important factor of \"meta cognition\".\n\nThe connection between our memory and our self-knowledge has been recognized for many years by leading minds in both philosophy and psychology, yet the precise specification of the relation remains a point of controversy.\n\n\nSelf-theories have traditionally failed to distinguish between different source that inform self-knowledge, these are \"episodic memory\" and \"semantic memory\". Both episodic and semantic memory are facets of \"declarative memory\", which contains memory of facts. Declarative memory is the explicit counterpart to \"procedural memory\", which is implicit in that it applies to skills we have learnt; they are not \"facts\" that can be \"stated\".\n\nEpisodic memory is the autobiographical memory that individuals possess which contains events, emotions, and knowledge associated with a given context.\n\nSemantic memory does not refer to concept-based knowledge stored about a specific experience like episodic memory. Instead it includes the memory of meanings, understandings, general knowledge about the world, and factual information etc. This makes semantic knowledge independent of context and personal information. Semantic memory enables an individual to know information, including information about their selves, without having to consciously recall the experiences that taught them such knowledge.\n\nPeople are able to maintain a sense of self that is supported by semantic knowledge of personal facts in the absence of direct access to the memories that describe the episodes on which the knowledge is based.\nThis evidence for the dissociation between episodic and semantic self-knowledge has made several things clear:\n\nPeople have goals that lead them to seek, notice, and interpret information about themselves. These goals begin the quest for self-knowledge.\nThere are three primary motives that lead us in the search for self-knowledge:\n\nSelf-enhancement refers to the fact that people seem motivated to experience positive emotional states and to avoid experiencing negative emotional states. People are motivated to feel good about themselves in order to maximize their feelings of self-worth, thus enhancing their self-esteem.\nThe emphasis on \"feelings\" differs slightly from how other theories have previously defined self-enhancement needs, for example the \"Contingencies of Self-Worth Model\".\nOther theorists have taken the term to mean that people are motivated to think about themselves in highly favorable terms, rather than feel they are \"good\".\nIn many situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as highly capable or \"better\" than one's peers. However, in some situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as \"average\" or even \"worse\" than others. In both cases, thoughts about the self still serve to enhance feelings of self-worth.\nThe universal need is not a need to think about oneself in any specific way, rather a need to maximize one's feelings of self-worth. This is the meaning of the self enhancement motive with respect to self-knowledge.\n\nIn Western societies, feelings of self-worth \"are\" in fact promoted by thinking of oneself in favorable terms.\n\nSee \"Self-verification theory\" section.\n\nAccuracy needs influence the way in which people search for self-knowledge. People frequently wish to know the truth about themselves without regard as to whether they learn something positive or negative.\nThere are three considerations which underlie this need:\nAccurate self-knowledge can also be instrumental in maximizing feelings of self-worth. Success is one of the number of things that make people feel good about themselves, and knowing what we are like can make successes more likely, so self-knowledge can again be adaptive. This is because self-enhancement needs can be met by knowing that one \"can not\" do something particularly well, thus protecting the person from pursuing a dead-end dream that is likely to end in failure.\n\nMany theorists believe that we have a motive to protect the self-concept (and thus our self-knowledge) from change. This motive to have consistency leads people to look for and welcome information that is consistent with what they believe to be true about themselves; likewise, they will avoid and reject information which presents inconsistencies with their beliefs. This phenomenon is also known as self-verification theory.\nNot everyone has been shown to pursue a self-consistency motive; but it has played an important role in various other influential theories, such as cognitive dissonance theory.\n\nThis theory was put forward by William Swann of the University of Texas at Austin in 1983 to put a name to the aforementioned phenomena. The theory states that once a person develops an idea about what they are like, they will strive to verify the accompanying self-views.\nTwo considerations are thought to drive the search for self-verifying feedback:\nThese factors of self-verification theory create controversy when persons suffering from low-self-esteem are taken into consideration. People who hold negative self-views about themselves \"selectively seek negative feedback\" in order to verify their self-views. This is in stark contrast to self-enhancement motives that suggest people are driven by the desire to feel good about themselves.\n\nThere are three sources of information available to an individual through which to search for knowledge about the self:\n\nThe physical world is generally a highly visible, and quite easily measurable source of information about one's self. Information one may be able to obtain from the physical world may include:\n\n\nThe comparative nature of self-views means that people rely heavily on the social world when seeking information about their selves. Two particular processes are important:\n\nPeople compare attributes with others and draw inferences about what they themselves are like. However, the conclusions a person ultimately draws depend on whom in particular they compare themselves with. The need for accurate self-knowledge was originally thought to guide the social comparison process, and researchers assumed that comparing with others who are similar to us in the \"important\" ways is more informative.\n\nPeople are also known to compare themselves with people who are slightly better off than they themselves are (known as an \"upward comparison\"); and with people who are slightly worse off or disadvantaged (known as a \"downward comparison\").\nThere is also substantial evidence that the need for \"accurate\" self-knowledge is neither the only, nor most important factor that guides the social comparison process, the need to feel good about ourselves affects the social comparison process.\n\nReflected appraisals occur when a person observes how others respond to them. The process was first explained by the sociologist Charles H. Cooley in 1902 as part of his discussion of the \"looking-glass self\", which describes how we see ourselves reflected in other peoples' eyes. He argued that a person's feelings towards themselves are socially determined via a three-step process:\n\n\"A self-idea of this sort seems to have three principled elements: the imagination of our appearance to the other person; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification. The comparison with a looking-glass hardly suggests the second element, the imagined judgment which is quite essential. The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind.\" (Cooley, 1902, p.153)\n\nIn simplified terms, Cooley's three stages are:\nNote that this model is of a phenomenological nature.\n\nIn 1963, John W. Kinch adapted Cooley's model to explain how a person's \"thoughts\" about themselves develop rather than their \"feelings\".\n\nKinch's three stages were:\nThis model is also of a phenomenological approach.\n\nResearch has only revealed limited support for the models and various arguments raise their heads:\n\nThe sequence of reflected appraisals may accurately characterize patterns in early childhood due to the large amount of feedback infants receive from their parents, yet it appears to be less relevant later in life. This is because people are not passive, as the model assumes. People \"actively\" and \"selectively\" process information from the social world. Once a person's ideas about themselves take shape, these also influence the manner in which new information is gathered and interpreted, and thus the cycle continues.\n\nThe psychological world describes our \"inner world\". There are three processes that influence how people acquire knowledge about themselves:\n\nIntrospection involves looking inwards and directly consulting our attitudes, feelings and thoughts for meaning.\nConsulting one's own thoughts and feelings can sometimes result in meaningful self-knowledge. The accuracy of introspection, however, has been called into question since the 1970s. Generally, introspection relies on people's explanatory theories of the self and their world, the accuracy of which is not necessarily related to the form of self-knowledge that they are attempting to assess. \n\nComparing sources of introspection. People believe that spontaneous forms of thought provide more meaningful self-insight than more deliberate forms of thinking. Morewedge, Giblin, and Norton (2014) found that the more spontaneous a kind of thought, the more spontaneous a particular thought, and the more spontaneous thought a particular thought was perceived to be, the more insight into the self it was attributed. In addition, the more meaning the thought was attributed, the more the particular thought influenced their judgment and decision making. People asked to let their mind wander until they randomly thought of a person to whom they were attracted to, for example, reported that the person they identified provided them with more self-insight than people asked to simply think of a person to whom they were attracted to. Moreover, the greater self-insight attributed to the person identified by the (former) random thought process than by the latter deliberate thought process led those people in the random condition to report feeling more attracted to the person they identified.\n\nWhether introspection always fosters self-insight is not entirely clear. Thinking too much about why we feel the way we do about something can sometimes confuse us and undermine true self-knowledge. Participants in an introspection condition are less accurate when predicting their own future behavior than controls and are less satisfied with their choices and decisions. In addition, it is important to notice that introspection allows the exploration of the consious mind only, and does not take into account the unconscious motives and processes, as found and formulated by Freud. \n\nWilson's work is based on the assumption that people are not always aware of \"why\" they feel the way they do. Bem's self-perception theory makes a similar assumption.\nThe theory is concerned with how people \"explain\" their behavior. It argues that people don't always \"know\" why they do what they do. When this occurs, they infer the causes of their behavior by analyzing their behavior in the context in which it occurred. Outside observers of the behavior would reach a similar conclusion as the individual performing it. The individuals then draw logical conclusions about why they behaved as they did.\n\n\"Individuals come to \"know\" their own attitudes, emotions, and other internal states partially by inferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs. Thus, to the extent that internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or uninterpretable, the individual is functionally in the same position as an outside observer, an observer who must necessarily rely upon those same external cues to infer the individual's inner states.\" (Bem, 1972, p.2)\n\nThe theory has been applied to a wide range of phenomena. Under particular conditions, people have been shown to infer their attitudes, emotions, and motives, in the same manner described by the theory.\n\nSimilar to introspection, but with an important difference: with introspection we \"directly examine\" our attitudes, feelings and motives. With self-perception processes we \"indirectly infer\" our attitudes, feelings, and motives by \"analyzing our behavior\".\n\nCausal attributions are an important source of self-knowledge, especially when people make attributions for positive and negative events. The key elements in self-perception theory are explanations people give for their actions, these explanations are known as causal attributions.\n\nCausal attributions provide answers to \"Why?\" questions by attributing a person's behavior (including our own) to a cause.\n\nPeople also gain self-knowledge by making attributions for \"other people's\" behavior; for example \"If nobody wants to spend time with me it must be because I'm boring\".\n\nIndividuals think of themselves in many different ways, yet only some of these ideas are active at any one given time. The idea that is specifically active at a given time is known as the Current Self-Representation. Other theorists have referred to the same thing in several different ways:\nThe current self-representation influences information processing, emotion, and behavior and is influenced by both \"personal\" and \"situational\" factors.\n\nSelf-concept, or how people \"usually\" think of themselves is the most important personal factor that influences current self-representation. This is especially true for attributes that are important and self-defining.\n\nSelf-concept is also known as the self-schema, made of innumerable smaller self-schemas that are \"chronically accessible\".\n\nSelf-esteem affects the way people feel about themselves. People with high self-esteem are more likely to be thinking of themselves in positive terms at a given time than people suffering low self-esteem.\n\nMood state influences the accessibility of positive and negative self-views.\n\nWhen we are happy we tend to think more about our positive qualities and attributes, whereas when we are sad our negative qualities and attributes become more accessible.\n\nThis link is particularly strong for people suffering low self-esteem.\n\nPeople can deliberately activate particular self-views. We select appropriate images of ourselves depending on what role we wish to play in a given situation.\n\nOne particular goal that influences activation of self-views is the desire to feel good.\n\nHow a person thinks of themselves depends largely on the social role they are playing. Social roles influence our personal identities.\n\nPeople tend to think of themselves in ways that distinguish them from their social surroundings.\nDistinctiveness also influences the salience of group identities.\n\nThe size of the group affects the salience of group-identities. Minority groups are more distinctive, so group identity should be more salient among minority group members than majority group members.\n\nGroup status interacts with group size to affect the salience of social identities.\n\nThe social environment has an influence on the way people evaluate themselves as a result of social-comparison processes.\n\nPeople regard themselves as at the opposite end of the spectrum of a given trait to the people in their company. However, this effect has come under criticism as to whether it is a primary effect, as it seems to share space with the assimilation effect, which states that people evaluate themselves more positively when they are in the company of others who are exemplary on some dimension.\n\nImagining how one appears to others has an effect on how one thinks about oneself.\n\nRecent events can cue particular views of the self, either as a direct result of failure, or via mood.\nMemory for prior events influence how people think about themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2956658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2956658", "title": "Sherman paradox", "text": "Sherman paradox\n\nThe Sherman Paradox refers to an anomalous pattern of inheritance found in Fragile X syndrome. The phenomenon is also referred to as anticipation or dynamic mutation.\n\nThe paradox is named after Stephanie Sherman, who studied the inheritance patterns of people with Fragile X syndrome. Sherman observed that the effects of Fragile X syndrome seemed to occur more frequently with each passing generation. This observation is now known as the Sherman Paradox.\n\nThe paradox was ultimately explained by insights into the mutation process that gives rise to the syndrome. Sherman theorized that the gene responsible for Fragile X syndrome becomes mutated through a two-step process. The first mutation, called the 'premutation', doesn't cause any clinical symptoms. A second mutation was required to convert the 'premutation' into a 'full mutation' capable of causing the clinical symptoms associated with Fragile X syndrome. Additionally, premutations must pass through females in order to transform into the full mutation.\n\nThe Fragile X syndrome is so named because of the appearance of the X chromosome in individuals with Fragile X. Under an electron microscope, a region on the long arm of the chromosome resembles a thin string. Investigation showed that this region consists of a CGG repeat triplet in both normal and diseased individuals. The difference between normal and diseased is the length of the repeat; the repeat is longer where Fragile X syndrome is present. When the length of the repeat surpasses a critical threshold, symptoms of the disorder appear and they increase in likelihood and severity with further length. Even below this threshold there is a range where the repeat becomes unstable during meiosis.\n\nIn normal individuals, an insertion of extra CGGs is unlikely. However, as the length of the repeat increases, the probability of additional triplet insertions increases. When the expansion reaches the danger range, the carrier is still unaffected, but the risk of further mutation becomes significant. This is called the premutation range. Once the Fragile X syndrome emerges, symptoms worsen from generation to generation because of the self-promoting aspect of the mutation.\n\nA similar mechanism, involving triplet repeats, underlies myotonic dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington's disease. In Huntington's disease, in contrast to Fragile X, somatic as well as germline mutations occur. Autopsies of affected individuals reveal an accumulation of long repeats of CAG in DNA in the striatum. In both conditions, effects are less severe if the long repeat is interspersed with other triplets.\n\n"}
{"id": "550013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=550013", "title": "Soup kitchen", "text": "Soup kitchen\n\nA soup kitchen, meal center, or food kitchen is a place where food is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at a below market price. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by volunteer organizations, such as church or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a food bank for free or at a low price, because they are considered a charity, which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.\n\nMany historical and some modern soup kitchens serve only soup (hence its name) with perhaps some bread. But several establishments which title themselves as a \"soup kitchen\" also serve other types of food, so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals, like food kitchens and meal centers.\n\nWhile societies have been using various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia, the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century. By the late 19th century, they were to be found in several American and European cities. In the United States and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century during the Great Depression. With the improved economic conditions that followed World War II, soup kitchens became less widely used, at least in the advanced economies. In the United States there was a resurgence in the use of soup kitchens following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s.\n\nIn the 21st century, the use of soup kitchens expanded in both the United States and Europe, following lasting global increases in the price of food which began in late 2006. Demand for their services grew as the Great Recession began to worsen economic conditions for those on low income. In much of Europe, demand further increased after the introduction of austerity-based economic policies from 2010.\n\nThe earliest occurrences of soup kitchens are difficult to identify. Throughout history, societies have invariably recognized a moral obligation to feed the hungry. The philosopher Simone Weil wrote that feeding the hungry when one has resources to do so is the most obvious obligation of all. She also said that as far back as Ancient Egypt, it was believed that people needed to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Soup has long been one of the most economical and simple ways to supply nutritious food to large numbers of people.\n\nSocial historian Karl Polanyi wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organisation in the 19th century, most human societies would generally either starve all together or not at all; because, communities would naturally share their food. As markets began to replace the older forms of resource allocation such as Redistribution, Reciprocity, and Autarky, society's overall level of food security would typically rise. But food insecurity could become worse for the poorest section of society, and the need arose for more formal methods for providing them with food. Christian churches traditionally provided food for the hungry since Late antiquity, with the nourishment mainly provided in the form of soup.\n\nThe earliest modern soup kitchens were established by the inventor Sir Benjamin Thompson, who was employed as an aide-de-camp to the Elector of Bavaria in the 1790s. Thompson was an American loyalist refugee from New England, and an inventor who was ennobled by Bavaria as Count Rumford. The Count was a prominent advocate of hunger relief, writing pamphlets that were widely read across Europe.\n\nHis message was especially well received in Great Britain, where he had previously held a senior government position for several years and was known as \"the Colonel\". An urgent need had recently arisen in Britain for food relief, due to its leading role in driving the Industrial Revolution. While technological development and economic reforms were rapidly increasingly overall prosperity, conditions for the poorest were often made worse, as traditional ways of life were disrupted. In the closing years of the 18th century, soup kitchens run on the principles pioneered by Rumford were to be found throughout England, Wales, and Scotland, with about 60,000 people being fed by them daily in London alone.\n\nWhile soup kitchens were generally well regarded, they did attract criticism from some, for encouraging dependency, and sometimes on a local level for attracting vagrants to an area. In Britain they were made illegal, along with other forms of aid apart from workhouses, by the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834.\n\nDuring the Irish famine of the 19th century, in which as many as one million people may have died, the British government passed the Temporary Relief Act (also known as the Soup Kitchen Act) in February 1847. The Act amended the restrictions on the provision of aid outside the workhouses for the duration of the famine, and expressly allowed the establishment of soup kitchens in Ireland to relieve pressure from the overstretched Poor Law system, which was proving to be totally inadequate in coping with the disaster.\n\nProhibition against soup kitchens was soon relaxed on mainland Britain too, though they never again became as prevalent as they had been in the early 19th century, partly as from the 1850s onwards, economic conditions generally began to improve even for the poorest. For the first few decades after the return of soup kitchens to mainland Britain, they were at first heavily regulated, run by groups like the Charity Organization Society. Even in the early 20th century, campaigning journalists like Bart Kennedy would criticize them for their long queues, and for the degrading questions staff would ask the hungry before giving out any soup.\n\nThe concept of soup kitchens spread to the United States from Ireland after the Great famine and the concomitant wave of Irish emigration to the New World. The earliest ones were established in the 1870s. A sharp rise in the number of hungry people resulting from an industrial recession coincided with the success of the AICP, and the American branch of the \"Charity Organization Society\" in getting various forms of \"outdoor relief\" banned. This resulted in civil society establishing soup kitchens, to help feed those of the poor who did not wish to subject themselves to the regimented organisation of the Almshouses favored by the charitable societies.\n\nIt is believed the term “breadline” entered the popular lexicon in the 1880s. It was during those years that a noteworthy bakery in New York City’s Greenwich Village, “Fleischmann Model Viennese Bakery,” instituted a policy of distributing unsold baked goods to the poor at the end of their business day. \nBy the late 19th century soup kitchens were to be found in several US cities.\nThe concept of soup kitchens hit the mainstream of United States consciousness during the Great Depression. One soup kitchen in Chicago was even sponsored by American mobster Al Capone in an effort to clean up his image.\n\nWith the improved economic conditions that followed the Second World War, there was less need for soup kitchens in advanced economies. However, with the scaling back of welfare provision in the 1980s under president Reagan's administration, there was a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks, about 80% of emergency kitchens, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981. Presently, Catholic Charities USA of Colorado Springs, Colorado, founded by The Sisters of Loretto, provides food to upwards of 600-700 persons or more per day, and has been doing so since 1985.\n\nUse of soup kitchens has grown rapidly across the world, following the lasting global inflation in the cost of food that began in late 2006. The \"global financial crisis\" further increased the demand for soup kitchens, as did the introduction of austerity policies that have become common in Europe since 2010. Modern soup kitchens are generally well regarded, though like their historical counterparts they are sometimes disliked by local residents for lowering the tone of a neighborhood.\n\nThe world's largest soup kitchen run at the Sikhs' holiest shrine, Golden Temple in Punjab, India, which according to \"Croatian Times\" can serve free food for up to 100,000 - 300,000 people every day. At the Langar (Kitchen), food is served to all visitors regardless of faith, religion, or background. Only vegetarian food is served and people eat together as equals. The institution of the Sikh langar, a community run free kitchen, was started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, the tradition of langar expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness, and oneness of humankind. Every Sikh shrine has a religiously sanctioned moral and humanitarian obligation to serve and provide hospitality, provisions, nourishments and meals to any man, regardless of race, creed, religious profession, identification, or affiliation.\n\nIn some countries such as Great Britain, increased demand from hungry people has largely been met by food banks, operating on the \"front line\" model, where they give food out directly to the hungry. In the USA, such establishments are called \"food pantries\"; Americans generally reserve the term \"food bank\" for entities which perform a warehouse-like function, distributing food to front line agencies, but not directly to the hungry themselves. Instead of providing hot meals, front line food banks and pantries hand out packages of groceries so that recipients can cook themselves several meals at home. This is often more convenient for the end user. They can receive food for up to a dozen or so meals at once, whereas with a soup kitchen, they typically only receive a single meal with each visit.\n\nFood banks typically have procedures needed to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them, unlike soup kitchens which will usually give a meal to whomever turns up with no questions asked. The soup kitchen's greater accessibility can make it more suitable for assisting people with long-term dependence on food aid. Soup kitchens can also provide warmth, companionship, and the shared communal experience of dining with others, which can be especially valued by people such as disabled, pensioners, widowers, homeless and ex-homeless. In some countries such as Greece, soup kitchens have become the most widely used form of food aid, with \"The Guardian\" reporting in 2012, that an estimated 400,000 Greeks visit a soup kitchen each day.\n"}

The solution to Einstein's equations in the presence of curvature squared terms, when the curvatures are large, leads to an effective cosmological constant.

The arrangement for a single diner is called a place setting. The practice of dictating the precise arrangement of tableware has varied across cultures and historical periods.\nInformal settings generally have fewer utensils and dishes but use a layout based on more formal settings. Utensils are arranged in the order and according to the manner in which the diner will use them. In the West, forks, plate, butter knife, and napkin generally are placed to the left of the dinner plate, and knives, spoons, stemware and tumblers, cups, and saucers to the right. (By contrast, formal settings in Armenia place the fork to the right of the dinner plate and informal settings in Turkey place the fork to the right of the dinner plate if not accompanied by a knife) Sauceboats and serving dishes, when used, either are placed on the table or, more formally, may be kept on a side table.\n\nAt an informal setting, fewer utensils are used and serving dishes are placed on the table. Sometimes the cup and saucer are placed on the right side of the spoon, about 30cm or 12 inches from the edge of the table. Often, in less formal settings, the napkin should be in the wine glass. However, such objects as napkin rings are very rare in the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, or Italy.\n\nUtensils are placed inward about 20cm or 8 inches from the edge of the table, with all placed either upon the same invisible baseline or upon the same invisible median line. Utensils in the outermost position are to be used first (for example, a soup spoon or a salad fork, later the dinner fork and the dinner knife). The blades of the knives are turned toward the plate. Glasses are placed an inch (2.5 cm) or so above the knives, also in the order of use: white wine, red wine, dessert wine, and water tumbler.\n\nThe most formal dinner is served from the kitchen. When the meal is served, in addition to the central plate (a service plate or dinner plate at supper; at luncheon, a service plate or luncheon plate) at each place there are a bread roll (generally on a bread plate, sometimes in the napkin), napkin, and flatware (knives and spoons to the right of the central plate, and forks to the left). Coffee is served in Butler Service style in demitasses, and a spoon placed on the saucer to the right of each handle. Serving dishes and utensils are not placed on the table for a formal dinner. The only exception in the West to these general rules is the protocol followed at the Spanish royal court, which was also adopted by the Austrian court, in which all cutlery was placed to the right of the central plate for each diner.\n\nAt a less formal dinner, not served from the kitchen, the dessert fork and spoon can be set above the plate, fork pointing right, spoon pointing left.\n\n"}

Although Cursillo was and is structured so as not to restrict participation to members of the Roman Catholic Church, in time people who had attended Cursillo founded similar programs tailored to specific groups, including programs for younger people, those in prison or affected by the incarceration of another, and members of specific denominational groups.

{"id": "37123191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37123191", "title": "Tone at the top", "text": "Tone at the top\n\n\"Tone at the top\" is a term that originated in the field of accounting and is used to describe an organization's general ethical climate, as established by its board of directors, audit committee, and senior management. Having good tone at the top is believed by business ethics experts to help prevent fraud and other unethical practices.\n\nThe concept of tone at the top originated in audit firms, where it referred fairly narrowly to the attitude of an organization's senior leadership towards internal financial controls. It was popularized following a series of major corporate accounting scandals such as those affecting Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems and WorldCom, when the concept was strongly emphasized in the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 as important in the prevention and detection of fraud and other unethical financial practices. Today the term is applied very broadly, including in the fields of general management, information security, law and software development, and is often used to describe the general corporate culture established by an organization's leadership.\n\nThe tone at the top is often considered to permeate an entire organization, and good tone at the top is considered a prerequisite for solid corporate governance. It has been said that boards of directors have a dual role: creating codes of conduct, and living by them.\n\nGood organizational tone is set through policies, codes of ethics, a commitment to hiring competent employees, and the development of reward structures that promote good internal controls and effective governance. In an analysis of ethical leadership, KPMG described ethical leaders as those who are receptive to employees' ethical concerns, value ethics and integrity over short-term business goals, and respond appropriately if they become aware of misconduct.\n\nAuditors typically interview an organization's leaders as part of the audit fieldwork in order to assess tone at the top, because poor tone is associated with malfeasance. Questions commonly asked include \"how is the board compensated,\" \"how active is the audit committee,\" \"what is the nature of the organization's corporate culture,\" \"what pressures are there to make sales and earnings goals,\" \"how is wrong-doing dealt with,\" \"do employees understand their individual responsibilities for controls,\" \"do monitoring controls signal failures in a timely fashion so corrective action can be taken,\" and \"is there evidence that the employee code of ethics is complied with.\"\n\nImportant fraud factors include pressure to reach goals, incentives and meeting expectations.\n\nExperts say that weaknesses in the \"tone at the top\" have been associated with most modern financial frauds. Poor tone at the top may include a disdain for internal controls, an overemphasis on profits at the expense of ethics, a belief that compliance with the law is sufficient for defensible ethical conduct, the canvassing and accommodating of some stakeholders but not others, blaming higher-ups or colleagues for unethical practices, having one's judgement clouded due to conflicts of interest, and a misunderstanding of and lack of adherence to public expectations of what constitutes ethical behaviour for executives. Backdating stock options and pegging the granting of options to significant good or bad corporate announcements (known as spring-loading and bullet-dodging) are compensation practices that can be indicative of poor tone at the top.\n\nThe Enron scandal, revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, its audit firm. Enron is considered to be the largest bankruptcy reorganization in U.S. history, as well as the biggest audit failure. Executives at Enron used accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and misleading financial reporting to hide billions in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues. The Enron story demonstrated many common features of failed tone at the top, including inappropriate hostility to critics and a misunderstanding of public expectations. In a conference call on April 17, 2001, after Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman complained that Enron wasn't releasing a balance sheet along with its financial statements, then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling responded \"Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole,\" a phrase that was met with dismay and astonishment by the media and public, but which became an inside joke among many Enron employees.\n\nArthur Andersen was criticized for being the only Big 5 audit firm to allow the partner in charge of an audit to override a ruling made by the quality control partner, and was found guilty in 2002 of obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to its audit of Enron, resulting in the Enron scandal. The Arthur Andersen story is now used in business ethics textbooks as an example of a failure of tone at the top, for emphasizing profitability over high ethical standards. \"See also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States and the Enron scandal.\"\n\nIn 2002, Xerox was fined $10 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly deceiving the public between 1997 and 2000 by employing several \"accounting maneuvers,\" with six Xerox senior executives paying another $22 million in 2003. The SEC charged that former CEO Paul Allaire and his second-in-command G. Richard Thoman, who were among the six fined, \"set a tone at the top of the company which equated business success with meeting short-term earnings targets.\"\n\nBusiness experts say that although the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), colloquially known as Fannie Mae, gave the appearance of setting the appropriate tone at the top, its actual conduct fell short. In 2004, Fannie Mae was investigated by the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), which alleged widespread accounting errors. In 2008 Fannie Mae was embroiled in several conflict of interest scandals, and in 2011 six of its executives, including 2005-2008 Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd, were charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with securities fraud. In May 2006, OFHEO released a \"Report of the Special Examination of Fannie Mae\" which argued that at Fannie Mae \"earnings mattered, but not how they were achieved,\" and which blamed \"the actions and inactions of the Board of Directors [which] inappropriately reinforced rather than checked the tone and culture set by [1999-2004 Fannie Mae CEO Franklin] Raines and other senior managers.\" Former OFHEA head Armando Falcon attributed Fannie Mae's problems to \"the arrogance and huge egos of senior management,\" saying \"it was always just groupthink and if you ever raised a dissenting voice, your career would be over. Ego and arrogance was visible everywhere, in everything the company did: how it treated counterparties in the marketplace it dealt in, how it was able to throw its weight around politically, the way it spent money to curry political loyalty, the arrogance that permeated everything that the company did, including ultimately the accounting misconduct, and the lack of any kind of corporate ethics.\" \"See also the 2004 Fannie Mae accounting controversy, the Countrywide Financial political loan scandal and Friends of Angelo VIP program, and the 2011 Fannie Mae SEC charges.\"\n\nThe 2007–2012 global financial crisis, considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, was investigated by the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which concluded that \"the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve’s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels,\" and laid the blame for the crisis with government and regulatory leaders and CEOs of the failed companies, saying \"tone at the top does matter and, in this instance, we were let down. No one said 'no'.\"\n\nFormer chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than $150 million from the company. During their trial in March 2004, they contended the board of directors authorized it as compensation.\n\nDuring jury deliberations, juror Ruth Jordan, while passing through the courtroom, appeared to make an \"okay\" sign with her fingers to the defense table. She later denied she had intended that gesture, but the incident received much publicity (including a caricature in \"The Wall Street Journal\"), and the juror received threats after her name became public. Judge Michael Obus declared a mistrial on April 2, 2004.\n\nOn June 17, 2005, after a retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted on all but one of the more than 30 counts against them. The verdicts carry potential jail terms of up to 25 years in state prison. Kozlowski himself was sentenced to no less than eight years and four months and no more than 25 years in prison. Swartz received the same sentence. Then in May 2007, New Hampshire Federal District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro approved a class action settlement whereby Tyco agreed to pay $2.92 billion (in conjunction with $225 million by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, their auditors) to a class of defrauded shareholders represented by Grant & Eisenhofer P.A., Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz & Kessler, and Milberg Weiss & Bershad.\n\nCEO Bernard Ebbers was accused of accounting fraud. Ebbers had become very wealthy from the rising price of his holdings in WorldCom common stock. However, in the year 2000, the telecommunications industry entered a downturn and WorldCom’s aggressive growth strategy suffered a serious setback when it was forced by the US Justice Department to abandon its proposed merger with Sprint in mid 2000. By that time, WorldCom’s stock price was declining and Ebbers came under increasing pressure from banks to cover margin calls on his WorldCom stock that was used to finance his other businesses (timber and yachting, among others). During 2001, Ebbers persuaded WorldCom’s board of directors to provide him corporate loans and guarantees in excess of $400 million to cover his margin calls. The board hoped that the loans would avert the need for Ebbers to sell substantial amounts of his WorldCom stock, as his doing so would put further downward pressure on the stock's price. However, this strategy ultimately failed and Ebbers was ousted as CEO in April 2002 and replaced by John Sidgmore, former CEO of UUNET Technologies, Inc.\n\nBeginning modestly in mid-year 1999 and continuing at an accelerated pace through May 2002, the company (under the direction of Ebbers, Scott Sullivan (CFO), David Myers (Comptroller) and Buford \"Buddy\" Yates (Director of General Accounting)) used fraudulent accounting methods to mask its declining earnings by painting a false picture of financial growth and profitability to prop up the price of WorldCom’s stock.\n\nThe fraud was accomplished primarily in two ways:\n\n\nIn 2002, a small team of internal auditors at WorldCom worked together, often at night and in secret, to investigate and unearth $3.8 billion in fraud. Shortly thereafter, the company’s audit committee and board of directors were notified of the fraud and acted swiftly: Sullivan was fired, Myers resigned, Arthur Andersen withdrew its audit opinion for 2001, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into these matters on June 26, 2002 (see accounting scandals). By the end of 2003, it was estimated that the company's total assets had been inflated by around $11 billion.\n\nImClone's stock price dropped sharply at the end of 2001 when its drug Erbitux, an experimental monoclonal antibody, failed to get the expected Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. It was later revealed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that numerous executives sold their stock before the announcement of the decision after the close of trading on December 28.\n\nIts founder, Samuel D. Waksal, was arrested in 2002 on insider trading charges for informing friends and family to sell their stock, and attempting to sell his own. His daughter, Aliza Waksal, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 27. His father, Jack Waksal, sold $8.1 million in shares over the 27th and 28th. Company executives had done the same. John B. Landes, the general counsel, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 6. Ronald A. Martell, the vice president for marketing and sales, sold $2.1 million in shares on December 11. Four other executives sold shares in the following weeks as well. Later, Samuel Waksal pleaded guilty to various charges, including securities fraud, and on June 10, 2003, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.\n"}
{"id": "323489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323489", "title": "Wooden fish", "text": "Wooden fish\n\nA wooden fish, also known as a Chinese temple block. is a wooden percussion instrument. The wooden fish is used by monks and lay people in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition. It is often used during rituals usually involving the recitation of sutras, mantras, or other Buddhist texts. The wooden fish is mainly used by Buddhist disciples in China, Japan, Korea, and other East Asian countries where the practice of Mahayana, such as the ceremonious reciting of sutras, is prevalent. In most Zen/Ch'an Buddhist traditions, the wooden fish serves to keep the rhythm during sutra chanting. In Pure Land Buddhism, it is used when chanting the name of Amitabha.\n\nThe Taoist clergy has also adapted the wooden fish into their rituals.\n\nThere are two kinds of wooden fish.\n\nMost commonly today, it is the traditional instrument that is round in shape and often made out of wood, but sometimes other materials are used as well; this form is actually a later development from the original. The fish is hollow with a ridge outside of the wooden fish to help provide the genuine hollow sound when striking the fish; the instrument is similarly shaped like a jingle bell. The sound can differ amongst wooden fish depending on the size, type of wood used, and how hollow the wooden fish is. The instrument is carved with fish scales on its top, and a carving of two fish heads embracing a pearl on the handle (to symbolize unity), hence the instrument is called a wooden fish for that reason. In Buddhism the fish, which never sleeps, symbolizes wakefulness. Therefore, it is to remind the chanting monks to concentrate on their sutra. Often the mallet used to strike the fish has a rubber coated tip to provide a muffled, but clear sound when struck. A simplified form is given in the temple block.\n\nWooden fish come in many sizes and shapes, ranging from , for laity use or sole daily practice, or to for usage in temples. Wooden fish are often (in Chinese temples) placed on the left of the altar, alongside a bell bowl, its metal percussion counterpart. Wooden fish often rest on a small embroidered cushion to prevent damage and unpleasant knocking sounds caused from the fish lying on the surface of a hard table or ground, as well as to avoid damage to the instrument.\n\nThe Korean version of a wooden fish is simpler in shape and no design is carved onto the fish. It is more oblong in shape. It has a handle for easy carrying during portable uses. The Korean versions of a wooden fish are different in the sense that they provide a deeper, more wooden-like hollow sound when struck.\n\nThe original type of wooden fish is literally in the shape of a fish. Along with a large temple bell and drum, It is found suspended in front of Buddhist monasteries. When proceeding with various duties (such as eating, lectures, or chores), a monk and a supervisor utilize the instrument to call all monastics to go to their tasks. Historically, this was the first wooden fish developed, which gradually evolved into the round wooden fish used by Buddhists today. One of the most noted examples is at the temple of Manpuku-ji.\n\nMany legends describe the origin of the wooden fish, which take place in China. One legend says that a monk went to India to acquire sutras. On his way to India, he found the way blocked by a wide, flooding river. There appeared neither bridge nor boat.\n\nSuddenly, a big fish swam up. It offered to carry the monk across the river. The fish told the monk that it wanted to atone for a crime committed when it was a human. The fish made a simple request, that on the monk's way to obtain sutras, to ask the Buddha to guide the fish on a method to attain Bodhisattvahood.\n\nThe monk agreed to the fish's request and continued his quest for seventeen years. After getting the scriptures, he returned to China via the river, which was flooding again. As the monk worried about how to cross, the fish came back to help. It asked if the monk had made the request to the Buddha. To the monk's dismay, he had forgotten. The fish became furious and splashed the monk, washing him into the river. A passing fisherman saved him from drowning, but unfortunately the sutras had been ruined by the water.\n\nThe monk went home full of anger. Filled with anger at the fish, he made a wooden effigy of a fish head. When he recalled his adversity, he beat the fish head with a wooden hammer. To his surprise, each time he beat the wooden fish, the fish opened its mouth and vomited a character. He became so happy that, when he had time, he always beat the fish. A few years later, he had got back from the wooden fish's mouth what he had lost to the flood.\n\nThe wooden fish is often used for rites of death and resurrection. During funerals, people may walk in processions while sounding wooden fishes in a slow and unison rhythm. Other purposes may include prayers for rain. In Confucianism, the wooden fish is struck at specific intervals to signify certain stages of ceremonies at temple. In Buddhism, it is struck during chants of Buddha's name.\n\nThe wooden fish symbolizes wakeful attention. It can also symbolize wealth and abundance.\n\n"}
