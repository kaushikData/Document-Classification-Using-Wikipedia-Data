{"id": "255114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255114", "title": "2 + 2 = 5", "text": "2 + 2 = 5\n\nThe phrase \"two plus two equals five\" (\"2 + 2 = 5\") is a slogan used in many different forms of media, most notably in Part One, Chapter Seven of the book \"1984\" by George Orwell. In the novel, it is used as an example of an obviously false dogma that one may be required to believe, similar to other obviously false slogans promoted by the Party in the novel.\n\nOrwell's protagonist, Winston Smith, uses the phrase to wonder if the State might declare \"two plus two equals five\" as a fact; he ponders whether, if everybody believes it, that makes it true. The Inner Party interrogator of thought-criminals, O'Brien, says of the mathematically false statement that control over physical reality is unimportant; so long as one controls one's own perceptions to what the Party wills, then any corporeal act is possible, in accordance with the principles of doublethink (\"Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once\").\n\nThe equation 2 + 2 = 4 has been proverbial as the type of an obvious truth since the 16th century, and it appears as such in Johann Wigand's 1562 \"De Neutralibus et Mediis Libellus\": \"That twice two are four, a man may not lawfully make a doubt of it, because that manner of knowledge is grauen [graven] into mannes [man's] nature.\"\n\nRené Descartes' realm of pure ideas considers that self-evident idea such as two plus two equals four may, in fact, have no reality outside the mind. According to the First Meditation (1641), the standard of truth is self-evidence of clear and distinct ideas. However, Descartes questions the correspondence of these ideas to reality.\n\nIn his play \"Dom Juan\" (1682), Molière's title character is asked what he believes. He answers that he believes that two plus two equals four.\n\nThe mirror-image of this—that 2 + 2 = 5 is the archetypical untruth—is attested at least as early as 1728. Ephraim Chambers' \"Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\", published in that year, follows its definition of the word \"absurd\" with this illustrative example: \"Thus, a proposition would be absurd, that should affirm, that two and two make five; or that should deny 'em to make four.\" Similarly Samuel Johnson said in 1779 that \"You may have a reason why two and two should make five, but they will still make but four.\"\n\nThe first known sympathetic reference to the equation 2 + 2 = 5 appears in an 1813 letter by Lord Byron to his soon-to-be wife Anabella Milbanke in which he writes, \"I know that two and two make four—& should be glad to prove it too if I could—though I must say if by any sort of process I could convert 2 & 2 into\" five \"it would give me much greater pleasure.\"\n\nAlthough the phrase \"2 + 2 = 5\" had earlier been used to indicate an absurdity in general, its use within a political setting is first attested at the dawning of the French Revolution. Abbé Sieyès, in his \"What Is the Third Estate?\" (1789), mocked the fact that the Estates-General gave disproportionate voting power to the aristocracy and the clergy in with the following analogy: \"Consequently if it be claimed that under the French constitution, 200,000 individuals out of 26 million citizens constitute two-thirds of the common will, only one comment is possible: it is a claim that two and two make five.\"\n\nHonoré de Balzac's novel \"Séraphîta\" (1834) contains the following passage:\nVictor Hugo used this phrase in 1852. He objected to the way in which the vast majority of French voters had backed Napoleon III, endorsing the way liberal values had been ignored in Napoleon III's coup. In his 1852 pamphlet, \"Napoléon le Petit\", he writes: \"Now, get seven million five hundred thousand votes to declare that two and two make five, that the straight line is the longest road, that the whole is less than its part; get it declared by eight millions, by ten millions, by a hundred millions of votes, you will not have advanced a step.\"\n\nRussian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky is known to be influenced by Hugo and his \"Napoléon le Petit\". In Dostoyevsky's \"Notes from Underground\" (published in 1864), the protagonist implicitly supports the idea of two times two making five, spending several paragraphs considering the implications of rejecting the statement \"two times two makes four\". His purpose is not ideological, however. Instead, he proposes that it is the free will to choose or reject the logical as well as the illogical that makes mankind human. He adds: \"I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.\"\n\nThe idea seems to have been significant to Russian literature and culture. Ivan Turgenev wrote in \"Prayer\" (1881), one of his \"Poems in Prose\" \"Whatever a man prays for, he prays for a miracle. Every prayer reduces itself to this: Great God, grant that twice two be not four.\" Also similar sentiments are said to be among Leo Tolstoy's last words when urged to convert back to the Russian Orthodox Church: \"Even in the valley of the shadow of death, two and two do not make six.\" Even turn-of-the-century Russian newspaper columnists used the phrase to suggest the moral confusion of the age. Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin in \"God and the State\" (1882), classifies Deism as: \"Imagine a philosophical vinegar sauce of the most opposed systems, a mixture of Fathers of the Church, scholastic philosophers, Descartes and Pascal, Kant and Scottish psychologists, all this a superstructure on the divine and innate ideas of Plato, and covered up with a layer of Hegelian immanence accompanied, of course, by an ignorance, as contemptuous as it is complete, of natural science, and proving just as two times two make five; the existence of a personal God.\" In \"The Reaction In Germany\" (1842) Bakunin compares the behavior of Compromising Positivists to the one of Juste-milieu at the beginning of the July Revolution quoting a French journal: \"The Left says, 2 times 2 are 4; the Right, 2 times 2 are 6; and the Juste-milieu says, 2 times 2 are 5\".\n\n\"Deux et deux font cinq (2 + 2 = 5\") was the title of a short story collection by French absurdist writer Alphonse Allais published in 1895. Similarly, a 1920 art manifesto by Russian imaginist poet Vadim Shershenevich was titled \"2 × 2 = 5\".\n\nThe Soviet Union began its first five-year economic plan in 1928. Its goals were ambitious from the start, seeking the immediate transformation of the USSR into an industrial nation. The consequences for underperformance during the plan were severe; managers who admitted missing their targets, even as those targets were revised upward, could be charged with the crime of 'wrecking'. After statistics from the first two years indicated that the plan was ahead of schedule, Joseph Stalin announced that the plan would be completed in four years. Propagandist Iakov Guminer supported this campaign with a 1931 poster reading \"Arithmetic of an alternative plan: 2+2 plus the enthusiasm of the workers=5\". Stalin declared the plan a success at the beginning of 1933, noting the creation of several heavy industries. George Orwell may have been influenced by this poster.\n\nGeorge Orwell had used this concept before publishing \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" in 1949. During his career at the BBC, he became familiar with the methods of Nazi propaganda. In his essay \"Looking Back on the Spanish War\", published in 1943 (six years before the publication of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"), Orwell wrote:\n\nIn the view of most of Orwell's biographers, the main source for this was \"Assignment in Utopia\" by Eugene Lyons, an account of his time in the Soviet Union. This contains a chapter \"Two Plus Two Equals Five\", that referred to Guminer's slogan.\n\nHowever, Orwell spoke of the Nazis, so he may have been making reference to the Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, who once, in a debatably hyperbolic display of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, declared, \"If the Führer wants it, two and two makes five!\"\n\nIn \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", Orwell writes:\n\nIn presidential debates prior to the 2009 Iranian presidential elections, reformist candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi accused his interlocutor, president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, of being illogical and said: \"If you ask (the president) what two by two makes he would answer five.\" In the following days, one of the slogans chanted by Mousavi's supporters was \"two by two makes five!\"\n\nMedia critic Andrew Keen uses the phrase in his 2007 critique of Wikipedia's policy to let anyone edit. He believes, along with Marshall Poe, that this leads to an encyclopedia of common knowledge, not expert knowledge. He believes the \"wisdom of the crowd\" will distort truth.\n\nIn 2017, Italian Catholic priest Antonio Spadaro, a close associate of Pope Francis, tweeted \"Theology is not #Mathematics. 2 + 2 in #Theology can make 5. Because it has to do with #God and real #life of #people...\" This remark was taken by many traditionalist Catholics to be referring to alleged contradictions between certain interpretation of \"Amoris laetitia\", an apostolic exhortation on how divorced and remarried Catholics can return to the church, and long standing Catholic doctrine on marriage, remarriage, and divorce. Some characterized Spadaro as alleging that one could act counter to the doctrine of the Catholic church if they felt that God allowed them to do so, in spite of any moral of theological contradictions encountered. Others have defended him, claiming that he was merely referring to the Catholic view that God will never be able to be perfectly comprehended by human reason alone. Others compared him humorously to Rex Mottram, a character in Evelyn Waugh's 1945 novel \"Brideshead Revisited\". In the novel, Mottram, during his catechesis as he disinterestedly prepares to enter the Catholic church to marry another main character, makes no effort to rationally ascertain any aspect of the faith, attributing all contradictions to his sinfulness.\n\nIn Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\" (1957), the hero John Galt posits that \"the noblest act you have ever performed is the act of your mind in the process of grasping that two and two make four\".\n\nPopular English alternative rock band Radiohead used the slogan as the title for the opening track on their 6th studio album \"Hail to the Thief\" (2003).\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"\" (1992), Captain Picard is tortured by a Cardassian in a manner similar to the torture of Winston Smith by O'Brien from \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". During the episode, the Cardassian officer tries to coerce Picard to admit seeing five lights when in fact there were only four. Picard valiantly sticks to reality. Near the end when Picard is about to be brought back to his crew, he defiantly declares, once again, \"There!... Are!... \"Four!\"... \"Lights!\"\" However, later in a counseling session with Troi, Picard admits that he believed he \"did\" see five lights at the end.\n\nIn the Iranian short film \"Two & Two\" (2011), a teacher in an authoritarian school uses \"2 + 2 = 5\" as tool to instill conformity.\n\nIn the video game \"\", the character Ocelot will repeat \"2 + 2 = 5\", as one of a few phrases he says after telling the player he has received drug resistance training. This is a reference to Ocelot's own doublethink during the game.\n\nIn the video game \"Orwell\", the achievement '2+2=5' is unlocked for ensuring the public acceptance of the Orwell surveillance system and the eradication of Thought, a prominent anti-government movement, therefore ensuring the continued and total control of The Nation's totalitarian government.\n\nBrazilian songwriter Caetano Veloso wrote a song called \"Como 2+2\" (\"like 2+2\", in Portuguese), in which one of the verses translates as \"everything allright like 2 + 2 are 5\", a reference to the dictatorship that ruled Brazil then.\n\nDostoevsky's dialogue about two times two equaling five is recited in the 2018 HBO movie \"Fahrenheit 451\".\n\nIn business texts about synergy, \"2 + 2 = 5\" is used without irony to indicate that the outcome of a collective effort is greater sum of individual efforts.\n\n\n\n"}

Inspired by Project Steve, it was initiated in 2005 by archaeologist R. Joe Brandon to produce a public response to the Discovery Institute's 2001 petition \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\".\n\nThe Discovery Institute's petition was publicized in 2005 by media coverage of the Discovery Institute's efforts to introduce \"intelligent design\" in science classrooms and the opposition to those efforts in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case. Brandon noticed that only about 80 of those appearing on the \"Dissent\" petition had expertise in an area relevant to evolution. Therefore, Brandon decided to create a petition of his own of scientists supporting evolution. The petition was hosted at ShovelBums.org, but has since been removed from the site.\n\nA total of 7,733 scientists signed a statement affirming their support for evolution over a 4-day period.\n\nThe statement was entitled \"A Scientific Support for Darwinism And For Public Schools Not To Teach \"Intelligent Design\" As Science\", and read:\n\nIn four days in the fall of 2005, starting on September 28, 2005 and ending at 4:09 pm Eastern Time, October 1, 2005, the petition supporting \"Darwinism\" gathered 7,733 verified signatures from concerned scientists. Of these, 6,965 were US residents and 4,066 had PhDs. The \"Four Day Petition\" was carried out with no outside funding or assistance of any professional society. The effort was carried out by e-mail and word-of-mouth.\n\nAmong the signatories were 21 U.S. National Academy of Science members, nine MacArthur Fellowship awardees, and a Nobel laureate. According to Brandon's analysis, of those who signed his petition, there were\n\n\nTherefore, about 68 percent of those signing the Brandon petition work in biology-related fields (using the first four categories from the list above).\n\nThis \"Scientific Support\" petition collected signatures at a rapid pace. The responses to the Brandon petition arrived at a rate 697,000% faster than the signatures collected on the Discovery Institute Darwin Dissent petition.\n\nBrandon's original goal was to get 400 petition signatures in four hours. However, Brandon found he was 75 signatures short after four hours, and so he decided to extend his collection period to four days. The emails became more frequent, and at one point, petition responses were arriving every 3.5 seconds. However, the 325 signatures collected in the first four hours can be compared to the Discovery Institute's gathering of 400 signatures of self-identified scientists, most in irrelevant fields, in four years. In the week after the close of the four-day period, another several thousand signatures arrived, but were not included in the official tally.\n\nOne signatory, Dr. Steve Brill of Rutgers University, stated,\nIn a press release on October 20, 2005 announcing the results of the \"Four Day Petition\", Brandon drew attention to the remarks of Discovery Institute Senior Fellow Michael Behe's faculty colleagues in the biological sciences at Lehigh University. Twenty of Behe's peers remarked collectively that\n\nAnother signatory, biologist Mark Siddall of the American Museum of Natural History stated,\nSiddall added \"R. Joe's efforts elicited an overwhelming response from the scientific community—one that cut across lines of faith as deeply as it did across fields of scientific study.\" Siddall also assisted Brandon in checking that the IP addresses of the respondents corresponded to the institutions they claimed to be affiliated with.\n\nBrandon's original plan was to compile the signatures that he obtained and pass them on to Judge John E. Jones III who was handling the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case, as well as announce the results in a press release. The petition was not completed sufficiently early to submit it as part of an \"amicus curae\" brief for the Dover case. However, if the case was to go to the US Supreme Court, the petition could have been submitted as an \"amicus\" brief at that time.\n\nR. Joe Brandon emphasized that this \"Four Day Petition\" did not mean that scientific issues are settled by majority vote. What Brandon maintains is that this is an indication of the level of scientific consensus that accepts evolution as a viable established scientific theory that has passed a large number of hurdles and is supported by an immense amount of evidence.\n\n"}

His full name is: Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ali bin Hasan bin Bashir (in some sources it is 'Bishr') Al Hakim At-Termizi. He is locally known as At-Termizi or Termiz Ota (\"Father of Termiz city\").\n\nInformation about his life and scientific and creative activities can be found in the works by Taj ad-Din Subki (Tabakat Ash-Shafii'yya Al-kubra), Khatiba Baghdad (Tarikh Baghdad), Ibn Hajara AshkAlani (Lisan Al-Miyzan), Sulami (Tabaqat As-Sufiyya) and in a number of other treatises.\n\nAl Hakim At-Termizi speaks about his life in his book \"Bad'u Shaani Abu Abdullah\" (\"The Beginning of Abu Abdullah's Pursuit\"), published in Beirut in 1965 by Yakh'ya Ismail Usman, together with the work of the scientist in \"Khatm Al-Avliya\" (\"Seal of the Saints\").\nTirmidhi was apparently born between 820 and 830 AD in Termez, Khorasan, nowadays Uzbekistan. His father was a scholar of hadith and a jurist; his early education appears to have been very orthodox. He was reared as a scholar of \"hadith\" and \"fiqh\" (law), more specifically, the Hanafi school of law that was dominant in eastern territories of Iran. The range of Tirmidhi's education did include the sciences, such as Greek natural science and philosophy. His subsequent reference to learning the use of the astrolabe, implying a knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, has been given different interpretations. \"There is no trace of influence from 'natural science' in his writings.\" But being a Sufi Master is enough to accept that he did. However, his general pursuit of knowledge gained him the name of \"al-hakim\" (the title which means he had mastered the five sciences-Mathematics-Logic-Music-Medicine and Astronomy).\n\nDifferent dates are used in written sources and present literature to indicate Al Hakim At-Termizi's date of birth and death. Some authors, Khwaja Khalif in particular, in his \"Kashf as-Zunun\", give the year 255 in Hijra / 869 AD as Al Hakim At-Termizi's date of death. The same date was written on Al Hakim At-Termizi's tomb. If we proceed from the fact that Al Hakim At-Termizi lived more than one hundred years, some sources say 112, 116 or 120 years, he was born approximately between 750–760 AD. At the same time, Abdulfattah Abdullah Baraka who wrote his great \"Al Hakim At-Termizi and Nazariyyatukhu fil\" (\"Al Hakim At-Termizi and his theory\") thirty years ago, said that Al Hakim At-Termizi, was born in 205 in Hijri / 820 and died in 320 in Hijri / 932 and lived 112 years.\n\nDetailed information about Al Hakim At-Termizi's childhood and youth is not available in the sources. According to his \"autobiography\", he started learning religious sciences when he was eight, and he made a Hajj to Mecca when he was twenty-eight.\n\nReturning from Mecca, Al Hakim At-Termizi became a Sufi follower; he withdrew from people and learned treaties.\nHis father Ali bin Hassan was a leading scholar, a Hadith specialist, who, looking for knowledge, went to Baghdad and took an active part in scientific discussions with prominent scholars of the time on various problems of Hadith. His mother and uncle were considered to be experts of Hadith. Consequently, Al Hakim At-Termizi grew up in the circle of educated and scientific people, which influenced greatly on his ideology.\n\nSome written sources contain reliable information about Al Hakim At-Termizi's teachers. His teacher was his father Ali bin Al-Hassan at Termizi \"History of Baghdad\" by Khatib Al-Bagdhadi contains some information. Among his other teachers were Kutaiba bin Sayid as-Sakafi Al- Balkhi (798–888 AD), Salih bin Abdullah At-Termizi of much interesting facts had been written in the book \"Books about Famous People\" by Ibn Khibbana; Salih bin Muhammad At-Termizi who was former qazi of Termiz for some time, Sufyan bin Vaki (died in 860), Hassan bin Umar bin Shafiq Al- Balkhi (died in 840 AD), Ahmad bin Khadravayh (died in 854 AD), Abu Turab An-Nakhshabi (link), and Yahya bin Maaz Ar-Razi (died in 875 AD).\n\nBased on data given in the written sources Al Hakim At-Termizi's life can be divided into the following periods:\n\n\nAl Hakim At-Termizi had many of students, including: Abu Muhammad Yahya bin Mansur Al-Kadi (died in 960 AD), Abu Ali Mansur bin Abdullah bin Khalid Al-Zuhli Al Hiravi; Abu Ali Al-Hassan bin Ali Al-Jurjani. He also taught Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Isa, Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Umar Al-Al Hakim Al-Varrak, Muhammad bin Jaafar bin Muhammad bin Al-Haisam bin Umran bin Buraida, and others.\n\nAl Hakim At-Termizi's scientific and creative activity is closely connected with his travels to other countries and cities. He visited Balkh, Nishapur, and Baghdad, where science and culture reached its zenith, and he met famous scholars and took part in discussions. Nevertheless, Termiz, his native city played an important role in his scientific and creative activity, and there he created his basic works. His sermons and as well as some works, first of all, \"Hatam Al-Avliya\" (Seal of Saints), \"Hal Ash-Shari'a\" (Arguments of the Islamic Law) in which are discussed Muslim rituals, about \"love for God\" and about various categories of mystics, about \"the Seals of Saints\", along with existing \"Seals of Prophets\", had dissatisfied some parts of the falikh and rich. Escaping from his enemies' chase, Al Hakim At-Termizi had to move to Balkh and then to Nishapur, where he was very well accepted and where he obtained a large number of followers later.\n\nAccording to Radtke and O'Kane, \"he is the first and, up until the time of Ibn al-Arabi, the only mystic author whose writings present a broad synthesis of mystic experience, anthropology, cosmology and Islamic theology... Tirmidhi's system of thought is representative of an old Islamic theosophy which had not yet consciously assimilated elements from the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic philosophic tradition.\"\n\n\nDifferent figures on the number of Al Hakim At-Termizi's works are mentioned in the written sources. Some authors say that the number of his work reaches four hundred. But the majority of authors tend to think that about eighty works belong to him. The famous Egyptian scholar Abdelfattah Abdulla Baraka writes that out of four hundred works by Al Hakim At-Termizi only about sixty have reached us. Though many works were lost, the most important ones that contain the great scholar's basic teachings, which comprise his scientific and spiritual legacy have been preserved (2).\n\nThe first work that must be mentioned is \"Navodir Al-Usul fi Ma'rifat Akhbor Ar-Rasul\" (\"Unique Principles of Learning about RasulAllah – the Messenger of God\"). It consists of 291 Hadith, and that to some extent it reflects the author's points of view, his outlook, his understanding the world. One copy of \"Navadir Al-Usul\" is kept in Tashkent, in the library of Muslim Board of Uzbekistan.\n\nOther works of the scholar are: \"Khaqiyqat Al-Odamiyya\" (\"Book about the Nature of a Man\"), \"Adab an-Nafs\" (\"Bringing up the Soul\"). The majority of the works of Al Hakim At-Termizi reached us in the form of manuscripts and they are kept in different manuscript funds of the world. Conditionally they may be divided into five groups: manuscripts that are kept in Paris, Cairo, Damascus, Alexandria, Istanbul and London. The following works by Al Hakim At-Termizi are kept in the National Library of Paris (in the Arab department):\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.\n\nAlfonso Reyes' parents were Bernardo Reyes and Aurelia Ochoa. His father was in important government positions during the government of Porfirio Díaz, such as the governorship of Nuevo León and the Secretary of War and Navy. Alfonso Reyes was educated primarily in Mexico City.\n\nIn 1909, he and other like-minded young intellectuals such as Martín Luis Guzmán and José Vasconcelos, founded the Ateneo de la Juventud to promote new cultural and aesthetic ideals and educational reform in Mexico. Other writers as Julio Torri and Pedro Enríquez Ureña also were part from the Ateneo and literary mates of Reyes. At the age of 21, Reyes published his first book, \"Cuestiones estéticas\". The following year, 1912, he wrote a short story, \"La Cena\" (\"The Supper\"), considered a forerunner of surrealism and of Latin American magical realism. In that year he was also named Secretary of the Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\n\nReyes obtained his law degree in 1913, the same year that his father would die participating in an attempted coup d'état against the then president Francisco Madero.\n\nAlfonso Reyes was posted to Mexico's diplomatic service in France in 1913. After Germany invaded France in 1914, he moved to Madrid, Spain, and pursued a literary career as journalist, investigator, translator, critic, and writer. In 1915, he wrote what is probably his best-known essay, \"Visión de Anáhuac (1915),\" with its famous epigraph, \"Viajero: has llegado a la región más transparente del aire\", the source of the title of Carlos Fuentes's novel \"La región más transparente\".\n\nReyes was reinstated in the diplomatic service in 1920. He was the second secretary in Spain in 1920, was in Paris from 1924 to 1927, then served as the ambassador to Argentina (1927–30 and 1936–37). He was the Mexican ambassador to Brazil from 1930 to 1935 and again in 1938. In 1939, he retired from the diplomatic corps and returned to Mexico, where he organized what is today El Colegio de México and dedicated himself to writing and teaching.\n\nDuring his time in Spain, where he resided from 1914 till 1924, it was considered his best creative period and when he became a great writer and master of literature.\n\nIn Spain, where he passed through hard financial times, he dedicated himself to literature and combined it with journalism; he worked in the Centro de Estudios Históricos (Historical Study Center) of Madrid under the direction of Sir Ramón Menéndez Pidal. In 1919 he was named the Mexican commission secretary \"Francisco del Paso y Troncoso\", the same year that Cantar de mio Cid was put to prose.\n\nMany of his friends insisted that he was a natural in Spanish and should pursue a career in politics, but he didn't follow their advice. One time he was presented with an offer to teach, but he rejected it too. He was more interested in the aesthetics of Benedetto Croce. He published numerous essays about poetry of the Spanish Golden Age, standing out among them: Baroque y Góngora; on top of that he was one of the first writers to study poetry of the Nun Juana Inés de la Cruz. From 1917 he produced Cartones de Madrid, his small masterpiece, Visión de Anáhuac, El suicida, and in 1921, El cazador. He was a collaborator of the magazines of \"Revista de Filología Española\", Revista de Occidente and \"Revue Hisanique\". His works about Spanish literature, older classical literature and aesthetics are notable, and among the more notable of that time, \"Cuestiones estéticas\" (1911). In Spain he organized a ceremony on 11 September 1923 in the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid (Real Botanical Garden of Madrid) to honor the memory of the symbolic poet Stéphane Mallarmé.\n\nAfter 1924 he developed a diplomatic and social life in Paris, Buenos Aires and Río de Janeiro. He translated a Mallarmé and edited his own literary mail, \"Monterrey\", publishing it in 1930. He wrote friends abroad in every part of the world and gave discourses, spoke at conferences and contributed to homages and cultural reunions.\n\nHe published among others, \"Cuestiones gongorinas\" (1927), \"Capítulos de literatura española\" (1939–195), \"Discurso por Virgilio\" (1931). His poetic works reveal a profound knowledge of the formal means, notably \"Ifigenia cruel\" (1924), \"Pausa\" (1926), \"5 casi sonetos\" (1931), \"Otra voz\" (1936) and \"Cantata en la tumba de Federico García Lorca\" (1937).\n\nHe left a left a legacy of work as a translator (Laurence Sterne, G.K. Chesterton, Anton Chekhov) and as an editor (Ruiz de Alarcón, Cantar del mio Cid, Lope de Vega, Baltasar Gracián, Juan Ruiz, Francisco de Quevedo).\n\nThe Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges referred to Reyes as \"the greatest prose writer in the Spanish language of any age\". At least five avenues in Monterrey's metropolitan area, three in the municipality and one in Mexico City are named after Reyes.\n\n\n\nThe Fondo de Cultura Económica published his complete works in 26 volumes, titled \"Obras Completas de Alfonso Reyes\".

He founded the Rosminians, officially the Institute of Charity or \"\", pioneered the concept of social justice, and was a key figure in Italian Liberal Catholicism. Alessandro Manzoni considered Rosmini the only contemporary Italian author worth reading.\n\nAntonio Rosmini Serbati was born 24 March 1797, at Rovereto, in the Austrian Tyrol. He studied at the University of Padua, and was ordained priest at Chioggia, 21 April 1821. In 1822 he received a Doctorate in Theology and Canon Law.\n\nDuring this time Rosmini formulated his \"Principle of Passivity\". Rosmini felt compelled to ask himself: Do my plans spring more from my own subjective desire to do good than from a desire to do the will of God?”. Reflecting in this way, Rosmini articulated the principle in two parts: be ready to undertake any work of charity but only so long as it is God’s Providence that presents it; in the meantime, immerse oneself in the commitment to continual conversion, seeking the amendment of one’s own life.\n\nIn 1828 he founded at Monte Calvario near Domodossola, a new religious community, the Institute of Charity, known generally since as the Rosminians. In the autumn of 1830 he inaugurated the observance of the rule at Calvario, and from 1834 to 1835 had charge of a parish at Rovereto. Later foundations followed at Stresa and Domodossola. The Constitutions of the institute were approved by presented to Pope Gregory XVI on 20 December 1838. The institute spread rapidly in England and Italy, and requests for foundations came from various countries.\n\nThe members might be priests or laymen, who devoted themselves to preaching, the education of youth, and works of universal charity—material, spiritual and intellectual. They work in Italy, England, Ireland, France, Wales, New Zealand, Kenya, Tanzania, India, Venezuela, and the United States. In London they were attached to the historical Church of St Etheldreda, Ely Place, Holborn. In 1962, Rosmini College School for Boys was founded in Auckland, New Zealand by Father Catcheside.\n\nRosmini was retained as a political advisor to the then government of Piedmont. In August 1848, he was sent to Rome by King Charles Albert of Piedmont to enlist the pope on the side of Italy as against Austria. Rosmini was invited to serve in the Roman Curia of Pope Pius IX as prime minister of the Papal States. He participated in the intellectual struggle which had for its object emancipation from Austria, but as a trusted ecclesiastical advisor and diplomat he was not an initiator of the movement which ended in the freedom and unity of Italy. In fact, while eager for the deliverance of Italy from Austria, his aim was to bring about a confederation of the states of the country, which was to be under the control of the pope. Upon establishment of the Roman Republic, the Pontiff was forced to flee and became estranged from his former advisor in political matters. The tenuous political circumstances made it very difficult to reconcile the two men's differing projects: innovative social and juridical reforms, however modest, fell victim to the more pressing existential needs of defending the supremacy of the Church's temporal powers.\n\nRosmini's works, \"Of the five wounds of the Holy Church\" and \"The Constitution of Social Justice\" (see Works below), aroused great opposition, especially among the Jesuits, and in 1849 they were placed upon the Index. Rosmini at once declared his submission and retired to Stresa on Lago Maggiore, where he died. Before his death he had the satisfaction of learning that the works in question were dismissed, that is, proclaimed free from censure by the Congregation of the Index. Twenty years later, the word dismissed (\"dimittantur\") became the subject of controversy, some maintaining that it amounted to a direct approval, others that it was purely negative and did not imply that the books were free from error. \nVincenzo Maria Gatti, the Dominican professor of theology at the College of Saint Thomas, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Master of the Sacred Palace, was instrumental in partially rehabilitating the works of Rosmini. In an article published in \"L'Osservatore Romano\" on 16 June 1876, Gatti made clear that Pius IX did not intend the \"dimittantur\" as amounting to wholesale condemnation. The controversy continued until 1887, however, when Pope Leo XIII condemned forty of Rosmini's propositions.\n\nIn 1998 he was named by Pope John Paul II in the encyclical \"Fides et Ratio\" as one of the greater Christian thinkers.\n\nThe most comprehensive view of Rosmini's philosophical standpoint is to be found in his \"\", in which he set forth the conception of a complete encyclopaedia of the human knowable, synthetically conjoined, according to the order of ideas, in a perfectly harmonious whole. Contemplating the position of recent philosophy from John Locke to Georg Hegel, and having his eye directed to the ancient and fundamental problem of the origin, truth and certainty of our ideas, he wrote: \"If philosophy is to be restored to love and respect, I think it will be necessary, in part, to return to the teachings of the ancients, and in part to give those teachings the benefit of modern methods\" (\"Theodicy\", a. 148). He examined and analysed the fact of human knowledge, and obtained the following results:\n\nOn 26 June 2006, Pope Benedict XVI signed a Decree of the heroic virtues, and hence declared Rosmini to be Venerable. On 3 June 2007, Pope Benedict XVI authorized the promulgation of a decree approving Rosmini's beatification. On 18 November 2007 he was beatified in Novara, Italy.\n\nOf his numerous works, of which a collected edition in 17 volumes was issued at Milan (1842–44), supplemented by \"Opere postume\" in 5 volumes (Turin, 1859–74), the most important are:\nThe following have also been translated into English:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "360414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360414", "title": "Autogenic training", "text": "Autogenic training\n\nAutogenic training is a desensitization-relaxation technique developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz by which a psychophysiologically determined relaxation response is obtained. The technique was first published in 1932. Studying the self-reports of people immersed in a hypnotic state, J.H. Schultz noted that physiological changes are accompanied by certain feelings. Abbé Faria and Émile Coué are the forerunners of Schultz. The technique involves repetitions of a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation and is based on passive concentration of bodily perceptions (e.g., heaviness and warmth of arms, legs), which are facilitated by self-suggestions. The technique is used to alleviate many stress-induced psychosomatic disorders.\n\nBiofeedback practitioners integrate basic elements of autogenic imagery and have simplified versions of parallel techniques that are used in combination with biofeedback. This was done at the Menninger Foundation by Elmer Green, Steve Fahrio, Patricia Norris, Joe Sargent, Dale Walters and others. They incorporated the hand warming imagery of autogenic training and used it as an aid to develop thermal biofeedback.\n\nThe roots of this technique lie in the research carried out by Oscar Vogt in the field of sleep and hypnosis. Vogt investigated individuals who had experience in hypnotic sessions. Under his guidance, they were able to go into a state (similar to a hypnotic state) for a self-determined period of time. These short-term mental exercises appeared to reduce stress or effects such as fatigue and tension. In the meantime, other disturbing effects (e.g. headaches) could be avoided. Inspired by this research and Vogt's work, Johannes Heinrich Schultz became interested in the phenomenon of autosuggestion. He wanted to explore an approach, which would avoid undesirable implications of hypnotherapy (e.g., the passivity of the individual and dependency on the therapist). When he was investigating hallucinations in healthy persons, he found that a majority of the subjects reported having two types of experienced sensation: heaviness in the extremities and feeling of warmth. Schultz wanted to understand whether simply imagining a state of heaviness and warmth in one's limbs could induce a state similar to hypnosis. Based on this idea he developed six basic exercises.\n\nAutogenic training was popularized in North America and the English-speaking world by Wolfgang Luthe, who co-authored, with Schultz, a multi-volume tome on autogenic training. In 1963 Luthe discovered the significance of \"autogenic discharges\", paroxysmic phenomena of motor, sensorial, visual and emotional nature related to the traumatic history of the patient, and developed the method of \"autogenic abreaction\". His disciple Luis de Rivera, a McGill University-trained psychiatrist, introduced psychodynamic concepts into Luthe's approach, developing \"autogenic analysis\" as a new method for uncovering the unconscious.\n\nThe main purpose of autogenic training is the achievement of autonomic self-regulation by removing environmental distraction, training imagery that accompanies autonomic self-regulation, and by providing a facilitative set of exercises that are easy to learn and remember.\n\nAutogenic training is based on 3 main principles:\nIn the context of autogenic training passive concentration means that the trainee is instructed to concentrate on inner sensations rather than environmental stimuli. Passiveness refers to allowing sensations to happen and being an observer rather than a manipulator.\n\nThe training can be performed in different postures:\n\nThe technique consists of six standard exercises according to Schultz:\n\nWhen a new exercise step is added in autogenic training, the trainee should always concentrate initially on the already learned exercises and then add a new exercise. In the beginning, a new exercise is added for only brief periods.\n\nAccording to the specific clinical needs, different modifications of formulas are used. These modifications can be classified into 3 main types:\n\nA study by Spencer suggests that autogenic training restores the balance between the activity of the sympathetic (flight or fight) and the parasympathetic (rest and digest) branches of the autonomic nervous system. The author hypothesizes that this can have important health benefits, as the parasympathetic activity promotes digestion and bowel movements, lowers the blood pressure, slows the heart rate, and promotes the functions of the immune system.\n\nThere is a lack of neurophysiological investigations addressing this topic; however, one EEG study from 1963 suggests that the decrease in afferent stimulation induces:\nThe same study suggests that EEG patterns obtained from subjects with different level of practice are not similar.\n\nAnother study from 1958 hypothesizes that autogenic state is between the normal waking state and sleep. It suggests that EEG patterns occurring during autogenic training are similar to electrophysiological changes occurring during initial stages of sleep.\n\nAutogenic training has been said to be contraindicated for people with heart conditions (e.g., individuals who have recently experienced myocardial infarction) or psychotic disorders, for children below the age of 5 and the individuals whose symptoms cannot be controlled.\n\nAutogenic training has different applications and is used in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, such as bronchial asthma or hypertension, as well as psychological disorders e.g. anxiety and depression. \nAutogenic training has been subject to clinical evaluation from its early days in Germany, and from the early 1980s worldwide. In 2002, a meta-analysis of 60 studies was published in \"Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback\", finding significant positive effects of treatment when compared to normals over a number of diagnoses; finding these effects to be similar to best recommended rival therapies; and finding positive additional effects by patients, such as their perceived quality of life.\n\nIn Japan, researchers from the Tokyo Psychology and Counseling Service Center have formulated a measure for reporting clinical effectiveness of autogenic training.\n\nThe principle of passive concentration in autogenic training makes this technique different from other relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation and biofeedback, in which trainees try to control physiological functions. As in biofeedback, bidirectional change in physiological activity is possible. Autogenic training is classified as a self-hypnotic technique. It is different from hetero-hypnosis, where trance is induced by another individual. Autogenic training emphasizes a trainee's independence and gives control from therapist to the trainee. By this, the need for physiological feedback devices or a hypnotherapist is eliminated.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2920407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2920407", "title": "Biblical accommodation", "text": "Biblical accommodation\n\nBiblical accommodation is the adaptation of words or sentences from the Bible to signify ideas different from those expressed therein. Thus, if a sinner excuses his fault by saying, \"The serpent deceived me\", he applies the scriptural words of Eve (Gen., iii, 13) to express an idea which the sentence does not convey in the Bible. Similarly, a blind person might use the words of Tob., v, 12, \"What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven\". Here, again, the words would have a meaning which they do not bear in Sacred Scripture. This accommodation is sometimes incorrectly styled the accommodated, or accommodative, sense of Scripture. From the definition it is clear that it is not a sense of Scripture at all. The possibility of such accommodation may arise, first, from some similarity between the ideas in the sacred text and the subject to which the passage is accommodated; secondly, from the fact that the words of Scripture may be understood in two different senses. The first is called extensive accommodation. Examples of it are found in the Church's offices, both in the Breviary and the Missal, when the praises bestowed by the Holy Ghost on Noe, Isaac, and Moses are applied to other saints. Thus the words of Ecclus., xxxii, 1, 5: \"Have they made thee ruler? . . . hinder not music\" are sometimes applied to College presidents assuming the burden of their office; we need not say that the words of Sacred Scripture have quite a different meaning. The second species of accommodation, called allusive, is often a mere play on words and at times seems due to a misunderstanding of the original meaning. The Vulgate text, \"Mirabilis Deus in sanctis suis\" (Ps., lxvii, 36) means, in the mouth of the Psalmist, that God is wonderful in His sanctuary (sancta, -orum). The Latin words may also be translated \"God is wonderful in his saints\" (sancti, -orum), and they are employed in this sense in the Missal. As this second signification was not intended by the inspired writer, the English rendering of the text in the Douay-Rheims version is a mistranslation.\n\nIt is generally held by Catholic authors that certain passages from the Old Testament have been used over again in the New Testament with a change of meaning. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (xiii, 5) the words spoken to Josue, \"I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee\" (Jos., i, 5), are applied to all Christians. Other examples of accommodation are the use of Exod., xvi, 18 in II Cor., viii, 15; Zach., iv, 14 in Apoc., xi, 4; Ps., vi, 9 in Matt., vii, 2, 3; Mich., vii, 6 in Matt, x, 36. Evidently, the new meaning attached to the words is also inspired. Rationalistic writers have maintained that similar accommodations are to be found in every case where the Four Evangelists quote the prophecies of the Old Testament. Some few Catholic writers have been willing to grant this explanation for a few passages, but the words in which the Evangelists assert that events in Our Lord's life took place \"in order that\" the prophecies might be fulfilled are incompatible with the theory that they wished to indicate only a resemblance between the event and the prophet's words. It is probable that no prophecy is used in the Gospels merely by accommodation.\n\nNew Testament quotations of Old Testament predictions often seem to modern readers to be accommodations, striking or forced as the case may be, while the New Testament writer, \"following the exegetical methods current among the Jews of his time, Matthew ii. 15, 18, xxvi. 31, xxvii. 9\", puts them forward as arguments. To say that he is merely \"describing a New Testament fact in Old Testament phraseology\" may be true of the result rather than of his design.\n\nAccommodation is used in the Liturgy and by the Fathers of the Church; texts have been accommodated by preachers and ascetical authors. Many of the sermons of St. Bernard are mosaics of Scripture phrases. The Council of Trent forbade the wresting of Scripture to profane uses (Sess. IV, Decret. \"De editione et usu Sacrorum Librorum \"). Typical rules for guidance in the accommodation of Scripture are:\n\n\nGerman 18th-century rationalism held that the Biblical writers made great use of conscious accommodation, intending moral commonplaces when they seemed to be enunciating Christian dogmas. Another expression for this, used, for example, by Johann Salomo Semler, is \"economy,\" which also occurs in the kindred sense of \"reserve\" (or of \"Disciplina Arcani\", a modern term for the supposed early Catholic habit of reserving esoteric truths). Isaac Williams on \"Reserve in Religious Teaching\", No. 80 of \"Tracts for the Times\", made a great sensation, and was commented on by Richard William Church in \"The Oxford Movement\".\n"}

He is co-author of \"The Animal Rights Debate\" (Rowman and Littlefield, 2001), a point-counterpoint volume with Prof. Tom Regan; he is also the author of \"Democracy\" (Macmillan, 1972); the author of \"Four Systems\" (Random House, 1982); the editor of \"Communism, Fascism, and Democracy\" (McGraw Hill, 1997); the co-author (with J. Sterba) of \"Affirmative Action and Racial Preference\" (Oxford, 2003), co-author (with I. M. Copi) of \"Introduction to Logic, 13th edition\" (Prentice-Hall, 2008), and author of \"A Conflict of Principles: The Battle over Affirmative Action at the University of Michigan\" (University Press of Kansas, 2014).\n\nHe has published many essays in moral and political philosophy in philosophical, medical, and legal journals. He has served as a member of the Medical School faculty of the University of Michigan, and as Chairman of the University of Michigan faculty, where he has been an active member of the philosophy faculty since 1955. In 2006 the University held a celebration honoring his 50 years on the faculty.\n\nDuring the years 1964-67 Cohen, then an Associate Prof. of Philosophy, was an active member of the small planning committee for the Residential College of the University of Michigan. He became the principal author of the \"Blue Book\" which laid the intellectual foundations for the Residential College. When the Residential College opened in 1967 Cohen became a full-time member of its faculty, and his appointment was shifted from the Department of Philosophy to the Residential College, where he remains the only one of that founding group serving as an active member of the Michigan faculty.\n\nIn 1998 anonymous donations totaling some $13,000 were made to the university to name a reading room in the Residential College in Cohen's honor. This was done; a plaque honoring him was placed. It was removed shortly afterwards, however, the reason given being \"procedural violations.\" Many in the University believed that Cohen was being discriminated against because of his outspoken and unpopular opposition to the race-conscious admissions system of the University. Senior members of the Law School faculty, and other faculties, who did not agree with Cohen's views on the admissions matter, nevertheless wrote angrily to the President, Lee Bollinger, in the conviction that technical violations of procedure were being arbitrarily invoked against him, and that the reputation of the University had been besmirched. The President agreed to replace the plaque and to reaffirm the name of the Reading Room; Cohen agreed that his own donation of $10,000 to the University for the room be made public.\n\nIn 1996, Cohen made public information he had gathered using the State of Michigan's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) about the substantial weight of racial factors in the University of Michigan undergraduate admissions office use of a \"grid system\". Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher sued the University based on this data. Barbara Grutter, in a separate proceeding, sued the Law School of the University of Michigan relying on additional data also revealed by Cohen's FOIA inquiry. While the U-M changed its \"grid system\" to a \"point system\" the following year, it argued that both mechanical systems were identical in outcome and that the point system, which became more famous, was designed merely to be easier to understand. The system that Cohen made public was ruled unconstitutional by the U. S. Supreme Court [in Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003] as a \"mechanical system,\" although in a separate ruling concerning the U-M Law School [Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003], the limited use of non-mechanical preferences was allowed.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on June 23, 2003, Cohen, Gratz, Grutter, and others were among those who invited Ward Connerly to Michigan, where he appeared in a July 8, 2003, speech on the Michigan campus announcing the formation of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI), to forbid preference by race or nationality in the state. This became Proposition 2 (06-2) in Michigan, appearing on the November 8, 2006, ballot. Cohen was a leading spokesperson for Proposition 2 in a heated electoral campaign. Proposition 2 passed by a 58%–42% margin. As a result of Cohen's involvement in the issue, he has appeared on numerous panels and in media reports on racial preferences since the mid-1990s.\n\nCohen has been a lifetime activist for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), serving as Chair of the Michigan affiliate of the ACLU, and for years as a member of the National Board of Directors of the ACLU.\n\nWhen the American Nazi Party threatened, in 1978, to march in Skokie, Illinois, Cohen published (in \"The Nation\" to which he was a regular contributor) several widely reprinted essays defending the right to present publicly even the most abhorrent political views. [See: \"The Extreme Test of Free Speech,\" \"The Nation\", 15 April 1978] When (as a part of the protest against the Vietnam War) efforts were made to forbid research of certain kinds on the U-M campus, Cohen strongly supported the freedom of faculty members to engage in the inquiries that they thought appropriate. During that war Cohen, in active protest, defended selective conscientious objection [See: \"The Case for Selective Pacifism,\" \"The Nation\", 8 July 1968], and defended some, but not all, civil disobedience. [See: \"Civil Disobedience and the Law,\" Rutgers Law Review, Fall, 1966.] When University administrators sought to censor the showing of sexually explicit films on campus, Cohen, then serving as Chair of the University faculty, strongly defended student freedoms before the Regents of the University, with ultimate success. In the mid-1970s, when the fear of misuse led some to oppose the continuation of research in recombinant DNA technology, Cohen defended such research vigorously, both on the Michigan campus and also in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" [\"When May Research Be Stopped?\" \"NEJM\" 26 May 1977.]\n\nCohen maintains his membership in the ACLU despite his disagreement with the organization's support of race preferences in university admissions.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1995 a fraction of Cohen's appointment was in the Medical School of the University of Michigan, where he served as Professor of Philosophy and as Director of the Program in Human Values in Medicine. There he served also as a founding member of the Michigan Medical Center's Ethics Committee, as a member of its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and for more than 30 years, as a member of its Institutional Review Board (IRB). Cohen's involvement with research on humans led to reflections on the uses of animals in science, which he defends [See: \"The Case for the Use of Animals in Biomedical Research,\" \"New England Journal of Medicine\", 2 October 1986]; and on the limited uses of prisoners as research subjects, which he also defends [see: \"Medical Experimentation on Prisoners,\" \"Perspectives in Biology and Medicine\", Spring, 1978]; on ethical issues in transplant medicine (See: \"Alcoholics and Liver Transplantation,\" \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", 13 March 1991); and on abortion (See: \"How Not to Argue about Abortion,\" \"The Michigan Quarterly Review\", Fall, 1990).\n\nHaving written much about the concept of justice, Cohen became involved, during the 1970s, in the process of Labor/Management arbitration. With the support of the late Prof. William Haber (Economics, U-M), a well-known arbitrator, Cohen became a member of the Labor Panel of the American Arbitration Association, and over the years has issued many arbitration awards in many industries. Cohen remains an active arbitrator for the AAA, and also an Act 312 Arbitrator, and Grievance Arbitrator, for the State of Michigan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2775954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2775954", "title": "Code of the United States Fighting Force", "text": "Code of the United States Fighting Force\n\nThe Code of the U.S. Fighting Force is a code of conduct that is an ethics guide and a United States Department of Defense directive consisting of six articles to members of the United States Armed Forces, addressing how they should act in combat when they must evade capture, resist while a prisoner or escape from the enemy. It is considered an important part of U.S. military doctrine and tradition, but is not formal military law in the manner of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or public international law, such as the Geneva Conventions.\n\nDuring the Korean War in the early 1950s, Chinese and North Korean forces captured American military personnel as prisoners of war. Unlike America's previous wars, these American prisoners then faced a deadly new enemy, the \"Eastern World's\" POW environment. It was the first American war that U.S. prisoners of war were viewed by an enemy as more than soldiers from the other side temporarily restrained from conducting war and whose desire to control the minds of U.S. prisoners extended the war into the POW camps. North Korean and Chinese communists were not hesitant to use brutal and bloody torture as gruesome tools in their efforts to exploit U.S. prisoners of war into making public statements that appeared favorable to the communist war effort. For the American prisoners brutal torture, lack of food, absence of medical aid, and subhuman treatment became a daily way of life and many of them found that their training had not prepared them for this new battlefield.\n\nAlthough collaborating with the enemy is nothing new (and there were a number of examples of it during World War II), its ramifications caused considerable damage to the morale and survival of U.S. POWs during the Korean War and later the Vietnam War. Before the Korean War, American prisoners in previous wars were subjected to inhumane and brutal treatment but the enemy did not take it upon itself to tear down the chain of command within the prisoner ranks. When the communists succeeded, a condition of distrust among the prisoners became the norm rather than the exception. Morale dropped and mutual assistance among the prisoners lessened. Chaos followed and the failure of the POWs to care for their fellow prisoners resulted in a higher death rate and made the captives more amenable to accept the doctrine of their captors.\n\nOne of the most elaborate propaganda efforts was the 1952 POW Olympics held in Pyuktong, North Korea. For 12 days in November, approximately 500 prison athletes from Britain, South Korea, Australia, Turkey, and the U.S. competed against other camps in events mirroring the World Olympics such as baseball, boxing, and track and field. This effort was publicized to show the world just how well the UN prisoners were treated. Of course, this was not the reality. Very few American servicemen were mentally prepared to protect themselves from such barbaric treatment and intense indoctrination attempts. Through inhumane treatment and manipulation, many prisoners were forced to collaborate with the communists.\n\nAfter the termination of the hostilities in Korea and the subsequent release of American prisoners of war, twenty-one Americans chose to remain in China, refusing repatriation. Many former U.S. prisoners coming back to their homeland were criminally charged and tried for offenses that \"amounted to treason, desertion to the enemy, mistreatment of fellow prisoners of war, and similar crimes.\" The emotions and compassion of the public were aroused, as graphic details of the inhumane treatment of U.S. POWs in communist prison camps surfaced during the trials. Public discussion caused intense arguments over what should have been done about Americans who were \"brainwashed\" in Korea and what to do about those in future wars who may be the recipients of similar bloody treatment.\n\nOn August 7, 1954, the United States Secretary of Defense directed that a committee be formed to recommend a suitable approach for conducting a comprehensive study of the problems related to the entire Korean War POW experience. The work of that committee resulted in the May 17, 1955 appointment of the Defense Advisory Committee on Prisoners of War, headed by Carter L. Burgess, assistant secretary of defense for Manpower and Personnel. The committee took heed of the ongoing divisive debate, noting that while all services had regulations governing the conduct of prisoners of war, \"the United States armed forces have never had a clearly defined code of conduct applicable to American prisoners after capture.\"\n\nColonel Franklin Brooke Nihart, USMC, worked at Marine Corps headquarters throughout the summer of 1955, outlined his ideas in longhand and the Code of Conduct was established with the issuance of by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on 17 August 1955 which stated, \"Every member of the Armed Forces of the United States are expected to measure up to the standards embodied in the Code of Conduct while in combat or in captivity.\" It has been modified twice—once in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter in , and most recently in President Ronald Reagan's of March 1988, which amended the code to make it gender-neutral.\n\nNotably, the code prohibits surrender except when \"all reasonable means of resistance [are] exhausted and...certain death the only alternative,\" enjoins captured Americans to \"resist by all means available\" and \"make every effort to escape and aid others,\" and bars the acceptance of parole or special favors from enemy forces. The code also outlines proper conduct for American prisoners of war, reaffirms that under the Geneva Conventions prisoners of war should give \"name, rank, service number, and date of birth\" and requires that under interrogation captured military personnel should \"evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability.\"\n\nThe authority for establishing the Code of Conduct, communication of intent, and assignment of responsibilities are outlined in the first three paragraphs of Executive Order 10631.\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance for the behavior and actions of members of the Armed Forces of the United States. This guidance applies not only on the battlefield, but also in the event that the service member is captured and becomes a prisoner of war (POW). The Code is delineated in six articles.\n\n\n"}

He was a philosopher and metaphysician inspired by the Hindu philosophy of Advaita Vedanta and Sufism and the author of numerous books on religion and spirituality. He was also a poet and a painter.\n\nIn his prose and poetic writings, Schuon focuses on metaphysical doctrine and spiritual method. He is considered one of the main representatives and an exponent of the \"religio perennis\" (perennial religion) and one of the chief representatives of the Traditionalist School. In his writings, Schuon expresses his faith in an absolute principle, God, who governs the universe and to whom our souls would return after death. For Schuon the great revelations are the link between this absolute principle—God—and mankind. He wrote the main bulk of his work in French. In the later years of his life Schuon composed some volumes of poetry in his mother tongue, German. His articles in French were collected in about 20 titles in French which were later translated into English as well as many other languages. The main subjects of his prose and poetic compositions are spirituality and various essential realms of the human life coming from God and returning to God.\n\nSchuon was born in Basel, Switzerland, on June 18, 1907. His father was a native of southern Germany, while his mother came from an Alsatian family. Schuon's father was a concert violinist and the household was one in which not only music but literary and spiritual culture were present. Schuon lived in Basel and attended school there until the untimely death of his father, after which his mother returned with her two young sons to her family in nearby Mulhouse, France, where Schuon was obliged to become a French citizen. Having received his earliest training in German, he received his later education in French and thus mastered both languages early in life.\n\nFrom his youth, Schuon's search for metaphysical truth led him to read the Hindu scriptures such as \"Upanishads\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\". While still living in Mulhouse, he discovered the works of René Guénon, the French philosopher and Orientalist, which served to confirm his intellectual intuitions and which provided support for the metaphysical principles he had begun to discover.\n\nSchuon journeyed to Paris after serving for a year and a half in the French army. There he worked as a textile designer and began to study Arabic in the local mosque school. Living in Paris also brought the opportunity to be exposed to various forms of traditional art to a much greater degree than before, especially the arts of Asia with which he had had a deep affinity since his youth. This period of growing intellectual and artistic familiarity with the traditional worlds was followed by Schuon's first visit to Algeria in 1932. It was then that he met the celebrated Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi and was initiated into his order. Schuon has written about his deep affinity with the esoteric core of various traditions and hence appreciation for the Sufism in the Islamic tradition. His main reason for seeking the blessings of Shaykh Al-Alawi being exactly the attachment to an orthodox master and Saint. On a second trip to North Africa, in 1935, he visited Algeria and Morocco; and during 1938 and 1939 he traveled to Egypt where he met Guénon, with whom he had been in correspondence for 27 years. In 1939, shortly after his arrival in Pie, India, World War II broke out, forcing him to return to Europe. After having served in the French army, and having been made a prisoner by the Germans, he sought asylum in Switzerland, which gave him Swiss nationality and was to be his home for forty years. In 1949 he married, his wife being a German Swiss with a French education who, besides having interests in religion and metaphysics, was also a gifted painter.\n\nFollowing World War II, Schuon accepted an invitation to travel to the American West, where he lived for several months among the Plains Indians, in whom he always had a deep interest. Having received his education in France, Schuon has written all his major works in French, which began to appear in English translation in 1953. Of his first book, \"The Transcendent Unity of Religions\" (London, Faber & Faber) T. S. Eliot wrote: \"I have met with no more impressive work in the comparative study of Oriental and Occidental religion.\"\n\nWhile always continuing to write, Schuon and his wife traveled widely. In 1959 and again in 1963, they journeyed to the American West at the invitation of friends among the Sioux and Crow American Indians. In the company of their Native American friends, they visited various Plains tribes and had the opportunity to witness many aspects of their sacred traditions. In 1959, Schuon and his wife were solemnly adopted into the Sioux family of James Red Cloud, descendant of Red Cloud. Years later they were similarly adopted by the Crow medicine man and Sun Dance chief, Thomas Yellowtail. Schuon's writings on the central rites of Native American religion and his paintings of their ways of life attest to his particular affinity with the spiritual universe of the Plains Indians. Other travels have included journeys to Andalusia, Morocco, and a visit in 1968 to the reputed home of the Virgin Mary in Ephesus.\n\nThrough his many books and articles, Schuon became known as a spiritual teacher and leader of the Traditionalist School. During his years in Switzerland he regularly received visits from well-known religious scholars and thinkers of the East.\n\nSchuon throughout his entire life had great respect for and devotion to the Virgin Mary which was expressed in his writings. As a result, his teachings and paintings show a particular Marian presence. His reverence for the Virgin Mary has been studied in detail by American professor James Cutsinger. Hence the name, \"Maryamiya\" (in Arabic, \"Marian\"), of the Sufi order he founded as a branch of the Shadhiliya-Darqawiya-Alawiya. When asked by one of his disciples about the reason for this choice of name, Schuon replied: \"It is not we who have chosen her; it is she who has chosen us.\"\n\nIn 1980, Schuon and his wife emigrated to the United States, settling in Bloomington, Indiana, where a community of disciples from all over the world would gather around him for spiritual direction. The first years in Bloomington saw the publication of some of his most important late works: \"From the Divine to the Human\", \"To Have a Center\", \"Survey of Metaphysics and Esoterism\" and others.\n\nApart from regular strictly Islamic Sufi gatherings of invocation (\"majalis al-dhikr\"), Schuon would occasionally lead in Bloomington gatherings involving the wearing of American Indian attire, and also some degree of ritual nudity. These gatherings were understood by disciples as a sharing in Schuon's personal insights and realization, not as part of the initiatic method he transmitted, centered on the invocation of a Divine Name. \nIn 1991, one of Schuon's followers accused him of \"fondling\" three young girls during “primordial gatherings”. A preliminary investigation was begun, but the chief prosecutor eventually concluded that there was no proof, noting that the plaintiff was of extremely dubious character. The prosecutor declared that there were no grounds for prosecution, and the local press made amends. Some articles and books, including Mark Sedgwick's \"Against the Modern World\",purporting to be scholarly documents, discuss this event and the related \"primordial\" practices of the Bloomington community in Midwestern suburban America in the late twentieth century. Schuon was greatly affected, but continued to write poetry in his native German, to receive visitors and maintain a busy correspondence with followers, scholars and readers until his death in 1998.\n\nThe traditionalist or \"perennialist\" perspective began to be enunciated in the 1920s by the French philosopher René Guénon and, in the 1930s, by Schuon himself. Orientalist Ananda Coomaraswamy and Swiss art historian Titus Burckhardt also became prominent advocates of this point of view. Fundamentally, this doctrine is the Sanatana Dharma – the \"eternal religion\" – of Hindu Neo-Vedanta. It was supposedly formulated in ancient Greece, in particular, by Plato and later Neoplatonists, and in Christendom by Meister Eckhart (in the West) and Gregory Palamas (in the East). Every religion has, besides its literal meaning, an esoteric dimension, which is essential, primordial and universal. This intellectual universality is one of the hallmarks of Schuon's works, and it gives rise to insights into not only the various spiritual traditions, but also history, science and art.\n\nThe dominant theme or principle of Schuon's writings was foreshadowed in his early encounter with a Black marabout who had accompanied some members of his Senegalese village to Switzerland in order to demonstrate their culture. When the young Schuon talked with him, the venerable old man drew a circle with radii on the ground and explained: God is in the center; all paths lead to Him.\n\nFor Schuon, the quintessence of pure metaphysics can be summarized by the following vedantic statement, although the Advaita Vedanta's perspective finds its equivalent in the teachings of Ibn Arabi, Meister Eckhart or Plotinus: \"Brahma satyam jagan mithya jivo brahmaiva na'parah\" (Brahman is real, the world is illusory, the self is not different from Brahman).\n\nThe metaphysics exposited by Schuon is based on the doctrine of the non-dual Absolute (Beyond-Being) and the degrees of reality. The distinction between the Absolute and the relative corresponds for Schuon to the couple Atma/Maya. Maya is not only the cosmic illusion: from a higher standpoint, Maya is also the Infinite, the Divine Relativity or else the feminine aspect (\"mahashakti\") of the Supreme Principle.\n\nSaid differently, being the Absolute, Beyond-Being is also the Sovereign Good (\"Agathon\"), that by its nature \"desires\" to communicate itself through the projection of Maya. The whole manifestation from the first Being (Ishvara) to matter (Prakriti), the lower degree of reality, is indeed the projection of the Supreme Principle (Brahman). The personal God, considered as the creative cause of the world, is only \"relatively Absolute,\" a first determination of Beyond-Being, at the summit of Maya. The Supreme Principle is not only Beyond-Being. It is also the Supreme Self (Atman) and in its innermost essence, the Intellect (buddhi) that is the ray of Consciousness shining down, the axial refraction of Atma within Maya.\n\nAccording to Schuon the spiritual path is essentially based on the discernment between the \"Real\" and the \"unreal\" (Atma / Maya); concentration on the Real; and the practice of virtues. Human beings must know the \"Truth\". Knowing the Truth, they must then will the \"Good\" and concentrate on it. These two aspects correspond to the metaphysical doctrine and the spiritual method. Knowing the Truth and willing the Good, human beings must finally love \"Beauty\" in their own soul through virtue, but also in \"Nature\". In this respect Schuon has insisted on the importance for the authentic spiritual seeker to be aware of what he called the \"metaphysical transparency of phenomena\".\n\nSchuon wrote about different aspects of spiritual life both on the doctrinal and on the practical levels. He explained the forms of the spiritual practices as they have been manifested in various traditional universes. In particular, he wrote on the Invocation of the Divine Name (dhikr, Japa-Yoga, the Prayer of the Heart), considered by Hindus as the best and most providential means of realization at the end of the Kali Yuga. As has been noted by the Hindu saint Ramakrishna, the secret of the invocatory path is that God and his Name are one.\n\nSchuon's views are in harmony with traditional Islamic teachings of the primacy of \"Remembrance of God\" as emphasized by Shaykh Al-Alawi in the following passage:\nGuénon had pointed out at the beginning of the twentieth century that every religion comprises two main aspects, \"esoterism\" and \"exoterism\". Schuon explained that esoterism displays two aspects, one being an extension of exoterism and the other one independent of exoterism; for if it be true that the form \"is\" in a certain way the essence, the essence on the contrary is by no means totally expressed by a single form; the drop is water, but water is not the drop. This second aspect is called \"quintessential esoterism\" for it is not limited or expressed totally by one single form or theological school and, above all, by a particular religious form as such.\n\nGuénon had based his \"Crisis of the Modern World\" on the Hindu doctrine of cyclic nature of time. Schuon expanded on this concept and its consequences for humanity in many of his articles. In his essay \"The Contradictions of Relativism\", Schuon wrote that the uncompromising relativism that underlies many modern philosophies had fallen into an intrinsic absurdity in declaring that there is no absolute truth and then attempting to put this forward as an absolute truth. Schuon notes that the essence of relativism is found in the idea that we never escape from human subjectivity whilst its expounders seem to remain unaware of the fact that relativism is therefore also deprived of any objectivity. Schuon further notes that the Freudian assertion that rationality is merely a hypocritical guise for a repressed animal drive results in the very assertion itself being devoid of worth as it is itself a rational judgment.\n\nSchuon was a frequent contributor to the quarterly journal Studies in Comparative Religion, (along with Guénon, Coomarswamy, and many others) which dealt with religious symbolism and the Traditionalist perspective.\n\n\n"}

Campbell was primarily interested in rhetoric, since he believed that its study would enable his students to become better preachers. He became a philosopher of rhetoric because he took it that the philosophical changes of the Age of Enlightenment would have implications for rhetoric.\n\nCampbell was born on 25 December 1719 in Aberdeen (it is unlikely that there was much significance given to his birth date, since Scottish Calvinists, such as Campbell's father, Rev. Colin Campbell, despised both popish rituals and holidays). At the age of fifteen, Campbell attended Marischal College where he studied logic, metaphysics, pneumatology (philosophy of mind and/or spirit), ethics, and natural philosophy. After graduating with his M.A. in 1738, Campbell decided to study law and served as an apprentice to a writer to the Signet in Edinburgh. He began gravitating towards theology after attending lectures at the University of Edinburgh. After serving out his term as an apprentice, he returned to Aberdeen and enrolled at both King's and Marischal Colleges, University of Aberdeen as a student of divinity. Because of the tumultuous political landscape in Scotland (see Jacobite rising of 1745), Campbell's divinity examinations were delayed until 1746 when he received his licence to preach. Within two years, he received ordination at the parish of Banchory Ternan.\n\nThe origin of Campbell's scholarly career can be traced back to his years at the parish. He established himself as a scripture critic, and lecturer of holy writ. Campbell began his lifelong ambition of translating the gospels, and around 1750, he composed the first two chapters of \"The Philosophy of Rhetoric\". Campbell's growing reputation impressed the magistrates of the city of Aberdeen and he was offered a ministerial position in 1757. His return brought him to the core of the growing intellectual community in northeast Scotland. In 1759, Campbell was offered the position of principal at Marischal College and he fully immersed himself in university affairs.\n\nDuring his time at Marischal, Campbell was a founding member of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society along with philosopher Thomas Reid, John Gregory (mediciner), David Skene, John Stewart and Robert Trail. Many members of the Society, including Reid, Campbell, and Gregory, were great admirers of Francis Bacon, so the group's aim directed toward the exploration of the sciences of the mind. The Aberdeen Philosophical Society is most often remembered for its philosophical publications, notably: Reid's \"Inquiry into the Human mind, on the Principles of Common Sense\" (1764), James Beattie's \"Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth\" (1770), and Alexander Gerard' \"Essay on Genius\". Campbell's work was very much influenced by the group's members. \"The Philosophy of Rhetoric\" was originally read in discourses before this Society. Campbell's emphasis on the trustworthiness of the senses and his exploration of tendencies basic to human nature have been attributed to the influence of his colleague in the society, the common sense philosopher, Thomas Reid.\n\nCampbell's first major publication, \"A Dissertation in Miracles\" (1762), was directed against David Hume's attack on miracles in \"An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding\". Campbell was influenced by Hume, but took particular issue with his philosophical strictures. Even though both were in complete opposition over almost every point of philosophy, Campbell and Hume shared a mutual respect. Thanks in part to the success of \"Miracles\", Campbell became a professor of divinity at Marischal in 1770. He lectured to students to prepare them for the demands of the ministry, both practical and spiritual. Campbell gave lectures on Church history, later published as \"Lectures on Ecclesiastical History\", and on pastoral character and preaching, later published as \"Lectures on Pulpit Eloquence\". After completing \"The Philosophy of Rhetoric\" (1776), Campbell published several sermons and finished his lifelong ambition, \"The Four Gospels, Translated from the Greek\" (1789).\n\nIn December 1793 he was a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nCampbell continued lecturing until ill health forced him into retirement in 1795 and he died on 6 April 1796. He is buried in St Nicholas Churchyard in Aberdeen.\n\nWhile Campbell's literary life was dominated by pedagogical and pastoral concerns, it is apparent that his mind was tempered by the values of the Enlightenment. Campbell believed that the Enlightenment was the ally to a moderate, rational, and practical Christianity, rather than a threat. His faith required that his religious evidences to be complete while his enlightened thinking required faith to give it purpose.\n\nThroughout Campbell's literary career, he focused on enlightened concerns such as rhetoric, taste, and genius—perhaps a result of his time in the Aberdeen Philosophical Society. His attempt to align rhetoric within the sphere of psychology resulted from Francis Bacon's survey of the structure and purpose of knowledge. The Philosophy of Rhetoric illustrates the Baconian influence of inductive methodology but also scientific investigation—two major concerns of the Enlightenment.\n\nAs well, Campbell's appeal to natural evidences was a similarity in process shared by most of the great minds of the Enlightenment. This is seen throughout his writing, with particular emphasis on placing methodology before doctrine, critical inquiry before judgment, and his application of tolerance, moderation, and improvement.\n\nCampbell embraced the philosophical empiricism which John Locke established in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Following the example of Locke's humanistic sciences, Campbell set forth an analysis of rhetoric through the scope of mental faculties. He believed that a rhetoric grounded in empiricism would become efficient because of the incorporation of the cognitive processes. The human senses are the basis for the validity of belief; thus a rhetorical theory based in faculty psychology would establish that rhetoric is capable of making a reader experience a concept with the same \"vivacity\" and automaticity as that of the senses.\n\nCampbell, like most theorists of the Enlightenment, believed in a universal human nature: the \"general principles [of taste] are the same in every people\". He gives the example of tropes and figuration which \"are so far from being the inventions of art, that, on the contrary, they result from the original and essential principles of the human mind\". This facet of human nature has remained constant throughout history so it must be universal trait. Based on premises similar to this, Campbell claimed that human beings act according to clear and obvious motives and rhetoric should be, in turn, directed towards similar operations of the mind.\n\nTo persuade effectively, Campbell believed that the orator should adapt his or her discourse to the needs of the audience, for as he states: \"whatever be the ultimate intention of the orator, to inform, to convince, to please, to move, or to persuade, still he must speak so as to be understood, or he speaks to no purpose\". He classifies the needs of the audience into four different categories:\n\nThe purpose of discourse is derived from the powers of the mind to which they appeal (understanding, imagination, passions, will), rather than the classical three, which are based on the public purpose of oration. The classical categories (see Cicero and Quintilian) are the demonstrative, to praise or blame; the deliberative, to advise or dissuade; and the forensic, to accuse or defend. In considering each of these, Campbell believes that not only understanding and memory of the audience must be taken into account, but the orator must as well provide particular attention at stimulating their passions. To incorporate this was as an obvious concern for Campbell, who believed that effective preaching must be measured by its effects on the audience.\n\nTo move an audience, Campbell believed that a rhetorician must appreciate the relationship between evidence and human nature. Campbell divided evidence into two major types: intuitive and deductive.\n\nIntuitive evidence is convincing by its mere appearance. Its effect on the power of judgment is \"natural, original, and unaccountable\", which suggests that no other additional evidences can make it more compelling or effective. Campbell subdivides intuitive evidence into three sources: abstraction, consciousness, and common sense. These are responsible for our understanding of metaphysical, physical, and moral truths.\n\nDeductive evidence, unlike intuitive, is not immediately perceived. It must be demonstrated either logically or factually since it is not derived by premises but with comparing ideas. Deductive evidence originates from one of two sources: demonstrative or moral. Demonstrative concerns itself with abstract and invariable relations of ideas; moral, on the other hand, is concerned only with matters of fact.\n\nCampbell had the idea of both moral and scientific reasoning. In his book, \"The Philosophy of Rhetoric\", the philosopher states four types of evidence that goes into reasoning. The first one is that reasoning comes from experience and how past experiences shape our sense of reason for present, and future reasoning. The second type of evidence is analogy, to analyze a situation we are able to get more of an understanding and view what needs to be done in the future to better an outcome. The third type of evidence is testimony. Testimony has to deal with written or oral communication. The very last is calculations of chances. Knowing that chance is not predictable a person can assume and use reason when it comes to other certain types of happenings.\n\nCampbell believed that Aristotle's syllogistic method is faulty for four reasons:\n\nIn David Hume's essay, \"Of Miracles\", he assesses the credibility of testimony for miracles, and claims that our acceptance of it is based on experience; thus when testimony goes against the evidence of experience, it is a likely reason to reject the testimony.\n\nIn response, Campbell published \"A Dissertation on Miracles\" to refute Hume's essay. He believed that Hume misrepresented the importance of testimony in attaining knowledge. Our faith in the representation of others is an original component in human nature. As proof, Campbell provides the example of children who readily accept the testimony of others. It is not until they get older and become sceptical that testimony is rejected; proof that our trust in witnesses precedes that of experience. For Campbell, the belief of testimony is part of human nature, since it is an unlearned and automatic response. Testimony is thus closer to evidence from consciousness than that from experience.\n\nCampbell argues that the most important factor in determining the authenticity of testimony is the number of witnesses. Numerous witnesses and no evidence of collusion will supersede all other factors, since the likelihood of testimony outweighs that of Hume's formula for determining the balance of probabilities. According to Campbell, Hume is wrong to claim that testimony is a weakened type of evidence; it is capable of providing absolute certainty even with the most miraculous event.\n\n\n\nCampbell's sermons and lectures provide important insights into the structure of his thought and range of his scholarly activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3138671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3138671", "title": "Glenville shootout", "text": "Glenville shootout\n\nThe Glenville shootout was a gun battle which occurred on the night of July 23–24, 1968, in the Glenville section of Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Gunfire was exchanged for roughly four hours between the Cleveland Police Department and the Black Nationalists of New Libya, a Black Power group. The battle led to the death of three policemen, three suspects, and a bystander. At least 15 others (police, gunmen, and bystanders) were wounded.\n\nThe gun battle sparked the Glenville Riots, which began on the evening of July 23 as the gun battle was winding down, and continued through the evening of July 26–27. During the first day of the riots, the African American mayor of Cleveland, Carl Stokes, refused to allow white police officers to patrol the area. When African American leaders in the neighborhood were unable to quell the violence, Stokes sent the Ohio Army National Guard and the rest of the Cleveland Police into the area to stop the violence. The riots ended early in the morning on July 27. Losses due to the riots were about $2.6 million, and proved to be the political death knell of Mayor Stokes' redevelopment effort. The instigator of the gunfight, Ahmed Evans, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life in prison.\n\nThe city of Cleveland suffered a significant loss of heavy industry beginning about 1950, which led to markedly higher unemployment. Meanwhile, large numbers of African Americans left the Deep South during the Second Great Migration. Cleveland saw a significant influx of blacks (who mistakenly believed the city was still a source of good jobs), but racial segregation and racially discriminatory housing practices left most African Americans able to find housing only in the city's eastern neighborhoods. The number of residents living there jumped from 150,000 in 1950 to 250,000 in 1960. Among the changing areas was the Glenville neighborhood. In 1950, Glenville was overwhelmingly white, middle-class, and Jewish. As these residents began migrating into Cleveland's far eastern suburbs in the 1950s, single-family homes were turned into rentals, and thousands of African Americans moved in. By 1960, Glenville was overwhelmingly black and poor. Most people in Glenville also lived in crowded, substandard housing. Quite often, single-family homes in Glenville were subdivided into four or more apartments, each of which accommodated a large, extended family.\n\nRacial tensions in Cleveland were exacerbated as the city began busing African American children to all-white schools in order to racially desegregate its schools and to reduce overcrowding in minority-majority elementary schools. Black parents were outraged when they discovered that their children were not eligible to participate in arts, sports, and after-hours activities at these schools. In January 1964, the United Freedom Movement, a coalition of black civil rights groups, decided to march on the Murray Hill School in the city's Little Italy neighborhood. When city leaders learned that local white residents intended to stop the march, they feared a riot would break out. The black civil rights groups were persuaded to cancel their protest. But the white mob still formed, and throughout the day on January 30, 1964, white citizens threw rocks and bottles and assaulted any African American person they found on the streets. The Cleveland Police made no arrests.\n\nCleveland's Black Power movement grew substantially in 1964 and 1965, as African American residents of the city viewed the Murray Hill riot as a symbol of their powerlessness. Despair bred extremism and violence. White and black gangs formed in the adjacent Superior-Sowinski area just east of Glenville, and physical assaults and gang wars occurred in broad daylight in the spring and summer of 1966. In June 1966, the week-long Hough Riots occurred throughout much of northeast Cleveland. Racial tension in the city worsened in the aftermath of these riots. A number of arsonists burned buildings and several stores were looted in the Hough neighborhood (the center of the riot) during the spring of 1967. Although many in the local and national media believed Cleveland was headed for another summer of violence in 1967, local African American anger appeared to be channeled politically instead. African American state legislator Carl Stokes unseated incumbent (and white) mayor Ralph S. Locher in the Democratic primary, and went on to win the mayoralty against white Republican attorney Seth Taft in November 1967.\n\nFred Evans was born in Greenville, South Carolina in 1931. His family moved to Cleveland in 1943. Evans dropped out of high school and enlisted in the United States Army in 1948. He served in the Korean War, where he won several medals for meritorious service. After suffering a severe injury when a bridge he was helping to build collapsed, he was discharged in 1952. He drove a city bus for two years, then reenlisted in 1954. He struck an officer, was court-martialed, and was sentenced to two years' hard labor and a dishonorable discharge. His sentence was later reduced to undesirable discharge, and he left the Army after just seven months. Army physicians had concluded that his 1952 injuries had left him with migraines, partial disability, epilepsy, and a personality disorder. He now suffered from severe rage issues which (under stress) he was unable to control, and that this, in part, had led to his confrontation with the senior officer. Evans returned to Cleveland and worked as a menial laborer for the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nAfter seeing what he believed to be a UFO in the early 1960s, Evans turned to astrology for spiritual guidance. After his astrological mentor was hospitalized for insanity in 1966, Evans adopted the first name Ahmed, began wearing garments of an African design, and began preaching an increasingly militant form of black nationalism. About 1964 or 1965, he joined a group calling itself the Black Nationalists of New Libya. He opened the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore on Superior Avenue, which drew the attention of local police because it often served as a gathering place for young black militants. The police closed his store three times in 1967 for \"sanitary violations\" (actions which Evans felt were a ruse to harass him), and Evans assaulted African American Patrolman James Payne in April 1967. In March 1967, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Evans had predicted that the United States would be consumed with violence on May 9, 1967. Although the media ridiculed Evans after his prediction failed to come to pass, Evans' status among local African Americans soared.\n\nOn May 1, 1968, Mayor Stokes announced that he was forming a $10.5 billion fund, named , to completely redevelop the city of Cleveland within a decade. Money for the effort would be contributed by business, private foundations, the city, the state, and the federal government. Cleveland: Now! focused on job training, neighborhood and housing rehabilitation, education, youth development, health, welfare reform, and downtown revitalization. A significant number of grants were made immediately available to a wide range of neighborhood groups to help build civic pride, reduce racial tension, help end poverty, and for other aims. Ahmed Evans applied for and received a $10,300 grant from the city to help local youth learn African arts and crafts.\n\nAt 2:30 PM on July 22, 1968, Cleveland City Council member George L. Forbes and Mayor's Council on Youth Opportunities director Walter Beach met with Cleveland Police Inspector Lewis Coffey at Cleveland City Hall. Coffey said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had given the Cleveland police information that Ahmed Evans and his New Libya group were stockpiling weapons at Evans' home at 12312 Auburndale Avenue in Glenville in preparation for assassinating several prominent African Americans (including Mayor Stokes) and instigating a general \"uprising\" on July 24. The police expressed doubt about these reports, as the sole source of information was a paid FBI informer who was not a member of Evans' group and who seemed under the influence of illegal narcotics. However, police subsequently discovered that black nationalists had been seen at a local department store the morning of July 22 inquiring about high-powered rifles and purchasing bandoliers of ammunition and first aid kits at an army surplus store. But it was unclear if these men belonged to Evans' group. Furthermore, Evans was angry. He had just been told by his white landlord that he could no longer rent space for his Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore, and he had been served with an eviction notice to vacate his apartment on the morning of July 22.\n\nAt the meeting with Forbes and Beach, the police decided that a \"roving surveillance\" of Evans' home should be implemented. Forbes and Beach also agreed to speak with Evans in an attempt to calm him down and attempt to address his grievances.\n\nAt 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach drove to the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, they drove to the Evans' apartment at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were surprised to discover that the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern that he was going to be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.\n\nIt is not clear whether the police or the Black Nationalists of New Libya opened fire first. However, most press outlets stated that the Black Nationalists of New Libya initiated the gun battle.\n\nAccording to police, shortly after Forbes and Beach left at 8:05 PM, an African American man with a carbine emerged from the Evans house and stood guard. A few minutes later, Evans and about 16 others, all of them heavily armed and wearing crossed bandoliers of ammunition, emerged from the house. The guard crossed the street and aimed his gun at the unmarked police vehicle sitting at Auburndale and E. 124th Street. The surveillants radioed for instructions, and at 8:20 PM were told to flee the area. The police vehicle turned right onto E. 124th Street, followed by a station wagon. The police claimed they heard a shot. The other police vehicle also fled the scene, turning right (south) onto Lakeview Avenue. The police in this car also said they heard several shots.\n\nCleveland Police Car No. 604 (a marked vehicle then at E. 123rd Street and Beulah Avenue) broadcast a report of shots fired at 8:24 PM.\n\nA radio broadcast over the police radio alerted the second surveillance vehicle to the shots fired at the tow truck. It turned back, traveling east on Beulah. When it came within view of the tow truck, police say, they saw the tow truck driver running from an armed man. Then two snipers behind the tow truck fired on the unmarked police car (hitting its hood, grill, and windshield). The police returned fire, emptying their weapon ammunition magazines. The police vehicle then fled north on E. 123rd Street, all four of its tires shot out.\n\nAround noon on July 23, 1968, a call was made to the Cleveland Police reporting an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked on the north side of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Lakeview shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and (he said) Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.\n\nEyewitness testimony conflicted with some of these events. Residents on the street and others said that the two tow truck operators examined the abandoned vehicle for several minutes before shots were fired, contradicting McMillan's testimony that he was fired upon almost immediately after exiting the cab of his truck. Some residents also said that an African American man approached the tow truck operators and argued with them briefly before departing.\n\nThe federal government's official report on the Glenville shootout suggested that the tow truck was not a target of the New Libyans. Rather, it was \"inadvertently trapped in the crossfire between police and snipers.\"\n\nEvans later asserted that the tow truck was a ruse. He claimed police snipers were already in the area and targeting him and his followers for assassination. These snipers fired on Evans and his followers first, he said. He claimed he was nowhere near the tow truck when shots were fired. Instead, he said, he had left his home and was walking on west on Auburndale Avenue toward the Lakeview Tavern (a few feet around the corner to the south) when he heard shots \"coming from the end of the street\". A man ran past him. Evans said he ran north to Beulah in time to see the tow truck operator running toward E. 123rd Street. He said he heard submachine gun fire, and said he assumed this was the blast which killed Leroy Mansfield Williams. Evans admitted that he fired several shots from his carbine, but the weapon then jammed. He fled into the home at 1384 Lakeview Road.\n\nSeveral clearly-marked Cleveland Police cars arrived at the scene of the tow truck shooting about the same time that the second unmarked surveillance vehicle arrived. Police witnesses said that three men now stood on the two corners of Lakeview Road and Beulah Avenue, firing at the police cars. A fourth man—probably Leroy Mansfield Williams (also known as Amir Iber Katir)—lay dying on the sidewalk. Later estimates placed the time of his death at about 9:26 PM.\n\nMost of the Glenville shootout occurred between 8:30 and 9:30 PM. It was contained in a small area, barely long, on Lakeview Road between Beulah Avenue and Auburndale Avenue. Lakeview Avenue is lined with residential homes, with narrow passages between them. When the police broadcast for assistance was made at 8:30 PM, it was an \"all units\" broadcast—which allowed any available police vehicle to respond. Within minutes, the side streets were clogged with police cars, abandoned there as officers arrived at the scene and ran on foot to the firefight. The police response was chaotic: Officers grabbed whatever weapon they could, and raced to the scene. Nearly all abandoned their radios in their vehicles. There was no law enforcement leadership present to control the police response. Gunfire centered around four locations: The tow truck, adjoining houses at 1391 and 1395 Lakeview Road, the Lakeview Tavern, and Ahmed Evans' apartment house at 12312 Auburndale Avenue.\n\nThree marked Cleveland Police vehicles were the first to arrive on the scene at 8:30 PM, one on Beulah Avenue and two at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview Road. Patrolmen Kenneth Gibbons and Willard Wolff were the first to arrive at the intersection of Lakeview and Auburndale, at 8:30 PM. They claim to have observed a plainclothes police officer grappling with a young African American male in or near the front yard of the Evans home. As they exited their vehicle to assist, a rifle bullet struck the engine of their marked police vehicle. It exploded, killing Wolff and severely injuring Gibbons. Police Sergeants Sam Levy and Bill Moran arrived moments behind Gibbons and Wolff. They ran behind the duplexes at 1435 and 1439 Lakeview Road, and used the alley to get behind the Lakeview Tavern. They then moved down the driveway between the tavern and the Evans home to reach Auburndale Avenue. At this point, Moran was shot and dived behind a car parked on the street, where he was shot again. Levy found safety under the car.\n\nPatrolmen Joseph McMannamon and Chester Szukalski were among the first uniformed officers to arrive at Beulah Avenue, approaching from the south on E. 123rd Street. The time of their arrival has been estimated as 8:30 PM. As they pulled in front of the tow truck, gunfire struck their vehicle from the south. As the men tried to escape out the driver's side door, Szukalski was hit. Severely injured, he crawled about toward a home and waited for help. McMannamon was lightly injured by bullet fragments. As more marked police cars arrived, the gunmen ran east—moving across Lakeview Road into a narrow alley that is something of an extension of Beulah Avenue. As the gunmen fled, they exchanged gunfire with other police who had just arrived, then turned south down the alley to get behind 1395 Lakeview Road. Sources differ as to what happened next. Cleveland police claim the gunmen burst into the house, and occupied the second floor. Mrs. Beatrice Flagg and her children, living in the apartment on the first floor, fell to the ground to avoid being hit when police fired into the building. As the police pumped tear gas canisters into the home, the family fled. The police also claimed that the gunmen surprised Rev. Henry L. Perryman's wife, who fled with their nine-month-old son as the armed men seized her second-floor apartment. The police then occupied the first floor of 1391 Lakeview Road to use it as a base from which they could fire at the gunmen at 1395 Lakeview. But Mrs. Perryman denied that any gunmen burst in on her. She and Mrs. Flagg claimed they received no warning before police began firing guns at their homes and launching tear gas through the windows. A later press report gave a third version of events, saying the police ordered the apartments evacuated. After the Flaggs and Perrymans fled, the gunmen burst into the building and occupied the second floor.\n\nAt 8:35 PM, Patrolman Louis E. Golonka, attempting to navigate the narrow passage between 1391 and 1395 Lakeview, was shot and killed. Five minutes later, police, firing into the alley from the rear windows of 1391 Lakeview, killed Sidney Curtis Taylor (also known as Malik Ali Bey). At 8:45 PM, Bernard Donald (also known as Nondu Bey) stood up out of some bushes behind 1395 Lakeview and fired at police in the passage between 1391 and 1395 Lakeview. A patrolman picked up Golonka's shotgun and killed Donald.\nLt. Leroy C. Jones and his partner arrived at the scene at about 8:40 PM, driving south on E. 124th Street. They parked and Jones ran around the corner onto Auburndale Avenue. Heavy gunfire rang out, and Jones fell dead in the middle of the block at 8:45 PM, lying on the sidewalk on the north side of the street. Patrolmen Angelo Santa Maria and Steve Sopko approached the scene from Auburndale Avenue about the time Jones died, but the number of abandoned police vehicles force them to park two blocks away. Santa Maria ran behind the houses on the south side of Auburndale Avenue and spotted Jones lying on the sidewalk. Shouting to police hiding behind various types of cover on the north side of the street, he learned that it was Lt. Jones. Santa Maria asked for a volunteer among the many African American bystanders to drive a car along Auburndale, providing him with cover so he could retrieve Jones. Twenty-two year old clerk James E. Chapman agreed to help. According to a federal government report, Chapman's car could not get close enough to Jones due the large number of abandoned police and civilian vehicles on Auburndale. Both men got out of the car and tried to retrieve Jones. Santa Maria found cover next to a police sergeant who had a submachine gun. Throwing a smoke bomb to provide cover, Santa Maria ran to get Jones while the sergeant opened fire with his submachine gun. Santa Maria was shot in the back at 9:00 PM. Patrolman Steve Marencky later retrieved him and put him in an abandoned police car for safety. Chapman was shot in the head about the same time that Santa Maria was shot, and died instantly.\n\nLt. Elmer Joseph drove north on Lakeview Road and reached the intersection of Lakeview and Auburndale at 8:45 PM, about the time Moran and Levy came under fire. He was shot as he exited his vehicle, but managed to get to cover. Fifty-year-old resident Henry Orange was wounded by gunfire at about the same location and same time, as was Patrolman Richard Hart. Hart fell in the street on Auburndale, and was shot several more times by a sniper standing in a dark doorway.\n\nPatrolman Leonard Szalkiewicz was shot and wounded at 8:55 PM while attempting to push an abandoned police vehicle off the street on Lakeview Road.\n\nSometime around 9:15 PM, police officers burst into the Lakeview Tavern and ordered the 10 staff and customers to lie on the floor. More police burst into the bar, and forced the seven men and three women into the basement. The officers fired repeatedly into the ceiling, and shot tear gas into the basement before locking the staff and customers in. Eyewitnesses said John Pegues, a tavern patron, was shot in the leg by police at this time, which an official chronology later said occurred at 9:30 PM. Patrolman Anthony Sherbinski, who rushed to the second floor to fire at snipers from the second floor window, was shot and wounded by return fire at the same time. The bar staff and patrons were not released from the basement until 10:15 PM. All the individuals were roughly handled by police, with most of the men being pistol-whipped. All ten were taken to the Fifth District Police station and locked up. Pegues was not given medical attention until 5:00 AM.\n\nAt about 9:30 PM, Patrolmen Thomas Smith and Ernest Rowell attempted to help Sgt. Sam Levy, who was pinned down by sniper fire near the car where he'd first been shot. Both men were shot and wounded trying to pick him up. About an hour later, another police officer accidentally set off a tear gas grenade nearby. Under cover of the cloud, Patrolmen William Traine and James Herron rushed with wheeled stretchers to retrieve Levy and Smith. Other police also helped, and the two were wheeled to a nearby ambulance.\n\nBy 9:45 PM, the shooting on Auburndale Avenue had ended. News media reported that 17 men and women were arrested at 12312 and 12314 Auburndale Avenue, but Evans was not among them. No dead or wounded were found in either house, and only four rifles. A fifth rifle was retrieved from a nearby automobile. Police initially charged only three people: John Hardrick, age 17; Leslie Jackson (also known as Osu Bey), age 16; and Alfred Thomas, age 18, all of whom were found at 12314 Auburndale (the home next to the Evans house). All three admitted to having fired their rifles.\n\nThe gun battle raging around 1395 Lakeview Road continued, however. Gunmen fired wildly in all directions from the upper floor windows. According to police, at one point a gunman stepped out of the house into the narrow passageway between 1395 and 1391 Lakeview, fired a few random shots, and went back inside. When he appeared at a kitchen window a few minutes later, police shot and apparently killed him (ending gunfire from the first floor of the structure).\n\nAt 11:11 PM, a police dispatcher advised all police in the area that a man at 1384 Lakeview Road wished to surrender to African American police. No one responded.\n\nAbout midnight, the police stormed 1395 Lakeview Road. They were able to get inside, but a locked and barricaded door prevented them from reaching the second floor. Police also say they saw a body lying on the kitchen floor. Shortly afterward, the house caught fire. The cause of the fire was never determined, and the Cleveland Fire Department did not fight the blaze since it was believed firefighters would come under attack. Police observers later said they heard the names \"Omar\" and \"Ali\" shouted from within the home. 1391 Lakeview Road also caught fire, and both homes burned to the ground.\n\nAs the fires raged, Councilman Forbes, youth director Beach, Harllel Jones, and others had gathered to try to talk to the gunmen and bring calm to the neighborhood. Jones, wanting to ensure no one was caught inside the burning buildings, went behind the structures and retrieved the bodies of Sidney Curtis Taylor and Bernard Donald, as well as Donald's wounded brother, Lathan Donald (also known as Nondu-El). According to Jones and his two companions, two uniformed white policemen (their badges removed) beat them in the passageway, telling them \"Leave that nigger to die\".\n\nAt 12:24 AM on July 24, a police dispatcher again issued a broadcast that a man at 1384 Lakeview Road wished to surrender to black officers. Three white policemen went to the home. The man identified himself as Ahmed Evans, and peacefully surrendered. The 11:11 PM and 12:24 AM police broadcasts were the only time 1384 Lakeview had been mentioned by any police officer over the radio during the evening. Evans was unarmed when apprehended. His jammed carbine was found in the bushes in front of the building where he was found.\n\nNo bodies were ever found inside either 1391 or 1395 Lakeview Road.\n\nIn addition to the seven deaths, 15 people (police, New Libyans, and bystanders) were injured in the shootout. It is possible that many more injured people (including gunmen) never sought treatment for their injuries and thus never were recorded on the official casualty lists. Some gunmen may have died and been borne away by friends, and it is probable that several snipers escaped.\n\nCrowds began to gather on Superior Avenue almost as soon as the shooting started. Superior Avenue is a major city thoroughfare which also carries U.S. Route 6. As police vehicles began racing down Superior Avenue to reach E. 120th Street, E. 123rd Street, Lakeview Road, and E. 124th Street, the crowd began throwing rocks at police and jeering them. At 9:15 PM, Mayor Stokes called Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes to inform him that a riot in Cleveland was likely. The governor called Major General Sylvester Del Corso, Adjutant General of the Ohio Army National Guard, and had the National Guard placed on alert. By 9:30 PM, the crowd numbered close to a thousand, mostly young adult, teenage, and pre-adolescent African American males. About this time, the Glenville riots broke out. A Molotov cocktail hit a marked police vehicle, causing it to burst into flames. A commercial panel truck, driving down Superior Avenue, was stopped by the crowd, the white driver brutally beaten, and the truck overturned and set afire. A black Cleveland Police officer, Herbert Reed, was pulled from his vehicle and savagely beaten. Two television news vehicles were also set aflame.\n\nMayor Stokes went on television to inform the public about the shootout and potential riot. He taped a brief message at WKYC-TV, telling people about the gunfight, and asking them to stay out of the area and remain at home. The mayor's message was broadcast shortly before 11:00 PM on all local television stations. Most Clevelanders learned of the incident after the mayor's message interrupted a baseball game between the Cleveland Indians and the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nAs they had done during the Hough riots, Cleveland Police withdrew from the area and formed a perimeter cordon. The mob moved west almost along Superior Avenue, looting stores. An entire block of buildings at E. 105th and Superior burned to the ground. The rioters also moved north, reaching St. Clair Avenue. Small bands of rioters and arsonists even moved into Hough as far west as E. 55th Street.\n\nAbout midnight, Mayor Stokes formally requested National Guard assistance in quelling the riot. More than 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized, and 1,500 were sent to Cleveland that night. Through the early morning of July 24, area firefighters attempted to respond to blazes, but were pelted with rocks and bottles. They then stopped responding unless given a police escort. During the night, fire departments responded to 15 fires set by vandals, as well as several false alarms and a handful of non-riot related fires. At 3:00 AM, about 200 Ohio Army National Guardsmen, assisted by 24 Cleveland Police officers, began patrolling Glenville.\n\nDuring the night, 28 African Americans were arrested, three-quarters of them for looting. According to eyewitnesses, about midnight, two white men in an automobile shot at three young black men waiting for a bus at E. 79th Street and St. Clair Avenue. Twenty-two-year-old Clifford Miller was hit in the head, and died. Thirty-year-old African American security guard James C. Haynes was found dead from multiple shotgun wounds behind a building at 8203 Superior Avenue shortly after midnight. He may have been killed by police.\n\nAt 8:30 AM on July 24, Stokes met with 100 African American civic leaders at City Hall to discuss ways to prevent the violence from flaring up again. Although no consensus for action emerged, most of the attendees felt that continued police presence would merely inflame tensions, and a few felt that a curfew would do little except build resentment while not preventing outsiders from coming into the area to make trouble. Early in the afternoon, a group of about 20 African American civic leaders (most, but not all, militants) suggested to Stokes that the black community be allowed to try to quell the violence on their own. A similar strategy had been proposed by a handful of black leaders during the night and at the 8:30 AM morning. At a meeting with Councilman Forbes and others held about 3:00 PM, Stokes discussed this plan. There was general agreement to try it, although General Del Corso was skeptical that it would succeed.\n\nDuring the day, there were scattered reports of looting and the hawking of stolen goods, to which Cleveland police responded. Although a temporary ban on the sale of liquor had been imposed throughout Cuyahoga County some time during the night, a few bars in the cordoned area were fined and closed for violating the ban.\n\nAt 4:15 PM, Stokes announced his plan for handling the riots. The area encompassed by Euclid Avenue, E. 55th Street, Superior Avenue, Rockefeller Park, St. Clair Avenue, and the Cleveland-East Cleveland border would be cordoned off at 7:00 PM. The National Guard and a unit of police officers would patrol the perimeter. A normal police patrol, consisting of 125 African American patrolmen, would roam the interior of the area. Another 109 representatives of local African American civic and neighborhood groups, assisted by 500 African American volunteers, would assist the police in keeping the area calm. This group of volunteers was called the \"Mayor's Committee\". Nonresident whites would be refused entry to the area, as would white news media.\n\nOvernight, roving bands of youth set 10 fires and engaged in sporadic looting. Civilian patrols were unable to control the looting, much of which was done by young adults and teenagers (some as young as 10 years of age). Against Mayor Stokes' direct orders, several white police officers and National Guardsmen violated the cordon during the night and responded to reports of looting. This created such a tense situation at a furniture store at E. 123rd Street and St. Clair Avenue that Law Director Buddy James had to race to the scene and intervene. White Cleveland Police were deeply embittered by Stokes' decision to keep them out of the affected area. When a plea for an ambulance for a heart attack victim came in, an anonymous policeman said over the police radio, \"White or nigger? Send the Mayor's Committee.\" When a child in the cordoned-off area fell from a second-floor balcony, an anonymous policeman radioed, \"Tell the Mayor's Committee to handle it.\" When a police dispatcher asked for police to respond to a fire, an anonymous policeman radioed, \"Tell the Mayor to go piss on it.\" Repeatedly, when asked to do their duty, anonymous policemen would radio back \"Fuck that nigger Mayor!\" When police at the Fifth District Headquarters (which encompassed the affected area) were told they could not carry rifles while patrolling the perimeter, those police present \"responded in a flurry of curses and epithets\" directed at Stokes. The anger at Stokes lasted throughout the evening, creating great tension at the Fifth District.\n\nAt a press conference on the morning of July 25, Mayor Stokes announced that 36 stores had been looted and 13 looters arrested (nearly all of them teenagers) during the night, and no persons had been shot or seriously injured.\n\nRegular public transit service and trash pickup through the cordoned area resumed the morning of July 25, and city demolition crews began tearing down the most severely affected and unsafe burned buildings.\n\nEarly on the morning of July 25, Stokes met with African American civic leaders who had participated in the Mayor's Committee effort. For the most part, only militant groups had participated in the peace patrols. Moderate neighborhood leaders, like pastors, had largely stayed home, and the militants and some other African American civic leaders deeply resented the lack of participation by moderates. There was general agreement that the Mayor's Committee had been only partially effective, and a curfew was discussed. While the group debated, Stokes left the room and held a press conference at which he announced the National Guard would once more patrol Glenville's streets. The mayor's announcement left many African American leaders feeling betrayed. Other black officials and white business owners criticized Stokes for using the Mayor's Committee patrols in the first place, which they viewed as a complete failure.\n\nAfter the mayor's announcement, 400 National Guardsmen moved into the cordoned-off area and began patrolling again. (More than 3,100 National Guardsmen were now in the Cleveland area.) The National Guard responded to (sporadic) reports of looting during the day, while police enforced the liquor ban. At 6:30 PM, Stokes announced he was imposing a curfew in the area from 9:00 PM to 6:30 AM. The National Guard would continue to patrol inside the restricted zone, and the ban on white police patrols was lifted. Several local African American leaders and volunteers also agreed to assist by roaming the affected area.\n\nMore than 2,100 National Guardsmen patrolled Glenville during the night of July 25–26. No additional deaths occurred, although there was still looting. A major fire erupted on E. 55th Street, and four minor arsonist fires were put out near the eastern end of Superior Avenue. Thirty people were arrested (one for arson, two for looting, the rest for curfew violations). After a band of 100 youths formed in the Lee-Miles neighborhood far from Glenville, the National Guard was sent there to disperse them.\n\nCuyahoga County lifted the ban on alcohol sales outside of Cleveland on the morning of July 26, and Mayor Stokes announced that the curfew that night would begin at midnight (to allow the public to attend a Cleveland Indians home baseball game). In the afternoon, 35 Cleveland Police and 100 National Guardsmen surrounded the Esquire Hotel at 10602 Superior Avenue after police received a tip that several gunmen from the July 23–24 shootout were hiding there. No gunmen were found.\n\nThe National Guard continued to patrol Glenville during the night of July 26 – 27. Police arrested Harllel Jones and a group of his followers late on July 26 at the Afro Set headquarters at 8127 Superior Avenue. After claiming to find brass knuckles on him, they searched his automobile without a search warrant and claimed to find a .38 caliber revolver. Mayor Stokes arrived as Jones was being arrested. Police later changed their report, and said brass knuckles were found in Jones' vehicle. A court threw out the case because the search was an unconstitutional violation of the Fourth Amendment. After Jones was taken to a local police precinct for booking and Stokes had left, eyewitnesses said police vandalized the group's offices. Few other incidents occurred during the night of July 26 – 27.\n\nThe ban on alcohol sales in Cleveland was lifted on the morning of July 27. The National Guard were withdrawn, Cleveland police were returned to their normal shifts and patrol patterns, and the curfew was lifted. The riots cost local business $2.6 million ($ in dollars). The damage was far more widespread than the much better-known Hough riots.\n\nOn the morning of July 27, the media reported that Evans had received a $6,000 grant from the mayor's redevelopment fund, and that he had used a portion of this money to buy weapons. The revelation during the riots that Evans had used Cleveland: Now! funds to purchase weapons ended political and business support for Mayor Stokes' redevelopment campaign.\n\nOne more serious incident of violence occurred at 2:30 AM on July 28. An African American youth got into an altercation with a security guard at the Haddam Hotel at E. 107th Street and Euclid Avenue. A crowd gathered, with black youth urging the crowd to riot. Cleveland Police responded in force, and a police riot broke out. NBC News photographers Julius Boros and Charles Ray were brutally beaten by a large number of police when they attempted to film and photograph the incident. Law Director Buddy James and Councilman George Forbes rushed to the Fifth District police headquarters, where James witnessed disturbing signs that the police intended harm toward the two men (who had been fingerprinted and jailed). An African American policeman accompanying James and Forbes quietly told them that African Americans were being brutally beaten in the station's parking garage. James demanded treatment for Boros. After examination at Lakeside Hospital, Boros was given pain medication. Dissatisifed, James ordered Boros transferred to Metropolitan General Hospital. This transfer was aborted by NBC attorneys while it was in process, and Boros was returned to Lakeside Hospital where he received no medical care for the several hours. James demanded that Boros be released, but the Cleveland Police delayed doing so repeatedly. When Boros was finally remanded into James' custody and examined near dawn at Lutheran Hospital, he was found to have broken ribs, a ruptured spleen, a fractured back, a broken tooth, and extensive cuts and abrasions. Boros was charged with assaulting an officer; he was swiftly acquitted in January 1970. The Cleveland Police declined to investigate the police riot at the Haddam Hotel, the attacks on Boros and Ray, the lack of medical treatment given to Boros, or the insubordination shown to James.\n\nEvans was indicted in August 1968 for the murders of Leroy C. Jones, Louis E. Golonka, Willard J. Wolff, and James E. Chapman. The charges were later altered to \"kill by shooting\" (an easier charge to prove). The prosecution's case rested on state laws which said that a conspirator is guilty of the crimes which his co-conspirators commit. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, but after deliberating for two days the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts on May 12, 1969. Evans was sentenced to death in the electric chair. Evans was incarcerated at Lucasville Correctional Facility, and appealed his conviction. His execution was stayed while he appealed. While his appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court placed a moratorium on all capital punishment in the United States in its ruling in \"Furman v. Georgia\", 408 U.S. 238 (1972). Evans' conviction was commuted to life in prison, and he spent the remainder of his life at Lucasville. Evans was diagnosed with cancer in 1977, and he died on February 25, 1978, at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nLathan L. Donald (age 19), Alfred Thomas (age 18), John Hardrick (age 17), and Leslie Jackson (age 16) were each indicted on August 25, 1968, on seven counts of first-degree murder, 11 counts of shooting to wound; and possession of a machine gun. Donald and Hardrick were also charged with possession of illegal narcotics. Hardrick and Thomas were detained in the Cleveland City Jail after their arrest.\n\nAfter a psychiatric hearing, Alfred Thomas was judged insane and unable to stand trial. He was committed to Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.\n\nAfter three and a half days of deliberation, a jury convicted Lathan Donald on August 18, 1969, of three counts of first-degree murder (by conspiracy), and four counts of second-degree murder (by conspiracy). After considering a plea for mercy, the jury granted the plea. Donald was sentenced to seven consecutive terms in prison, without the possibility of parole. His sentence meant that he would spend a minimum of 110 years in prison.\n\nLeslie Jackson appealed his indictment. His attorneys argued that, under Ohio law, a Juvenile Court was required to find a juvenile delinquent, as well as determine that the juvenile could not be rehabilitated under the juvenile justice system, before that juvenile could be turned over to the Court of Common Pleas for indictment as an adult. His case went to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which in 1970 nullified the indictments against him in \"In re Jackson\", 21 Ohio St.2d 215 (Ohio 1970). The ruling had the effect of nullifying Hardrick's indictments as well. Hardrick and Jackson were then charged with delinquency for wounding Lt. Elmer Joseph during the shootout. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Charles R. Laurie declined to have the pair re-indicted by the Court of Common Pleas, as the two \"were not ring leaders and besides, many key witnesses are no longer available.\" After hearing evidence that a rifle used by the two was employed to wound Lt. Joseph, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Walter G. Whitlatch sentenced Hardrick and Jackson to the Mansfield Youth Center in Mansfield, Ohio. Both individuals were to be released on their 21st birthday.\n\nThe convictions of Hardrick and Jackson were the last legal actions taken against any individual charged in the Glenville shootout.\n\nIn 1971, eight Cleveland police officers and tow truck worker William McMillan sued the city of Cleveland for $8.8 million, arguing that the Stokes administration had negligently paid money to black militants which led directly to their injuries. After more than six years, during which several judges oversaw the case, Common Pleas Judge John C. Bacon ordered the case to trial. After the plaintiffs had finished presenting their case for three weeks, Judge Bacon dismissed the suit, finding that the plaintiffs had offered no evidence showing that Stokes or the Cleveland: Now! trustees knew that payments were going to Evans or other black nationalists.\n\nWhite police on the Cleveland force reacted bitterly toward Stokes after the Glenville shootout, blaming him for supporting radicals like Evans and for providing him with the funds to arm himself. Police began anonymously taunting Stokes and hurling racial epithets at him over police radios. At a police union meeting on August 1, 600 police voted overwhelmingly to demand the resignation of Public Safety Director James McManamon. In an attempt to turn the police department around, Stokes agreed in September 1968 to establish Cleveland's first SWAT unit, so that the police could deal with situations like the Glenville shootout in which there was heavy gunfire and entrenched gunmen. He also agreed to hire 500 new police officers, purchase 164 new patrol cars, and establish a police training academy. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People began urging African Americans to apply for the new positions, and Police Chief Blackwell agreed to racially integrate all police patrols in the Glenville neighborhood.\n\nOn October 9, Stokes dismissed Police Chief Michael J. Blackwell for being unable to improve morale in the force and rein in the racial tension, and announced a $17 million overhaul of the police department. Patrick L. Gerity, a 48-year-old police deputy inspector, was named Chief of Police.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "157279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157279", "title": "Isaiah Berlin", "text": "Isaiah Berlin\n\nSir Isaiah Berlin (1909–1997) was a Russian-British social and political theorist, philosopher and historian of ideas. Although averse to writing, his improvised lectures and talks were recorded and transcribed, with his spoken word being converted by his secretaries into his published essays and books.\n\nBorn in Riga, Latvia, in 1909, he moved to Petrograd, Russia, at the age of six, where he witnessed the revolutions of 1917. In 1921 his family moved to the UK, and he was educated at St Paul's School, London, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1932, at the age of 23, Berlin was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. He translated works by Ivan Turgenev from Russian into English and, during the war, worked for the British Diplomatic Service. From 1957 to 1967 he was Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at the University of Oxford. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1963 to 1964. In 1966, he played a role in founding Wolfson College, Oxford, and became its first President. Berlin was appointed a CBE in 1946, knighted in 1957, and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1971. He was President of the British Academy from 1974 to 1978. He also received the 1979 Jerusalem Prize for his writings on individual freedom.\n\nAn annual Isaiah Berlin Lecture is held at the Hampstead Synagogue, at Wolfson College, Oxford, at the British Academy, and in Riga. Berlin's work on liberal theory and on value pluralism, as well as his opposition to Marxism and communism, has had a lasting influence. In its obituary of the scholar, \"The Independent\" stated that:\n\nBorn 6 June 1909, Berlin was the only surviving child of a wealthy Jewish family, the son of Mendel Berlin, a timber trader and philanthropist (and a direct descendant of Shneur Zalman, founder of Chabad Hasidism), and his wife Marie, \"née\" Volshonok. His family owned a timber company, one of the largest in the Baltics, as well as forests in Russia, from where the timber was floated down the Daugava river to its sawmills in Riga. As his father, who was the head of the Riga Association of Timber Merchants, worked for the company in its dealings with Western companies, he was fluent not only in Russian and German, but also French and English. His Russian-speaking mother, Marie Volshonok, was also fluent in Latvian. Isaiah Berlin spent his first six years in Riga, and later lived in Andreapol (a small timber town near Pskov, effectively owned by the family business) and Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). In Petrograd, the family lived first on Vasilyevsky Island and then on Angliyskaya Embankment on the River Neva. On Angliyskaya Embankment, they shared their building with the other tenants being Rimsky-Korsakov's daughter, as well as an assistant Minister of Finnish affairs, and Princess Emeretinsky - and, with the onset of the October Revolution of 1917, the fortunes of the building's tenants were rapidly reversed, with both the Princess Emeretinsky and Rimsky-Korsakov's daughter soon being made to stoke the building's stoves and sweep the yards. Berlin witnessed the February and October Revolutions both from his apartment windows, and from walks in the city with his governess where he recalled the crowds of protesters marching on the Winter Palace Square.\n\nOne particular childhood memory of the February Revolution, marked his life-long opposition to violence, with Berlin saying:\n\nFeeling increasingly oppressed by life under Bolshevik rule where the family was identified as bourgeoisie, the family left Petrograd, on 5 October 1920, for Riga, but encounters with anti-Semitism and difficulties with the Latvian authorities convinced them to leave, and they moved to Britain in early 1921 (Mendel in January, Isaiah and Marie at the beginning of February), when Berlin was eleven. In London, the family first stayed in Surbiton where he was sent to Arundel House for preparatory school, then within the year they bought a house in Kensington, and six years later in Hampstead.\n\nBerlin's native language was Russian, and his English was virtually nonexistent at first, but he reached proficiency in English within a year at around the age of 12. In addition to Russian and English, Berlin was fluent in French, German and Italian, and knew Hebrew, Latin, and Ancient Greek. Despite his fluency in English, however, in later life Berlin's Oxford English accent would sound increasingly Russian in its vowel sounds. Whenever he was described as an English philosopher, Berlin always insisted that he was not an English philosopher, but would forever be a Russian Jew: \"I am a Russian Jew from Riga, and all my years in England cannot change this. I love England, I have been well treated here, and I cherish many things about English life, but I am a Russian Jew; that is how I was born and that is who I will be to the end of my life.\"\n\nAfter being educated at St Paul's School (London), Berlin applied to Balliol College, Oxford, but was denied admission after a chaotic interview. Berlin decided to apply again, only to a different College: Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Berlin was admitted and commenced his Classics (Greats) degree. He graduated in 1928, taking a First in his final examinations and winning \"The John Locke Prize\" for his performance in the philosophy papers, in which he outscored A. J. Ayer. He subsequently took another degree at Oxford in PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), winning another First after less than a year on the course. He was appointed a tutor in philosophy at New College, Oxford, and soon afterwards was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, the first unconverted Jew to achieve this fellowship at All Souls.\n\nWhile still a student, he befriended Ayer (with whom he was to share a lifelong amicable rivalry), Stuart Hampshire, Richard Wollheim, Maurice Bowra, Stephen Spender, J. L. Austin and Nicolas Nabokov. In 1940, he presented a philosophical paper on other minds to a meeting attended by Ludwig Wittgenstein at Cambridge University. Wittgenstein rejected the argument of his paper in discussion but praised Berlin for his intellectual honesty and integrity. Berlin was to remain at Oxford for the rest of his life, apart from a period working for British Information Services in New York from 1940 to 1942, and for the British embassies in Washington, DC, and Moscow from then until 1946. Prior to this service, however, Berlin was barred from participation in the British war effort as a result of his being born in Latvia, and because his left arm had been damaged at birth. In April 1943 he wrote a confidential analysis of members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the Foreign Office; he described Senator Arthur Capper from Kansas as \"a solid, stolid, 78-year-old reactionary from the corn belt, who is the very voice of Mid-Western \"grass root\" isolationism\".\nFor his services, he was appointed a CBE in the 1946 New Year Honours. Meetings with Anna Akhmatova in Leningrad in November 1945 and January 1946 had a powerful effect on both of them, and serious repercussions for Akhmatova (who immortalised the meetings in her poetry).\n\nIn 1956 Berlin married Aline Halban, \"née\" de Gunzbourg (1915–2014), who was not only the former wife of an Oxford colleague and a former winner of the ladies' golf championship of France, but from an exiled half Russian-aristocratic and half ennobled-Jewish banking and petroleum family (her mother was Yvonne Deutsch de la Meurthe, granddaughter of Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe) based in Paris.\nHe was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959. He was instrumental in the founding, in 1966, of a new graduate college at Oxford University: Wolfson College. The college was founded to be a center of academic excellence which, unlike many other colleges at Oxford, would also be based on a strong egalitarian and democratic ethos. Berlin was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University. As later revealed, when he was asked to evaluate the academic credentials of Isaac Deutscher, Isaiah Berlin argued against a promotion, because of the profoundly pro-communist militancy of the candidate.\n\nBerlin died in Oxford on 5 November 1997, aged 88. He is buried there in Wolvercote Cemetery. On his death, the obituarist of \"The Independent\" wrote: \"he was a man of formidable intellectual power with a rare gift for understanding a wide range of human motives, hopes and fears, and a prodigiously energetic capacity for enjoyment – of life, of people in all their variety, of their ideas and idiosyncrasies, of literature, of music, of art\". The front page of \"The New York Times\" concluded: \"His was an exuberant life crowded with joys – the joy of thought, the joy of music, the joy of good friends. ... The theme that runs throughout his work is his concern with liberty and the dignity of human beings ... Sir Isaiah radiated well-being.\"\n\nBerlin did not enjoy writing, and his published work (including both his essays and books) was produced by means of conversational dictation to a tape-recorder, or through the transcription of his improvised lectures and talks from recorded tapes. The work of transcribing his spoken word often placed a strain on his secretaries. This method of dictation even extended to his letters, which were produced by speaking to a Grundig tape recorder, often while simultaneously in conversation with his friends, and then transcribed with difficulty by his secretary, who at times would inadvertently include his jokes and laughter into the transcribed text itself. The results are a darting and leaping style of thought, which literally reflected his own conversation, and the ornate grammar and punctuation which was contained in his everyday speech.\n\nBerlin is popularly known for his essay \"Two Concepts of Liberty\", delivered in 1958 as his inaugural lecture as Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. The essay, with its analytical approach to the definition of political concepts, reintroduced the methods of analytic philosophy to the study of political philosophy. Spurred by his background in philosophy of language, Berlin argued for a nuanced and subtle understanding of our political terminology, where what was superficially understood as a single concept could mask a plurality of different uses and therefore meanings. Berlin argued that these multiple and differing concepts, otherwise masked by rhetorical conflations, showed the plurality and incompatibility of human values, and the need for us to distinguish and trade off analytically between, rather than conflate, them if we are to avoid disguising underlying value-conflicts. The two concepts are 'negative freedom', or freedom from interference, which Berlin derived from the British tradition, and 'positive freedom', or freedom as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do. Berlin points out that these two different conceptions of liberty can clash with each other.\n\nBerlin's lectures on the Enlightenment and its critics (especially Giambattista Vico, Johann Gottfried Herder, Joseph de Maistre and Johann Georg Hamann, to whose views Berlin referred as the Counter-Enlightenment) contributed to his advocacy of an irreducibly pluralist ethical ontology. In \"Three Critics of the Enlightenment\", Berlin argues that Hamann was one of the first thinkers to conceive of human cognition as language – the articulation and use of symbols. Berlin saw Hamann as having recognised as the rationalist's Cartesian fallacy the notion that there are \"clear and distinct\" ideas \"which can be contemplated by a kind of inner eye\", without the use of language – a recognition greatly sharpened in the 20th century by Wittgenstein's private language argument.\n\nFor Berlin, values are creations of mankind, rather than products of nature waiting to be discovered. He argued, on the basis of the epistemic and empathetic access we have to other cultures across history, that the nature of mankind is such that certain values – the importance of individual liberty, for instance – will hold true across cultures, and this is what he meant by objective pluralism. Berlin's argument was partly grounded in Wittgenstein's later theory of language, which argued that inter-translatability was supervenient on a similarity in forms of life, with the inverse implication that our epistemic access to other cultures entails an ontologically contiguous value-structure. With his account of value pluralism, he proposed the view that moral values may be equally, or rather incommensurably, valid and yet incompatible, and may, therefore, come into conflict with one another in a way that admits of no resolution without reference to particular contexts of a decision. When values clash, it may not be that one is more important than the other: keeping a promise may conflict with the pursuit of truth; liberty may clash with social justice. Moral conflicts are \"an intrinsic, irremovable element in human life\". \"These collisions of values are of the essence of what they are and what we are.\" For Berlin, this clashing of incommensurate values within, no less than between, individuals, constitutes the tragedy of human life. Alan Brown suggests, however, that Berlin ignores the fact that values are commensurable in the extent to which they contribute to the human good.\n\n\"The Hedgehog and the Fox\", a title referring to a fragment of the ancient Greek poet Archilochus, was one of Berlin's most popular essays with the general public, reprinted in numerous editions. Of the classification that gives the essay its title, Berlin once said \"I never meant it very seriously. I meant it as a kind of enjoyable intellectual game, but it was taken seriously.\"\n\nBerlin expands upon this idea to divide writers and thinkers into two categories: hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea (examples given include Plato), and foxes, who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea (examples given include William Shakespeare).\n\nBerlin's lecture \"Historical Inevitability\" (1954) focused on a controversy in the philosophy of history. Given the choice, whether one believes that \"the lives of entire peoples and societies have been decisively influenced by exceptional individuals\" or, conversely, that whatever happens occurs as a result of impersonal forces oblivious to human intentions, Berlin rejected both options and the choice itself as nonsensical. Berlin is also well known for his writings on Russian intellectual history, most of which are collected in \"Russian Thinkers\" (1978; 2nd ed. 2008) and edited, as most of Berlin's work, by Henry Hardy (in the case of this volume, jointly with Aileen Kelly). Berlin also contributed a number of essays on leading intellectuals and political figures of his time, including Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Chaim Weizmann. Eighteen of these character sketches were published together as \"Personal Impressions\" (1980; 2nd ed., with four additional essays, 1998; 3rd ed., with a further ten essays, 2014).\n\nA number of commemorative events for Isaiah Berlin are held at Oxford University, as well as scholarships given out in his name, including the Wolfson Isaiah Berlin Clarendon Scholarship, The Isaiah Berlin Visiting Professorship, and the annual Isaiah Berlin Lectures. The Berlin Quadrangle of Wolfson College, Oxford, is named after him. The Isaiah Berlin Association of Latvia was founded in 2011 to promote the ideas and values of Sir Isaiah Berlin, in particular by organising an annual Isaiah Berlin day and lectures in his memory. At the British Academy, the Isaiah Berlin lecture series has been held since 2001. Many volumes from Berlin's personal library were donated to Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer Sheva and form part of the Aranne Library collection. The Isaiah Berlin Room, on the third floor of the library, is a replica of his study at the University of Oxford. There is also the Isaiah Berlin Society which takes place at his alma mater of St Paul's School (London). The society invites world famous academics to share their research into the answers to life's great concerns and to respond to students' questions. In the last few years they have hosted: A.C. Grayling, Brad Hooker, Jonathan Dancy, John Cottingham, Tim Crane, Arif Ahmed, Hugh Mellor and David Papineau.\n\nApart from earlier editions of \"Karl Marx\" and \"The Hedgehog and the Fox\", and \"Unfinished Dialogue\", all books listed from 1978 onwards are edited (or, where stated, co-edited) by Henry Hardy, and all but \"Karl Marx\" are compilations or transcripts of lectures, essays, and letters. Details given are of first and latest UK editions, and current US editions. Most titles are also available as e-books. The 11 titles marked with a '+' are available in the US market in revised editions from Princeton University Press, with additional material by Berlin, and (except in the case of \"Karl Marx\") new forewords by contemporary authors; the 5th edition of \"Karl Marx\" is also available in the UK.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "166162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166162", "title": "Islamic philosophy", "text": "Islamic philosophy\n\nIn the religion of Islam, two words are sometimes translated as philosophy—\"falsafa\" (literally: \"philosophy\"), which refers to philosophy as well as logic, mathematics, and physics; and \"Kalam\" (literally \"speech\"), which refers to a rationalist form of Islamic philosophy and theology based on the interpretations as developed by medieval Muslim philosophers. \nIslamic philosophy has also been described as the systematic investigation of problems connected with life, the universe, ethics, medicine, science, society, and so on as conducted in the medieval Muslim world from Persian (Avicenna, al-Biruni, al-Farabi, al-Ghazali, Khayyam, Khwarizmi, al-Razi, Suhrawardi), \nArab (al-Kindi, al-Ashari, Alhazen), and Andalusian (Averroes, at-Turtushi, Ibn Hazm) Islamic philosophers, scholars and polymaths during the Islamic Golden Age.\n\nEarly Islamic philosophy began in the 2nd century AH of the Islamic calendar (early 9th century CE) and lasted until the 6th century AH (late 12th century CE). The period is known as the Golden Age of Islam, and the achievements of this period had a crucial influence on the development of modern philosophy and science in the Western world; for Renaissance Europe, the influence represented from the Islamic Golden Age was “one of the largest technology transfers in world history”. This period began with al-Kindi in the 9th century and ended with Averroes (Ibn Rushd) at the end of 12th century. The death of Averroes effectively marked the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the Peripatetic Arabic School, and philosophical activity declined significantly in Western Islamic countries such as Islamic Iberia and North Africa.\n\nIslamic philosophy persisted for much longer in Muslim Eastern countries, in particular Safavid Persia, Ottoman and Mughal Empires, where several schools of philosophy continued to flourish: Avicennism, Averroism, Illuminationist philosophy, Mystical philosophy, Transcendent theosophy, and Isfahan philosophy. Ibn Khaldun, in his \"Muqaddimah\", made important contributions to the philosophy of history. Interest in Islamic philosophy revived during the Nahda (\"Awakening\") movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and continues to the present day.\n\nBy way of introduction Islamic philosophy refers to philosophy produced in an Islamic society.\n\nIslamic philosophy is a generic term that can be defined and used in different ways. In its broadest sense it means the world view of Islam, as derived from the Islamic texts concerning the creation of the universe and the will of the Creator. In another sense it refers to any of the schools of thought that flourished under the Islamic empire or in the shadow of the Arab-Islamic culture and Islamic civilization. In its narrowest sense it is a translation of \"Falsafa\", meaning those particular schools of thought that most reflect the influence of Greek systems of philosophy such as Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism.\n\nIt is not necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor exclusively produced by Muslims. Nor do all schools of thought within Islam admit the usefulness or legitimacy of philosophical inquiry. Some argue that there is no indication that the limited knowledge and experience of humans can lead to truth. It is also important to observe that, while \"reason\" (\"'aql\") is sometimes recognised as a source of Islamic law, this may have a totally different meaning from \"reason\" in philosophy.\nThe historiography of Islamic philosophy is marked by disputes as to how the subject should be properly interpreted. Some of the key issues involve the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd, and also whether Islamic philosophy can be read at face value or should be interpreted in an esoteric fashion. Supporters of the latter thesis, like Leo Strauss, maintain that Islamic philosophers wrote so as to conceal their true meaning in order to avoid religious persecution, but scholars such as Oliver Leaman disagree.\n\nIslamic philosophy as the name implies refers to philosophical activity within the Islamic milieu. The main sources of classical or early Islamic philosophy are the religion of Islam itself (especially ideas derived and interpreted from the Quran) and Greek philosophy which the early Muslims inherited as a result of conquests, along with pre-Islamic Indian philosophy and Persian philosophy. Many of the early philosophical debates centered around reconciling religion and reason, the latter exemplified by Greek philosophy.\n\nSome Muslims oppose the idea of philosophy as un-Islamic. The popular Salafist website IslamQA.info (supervised by Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid of Saudi Arabia) declares philosophy to be an \"alien entity\": \nThe terminology of Islamic philosophy did not emerge as a branch of knowledge that is taught in the curriculum of Islamic studies until it was introduced by Shaykh Mustafa Abd al-Raziq – the Shaykh of al-Azhar – as a reaction to western attacks on Islam based on the idea that Islam has no philosophy. But the fact of the matter is that philosophy is an alien entity in the body of Islam. \n\nThe fatwa claims that \"the majority of \"fuqaha’\" [experts in \"fiqh\"] have stated that it is haraam to study philosophy, and lists some of these:\n\nIslamQA quotes Al-Ghazali who declares that of the \"four branches\" of philosophy (geometry and mathematics, logic, theology, and natural sciences), some of the natural sciences \"go against shari’ah, Islam and truth\", and that except for medicine, \"there is no need for the study of nature\".\n\nMaani’ Hammad al-Juhani, (a member of the Consultative Council and General Director, World Assembly of Muslim Youth) \nis quoted as declaring that because philosophy does not follow the moral guidelines of the Sunnah, \n\"philosophy, as defined by the philosophers, is one of the most dangerous falsehoods and most vicious in fighting faith and religion on the basis of logic, which it is very easy to use to confuse people in the name of reason, interpretation and metaphor that distort the religious texts\".\n\nIbn Abi al-Izz, a commentator on al-Tahhaawiyyah, condemns philosophers as the ones who \"most deny the Last Day and its events. In their view Paradise and Hell are no more than parables for the masses to understand, but they have no reality beyond people’s minds.\"\n\nIn early Islamic thought, which refers to philosophy during the \"Islamic Golden Age\", traditionally dated between the 8th and 12th centuries, two main currents may be distinguished. The first is Kalam, which mainly dealt with Islamic theological questions, and the other is Falsafa, which was founded on interpretations of Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism. There were attempts by later philosopher-theologians at harmonizing both trends, notably by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) who founded the school of Avicennism, Ibn Rushd (Averroës) who founded the school of Averroism, and others such as Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) and Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī.\n\n\"ʿIlm al-Kalām\" () is the philosophy that seeks Islamic theological principles through dialectic. In Arabic, the word literally means \"speech\".\n\nOne of first debates was that between partisans of the \"Qadar\" ( meaning \"Fate\"), who affirmed free will; and the \"Jabarites\" ( meaning \"force\", \"constraint\"), who believed in fatalism.\n\nAt the 2nd century of the Hijra, a new movement arose in the theological school of Basra, Iraq. A pupil of Hasan of Basra, Wasil ibn Ata, left the group when he disagreed with his teacher on whether a Muslim who has committed a major sin invalidates his faith. He systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Qadarites and Jabarites. This new school was called \"Mu'tazilite\" (from \"i'tazala\", to separate oneself).\n\nThe Mu'tazilites looked in towards a strict rationalism with which to interpret Islamic doctrine. Their attempt was one of the first to pursue a rational theology in Islam. They were however severely criticized by other Islamic philosophers, both Maturidis and Asharites. The great Asharite scholar Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi wrote the work \"Al-Mutakallimin fi 'Ilm al-Kalam\" against the Mutazalites.\n\nIn later times, \"Kalam\" was used to mean simply \"theology\", i.e. the \"duties of the heart\" as opposed to (or in conjunction with) fiqh\" (jurisprudence), the \"duties of the body\".\n\n\"Falsafa\" is a Greek loanword meaning \"philosophy\" (the Greek pronunciation \"philosophia\" became \"falsafa\"). From the 9th century onward, due to Caliph al-Ma'mun and his successor, ancient Greek philosophy was introduced among the arabs and the Peripatetic School began to find able representatives. Among them were Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes. Another trend, represented by the Brethren of Purity, used Aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean world view.\n\nDuring the Abbasid caliphate, a number of thinkers and scientists, some of them heterodox Muslims or non-Muslims, played a role in transmitting Greek, Hindu and other pre-Islamic knowledge to the Christian West. They contributed to making Aristotle known in Christian Europe. Three speculative thinkers, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Al-Kindi, combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam.\n\nBy the 12th century, \"Kalam\", attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. At the same time, however, \"Falsafa\" came under serious critical scrutiny. The most devastating attack came from Al-Ghazali, whose work \"Tahafut al-Falasifa\" (\"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\") attacked the main arguments of the Peripatetic School.\n\nAverroes, Maimonides' contemporary, was one of the last of the Islamic Peripatetics and set out to defend the views of the \"Falsafa\" against al-Ghazali's criticism. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Avicenna and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Averroes admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world—hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter.\n\nBut while Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and other Persian and Muslim philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on traditional beliefs, Ibn Rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, \"Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation \"ex nihilo\"\" (Munk, \"Mélanges,\" p. 444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Avicenna declared, but also a necessity.\n\nIn early Islamic philosophy, logic played an important role. Sharia (Islamic law) placed importance on formulating standards of argument, which gave rise to a novel approach to logic in Kalam, but this approach was later displaced by ideas from Greek philosophy and Hellenistic philosophy with the rise of the Mu'tazili philosophers, who highly valued Aristotle's \"Organon\". The works of Hellenistic-influenced Islamic philosophers were crucial in the reception of Aristotelian logic in medieval Europe, along with the commentaries on the \"Organon\" by Averroes. The works of al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali and other Muslim logicians who often criticized and corrected Aristotelian logic and introduced their own forms of logic, also played a central role in the subsequent development of European logic during the Renaissance.\n\nAccording to the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy:\n\nImportant developments made by Muslim logicians included the development of \"Avicennian logic\" as a replacement of Aristotelian logic. Avicenna's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal modal logic and inductive logic. Other important developments in early Islamic philosophy include the development of a strict science of citation, the isnad or \"backing\", and the development of a method to disprove claims, the ijtihad, which was generally applied to many types of questions.\n\nEarly forms of analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning and categorical syllogism were introduced in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century with the process of \"Qiyas\", before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later, during the Islamic Golden Age, there was debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term \"Qiyas\" refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that \"Qiyas\" refers to inductive reasoning. Ibn Hazm (994–1064) disagreed, arguing that \"Qiyas\" does not refer to inductive reasoning but to categorical syllogistic reasoning in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111; and, in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that \"Qiyas\" refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term \"Qiyas\" refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.\n\nThe first original Arabic writings on logic were produced by al-Kindi (Alkindus) (805–873), who produced a summary on earlier logic up to his time. The first writings on logic with non-Aristotelian elements was produced by al-Farabi (Alfarabi) (873–950), who discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference. He is also credited for categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being \"idea\" and the second being \"proof\".\n\nAverroes (1126–1198), author of the most elaborate commentaries on Aristotelian logic, was the last major logician from al-Andalus.\n\nAvicenna (980–1037) developed his own system of logic known as \"Avicennian logic\" as an alternative to Aristotelian logic. By the 12th century, Avicennian logic had replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world.\n\nThe first criticisms of Aristotelian logic were written by Avicenna (980–1037), who produced independent treatises on logic rather than commentaries. He criticized the logical school of Baghdad for their devotion to Aristotle at the time. He investigated the theory of definition and classification and the quantification of the predicates of categorical propositions, and developed an original theory on \"temporal modal\" syllogism. Its premises included modifiers such as \"at all times\", \"at most times\", and \"at some time\".\n\nWhile Avicenna (980–1037) often relied on deductive reasoning in philosophy, he used a different approach in medicine. Ibn Sina contributed inventively to the development of inductive logic, which he used to pioneer the idea of a syndrome. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation which are critical to inductive logic and the scientific method.\n\nIbn Hazm (994–1064) wrote the \"Scope of Logic\", in which he stressed on the importance of sense perception as a source of knowledge. Al-Ghazali (Algazel) (1058–1111) had an important influence on the use of logic in theology, making use of Avicennian logic in Kalam. Despite the logical sophistication of al-Ghazali, the rise of the Ash'ari school in the 12th century slowly suffocated original work on logic in much of the Islamic world, though logic continued to be studied in some Islamic regions such as Persia and the Levant.\n\nFakhr al-Din al-Razi (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's \"first figure\" and developed a form of inductive logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). Systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the Illuminationist school, founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who developed the idea of \"decisive necessity\", an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation. and in favour of inductive reasoning.\n\nAvicenna's proof for the existence of God was the first ontological argument, which he proposed in the \"Metaphysics\" section of \"The Book of Healing\". This was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof, which utilizes intuition and reason alone. Avicenna's proof of God's existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a cosmological argument and an ontological argument. \"It is ontological insofar as ‘necessary existence’ in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent\". The proof is also \"cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent.\"\n\nIslamic philosophy, imbued as it is with Islamic theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism the difference between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. This was first described by Avicenna's works on metaphysics, who was himself influenced by al-Farabi.\n\nSome orientalists (or those particularly influenced by Thomist scholarship) argued that Avicenna was the first to view existence (\"wujud\") as an accident that happens to the essence (\"mahiyya\"). However, this aspect of ontology is not the most central to the distinction that Avicenna established between essence and existence. One cannot therefore make the claim that Avicenna was the proponent of the concept of essentialism \"per se\", given that existence (\"al-wujud\") when thought of in terms of necessity would ontologically translate into a notion of the \"Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself\" (\"wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi\"), which is without description or definition and, in particular, without quiddity or essence (\"la mahiyya lahu\"). Consequently, Avicenna's ontology is 'existentialist' when accounting for being–\"qua\"–existence in terms of necessity (\"wujub\"), while it is essentialist in terms of thinking about being–\"qua\"–existence in terms of \"contingency–\"qua\"–possibility\" (\"imkan\" or \"mumkin al-wujud\", meaning \"contingent being\").\n\nSome argue that Avicenna anticipated Frege and Bertrand Russell in \"holding that existence is an accident of accidents\" and also anticipated Alexius Meinong's \"view about nonexistent objects.\" He also provided early arguments for \"a \"necessary being\" as cause of all other existents.\"\n\nThe idea of \"essence preced[ing] existence\" is a concept which dates back to Avicenna and his school as well as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and his Illuminationist philosophy. \"Existence preced[ing] essence\", the opposite (existentialist) notion, was developed in the works of Averroes and Mulla Sadra's transcendent theosophy.\nIbn al-Nafis wrote the \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a defense of \"the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.\" The book presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus as forms of evidence. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to Avicenna's metaphysical argument on spiritual resurrection (as opposed to bodily resurrection), which was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.\n\nThe Muslim physician-philosophers, Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the spirit, and in particular, the Avicennian doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the Scholastics. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul included the idea that the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of \"The Ten Intellects\", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final intellect.\n\nAvicenna generally supported Aristotle's idea of the soul originating from the heart, whereas Ibn al-Nafis on the other hand rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul \"is related to the entirety and not to one or a few organs.\" He further criticized Aristotle's idea that every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. Ibn al-Nafis concluded that \"the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul\" and he defined the soul as nothing other than \"what a human indicates by saying ‘I’.\"\n\nWhile he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality of the soul. He referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. His \"Floating Man\" thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all , which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. He thus concludes that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing, and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms, but as a primary given, a substance.\n\nThis argument was later refined and simplified by René Descartes in epistemic terms when he stated: \"I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness.\"\n\nWhile ancient Greek philosophers believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, early medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the creationism shared by Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher John Philoponus presented a detailed argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Muslim and Arab Jewish philosophers like Al-Kindi, Saadia Gaon, and Al-Ghazali developed further arguments, with most falling into two broad categories: assertions of the \"impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite\" and of the \"impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition\".\n\nIn metaphysics, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) defined truth as:\n\nAvicenna elaborated on his definition of truth in his \"Metaphysics\":\n\nIn his \"Quodlibeta\", Thomas Aquinas wrote a commentary on Avicenna's definition of truth in his \"Metaphysics\" and explained it as follows:\n\nEarly Islamic political philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion and emphsized the process of ijtihad to find truth.\n\nIbn al-Haytham (Alhacen) reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself. In his \"Aporias against Ptolemy\", Ibn al-Haytham further wrote the following comments on truth:\n\nThe Freewill versus predestination issue is one of the \"most contentious topics in classical Islamic thought.\" In accordance with the Islamic belief in predestination, or divine preordainment (\"al-qadā wa'l-qadar\"), God has full knowledge and control over all that occurs. This is explained in Qur'anic verses such as \"Say: 'Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector'...\" For Muslims, everything in the world that occurs, good or bad, has been preordained and nothing can happen unless permitted by God. According to Muslim theologians, although events are pre-ordained, man possesses free will in that he or she has the faculty to choose between right and wrong, and is thus responsible for his actions. According to Islamic tradition, all that has been decreed by God is written in \"al-Lawh al-Mahfūz\", the \"Preserved Tablet\".\n\nAtomistic philosophies are found very early in Islamic philosophy, and represent a synthesis of the Greek and Indian ideas. Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy. Yet it was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some schools of Islamic thought.\n\nThe most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the Asharite school of philosophy, most notably in the work of the philosopher al-Ghazali (1058–1111). In Asharite atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is \"accidental\" meaning something that lasts for only an instant. Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment. Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God's constant intervention, without which nothing could happen. Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on causation, or the lack thereof.\n\nOther traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle. An active school of philosophers in Spain, including the noted commentator Averroes (1126-1198 AD) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle. Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries did much to guide the interpretation of Aristotle in later Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.\n\nThere are several cosmological verses in the Qur'an (610–632) which some modern writers have interpreted as foreshadowing the expansion of the universe and possibly even the Big Bang theory:\n\nDon't those who reject faith see that the heavens and the earth were a single entity then We ripped them apart?\nAnd the heavens We did create with Our Hands, and We do cause it to expand.\n\nIn contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the creation myth shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the first such argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. His reasoning was adopted by many, most notably; Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel). They used two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the \"argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite\", which states:\n\nThe second argument, the \"argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition\", states:\n\nBoth arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became famous after it was adopted by Immanuel Kant in his thesis of the first antimony concerning time.\n\nIn the 10th century, the Brethren of Purity published the \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\", in which a heliocentric view of the universe is expressed in a section on cosmology:\n\nThe Mu'tazili scientist and philosopher al-Jahiz (c. 776–869) was the first of the Muslim biologists and philosophers to develop an early theory of evolution. He speculated on the influence of the environment on animals, considered the effects of the environment on the likelihood of an animal to survive, and first described the struggle for existence, a precursor to natural selection. Al-Jahiz's ideas on the struggle for existence in the \"Book of Animals\" have been summarized as follows:\n\nIn Chapter 47 of \"India\", entitled \"On Vasudeva and the Wars of the Bharata,\" Abu Rayhan Biruni attempted to give a naturalistic explanation as to why the struggles described in the \"Mahabharata\" \"had to take place.\" He explains it using natural processes that include biological ideas related to evolution, which has led several scholars to compare his ideas to Darwinism and natural selection. This is due to Biruni describing the idea of artificial selection and then applying it to nature:\n\nIn the 13th century, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi explains how the elements evolved into minerals, then plants, then animals, and then humans. Tusi then goes on to explain how hereditary variability was an important factor for biological evolution of living things:\n\nTusi discusses how organisms are able to adapt to their environments:\n\nTusi then explains how humans evolved from advanced animals:\n\nAl-Dinawari (828–896), considered the founder of Arabic botany for his \"Book of Plants\", discussed plant evolution from its birth to its death, describing the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit.\n\nIbn Miskawayh's \"al-Fawz al-Asghar\" and the Brethren of Purity's \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\" (\"The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa\") developed theories on evolution that possibly had an influence on Charles Darwin and his inception of Darwinism, but has at one time been criticized as overenthusiastic.\n\nEnglish translations of the \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\" were available from 1812, while Arabic manuscripts of the \"al-Fawz al-Asghar\" and \"The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa\" were also available at the University of Cambridge by the 19th century. These works likely had an influence on 19th-century evolutionists, and possibly Charles Darwin.\n\nIn the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun further developed the evolutionary ideas found in the \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\". The following statements from his 1377 work, the \"Muqaddimah\", express evolutionary ideas:\n\nNumerous other Islamic scholars and scientists, including the polymaths Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Khazini, discussed and developed these ideas. Translated into Latin, these works began to appear in the West after the Renaissance and may have influenced Western philosophy and science.\n\nThe polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) is considered a pioneer of phenomenology. He articulated a relationship between the physical and observable world and that of intuition, psychology and mental functions. His theories regarding knowledge and perception, linking the domains of science and religion, led to a philosophy of existence based on the direct observation of reality from the observer's point of view. Much of his thought on phenomenology was not further developed until the 20th century.\n\nThe philosophy of mind was studied in medieval Islamic psychological thought, which refers to the study of the \"nafs\" (literally \"self\" or \"psyche\" in Arabic) in the Islamic world, particularly during the Islamic Golden Age (8th–15th centuries) as well as modern times (20th–21st centuries), and is related to psychology, psychiatry and the neurosciences.\n\nThe Arab polymath al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen; died c. 1041) presented a thorough mathematical critique and refutation of Aristotle's conception of place (\"topos\") in his \"Risala/Qawl fi’l-makan\" (\"Treatise/Discourse on Place\").\n\nAristotle's \"Physics\" (Book IV – \"Delta\") stated that the place of something is the two-dimensional boundary of the containing body that is at rest and is in contact with what it contains. Ibn al-Haytham disagreed with this definition and demonstrated that place (\"al-makan\") is the imagined (three-dimensional) void (\"al-khala' al-mutakhayyal\") between the inner surfaces of the containing body. He showed that place was akin to space, foreshadowing Descartes's notion of place as space qua \"Extensio\" or even Leibniz's \"analysis situs\". Ibn al-Haytham's mathematization of place rested on several geometric demonstrations, including his study on the sphere and other solids, which showed that the sphere (\"al-kura\") is the largest in magnitude (volumetric) with respect to other geometric solids that have equal surface areas. For instance, a sphere that has an equal surface area to that of a cylinder, would be larger in (volumetric) magnitude than the cylinder; hence, the sphere occupies a larger place than that occupied by the cylinder; unlike what is entailed by Aristotle's definition of place: that this sphere and that cylinder occupy places that are equal in magnitude. Ibn al-Haytham rejected Aristotle's philosophical concept of place on mathematical grounds. Later, the philosopher 'Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (13th century) tried to defend the Aristotelian conception of place in a treatise titled: \"Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan\" (\"A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham's place\"), although his effort was admirable from a philosophical standpoint, it was unconvincing from the scientific and mathematical viewpoints.\n\nIbn al-Haytham also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his \"Book of Optics\" (1021). His experimental proof of the intromission model of vision led to changes in the way the visual perception of space was understood, contrary to the previous emission theory of vision supported by Euclid and Ptolemy. In \"tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the\nintuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for\ncorrelation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.\"\n\nIn the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a \"maktab\", which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madrasahs (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to a mosque. In the 11th century, Ibn Sina (known as \"Avicenna\" in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter dealing with the \"maktab\" entitled \"The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children\", as a guide to teachers working at \"maktab\" schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn Sina described the curriculum of a \"maktab\" school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a \"maktab\" school.\n\nIbn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a \"maktab\" school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the Qur'an, Islamic metaphysics, language, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).\n\nIbn Sina refers to the secondary education stage of \"maktab\" schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.\n\nThe pioneering development of the scientific method by the Arab Ash'ari polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) was an important contribution to the philosophy of science. In the \"Book of Optics\" (c. 1025 CE), his scientific method was very similar to the modern scientific method and consisted of the following procedures:\n\n\nIn \"The Model of the Motions\", Ibn al-Haytham also describes an early version of Occam's razor, where he employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical motions, as he attempts to eliminate from his planetary model the cosmological hypotheses that cannot be observed from Earth.\n\nIn \"Aporias against Ptolemy\", Ibn al-Haytham commented on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge:\n\nHe held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge:\n\nIbn al-Haytham attributed his experimental scientific method and scientific skepticism to his Islamic faith. He believed that human beings are inherently flawed and that only God is perfect. He reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself. In \"The Winding Motion\", Ibn al-Haytham further wrote that faith should only apply to prophets of Islam and not to any other authorities, in the following comparison between the Islamic prophetic tradition and the demonstrative sciences:\n\nIbn al-Haytham described his search for truth and knowledge as a way of leading him closer to God:\n\nHis contemporary Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī also introduced an early scientific method in nearly every field of inquiry he studied. For example, in his treatise on mineralogy, \"Kitab al-Jamahir\" (\"Book of Precious Stones\"), he is \"the most exact of experimental scientists\", while in the introduction to his study of India, he declares that \"to execute our project, it has not been possible to follow the geometric method\" and develops comparative sociology as a scientific method in the field. He was also responsible for introducing the experimental method into mechanics, the first to conduct elaborate experiments related to astronomical phenomena, and a pioneer of experimental psychology.\n\nUnlike his contemporary Avicenna's scientific method where \"general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work\", al-Biruni developed scientific methods where \"universals came out of practical, experimental work\" and \"theories are formulated after discoveries.\" During his debate with Avicenna on natural philosophy, al-Biruni made the first real distinction between a scientist and a philosopher, referring to Avicenna as a philosopher and considering himself to be a mathematical scientist.\n\nAl-Biruni's scientific method was similar to the modern scientific method in many ways, particularly his emphasis on repeated experimentation. Biruni was concerned with how to conceptualize and prevent both systematic errors and random errors, such as \"errors caused by the use of small instruments and errors made by human observers.\" He argued that if instruments produce random errors because of their imperfections or idiosyncratic qualities, then multiple observations must be taken, analyzed qualitatively, and on this basis, arrive at a \"common-sense single value for the constant sought\", whether an arithmetic mean or a \"reliable estimate.\"\n\nAvicenna (Ibn Sina) is considered the father of modern medicine, for his introduction of experimental medicine and clinical trials, the experimental use and testing of drugs, and a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical substances, in his medical encyclopedia, \"The Canon of Medicine\" (11th century), which was the first book dealing with experimental medicine. It laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs or medications, which still form the basis of modern clinical trials:\n\n\nThe first documented description of a peer review process is found in the \"Ethics of the Physician\" written by Ishaq bin Ali al-Rahwi (854–931) of al-Raha, Syria, who describes the first medical peer review process. His work, as well as later Arabic medical manuals, state that a visiting physician must always make duplicate notes of a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would review the practising physician's notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient.\n\nAvicenna's most influential theory in epistemology is his theory of knowledge, in which he developed the concept of tabula rasa. He argued that the \"human intellect at birth is rather like a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know\" and that knowledge is attained through \"empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts\" which is developed through a \"syllogistic method of reasoning; observations lead to prepositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts.\"\n\nIn the 12th century, Ibn Tufail further developed the concept of tabula rasa in his Arabic novel, \"Hayy ibn Yaqzan\", in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child \"from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society\" on a desert island. The Latin translation of his work, entitled \"Philosophus Autodidactus\", published by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671, had an influence on John Locke's formulation of tabula rasa in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\".\n\nIslamic eschatology is concerned with the \"Qiyamah\" (end of the world; Last Judgement) and the final judgement of humanity. Eschatology relates to one of the six articles of faith (\"aqidah\") of Islam. Like the other Abrahamic religions, Islam teaches the bodily resurrection of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul (though Jews do not necessarily view the soul as eternal); the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of \"Jannah\" (Heaven), while the unrighteous are punished in \"Jahannam\" (Hell). A significant fraction (one third, in fact) of the Quran deals with these beliefs, with many \"hadith\" elaborating on the themes and details. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing the Armageddon is often known as \"fitna\" (a test) and \"malahim\" (or \"ghayba\" in the Shi'a tradition).\n\nIbn al-Nafis dealt with Islamic eschatology in some depth in his \"Theologus Autodidactus\", where he rationalized the Islamic view of eschatology using reason and science to explain the events that would occur according to Islamic eschatology. He presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of Arabic fiction, hence his \"Theologus Autodidactus\" may be considered the earliest science fiction work.\n\nSharia () refers to the body of Islamic law. The term means \"way\" or \"path\"; it is the legal framework within which public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles of jurisprudence. Fiqh is the term for Islamic jurisprudence, made up of the rulings of Islamic jurists. A component of Islamic studies, Fiqh expounds the methodology by which Islamic law is derived from primary and secondary sources.\n\nMainstream Islam distinguish \"fiqh\", which means understanding details and inferences drawn by scholars, from \"sharia\" that refers to principles that lie behind the fiqh. Scholars hope that \"fiqh\" and \"sharia\" are in harmony in any given case, but they cannot be sure.\n\nThe Islamic philosophers, Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis, were pioneers of the philosophical novel. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic novel \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" (\"Philosophus Autodidactus\") as a response to al-Ghazali's \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\", and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional novel \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a response to Ibn Tufail's \"Philosophus Autodidactus\". Both of these novels had protagonists (Hayy in \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" and Kamil in \"Theologus Autodidactus\") who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated in a cave and living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in \"Philosophus Autodidactus\", the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in \"Theologus Autodidactus\", developing into the first example of a science fiction novel.\n\nIbn al-Nafis described his book \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a defense of \"the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.\" He presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the metaphysical claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.\n\nA Latin translation of \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" was published in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger. The first English translation by Simon Ockley was published in 1708, and German and Dutch translations were also published at the time. \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" went on to have a significant influence on European literature, and became an influential best-seller throughout Western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write \"Robinson Crusoe\", which also featured a desert island narrative and was regarded as the first novel in English.\n\n\"Philosophus Autodidactus\" also had a \"profound influence\" on modern Western philosophy. It became \"one of the most important books that heralded the Scientific Revolution\" and European Enlightenment, and the thoughts expressed in the novel can be found in \"different variations and to different degrees in the books of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Immanuel Kant.\" The novel inspired the concept of \"tabula rasa\" developed in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690) by Locke, who was a student of Pococke. \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" also developed the themes of empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture, condition of possibility, materialism, and Molyneux's Problem. The novel also inspired Robert Boyle, another acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, \"The Aspiring Naturalist\". Other European scholars influenced by \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" include Gottfried Leibniz, Melchisédech Thévenot, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens, George Keith, Robert Barclay, the Quakers, and Samuel Hartlib.\n\nEarly Islamic political philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect \"all\" philosophy was \"political\" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more secular view and were supported by secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. The only Greek political treatise known to medieval Muslims at the time was Plato's \"Republic\". By the end of the Islamic Golden Age, however, the Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed.\n\nIslamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam, i.e. the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad. However, in the Western thought, it is generally known that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Alfarabi), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah, sultan, ummah, cemaa -and even the \"core\" terms of the Qur'an, i.e. ibada, din, rab and ilah- is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.\n\nThe 14th-century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist Ernest Gellner considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of government, \"an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself\", the best in the history of political theory.\n\nThe first detailed studies on the subject of historiography and the first critiques on historical methods appeared in the works of the Arab Ash'ari polymath Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), who is regarded as the father of historiography, cultural history, and the philosophy of history, especially for his historiographical writings in the \"Muqaddimah\" (Latinized as \"Prolegomena\") and \"Kitab al-Ibar\" (\"Book of Advice\"). His \"Muqaddimah\" also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history, and he discussed the rise and fall of civilizations.\n\nFranz Rosenthal wrote in the \"History of Muslim Historiography\":\n\nThere is an important question on the relation of religion and philosophy, reason and faith and so on. In one hand there is extraordinary importance attached to religion in Islamic civilization and in other hand they created certain doctrines in respect to reason and religion.\n\nThe social philosopher and Ash'ari polymath Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) was the last major Islamic philosopher from Tunis, North Africa. In his \"Muqaddimah\", he developed the earliest theories on social philosophy, in formulating theories of social cohesion and social conflict. His \"Muqaddimah\" was also the introduction to a seven volume analysis of universal history.\n\nIbn Khaldun is considered the \"father of sociology\", \"father of historiography\", and \"father of the philosophy of history\" by some, for allegedly being the first to discuss the topics of sociology, historiography and the philosophy of history in detail.\n\nIslamic philosophy found an audience with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men—such as the Ibn Tibbons, Narboni, Gersonides—joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Rushd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil Joseph ben Judah, spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Rushd's commentary.\n\nThe oldest Jewish religio-philosophical work preserved in Arabic is that of Saadia Gaon (892–942), \"Emunot ve-Deot\", \"The Book of Beliefs and Opinions\". In this work Saadia treats the questions that interested the Mutakallamin, such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. Saadia criticizes other philosophers severely. For Saadia there was no problem as to creation: God created the world \"ex nihilo\", just as the Bible attests; and he contests the theory of the Mutakallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter.\n\nTo prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Mutakallamin. Only the attributes of essence (\"sifat al-dhatia\") can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (\"sifat-al-fi'aliya\"). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres. Here Saadia controverts the Mutakallamin, who considered the soul an \"accident\" \"'arad\" (compare Guide for the Perplexed i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: \"Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident\" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: \"If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love,\" etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views.\n\nSince no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Persian or Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, Al Ghazali found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the \"Kuzari,\" in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Mutakallimun for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, \"I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them\" (\"Kuzari,\" v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Mutakallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: \"Does the Kalam give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?\" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in Judah ha-Levi's eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament.\n\nSimilarly the reaction in favour of stricter Aristotelianism, as found in Averroes, had its Jewish counterpart in the work of Maimonides. Later Jewish philosophers, such as Gersonides and Elijah Delmedigo, followed the school of Averroes and played a part in transmitting Averroist thought to medieval Europe.\n\nIn Spain and Italy, Jewish translators such as Abraham de Balmes and Jacob Mantino translated Arabic philosophic literature into Hebrew and Latin, contributing to the development of modern European philosophy.\n\nThe death of Ibn Rushd (Averroës) effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the \"Peripatetic Arabic School\", and philosophical activity declined significantly in western Islamic countries, namely in Islamic Spain and North Africa, though it persisted for much longer in the Eastern countries, in particular Iran and India. Contrary to the traditional view, Dimitri Gutas and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the true \"Golden Age\" of Arabic and Islamic philosophy, initiated by Al-Ghazali's successful integration of logic into the Madrasah curriculum and the subsequent rise of Avicennism.\n\nSince the political power shift in Western Europe (Spain and Portugal) from Muslim to Christian control, the Muslims naturally did not practice philosophy in Western Europe. This also led to some loss of contact between the 'west' and the 'east' of the Islamic world. Muslims in the 'east' continued to do philosophy, as is evident from the works of Ottoman scholars and especially those living in Muslim kingdoms within the territories of present-day Iran and India, such as Shah Waliullah and Ahmad Sirhindi. This fact has escaped most pre-modern historians of Islamic (or Arabic) philosophy. In addition, logic has continued to be taught in religious seminaries up to modern times.\n\nAfter Ibn Rushd, there arose many later schools of Islamic Philosophy. We can mention just a few, such as those founded by Ibn Arabi and ShiiteMulla Sadra. These new schools are of particular importance, as they are still active in the Islamic world. The most important among them are:\n\nIlluminationist philosophy was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi in the 12th century. This school is a combination of Avicenna's philosophy and ancient Iranian philosophy, with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by Neoplatonism.\n\nIn logic in Islamic philosophy, systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the Illuminationist school, founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who developed the idea of \"decisive necessity\", an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation.\n\nTranscendent theosophy is the school of Islamic philosophy founded by Mulla Sadra in the 17th century. His philosophy and ontology is considered to be just as important to Islamic philosophy as Martin Heidegger's philosophy later was to Western philosophy in the 20th century. Mulla Sadra bought \"a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of reality\" and created \"a major transition from essentialism to existentialism\" in Islamic philosophy, several centuries before this occurred in Western philosophy.\n\nThe idea of \"essence precedes existence\" is a concept which dates back to Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and his school of Avicennism as well as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and his Illuminationist philosophy. The opposite idea of \"Existence precedes essence\" was thus developed in the works of Averroes and Mulla Sadra as a reaction to this idea and is a key foundational concept of existentialism.\n\nFor Mulla Sadra, \"existence precedes the essence and is thus principle since something has to exist first and then have an essence.\" This is primarily the argument that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Theosophy. Sayyid Jalal Ashtiyani later summarized Mulla Sadra's concept as follows:\n\nMore careful approaches are needed in terms of thinking about philosophers (and theologians) in Islam in terms of phenomenological methods of investigation in ontology (or onto-theology), or by way of comparisons that are made with Heidegger's thought and his critique of the history of metaphysics.\n\nThe tradition of Islamic philosophy is still very much alive today [despite the belief in many Western circles that this tradition ceased after the golden ages] of Suhrawardi's \"Hikmat al-Ishraq\" (\"Illumination Philosophy\") or Mulla Sadra's \"Hikmat-e-Mota'aliye\" (\"Transcendent\" [or \"Exalted\"] \"Philosophy\"). Another figure is Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who reshaped and revitalized Islamic philosophy among the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in the early 20th century. His \"The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam\"  is a milestone in the modern political philosophy of Islam.\n\nIn contemporary Islamic regions, the teaching of \"hikmat\" or \"hikmah\" has continued to flourish.\n\n\nPhilosophy has not been without criticism amongst Muslims, both contemporary and past. The imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, for whom the Hanbali school of thought is named, rebuked philosophical discussion, once telling proponents of it that he was secure in his religion, but that they were \"in doubt, so go to a doubter and argue with him (instead).\" Today, Islamic philosophical thought has also been criticized by scholars of the modern Salafi movement.\n\nThere would be many Islamic thinkers who were not enthusiastic about its potential, but it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a \"foreign science\". Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even the 11th century al-Ghazali, known for his \"Incoherence of the Philosophers\" critique of philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and logic. His criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. In his view the three most serious of these were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things, though it should be noted that not all philosophers subscribed to these same views.\n\nIn recent studies by Muslim contemporary thinkers that aim at \"renewing the impetus of philosophical thinking in Islam,\" the philosopher and theorist Nader El-Bizri offers a critical analysis of the conventions that dominate mainstream academic and epistemic approaches in studying Islamic philosophy. These approaches, of methodology and historiography are looked at from archival standpoints within Oriental and Mediaevalist Studies, fail to recognize the fact that philosophy in Islam can still be a living intellectual tradition. He maintains that its renewal requires a radical reform in ontology and epistemology within Islamic thought. El-Bizri's interpretations of Avicenna (Ibn Sina) from the standpoint of Heidegger's critique of the history of metaphysics, and specifically against the background of the unfolding of the essence of technology, aim at finding new pathways in ontology that are not simply Avicennian nor Heideggerian, even though El-Bizri's approach in rethinking \"falsafa\" amounts to a \"Neo-Avicennism\" that carries resonances with novel modern philosophical ways of reading Aristotelianism and Thomism. El-Bizri engages contemporary issues in philosophy through a fundamental critical analytic of the evolution of key concepts in the history of ontology and epistemology. Nader El-Bizri is a modernist in outlook since he aims at bringing newness to the tradition rather than simply reproduce it or being in rupture with it.\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated B.A. in 1703, M.A. in 1707, and had D.D. by royal command in 1717.\n\nHe was known as a mathematician, and lived much of his life at Cambridge. He held a prebend at Norwich, was a royal chaplain, and canon of Canterbury (1721). On 16 March 1728 he was instituted to the deanery of Salisbury.

He also teaches at the School of Public Policy and Governance. He received his Bachelor of Arts from McGill University in 1990, where his teachers included Charles Taylor, and his Master of Arts and doctor of philosophy (1995) degrees are from Northwestern University, where he studied under Thomas A. McCarthy and Jürgen Habermas. He has published both academic and popular writings, including the bestselling \"The Rebel Sell\". His philosophical work includes papers and books in political philosophy, business ethics, rational choice theory, action theory, and critical theory.\n\nHeath is the recipient of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation Fellowship (2012). In 2013, Heath was named to the Royal Society of Canada. His popular book \"Enlightenment 2.0\" won the 2014 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing.\n\nThe central claim of \"The Rebel Sell\" is that counter-cultural movements have failed, and that they all share a common fatal error in the way they understand society; hence, counter-culture is not a threat to \"the system\".\nFor example, it is suggested of Adbusters' Blackspot campaign that the shoe's existence proves that \"no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture.\"\n\nIn the book \"Filthy Lucre\", Joseph Heath criticizes the idea that tax-paying is inherently different from consumption, and argues that the idea of a tax freedom day is flawed: \n\nIt would make just as much sense to declare an annual \"mortgage freedom day\", in order to let mortgage owners know what day they \"stop working for the bank and start working for themselves\". ...But who cares? Homeowners are not really \"working for the bank\"; they're merely financing their own consumption. After all, they're the ones living in the house, not the bank manager. \nIn business ethics, Heath advances a new theory, what he calls a \"market failures\" or \"Paretian\" approach, which states that \"the market is essentially a staged competition, designed to promote Pareto efficiency, and in cases where the explicit rules governing the competition are insufficient to secure the class of favoured outcomes, economic actors should respect the spirit of these rules and refrain from pursuing strategies that run contrary to the point of the competition\". The approach is neither akin to the shareholder theory, the stakeholder theory or to a personal ethics framework.\n\nHeath’s market failures approach follows from his work in political economy. According to Heath, the market is not a system of natural justice. Rather, it is an imperfect but efficient institutional arrangement designed to maximize social welfare by way of an unresolved collective action problem. In other words, markets are \"special-purpose institutions designed to promote efficiency\", that need to be \"embedded within the broader context of a welfare state, which engages in both market-complementing and redistributive policies to claim to be just.\"\n\nSince these structured competitions are implemented \"for the narrow reason\" that, in a reasonably competitive market, they generate social benefits through positive externalities, \"adversarial ethics\" are acceptable in the circumscribed and limited role of markets. Indeed, economic actors engaged in market transaction \"must be given a fairly broad exemption from the norms of equality or fairness\".\n\nHowever, they must be held accountable to the fundamental principles required to have a competitive and efficiency promoting market. Therefore, \"the central role of business ethics is […] not to bring in 'outside' moral considerations to condemn the latest outrage, but to clarify and to correct the self-understanding of participants in the market economy […]. In order to do so, it has no need to appeal to normative standards beyond those that are already implicit in the institutions of a market economy.\" \n\nHence, \"the overall set of profit-maximizing strategies is partitioned into three categories, separating out the immoral and the illegal strategies from the normatively acceptable ones. The efficiency standard can be used to make both cuts. The 'acceptable/unacceptable' distinction is imposed by the efficiency properties of the market system as a whole. The set of unacceptable strategies can then be subdivided into 'immoral/illegal' using a transaction cost or regulatory cost analysis.\" In other words, the \"basic thrust of 'business ethics' is […] to discourage firms from taking advantage of market imperfections, even in cases where legal regulation is not feasible.\" \n\nThus, \"the firm should behave as though market conditions were perfectly competitive, even though they may not in fact be. The following list of imperatives provides some examples of the restrictions that this would imply : \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other Jewish Hellenistic writings include those of Jason of Cyrene, Josephus, Philo, Demetrius the chronographer, Eupolemus, Pseudo-Eupolemus, Artapanus of Alexandria, Cleodemus Malchus, Aristeas, Pseudo-Hecataeus, Thallus, and Justus of Tiberias, Pseudo-Philo, many Old Testament Pseudepigrapha and the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible itself.\n\nWhereas the Classical Greek city states used different dialects of Greek, a common standard, called Koine ( \"common\"), developed gradually in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC as a consequence of the formation of larger political structures (like the Greek colonies, Athenian Empire, and the Macedonian Empire) and a more intense cultural exchange in the Aegean area, or in other words the Hellenization of the empire of Alexander the Great.\n\nIn the Greek Dark Ages and the Archaic Period, Greek colonies were founded all over the Mediterranean basin. However, even though Greek goods were popular in the East, the cultural influence tended to work the other way around. Yet, with the conquests of Alexander the Great (333-323 BC) and the subsequent establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms (above all, the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom), Koine Greek became the dominant language in politics, culture and commerce in the Near East.\n\nDuring the following centuries, Rome conquered Greece and the Macedonian Kingdoms piece for piece until, with the conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, she held all land around the Mediterranean. However, as Horace gently puts it: \"Conquered Greece has conquered the brute victor and brought her arts into rustic Latium\" (\"Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit et artis intulit agresti Latio\".) Roman art and literature were calqued upon Hellenistic models.\n\nKoine Greek remained the dominant language in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, extending into the Byzantine Empire as Byzantine Greek. In the city of Rome, Koine Greek was in widespread use among ordinary people, and the elite spoke and wrote Greek as fluently as Latin. Jewish Koine Greek did not exist as a separate dialect, but some Jewish texts in Koine Greek do show the influence of Aramaic in syntax and the influence of Biblical background in vocabulary.\n\nAfter the Babylonian captivity, Aramaic replaced Biblical Hebrew as the everyday language in Palestine. The two languages were as similar as two Romance languages or two Germanic languages today. Thus Biblical Hebrew, which was still used for religious purposes, was not totally unfamiliar, but still a somewhat strange norm that demanded a certain degree of training to be understood properly.\n\nAfter Alexander, Palestine was ruled by the Ptolemies and the Seleucids for almost two hundred years. Jewish culture was heavily influenced by Hellenistic culture, and Koine Greek was used not only for international communication, but also as the first language of many Jews. This development was furthered by the fact that the largest Jewish community of the world lived in Ptolemaic Alexandria. Many of these diaspora Jews would have Greek as their first language, and first the Torah and then other Jewish scriptures (later the Christian \"Old Testament\") were therefore translated into standard Koine Greek, i.e. the Septuagint.\n\nCurrently, 1,600 Jewish epitaphs (funerary inscriptions) are extant from ancient Palestine dating from 300 B.C. to 500 A.D. Approximately 70 percent are in Greek, about 12 percent are in Latin, and only 18 percent are in Hebrew or Aramaic. \"In Jerusalem itself about 40 percent of the Jewish inscriptions from the first century period (before 70 C.E.) are in Greek. We may assume that most Jewish Jerusalemites who saw the inscriptions in situ were able to read them\".\n\nMost biblical scholars adhere to the view that the Greek text of the New Testament is the original version. However, there does exist an alternative view which maintains that it is a translation from an Aramaic original, a position known as Peshitta Primacy (also known in primarily non-scholarly circles as \"Aramaic primacy\"). Although this view has its adherents, the vast majority of scholars dispute this position citing linguistic, historical, and textual inconsistencies. At any rate, since most of the texts are written by diaspora Jews such as Paul the Apostle and his possibly Gentile companion, Luke, and to a large extent addressed directly to Christian communities in Greek-speaking cities (often communities consisting largely of Paul's converts, which appear to have been non-Jewish in the majority), and since the style of their Greek is impeccable, a Greek original is more probable than a translation.\n\nEven Mark, whose Greek is heavily influenced by his Semitic substratum, seems to presuppose a non-Hebrew audience. Thus, he explains Jewish customs (e.g. , see also Mark 7), and he translates Aramaic phrases into Greek (: \"boanerges\"; : \"talitha kum\"; : \"ephphatha\"; : \"abba\"; : \"Golgotha\"; , see also Aramaic of Jesus and Sayings of Jesus on the cross). In the Aramaic Syriac version of the Bible, these translations are preserved, resulting in odd texts like Mark 15:34:\n\n\nIn the Peshitta:\n\nThe languages spoken in Galilee and Judea during the first century include the Semitic Aramaic and Hebrew languages as well as Greek, with Aramaic being the predominant language. Most scholars agree that during the early part of first century Aramaic was the mother tongue of virtually all natives of Galilee and Judea. Most scholars support the theory that Jesus spoke Aramaic and that he may have also spoken Hebrew and Greek. Stanley E. Porter concluded: \"The linguistic environment of Roman Palestine during the first century was much more complex, and allows for the possibility that Jesus himself may well have spoken Greek on occasion.\"\n\nCritics of the mainstream consensus in favour of Greek being the original language of the New Testament claim logical improbabilities in the Greek Text compared to the Syriac/Hebrew Texts and vocabulary containing wordplay in the Syriac/Hebrew New Testament texts that parallels Hebraic wordplay in the Old Testament. These arguments are rejected by the academic mainstream.\n"}

Cultural immersion in the West by figures such as Hu Shi and Feng Youlan led to an increased interest in a Chinese philosophy and stimulated the creation of this field which had not yet been labeled nor discussed as such until this point. Feng Youlan made sure to make the distinction between \"Zhongguo de zhexue\" [any philosophical activity pursued in China] and \"Zhongguo di zhexue\" [indigenous philosophy from Chinese soil]. The debates over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy primarily concern the indigenous philosophy of China. They range in their central focus: whether the discipline of “philosophy” existed in traditional Chinese thought; whether the subjects and issues involved in the discipline existed in Chinese thought; and whether the now established discipline of Chinese philosophy can be truly be considered Chinese. These contentions have led to larger questions about the nature of philosophy and its discipline.\n\nThe discipline of philosophy did not enter China until the 19th century. Nishi Amane, a Japanese scholar, first translated the term “philosophy” into Chinese as \"zhexue\" (wisdom learning) in 1873. Though he originally coined this term solely to refer to the concept of Western Philosophy, he argued that the nature of the discipline of philosophy was in a constant flux, thus creating an opening for the realm of Chinese philosophy. After the Western infusion at the turn of the 20th century, an emulation of the Western educational system and its way of categorization spread through China. While ancient Chinese education had been based on ethical education, after the Opium War the educational system was considered an obstruction in the realization of Chinese potential. The \"Dao tong\" (Confucian orthodoxy) was refashioned into the “history of Chinese philosophy,” effectively objectivizing a concept meant to be lived. The Chinese philosophy of the past included classical learning (jinxue), the learning of the ancient masters (zhuzixue) speculative learning (xuanxue), Buddhist learning, and learning of principle (lixue). While all these branches share common elements with Western philosophy, it was definitively decided that these were not philosophy in their original state. Hence, there was the subsequent distillation by later scholars using Western notions to form a history of Chinese philosophy.\n\nThe Rules for Colleges and Universities in 1903 divided academic subjects into disciplines, with classics as one of these disciplines; by 1913, classical studies was dropped, diminishing its former significance. There were no divisions of scholarship based on the nature of knowledge in China prior to Western importation. By 1914, Beijing University created a Division of Chinese Philosophy and in 1919, Cai Yuanpei, the new president, changed the name to the Department of Philosophy. This marked the start of the new academic discipline of Chinese Philosophy.\n\nChinese philosophy developed under the paradigm of Western philosophy, rather than the other way around, because of the prevalent view in the early twentieth century of the superiority of Western culture. With advanced military, technology, and a wider dissemination of culture, Western systems of knowledge attained a “universal” quality that relegated Chinese paradigms as “local particularities.” Yet because any global contact will most likely stimulate change, the transformation of traditional Chinese academics can be seen as both an imposition by the West, as well as a conscious choice by the Chinese to move towards a seemingly inevitable direction.\n\nThe lack of a formal system in traditional Chinese philosophy motivates the creation of a “systemic overcoat.” There is no historical narrative in Chinese philosophy similar to the one that exists in Western philosophy. The material studied under the discipline of Chinese philosophy had been sifted in the early 20th century from the paradigms of classics, poetry, masters, and collected writings to create this field. The academic philosophical model that is applied now to this discipline appeared only after Hu Shi’s Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy and Feng Youlan’s History of Chinese Philosophy. Both Feng Youlan and Hu Shi comprehended the lack of narrative in Chinese thought and thus proceeded to create a categorization that mirrored that of the Western paradigm. However, by preformatting the outline and selectively choosing material that fit, they presented a warped version of the original. An accurate understanding of these texts is impossible because the original context has become obscured. The overcoat may express the concepts of Western philosophy that are present in Chinese thought, but in the process it causes an abstraction from the reality these concepts were couched in originally.\n\nSome argue that Chinese thought cannot be translated into Western jargon, when the philosophical method of the West is used to interpret the non-philosophical texts of China. There are systematic differences in expression between Eastern thought and Western philosophy that prevent comparisons between the two. Some scholars would rather prefer the use of only terminology native to Chinese philosophy to research the history of Chinese philosophy, but others object on the basis of academic diversification. Moreover, the explanation of Chinese philosophy with Chinese terms excludes those without a highly specialized and advanced education in this field. The use of Western terminology allows for a facilitated and more widespread understanding of Chinese philosophy. Still, the danger remains that the continued use of Western discourse will suppress the voices of Chinese scholars and allow the West to retain its dominant position over the East.\n\nZhang Dainian argues that the overcoat does not harm the inner content; that the cleavage does not destroy the content. Although there are concepts and principles in Chinese philosophy that do not come up in Western philosophy (and vice versa), until there can be a definitive interpretation of the text, a systematic overcoat cannot really be said to confuse the material.\n\nThe early pioneers of the field of Chinese philosophy (Fu Sinian, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Taiyan, Hu Shi) acknowledged the distinctive origin of Chinese thought as \"dao shu\" [Dao craft] and its implicit difference from Western philosophy. Yet, they also conceded that at that point in time, the Western mode of thought was the only method to convey Chinese philosophy. Along the same vein, a few decades prior to Fu Sinian and Hu Shi's studies there were similar ideas forming in Japan, particularly among the intellectual society known as the Meiji Six Society, as they attempted to introduce Western philosophy to Japan in order to bridge the intellectual gap between the East and the West.\n\nNow, modern philosophical scholars when referencing these ancient texts in their own work, reconstruct these studies and create a logical system that do not retain the spirit of these works. There is a dispute over whether the retention of the traditional Chinese spirit is necessary for the label of Chinese philosophy.\n\nEven modern Western philosophers are in stark contrast with ancient Greek philosophers, demonstrating the nonexistence of a universal philosophy. The two forms of contemporary philosophy are analytical philosophy and phenomenology, both of which differ greatly from traditional Western philosophy. The modern logical reasoning system of Western philosophy renders it closer to the sciences, while Chinese philosophy stems from history and can be considered a religion.\n\nScholars whose studies involve an examination of Western philosophy have concluded that the presence of ontology is what makes Western philosophy distinct. However, ontology is not present in traditional Chinese philosophy, which again brings up the issue of whether to the term “philosophy” is appropriate.\n\nIn attempts for inclusion into the field of philosophy, scholars such as Feng Youlan emphasized certain aspects of classical texts that aligned with Western concepts. Though at least highlighting some shared ideas, these interpretations presented a skewed perspective of classical texts for they did not stay faithful in presenting the true significance of the works. Rather than creating a philosophical model that reflects the Chinese spirit, what has been created is an exaltation of the Western model by imitation.\n\nThe creation of Chinese philosophy can also be seen as a response to the oppressive West. By establishing an independent discipline with a history just as long as the Western version, Chinese scholars hoped to challenge the domination of the West in this field, as well as stimulate national pride.\n\nA rejection of the term Chinese philosophy is a rejection of European ethnocentrism. The West has structured the subject, cultural identity, and history of the Third World in a way that forces the Third World to be submissive for they cannot express their subjective experience on their own terms. Instead of advocating a complete overthrow of Western philosophy and its corresponding models, the proposal is to incorporate the Western theories that have already infiltrated the culture and meld them with the national position. While “Western hegemony” per se may be deposed of, Western discourse cannot also go, for it allows the means for the expression and research of philosophy.\n\nPhilosophy itself does not mean just thought; the word is linked to a European history that makes it specific to the West. This is not to say that Eastern thought does not have an equal value to Western thought, but that the label of philosophy can only be assigned beyond this Western European realm.\n\nHowever, Jing Haifeng argues that this is a rather narrow view of philosophy. Rather, he insists that the development of Western philosophy into China and its subsequent tumultuous transformation created a new discipline that, while unique from indigenous learning, still counts as philosophy.\n\nThere has never been a complete consensus of the definition of “philosophy.” If there is to be an argument for a solely Western connotation of philosophy, then the concept of philosophy should be widened to include Chinese thought. However, this sacrifices a conscious definition of what is and what is not philosophy. Those in favor of this prospect refer to the extension of the definition of religion by Western theologians to include Eastern religions. Philosophical models have varied from individuals and civilizations for all of history. Recognition of a pluralistic world culture by both Eastern and Western is necessary for a broader definition of philosophy.\n\nSome argue that Chinese philosophy and Western philosophy have evolved independently and are equally as legitimate. This view escapes the frame of the supreme Western philosophic model and proposes the question of what is philosophy. Western philosophy has the essential component of ontology and developed in that direction. Similarly, Chinese philosophy centers on self-cultivation and thus developed towards \"ren\" [benevolence] in self-conduct.\n\nWestern missionaries in the 17th century called Confucius a philosopher. The works of the ancient masters resemble premodern/ancient Western philosophy more so than post-Kantian thought, which could be considered a link to philosophy.\n\nThe topics discussed in ancient Chinese thought are universal in philosophy, the term used generally. The term “philosophy,” itself, may not have existed, but the same subject matters were discussed. These include topics such as humanity, human nature, and principle. Deep reflections of life manifest in a multitude of cultures. Mou Zongsan used the concept of the particular and universal in explaining the compatibility of Chinese and Western philosophy: each views the world through their own narrow aperture, but through this aperture, each can attain the truth.\n\nWestern disciplines come from universals extracted from studies of individual phenomena and then condensed into systems of knowledge. Though the Chinese did not develop thought to this extent, it can be said that the subjects of these disciplines still existed in Chinese thought. While the strict, regulated Western mode of thinking called logic was not to be found in China, there was still a form of thinking.\n\nThe search for wisdom has been prevalent in both ancient Greek and ancient Chinese texts. Socrates thought of philosophy as a lifestyle search for wisdom. Rather than a form of academic thought, philosophy meant a path towards truth and wisdom. Despite the differences in methodology, both the ancient Greeks and ancient Chinese discussed the same topics. The subject of philosophy has been a tradition for both. Hence, the West cannot be said to have an exclusive hold on the term. Philosophy has existed for the Chinese in the Aristotelian sense. These pre-Socratic philosophers bear a resemblance to the ancient Chinese philosophers known as sages.\n\nThe ancient Chinese masters’ studies were inherently connected to a way of life. Using Socrates and Plato's definition of philosophy as universal knowledge, it follows that if all people must deal with the issue how to conduct themselves, this should be a philosophical issue.\n\nMoreover, in order to assert the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy, many Chinese scholars have argued that it is more than just an ethics-based philosophy. They claim that it contains a metaphysical nature and is both transcendental and immanent. However, the religious nature of this argument has caused sharp criticism from Western sinologists.\n\nThe recent flare up of the debates over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy has been brought upon by a variety of issues. First, there is the lack of recognition from Western colleagues of the legitimacy of this field. Moreover, there is disagreement over appropriate uses of methodology and terminology. The main concern is how scholars can narrate the history of Chinese philosophy in a manner that allows for comprehensive understanding of the topics touched upon. For at the moment, the Western systematic overcoat creates a Chinese history of philosophy that seems incomplete due to the lack of total overlap between China and the West.\n\nIn addition, there is disagreement over the quality of contemporary research on ancient Chinese thought. Yu Wujin noted especially a lack of knowledge of both philosophy and classical Chinese texts, lack of perspective, weak abstract thinking, in addition to copying and plagiarizing.\n\nIt is important to note that most do not see these debates over the value of Chinese philosophy, but rather its future.\n\nTo interpret Chinese thought as philosophy requires a complete understanding of both fields of Eastern and Western thought. Those who have undertaken this interpretation have been trained in a (Western) philosophical discourse that underlies any study of Chinese thought and directs these studies in a corresponding philosophical manner. Their conclusion has been that philosophical models are not compatible with Chinese models of thought. However, since these scholars themselves have been immersed in the philosophical model, objective evaluation between the two fields becomes impossible. There can be no impartial evaluation because these discussions must stand outside the realm of both philosophy and Chinese thought.\n\nThe focus on the methodologies of interpretation rather than the actual text blocks the more significant matter of whether the original material itself can be considered philosophy. A rejection of the concept of “Chinese philosophy” does not answer this question. However, it does help shape the direction for the future of Chinese thought. The acceptance of Chinese thought as a philosophy will only occur if this new field can deepen understanding of fundamental philosophical problems outside of its cultural context.\n\nAs a result of this debate, it has been suggested that the legitimacy of Western philosophy must also be considered anew. It is only logical that if there is an examination of Chinese thought by the standards of Western philosophy, there must be a reciprocal examination as well. However, just as the argument goes that Chinese thought cannot be made to fit to the standards of Western philosophy, the reverse is as true.\n\nAnother solution proposed is the introduction of more methodologies in order to have more philosophical interpretations to replace the uniform approaches of the 20th century. Since Chinese and Western philosophies are different forms of philosophy, it follows that the two should have distinct forms of expression. However, China has not had one solitary mode of expression through its history of philosophy. There has been a range in the subjects discussed and the means of discussion. Therein lies a primary difference of Chinese philosophy: its value does not lie in the organization of its thinking, but rather whether it can answer significantly the issues of the times.\n\nA history of Chinese philosophy may as well coexist alongside a history of Chinese thought. While Chinese philosophy would remain the particular Chinese ideas that coincide with Western philosophies, Chinese thought would retain the wider spectrum of general knowledge, thoughts, and beliefs that are more applicable in a societal setting and which are included in classical Chinese texts.\n\nA return to the traditional form of Chinese learning seems implausible at this time, as Chinese universities have divided their disciplines in the same manner as the West; as a result, philosophic thinking will most likely follow in the Western direction. In addition, a complete rejection of the term “philosophy” concerning Chinese thought would isolate this field from Western contemporaries making it irrelevant. Instead, much emphasis has been placed on the special nature of Chinese philosophy in an attempt to highlight the inherent differences.\n\nAnother solution is to consider all research done thus far on the history of Chinese philosophy as comparative research. Such studies are beneficial in that they allow new perspectives and reveal the unique characteristics of each type of philosophy. Yu Xuanmeng advocates a new structure for comparative study between Western and Chinese philosophy that grants them both the presence of transcendence, though through different means. The Western definition of transcendental means a property-transcending-experience. He reasons that the extension of life in time – that is, the conscious choices made by man of how to involve himself with the world after he examines himself – is also a type of transcendence.\n\nThe argument over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy and the use of the term should not be of higher priority than an extensive study of traditional Chinese thought for the knowledge and understanding of how to solve contemporary societal issues in a global community.\n\n"}

It is common in both politics and public relations.\n\nSaying \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" to someone who has been offended by a statement is a non-apology apology. It does not admit there was anything wrong with the remarks made, and may imply the person took offense for hypersensitive or irrational reasons. Another form of non-apology does not apologize directly to the injured or insulted party, but generically \"to anyone who might have been offended\".\n\nStatements that use the word \"sorry\" but do not express responsibility for wrongdoing may be meaningful expressions of regret, but such statements can also be used to elicit forgiveness without acknowledging fault.\n\nNon-apology apologizers may be trying to avoid litigation that might result from an admission of guilt or responsibility. Many states, including Massachusetts and California, have laws to prevent a plaintiff from using an apology as evidence of liability. For example, a medical doctor may apologize to a patient for a bad outcome without fearing the apology can be used against them at trial as evidence of negligence.\n\nIn November 2008, the Alberta legislature passed an amendment to the existing Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-18, geared at protecting apologizing parties from risks of legal liability and loss of insurance coverage. Section 26.1 of the Act provides that an apology does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability.\n\nThe expression \"mistakes were made\" is commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges a situation was handled poorly or inappropriately but seeks to evade any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by using the passive voice. The acknowledgement of \"mistakes\" is framed in an abstract sense with no direct reference to \"who\" made the mistakes. An active voice construction would be along the lines of \"I made mistakes\" or \"John Doe made mistakes.\" The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word \"mistakes\" also does not imply intent.\n\n\"The New York Times\" has called the phrase a \"classic Washington linguistic construct\". Political consultant William Schneider suggested this usage be referred to as the \"past exonerative\" tense, and commentator William Safire has defined the phrase as \"[a] passive-evasive way of acknowledging error while distancing the speaker from responsibility for it\". A commentator at NPR declared this expression to be \"the king of non-apologies\". While perhaps most famous in politics, the phrase has also been used in business, sports, and entertainment.\n\nAttorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of \"The Art of the Apology\", mentions the \"if apology\" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as \"I apologize if I offended anyone\". Comedian Harry Shearer has coined the term Ifpology for its frequent appearances on \"The Apologies of the Week\" segment of \"Le Show\".\n\nOne of the first references was in the \"New York Times\" by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook \"If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize And Admit Nothing\". This was mainly in regard to Senator Bob Packwood: \"Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry\". Mooney goes on to cite Bill Clinton, who said of Mario Cuomo: \"If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it.\" A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer Fuzzy Zoeller about Tiger Woods; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with K-Mart. According to John Kador in \"Effective Apology\", \"Adding the word \"if\" or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology.\"\n\nA 2014 ifpology was made by \"CNN\"s Don Lemon, who said, \"If my question to her struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention.\" This was in reference to his interview with Joan Tarshis where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.\n\nOn September 16, 2015, Matt Damon made what \"Salon\" termed a \"non-apology\" apology when he said, \"I am sorry that they [his comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.\" This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer Effie Brown on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show \"Project Greenlight\" that were criticized as condescending.\n\nOn July 24, 1991, \"The New York Times\" reported Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans had offered the prime minister of Malaysia \"what might best be described as a non-apology apology\" for what the Malaysian government regarded as an insulting portrayal of Malaysia in an Australian television series, \"Embassy\". Speaking to journalists, Mr Evans said he had \"wanted to acknowledge fault where such acknowledgment is appropriate\".\n\nHumorist Bruce McCall, in a 2001 \"New York Times\" piece entitled \"The Perfect Non-apology Apology\", defined the term as referring to \"sufficiently artful double talk\" designed to enable one to \"get what you want by seeming to express regret while actually accepting no blame,\" and suggested some tongue-in-cheek apologies, such as:\n\nTypologies of apology note they cover a range of situations and degrees of regret, remorse, and contrition, and that success is to be gauged by the result of the apology rather than the degree of contrition involved. Deborah Levi offers the following possibilities:\n\n\nWhile the non-apology apology is clearly unsuited to situations where an expression of remorse, contrition, and future change are obviously desirable (e.g. the \"happy ending\" apology), it may prove extremely useful in situations where little can be done to assuage the apparent offence or prevent its repetition, as when an airline apologises for a delay, in the full knowledge that a future repetition is inevitable. Such tactical apologies may have beneficial effects simply through the validation of the emotions of the offended party: they answer the basic human need for disagreeable emotions to be recognised and acknowledged as important, while protecting the apparently offending party from an expression of remorse. Negotiators often use this tactic to calm tense situations: \"an apology can defuse emotions effectively, even when you do not acknowledge personal responsibility for the action or admit an intention to harm. An apology may be one of the least costly and most rewarding investments you can make.\"\n\n"}

He was President of the American Philosophical Association (Central Division) in 1992-93, and has served as editor of the \"Journal of Philosophical Research.\"\n\nButchvarov has made major, systematic contributions to contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. His books include \"Resemblance and Identity: An Examination of the Problem of Universals\" (Indiana University Press, 1966), \"The Concept of Knowledge\" (Northwestern University Press, 1970), \"Being Qua Being: A Theory of Identity, Existence and Predication\" (Indiana University Press, 1979), \"Skepticism in Ethics\" (Indiana University Press, 1989), \"Skepticism about the External World\" (Oxford University Press, 1998), and \"Anthropocentrism in Philosophy\" (de Gruyter, 2015). Some of his writings can be found on http://myweb.uiowa.edu/butchvar/ and, more reliably, http://butchvarov.yolasite.com/.\n\nIn metaphysics, Butchvarov is perhaps best known for his work on the identity theory of universals and on the nature of informative identity statements (that is, statements of the form \"a=b\"—as opposed to instances of the law of identity, that is, statements of the form \"a=a\"). In epistemology, he argues for the view that knowledge is the absolute impossibility of mistake. In ethics, his central metaethical thesis is that a realist account of goodness is defensible if goodness is seen as a generic property.\n\nButchvarov may be said to have been influenced by philosophers as varied as Plato, Kant, Hegel, and Wittgenstein. The latter's influence can perhaps best be seen in Butchvarov's metaphilosophical Method of Analogy for which he argued in \"The Limits of Ontological Analysis\" (in M. S. Gram and E. D. Klemke (eds.), \"The Ontological Turn: Studies in the Philosophy of Gustav Bergmann\" (University of Iowa Press, 1974)). He claims that understanding is most often a matter of coming to see what something is \"like\", seeing what it literally \"is\" being a limiting case, and that it is the noticing, discovery, and grasping of similarities and differences that is the core intellectual achievement in our understanding of the world.\n\nIn his most recent work, Butchvarov argues that anthropocentrism in philosophy, though common, is deeply paradoxical. Ethics investigates the human good (including happiness and pleasure), epistemology investigates human knowledge (including perception and conceptualization), and antirealist metaphysics holds that the world depends on our cognitive capacities. But humans' good and knowledge, including their language and concepts, are empirical matters, properly investigated by empirical sciences, not armchair philosophy. And humans are inhabitants, not \"makers,\" of the world. Nevertheless, all three – ethics, epistemology, and antirealist metaphysics – can be reinterpreted as making no reference to humans. Ethics would be confined to the metaphysics of the generic property goodness, epistemology to the appraisal of basic nonformal inferences, and antirealism to the logical structure of the world.\n\nButchvarov's latest papers are \"Commonsense Political Philosophy\" and \"Afterlife,\" both available at http://butchvarov.yolasite.com.\n\n\n\n"}

From 1996 until 2014, he was the Louis D. Rubin, Jr. Distinguished Professor of physics and astronomy, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nBorn in Kidderminster, England, Frampton attended King Charles I School, 1954–62 and then Brasenose College, Oxford, 1962–68. He received BA (Double First) in 1965, MA, DPhil in 1968, and DSc in 1984, degrees from Oxford. \n\nHe is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1990) and the American Physical Society (1981). In 1987 he was the project director for siting the Superconducting Supercollider, in North Carolina. A Festschrift for his 60th birthday has been published.\n\nHis DPhil thesis analyzed the relationship between current algebra and superconvergence sum rules, and contained a 1967 sum rule. In 1970, he analyzed the absence of ghosts in the dual resonance model.\n\nThree examples of his model building are the chiral color model, in 1987, which predicts axigluons; the 331 model, in 1992, which can explain the number of quark-lepton generations, and predicts bileptons; his proposal, in 1995, of the binary tetrahedral group as a flavor symmetry. All three serve as targets of opportunity for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In 2002, he built a model relating\nmatter–antimatter asymmetry in the early universe to measurements possible on Earth. In 2015, he showed that the 331-model predicts long-lived quarks accessible to Run 2 of the LHC.\nIn formal directions, three examples are that he calculated, in 1976, the rate of vacuum decay in quantum field theory; in 1982, he analyzed ten-dimensional gauge field theory, and its hexagon anomaly, precursor to the first superstring revolution; in 1988, he constructed the Lagrangian which describes the dynamics of the p-adic string.\nFor cosmology, two examples are, in 2007, he built a cyclic model which can solve a 75-year-old entropy problem; in 2010, he discussed how dark energy may be better understood by studying temperature and entropy. In 2015, he demonstrated how cyclic entropy can lead to\nflat geometry without an inflationary era and estimated the time until contraction to be close to one hundred times the present age of the universe. In 2015 he also proposed a novel theory of dark matter, where the dark matter constituents are primordial black holes with many solar masses.\n\nIn November 2012, Frampton was convicted of drug smuggling in Argentina and was sentenced to four years and eight months in detention. He denied the charges and said that he was a victim of a scam wherein an impostor of an internationally known model on a dating website tricked him into transporting two kilos of cocaine hidden in the liner fabric of a suitcase. \n\nThe prosecutor presented what he said were text messages, handwritten notes and emails sent by Frampton discussing the suitcase, the drugs, and their street value. Frampton's statements that the prosecutor's evidence was laughable, were translated in court as suggesting that the messages themselves had been intended as jokes. A forensic psychologist diagnosed Frampton with schizoid personality disorder, which Frampton's attorneys argued rendered him to deliver poor judgment in practical matters and increased his gullibility. \n\nSoon after his arrest, his pay was stopped and he was placed on personal leave. The move was widely criticized by the academic community.\n\nHe was fired from his UNC post in 2014. On June 16, 2015 an appeals court in North Carolina unanimously ruled that his university violated its own policies by placing Frampton on unpaid leave while he awaited trial, and ordered the university to restore Frampton's back salary and benefits. Frampton's account of these events was published in 2014.\n\nFrampton's first publication was \"Chirality Commutator and Vector Mesons\", in 1967. He has published numerous articles on particle phenomenology. He was the author of a book on string theory, in 1974 (2nd edition1986), when it was still named the dual resonance model.

{"id": "22926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22926", "title": "Poetry", "text": "Poetry\n\nPoetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \"poiesis\", \"making\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.\n\nPoetry has a long history, dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa, and panegyric and elegiac court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys . Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE, while the Epic of Sundiata is one of the most well-known examples of griot court poetry. The earliest Western Asian epic poetry, the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", was written in Sumerian. Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese \"Shijing\", or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit \"Vedas\", Zoroastrian \"Gathas\", and the Homeric epics, the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\". Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's \"Poetics\", focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, prosaic forms of writing.\n\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\n\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.\n\nSome scholars believe that the art of poetry may predate literacy. Others, however, suggest that poetry did not necessarily predate writing.\n\nThe oldest surviving epic poem, the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", comes from the 3rd millenniumBCE in Sumer (in Mesopotamia, now Iraq), and was written in cuneiform script on clay tablets and, later, on papyrus. A tablet dating to c.2000BCE describes an annual rite in which the king symbolically married and mated with the goddess Inanna to ensure fertility and prosperity; it is considered the world's oldest love poem. An example of Egyptian epic poetry is \"The Story of Sinuhe\" (c. 1800 BCE).\nOther ancient epic poetry includes the Greek epics, the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\"; the Avestan books, the \"Gathic Avesta\" and the \"Yasna\"; the Roman national epic, Virgil's \"Aeneid\"; and the Indian epics, the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\". Epic poetry, including the \"Odyssey\", the \"Gathas\", and the Indian \"Vedas\", appears to have been composed in poetic form as an aid to memorization and oral transmission, in prehistoric and ancient societies.\n\nOther forms of poetry developed directly from folk songs. The earliest entries in the oldest extant collection of Chinese poetry, the \"Shijing\", were initially lyrics.\n\nThe efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form, and what distinguishes good poetry from bad, resulted in \"poetics\"—the study of the aesthetics of poetry. Some ancient societies, such as China's through her \"Shijing\" (\"Classic of Poetry\"), developed canons of poetic works that had ritual as well as aesthetic importance. More recently, thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" and Matsuo Bashō's \"Oku no Hosomichi\", as well as differences in content spanning Tanakh religious poetry, love poetry, and rap.\n\nClassical thinkers employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.\n\nAristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, as well as in Europe during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.\n\nThis does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought process. English Romantic poet John Keats termed this escape from logic \"Negative Capability\". This \"romantic\" approach views form as a key element of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic. This approach remained influential into the 20th century.\n\nDuring this period, there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part due to the spread of European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade. In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.\n\nSome 20th-century literary theorists, relying less on the opposition of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates. The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between the creation of a poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.\n\nThe rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.\n\nRecently, postmodernism has come to convey more completely prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.\n\nThe early 21st century poetic tradition appears to continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic traditions such as those initiated by Whitman, Emerson, and Wordsworth. The literary critic Geoffrey Hartman has used the phrase \"the anxiety of demand\" to describe contemporary response to older poetic traditions as \"being fearful that the fact no longer has a form\", building on a trope introduced by Emerson. Emerson had maintained that in the debate concerning poetic structure where either \"form\" or \"fact\" could predominate, that one need simply \"Ask the fact for the form.\" This has been challenged at various levels by other literary scholars such as Bloom who has stated in summary form concerning the early 21st century that: \"The generation of poets who stand together now, mature and ready to write the major American verse of the twenty-first century, may yet be seen as what Stevens called 'a great shadow's last embellishment,' the shadow being Emerson's.\"\n\nProsody is the study of the meter, rhythm, and intonation of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.\n\nThe methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by accents, syllables, or moras, depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. Japanese is a mora-timed language. Latin, Catalan, French, Leonese, Galician and Spanish are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include English, Russian and, generally, German. Varying intonation also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages.\n\nMetrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.\n\nThe chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was \"parallelism\", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm.\n\nClassical Chinese poetics, based on the tone system of Middle Chinese, recognized two kinds of tones: the level (平 \"píng\") tone and the oblique (仄 \"zè\") tones, a category consisting of the rising (上 \"sháng\") tone, the departing (去 \"qù\") tone and the entering (入 \"rù\") tone. Certain forms of poetry placed contraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.\n\nThe formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of free verse, rhythm is often organized based on looser units of cadence rather than a regular meter. Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry. Jeffers experimented with sprung rhythm as an alternative to accentual rhythm.\n\nIn the Western poetic tradition, meters are customarily grouped according to a characteristic metrical foot and the number of feet per line. The number of metrical feet in a line are described using Greek terminology: tetrameter for four feet and hexameter for six feet, for example. Thus, \"iambic pentameter\" is a meter comprising five feet per line, in which the predominant kind of foot is the \"iamb\". This metric system originated in ancient Greek poetry, and was used by poets such as Pindar and Sappho, and by the great tragedians of Athens. Similarly, \"dactylic hexameter\", comprises six feet per line, of which the dominant kind of foot is the \"dactyl\". Dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter of Greek epic poetry, the earliest extant examples of which are the works of Homer and Hesiod. Iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used by a number of poets, including William Shakespeare and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, respectively. The most common metrical feet in English are:\n\n\nThere are a wide range of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four syllable metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.\n\nEach of these types of feet has a certain \"feel,\" whether alone or in combination with other feet. The iamb, for example, is the most natural form of rhythm in the English language, and generally produces a subtle but stable verse. Scanning meter can often show the basic or fundamental pattern underlying a verse, but does not show the varying degrees of stress, as well as the differing pitches and lengths of syllables.\n\nThere is debate over how useful a multiplicity of different \"feet\" is in describing meter. For example, Robert Pinsky has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse, English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests, feet which he considers natural to the language. Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity. Vladimir Nabokov noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term \"scud\" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.\n\nDifferent traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.\n\nSome common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:\n\nRhyme, alliteration, assonance and consonance are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element. They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, Chaucer used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.\n\nRhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"internal rhyme\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.\n\nAssonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but goes back to the Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.\n\nIn many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.\n\nMost rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line does not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"a-a-b-a\" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form. Similarly, an \"a-b-b-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"enclosed rhyme\") is used in such forms as the Petrarchan sonnet. Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-b-c\" convention, such as the ottava rima and terza rima. The types and use of differing rhyming schemes is discussed further in the main article.\n\nPoetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry, and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.\n\nAmong major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse paragraph, and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and calligraphy. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called \"poetic forms\" or poetic modes (see following section), as in the sonnet or haiku.\n\nPoetry is often separated into lines on a page. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.\n\nLines of poems are often organized into stanzas, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.\n\nOther poems may be organized into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form. Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.\n\nIn many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.\n\nIn some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In skaldic poetry, the dróttkvætt stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dróttkvætts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dróttkvætts.\n\nEven before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.\n\nWith the advent of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.\n\nPoetic diction treats the manner in which language is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form. Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.\n\nPoetic diction can include rhetorical devices such as simile and metaphor, as well as tones of voice, such as irony. Aristotle wrote in the \"Poetics\" that \"the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor.\" Since the rise of Modernism, some poets have opted for a poetic diction that de-emphasizes rhetorical devices, attempting instead the direct presentation of things and experiences and the exploration of tone. On the other hand, Surrealists have pushed rhetorical devices to their limits, making frequent use of catachresis.\n\nAllegorical stories are central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were prominent in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. \"Aesop's Fables\", repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 BCE, are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages. Other notables examples include the \"Roman de la Rose\", a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's \"Piers Ploughman\" in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's \"Fables\" (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.\n\nAnother element of poetic diction can be the use of vivid imagery for effect. The juxtaposition of unexpected or impossible images is, for example, a particularly strong element in surrealist poetry and haiku. Vivid images are often endowed with symbolism or metaphor. Many poetic dictions use repetitive phrases for effect, either a short phrase (such as Homer's \"rosy-fingered dawn\" or \"the wine-dark sea\") or a longer refrain. Such repetition can add a sombre tone to a poem, or can be laced with irony as the context of the words changes.\n\nSpecific poetic forms have been developed by many cultures. In more developed, closed or \"received\" poetic forms, the rhyming scheme, meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules, ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an elegy to the highly formalized structure of the ghazal or villanelle. Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages. Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the glossary.\n\nAmong the most common forms of poetry, popular from the Late Middle Ages on, is the sonnet, which by the 13th century had become standardized as fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure. By the 14th century and the Italian Renaissance, the form had further crystallized under the pen of Petrarch, whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by Sir Thomas Wyatt, who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature. A traditional Italian or Petrarchan sonnet follows the rhyme scheme \"ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE\", though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or \"sestet\"), is common. The English (or Shakespearean) sonnet follows the rhyme scheme \"ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG\", introducing a third quatrain (grouping of four lines), a final couplet, and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use iambic pentameter, while in the Romance languages, the hendecasyllable and Alexandrine are the most widely used meters.\n\nSonnets of all types often make use of a \"volta\", or \"turn,\" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This \"volta\" can often take the form of a \"but\" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.\n\nSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as Edmund Spenser (who gave his name to the Spenserian sonnet), Michael Drayton, and Shakespeare, whose sonnets are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the \"Oxford Book of English Verse\". However, the twists and turns associated with the \"volta\" allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects. Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics (John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Claude McKay), theology (John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins), war (Wilfred Owen, e.e. cummings), and gender and sexuality (Carol Ann Duffy). Further, postmodern authors such as Ted Berrigan and John Berryman have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of \"sonnets\" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.\n\n\"Shi\" () Is the main type of Classical Chinese poetry. Within this form of poetry the most important variations are \"folk song\" styled verse (\"yuefu\"), \"old style\" verse (\"gushi\"), \"modern style\" verse (\"jintishi\"). In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of \"shi\" poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or \"jueju\") or else an eight line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a caesura before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device. The \"old style\" verse (\"gushi\") is less formally strict than the \"jintishi\", or regulated verse, which, despite the name \"new style\" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as Shen Yue (441–513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of Chen Zi'ang (661–702 CE). A good example of a poet known for his \"gushi\" poems is Li Bai (701–762 CE). Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the four tones of Middle Chinese. The basic form of jintishi (lushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of allusion, and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics. One of the masters of the form was Du Fu (712–770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).\n\nThe villanelle is a nineteen-line poem made up of five triplets with a closing quatrain; the poem is characterized by having two refrains, initially used in the first and third lines of the first stanza, and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain, which is concluded by the two refrains. The remaining lines of the poem have an a-b alternating rhyme. The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as Dylan Thomas, W.H. Auden, and Elizabeth Bishop.\n\nA limerick is a poem that consists of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm is very important in limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, the third and fourth lines only need five to seven. All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.\n\nTanka is a form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, with five sections totalling 31 \"onji\" (phonological units identical to morae), structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern. There is generally a shift in tone and subject matter between the upper 5-7-5 phrase and the lower 7-7 phrase. Tanka were written as early as the Asuka period by such poets as Kakinomoto no Hitomaro (\"fl.\" late 7th century), at a time when Japan was emerging from a period where much of its poetry followed Chinese form. Tanka was originally the shorter form of Japanese formal poetry (which was generally referred to as \"waka\"), and was used more heavily to explore personal rather than public themes. By the tenth century, tanka had become the dominant form of Japanese poetry, to the point where the originally general term \"waka\" (\"Japanese poetry\") came to be used exclusively for tanka. Tanka are still widely written today.\n\nHaiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, which evolved in the 17th century from the \"hokku\", or opening verse of a renku. Generally written in a single vertical line, the haiku contains three sections totalling 17 \"onji\", structured in a 5-7-5 pattern. Traditionally, haiku contain a kireji, or cutting word, usually placed at the end of one of the poem's three sections, and a kigo, or season-word. The most famous exponent of the haiku was Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694). An example of his writing:\n\nThe \"khlong\" (, ) is among the oldest Thai poetic forms. This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables, which must be marked with \"mai ek\" (, , ) or \"mai tho\" (, , ). This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones (as opposed to today's five, a split which occurred during the Ayutthaya Kingdom period), two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks. It is usually regarded as an advanced and sophisticated poetic form.\n\nIn \"khlong\", a stanza (\"bot\", , ) has a number of lines (\"bat\", , , from Pali and Sanskrit \"pāda\"), depending on the type. The \"bat\" are subdivided into two \"wak\" (, , from Sanskrit \"varga\"). The first \"wak\" has five syllables, the second has a variable number, also depending on the type, and may be optional. The type of \"khlong\" is named by the number of \"bat\" in a stanza; it may also be divided into two main types: \"khlong suphap\" (, ) and \"khlong dan\" (, ). The two differ in the number of syllables in the second \"wak\" of the final \"bat\" and inter-stanza rhyming rules.\n\nThe \"khlong si suphap\" (, ) is the most common form still currently employed. It has four \"bat\" per stanza (\"si\" translates as \"four\"). The first \"wak\" of each \"bat\" has five syllables. The second \"wak\" has two or four syllables in the first and third \"bat\", two syllables in the second, and four syllables in the fourth. \"Mai ek\" is required for seven syllables and \"Mai tho\" is required for four, as shown below. \"Dead word\" syllables are allowed in place of syllables which require \"mai ek\", and changing the spelling of words to satisfy the criteria is usually acceptable.\n\nOdes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace. Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins. The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode. Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.\n\nThe ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) is a form of poetry common in Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Bengali poetry. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a refrain at the end of the second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an identical meter. The ghazal often reflects on a theme of unattainable love or divinity.\n\nAs with other forms with a long history in many languages, many variations have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter and the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.\nOne of the most famous poet in this type of poetry is Hafez, whose poems often include the theme of exposing hypocrisy. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-fourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author. The West-östlicher Diwan of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a collection of lyrical poems, is inspired by the Persian poet Hafez.\n\nIn addition to specific forms of poems, poetry is often thought of in terms of different genres and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics. Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.\n\nNarrative poetry is a genre of poetry that tells a story. Broadly it subsumes epic poetry, but the term \"narrative poetry\" is often reserved for smaller works, generally with more appeal to human interest. Narrative poetry may be the oldest type of poetry. Many scholars of Homer have concluded that his \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" were composed from compilations of shorter narrative poems that related individual episodes. Much narrative poetry—such as Scottish and English ballads, and Baltic and Slavic heroic poems—is performance poetry with roots in a preliterate oral tradition. It has been speculated that some features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as meter, alliteration and kennings, once served as memory aids for bards who recited traditional tales.\n\nNotable narrative poets have included Ovid, Dante, Juan Ruiz, William Langland, Chaucer, Fernando de Rojas, Luís de Camões, Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Robert Burns, Adam Mickiewicz, Alexander Pushkin, Edgar Allan Poe, Alfred Tennyson, and Anne Carson.\n\nLyric poetry is a genre that, unlike epic and dramatic poetry, does not attempt to tell a story but instead is of a more personal nature. Poems in this genre tend to be shorter, melodic, and contemplative. Rather than depicting characters and actions, it portrays the poet's own feelings, states of mind, and perceptions. Notable poets in this genre include Christine de Pizan, John Donne, Charles Baudelaire, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Antonio Machado, and Edna St. Vincent Millay.\n\nEpic poetry is a genre of poetry, and a major form of narrative literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature to the culture of the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", Virgil's Aeneid, the \"Nibelungenlied\", Luís de Camões' \"Os Lusíadas\", the \"Cantar de Mio Cid\", the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the \"Mahabharata\", Valmiki's \"Ramayana\", Ferdowsi's \"Shahnama\", Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the \"Epic of King Gesar\". While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent on the basis of his epic, \"Omeros\".\n\nPoetry can be a powerful vehicle for satire. The Romans had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for political purposes. A notable example is the Roman poet Juvenal's satires.\n\nThe same is true of the English satirical tradition. John Dryden (a Tory), the first Poet Laureate, produced in 1682 \"Mac Flecknoe\", subtitled \"A Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S.\" (a reference to Thomas Shadwell). Another master of 17th-century English satirical poetry was John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester. Satirical poets outside England include Poland's Ignacy Krasicki, Azerbaijan's Sabir and Portugal's Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage.\n\nAn elegy is a mournful, melancholy or plaintive poem, especially a lament for the dead or a funeral song. The term \"elegy,\" which originally denoted a type of poetic meter (elegiac meter), commonly describes a poem of mourning. An elegy may also reflect something that seems to the author to be strange or mysterious. The elegy, as a reflection on a death, on a sorrow more generally, or on something mysterious, may be classified as a form of lyric poetry.\n\nNotable practitioners of elegiac poetry have included Propertius, Jorge Manrique, Jan Kochanowski, Chidiock Tichborne, Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, John Milton, Thomas Gray, Charlotte Turner Smith, William Cullen Bryant, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Evgeny Baratynsky, Alfred Tennyson, Walt Whitman, Antonio Machado, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Giannina Braschi, William Butler Yeats, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Virginia Woolf.\n\nThe fable is an ancient literary genre, often (though not invariably) set in verse. It is a succinct story that features anthropomorphized animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that illustrate a moral lesson (a \"moral\"). Verse fables have used a variety of meter and rhyme patterns.\n\nNotable verse fabulists have included Aesop, Vishnu Sarma, Phaedrus, Marie de France, Robert Henryson, Biernat of Lublin, Jean de La Fontaine, Ignacy Krasicki, Félix María de Samaniego, Tomás de Iriarte, Ivan Krylov and Ambrose Bierce.\n\nDramatic poetry is drama written in verse to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, sometimes related forms in many cultures. Greek tragedy in verse dates to the 6th century B.C., and may have been an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama, just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the \"bianwen\" verse dramas in China, forerunners of Chinese Opera. East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh. Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, \"Layla and Majnun\" and \"Khosrow and Shirin\", Ferdowsi's tragedies such as \"Rostam and Sohrab\", Rumi's \"Masnavi\", Gorgani's tragedy of \"Vis and Ramin\", and Vahshi's tragedy of \"Farhad\".\n\nSpeculative poetry, also known as fantastic poetry (of which weird or macabre poetry is a major sub-classification), is a poetic genre which deals thematically with subjects which are \"beyond reality\", whether via extrapolation as in science fiction or via weird and horrific themes as in horror fiction. Such poetry appears regularly in modern science fiction and horror fiction magazines. Edgar Allan Poe is sometimes seen as the \"father of speculative poetry\". Poe's most remarkable achievement in the genre was his anticipation, by three-quarters of a century, of the Big Bang theory of the universe's origin, in his then much-derided 1848 essay (which, due to its very speculative nature, he termed a \"prose poem\"), \"\".\n\nProse poetry is a hybrid genre that shows attributes of both prose and poetry. It may be indistinguishable from the micro-story ( the \"short short story\", \"flash fiction\"). While some examples of earlier prose strike modern readers as poetic, prose poetry is commonly regarded as having originated in 19th-century France, where its practitioners included Aloysius Bertrand, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé. Since the late 1980s especially, prose poetry has gained increasing popularity, with entire journals, such as \"The Prose Poem: An International Journal\", \"Contemporary Haibun Online\", and \"Haibun Today\" devoted to that genre and its hybrids. Latin American poets of the 20th century who wrote prose poems include Octavio Paz and Giannina Braschi\n\nLight poetry, or light verse, is poetry that attempts to be humorous. Poems considered \"light\" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature word play, including puns, adventurous rhyme and heavy alliteration. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English is usually formal. Common forms include the limerick, the clerihew, and the double dactyl.\n\nWhile light poetry is sometimes condemned as doggerel, or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned \"serious\" poets have also excelled at light verse. Notable writers of light poetry include Lewis Carroll, Ogden Nash, X. J. Kennedy, Willard R. Espy, and Wendy Cope.\n\nSlam poetry is a genre, developed since about 1984, in which performers comment emotively, aloud before an audience, on personal, social, or other matters. It focuses on the aesthetics of word play, intonation, and voice inflection. Slam poetry is often competitive, at dedicated \"poetry slam\" contests.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23475106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23475106", "title": "Richard Dedekind", "text": "Richard Dedekind\n\nJulius Wilhelm Richard Dedekind (6 October 1831 – 12 February 1916) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to abstract algebra (particularly ring theory),\naxiomatic foundation for the natural numbers, algebraic number theory and the definition of the real numbers.\n\nDedekind's father was Julius Levin Ulrich Dedekind, an administrator of Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig. Dedekind had three older siblings. As an adult, he never used the names Julius Wilhelm. He was born, lived most of his life, and died in Braunschweig (often called \"Brunswick\" in English).\n\nHe first attended the Collegium Carolinum in 1848 before transferring to the University of Göttingen in 1850. There, Dedekind was taught number theory by professor Moritz Stern. Gauss was still teaching, although mostly at an elementary level, and Dedekind became his last student. Dedekind received his doctorate in 1852, for a thesis titled \"Über die Theorie der Eulerschen Integrale\" (\"On the Theory of Eulerian integrals\"). This thesis did not display the talent evident by Dedekind's subsequent publications.\n\nAt that time, the University of Berlin, not Göttingen, was the main facility for mathematical research in Germany. Thus Dedekind went to Berlin for two years of study, where he and Bernhard Riemann were contemporaries; they were both awarded the habilitation in 1854. Dedekind returned to Göttingen to teach as a \"Privatdozent\", giving courses on probability and geometry. He studied for a while with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and they became good friends. Because of lingering weaknesses in his mathematical knowledge, he studied elliptic and abelian functions. Yet he was also the first at Göttingen to lecture concerning Galois theory. About this time, he became one of the first people to understand the importance of the notion of groups for algebra and arithmetic.\n\nIn 1858, he began teaching at the Polytechnic school in Zürich (now ETH Zürich). When the Collegium Carolinum was upgraded to a \"Technische Hochschule\" (Institute of Technology) in 1862, Dedekind returned to his native Braunschweig, where he spent the rest of his life, teaching at the Institute. He retired in 1894, but did occasional teaching and continued to publish. He never married, instead living with his sister Julia.\n\nDedekind was elected to the Academies of Berlin (1880) and Rome, and to the French Academy of Sciences (1900). He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Oslo, Zurich, and Braunschweig.\n\nWhile teaching calculus for the first time at the Polytechnic school, Dedekind developed the notion now known as a Dedekind cut (German: \"Schnitt\"), now a standard definition of the real numbers. The idea of a cut is that an irrational number divides the rational numbers into two classes (sets), with all the numbers of one class (greater) being strictly greater than all the numbers of the other (lesser) class. For example, the square root of 2 defines all the nonnegative numbers whose squares are less than 2 and the negative numbers into the lesser class, and the positive numbers whose squares are greater than 2 into the greater class. Every location on the number line continuum contains either a rational or an irrational number. Thus there are no empty locations, gaps, or discontinuities. Dedekind published his thoughts on irrational numbers and Dedekind cuts in his pamphlet \"Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen\" (\"Continuity and irrational numbers\"); in modern terminology, \"Vollständigkeit\", \"completeness\".\n\nDedekind's theorem states that if there existed a one-to-one correspondence between two sets, then the two sets were \"similar\". He invoked similarity to give the first precise definition of an infinite set: a set is infinite when it is \"similar to a proper part of itself,\" in modern terminology, is equinumerous to one of its proper subsets. Thus the set N of natural numbers can be shown to be similar to the subset of N whose members are the squares of every member of N, (N → N):\n\nDedekind edited the collected works of Lejeune Dirichlet, Gauss, and Riemann. Dedekind's study of Lejeune Dirichlet's work led him to his later study of algebraic number fields and ideals. In 1863, he published Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on number theory as \"Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie\" (\"Lectures on Number Theory\") about which it has been written that:\n\nThe 1879 and 1894 editions of the \"Vorlesungen\" included supplements introducing the notion of an ideal, fundamental to ring theory. (The word \"Ring\", introduced later by Hilbert, does not appear in Dedekind's work.) Dedekind defined an ideal as a subset of a set of numbers, composed of algebraic integers that satisfy polynomial equations with integer coefficients. The concept underwent further development in the hands of Hilbert and, especially, of Emmy Noether. Ideals generalize Ernst Eduard Kummer's ideal numbers, devised as part of Kummer's 1843 attempt to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. (Thus Dedekind can be said to have been Kummer's most important disciple.) In an 1882 article, Dedekind and Heinrich Martin Weber applied ideals to Riemann surfaces, giving an algebraic proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem.\n\nIn 1888, he published a short monograph titled \"Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?\" (\"What are numbers and what are they good for?\" Ewald 1996: 790), which included his definition of an infinite set. He also proposed an axiomatic foundation for the natural numbers, whose primitive notions were the number one and the successor function. The next year, Giuseppe Peano, citing Dedekind, formulated an equivalent but simpler set of axioms, now the standard ones.\n\nDedekind made other contributions to algebra. For instance, around 1900, he wrote the first papers on modular lattices. In 1872, while on holiday in Interlaken, Dedekind met Georg Cantor. Thus began an enduring relationship of mutual respect, and Dedekind became one of the very first mathematicians to admire Cantor's work concerning infinite sets, proving a valued ally in Cantor's disputes with Leopold Kronecker, who was philosophically opposed to Cantor's transfinite numbers.\n\nPrimary literature in English:\n\nPrimary literature in German:\n\n\n\nThere is an online bibliography of the secondary literature on Dedekind.

{"id": "1609822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1609822", "title": "Rockism and poptimism", "text": "Rockism and poptimism\n\nRockism is the belief in certain values thought to be intrinsic to rock music, making the genre superior to other forms of popular music. A \"rockist\" may also be someone who regards rock music as the normative state of popular music. Poptimism (or popism) is the belief that pop music is as worthy of professional critique and interest as rock music. Detractors of poptimism describe it as a counterpart of rockism that instead privileges the most famous or best-selling pop, hip-hop, and R&B acts. \n\nMagazines devoted to the serious discussion of popular music first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, with some formative rock critics suggesting that enduring pop music art was made by singer-songwriters using traditional rock instruments on long-playing albums, and that pop hits reside on a lower aesthetic plane as a source of \"guilty pleasure\". The term \"rockism\" was coined in 1981 by English rock musician Pete Wylie and soon became a pejorative used humorously by self-described \"anti-rockist\" critics in the British press. Originally coinciding with the rise of New Pop in the early 1980s, the term was not generally used beyond small music magazines until the mid 2000s, partly due to the increasing number of bloggers who used it more seriously in analytical debate.\n\nIn the 2000s, a critical reassessment of pop music was underway, and by the next decade, poptimism supplanted rockism as the prevailing ideology in popular music criticism. While poptimism was envisioned as the \"antidote\" to rockist attitudes, opponents of its discourse argue that it has resulted in certain pop stars being shielded from negative reviews as part of an effort to maintain a consensus of uncritical excitement. Others argue that the two viewpoints have similar flaws.\n\nUntil the late 1960s, \"pop\" was considered to have the same definition as \"rock\" or \"rock and roll\". From the 1960s to the 1970s, music magazines such as \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Creem\" laid the foundation for popular music criticism in an attempt to make popular music worthy of study. Following the release of the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", such magazines began drawing a contrast between \"pop\" and \"rock\" (with \"rock and roll\" now referring to the 1950s style), creating a division that gave generic significance to both terms.\n\n\"Pop\" became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible. \"Rock\" became associated with a style of music that was usually heavier and centered on the electric guitar. Besides general differences in musical style, the two words became associated with differing values. Many early rock reporters believed that rock embodied a particular set of values, such as rebelliousness, innovation, seriousness, and sociopolitical intent. However, not all critics supported the idea of integrating high culture values into rock music, nor did they all argue for the importance of personal expression. In addition, some believed that such values were merely impositions of the cultural establishment. Nonetheless, a widespread belief among music critics in the 1960s and 1970s was that truly artistic music was made by singer-songwriters using traditional rock instruments on long-playing albums, and that pop hits reside on a lower aesthetic plane, a source of \"guilty pleasure\".\n\n\"Rockism\" was coined in 1981 when English rock musician Pete Wylie announced his Race Against Rockism campaign, an inversion of \"Rock Against Racism\". The term was immediately repurposed as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Former \"NME\" writer Paul Morley recalled: \n\nThere is no widespread consensus for the definition of \"rockism\". During the 1990s, to be a \"rockist\" was defined as demanding a perception of authenticity in pop music despite whatever artifice is needed. In 2004, music critic Kelefa Sanneh offered a definition of rockists: \"[S]omeone who reduces rock 'n' roll to a caricature, then uses that caricature as a weapon. Rockism means idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star; lionizing punk while barely tolerating disco; loving the live show and hating the music video; extolling the growling performer while hating the lip-syncher.\" He further accused rockists of projecting a sexist, racist, and homophobic point of view.\n\n\"Seattle Weekly\"s Douglas Wolk acknowledged the loose definition of rockism and proposed: \"Rockism, let's say, is treating rock as \"normative\". In the rockist view, rock is the \"standard state\" of popular music: the kind to which everything else is compared, explicitly or implicitly.\" \"Popmatters\" Robert Loss wrote that \"traditionalism\" describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for \"rockism\". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists. \n\nIn 2006, as a response to confusion over what the term meant, Morley said that the definition had \"something to do with\" the following five points:\n\nPoptimism (also called popism) is a mode of discourse which holds that pop music deserves the same respect as rock music and is as authentic and as worthy of professional critique and interest. It positions itself as an antidote to rockism and developed following Carl Wilson's book about Céline Dion's album \"Let's Talk About Love\" and Sanneh's 2004 essay against rockism in \"The New York Times\". In the article, Sanneh asks music listeners to \"stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever, as if anything could, and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable, as if that were necessarily a bad thing. Van Morrison's 'Into the Music' was released the same year as the Sugarhill Gang's 'Rapper's Delight'; which do you hear more often?\" Loss cited Sanneh's article as \"a sort of ur-text on poptimism\", elaborating:\n\nAfter Sanneh published his 2004 article, an argument about rockism developed in various web circles. In 2006, music journalist Jody Rosen noted the growing backlash against rock's traditional critical acclaim and the new poptimism ideology. By 2015, \"Washington Post\" writer Chris Richards wrote that, after a decade of \"righteously vanquishing [rockism's] nagging falsehood\", poptimism had become \"the prevailing ideology for today’s most influential music critics. Few would drop this word in conversation at a house party or a nightclub, but in music-journo circles, the idea of poptimism itself is holy writ.\"\n\nIn 2006, Morley derided the seriousness of contemporary music writers: \"Many of the self-proclaimed American anti-rockists—or popists, or poptimists, or pop pricks—actually write with a kind of fussy, self-important rockist sheen. And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been.\" That same year, Rosen spoke positively of the new movement but forewarned of possible excesses; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored. A week later, \"PopMatters\" Rob Horning responded to Rosen's writing with a more negative view of poptimism, writing that it is \"sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it. Basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can make the case for your own importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Quietus\" in 2017, Michael Hann argued that \"the poptimists are just as proscriptive as the rockists\", and listed the following as a few poptimist \"sacred cows, which are beyond challenge\":\n\n\nAccording to Loss, rockism and poptimism are ultimately the same thing, and both rockists and poptimists treat music as a social commodity while mystifying the conditions in which music occurs. He adds that, as is common in \"a culture wherein history isn't valued much\", poptimism neglects its historical precedents. As it presents itself as a radical break in the discourse of popular culture, older rock critics and journalists are usually depicted as \"a bunch of bricklayers for the foundations of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\", a notion that Loss disputes: \"Like film studies, rock criticism of the late '60s and the '70s was an attempt to make popular music worthy of study; it was poptimism before its day. It's somehow become generally accepted that rock criticism before the new millennium was overwhelmingly rockist.\"\n\nAfter the 2000s, the effects of poptimism attracted a belief that once a pop star reaches a certain level of stardom, many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews. Richards argued that poptimism cheerleads the already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent. \"New York Times Magazine\"s Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of click-driven internet journalism that aspired to the lowest common denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and film critics. Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: \"When [he] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' I imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, \"Don't tell them that!\" We like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that it never was in the first place.\" He also noted a minuscule number of lowly-rated albums in publications such as \"Rolling Stone\", \"Pitchfork\", and \"PopMatters\", and that \"telling consumers what to purchase is still the point of a lot of music 'criticism'.\"\n\nHann says that when writers deal with \"upmarket\" readership, they \"need to be able to justify your coverage, and that [means] thinkpieces hailing the cultural significance of the new pop stars. ... And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, you know what? This isn't much cop.'\" He recalls his experience as music editor for \"The Guardian\", where he has \"been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted to read about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society.\"\n\n\"Flavorwire\"s Elisabeth Donnely said that literary criticism \"needs a poptimist revolution\" in order to understand current literary phenomena such as \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and better connect with the reading audience. In 2015, \"Salon\" published an article subtitled \"Book criticism needs a poptimist revolution to take down the genre snobs\", in which Rachel Kramer Bussell argued that book critics ignore often very good work and alienate readers by focusing only on genres considered \"literary\". \n\nWriting for \"Salon\" in 2016, Scott Timberg commented on critics giving more respect to celebrity chef Guy Fieri, saying \"Love or hate what is called poptimism, the impulse seems to be coming to food and restaurant criticism\". Timberg likened food critics' \"'in defense of [Fieri]' movement\" to rock critics who \"began writing apologias for Billy Joel and composed learned deconstructions of Britney Spears\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3009731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3009731", "title": "Sensei", "text": "Sensei\n\nSensei (can be pronounced \"Sensai\" as well), Sinsang, Sonsaeng, Seonsaeng or Xiansheng () is an honorific term shared in Chinese honorifics and Japanese honorifics that is translated as \"person born before another\" or \"one who comes before\". In general usage, it is used, with proper form, after a person's name, and means \"teacher\"; the word is also used as a title to refer to or address other professionals or persons of authority, such as clergy, accountants, lawyers, physicians, and politicians, or to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, e.g., accomplished novelists, musicians, artists and martial artists.\n\nThe two characters that make up the term can be directly translated as \"born before\" and imply one who teaches based on wisdom from age and experience.\n\nThe word prefaced by the adjective 大, pronounced \"dai\" (or \"ō\"), which means \"great\" or \"large\", is often translated \"grand master\". This compound term, \"dai-sensei\", is sometimes used to refer to the top sensei in a particular school or tradition, particularly within the iemoto system. For a more senior member of a group who has not achieved the level of sensei, the term is used – note the common use of 先 \"before\"; in martial arts, this is particularly used for the most senior non-sensei member.\n\nThe Japanese expression of 'sensei' shares the same characters as the Chinese word 先生, pronounced \"xiānshēng\" in Standard Chinese. Xiansheng was a courtesy title for a man of respected stature. Middle Chinese pronunciation of this term may have been * or *. In modern Standard Chinese, it is used in the same way as the title \"Mr.\" Prior to the development of the modern vernacular, \"xiansheng\" was used to address teachers of both genders; this has fallen out of usage in Standard Chinese, though it is retained in some southern Chinese Chinese varieties such as Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew and Hakka, where it still has the meaning \"teacher\" or \"doctor\". In Japanese, \"sensei\" is still used to address people of both genders. It is likely both the current Southern Chinese and Japanese usages are more reflective of its Middle Chinese etymology.\n\nIn Sanbo Kyodan related zen schools, \"sensei\" is used to refer to ordained teachers below the rank of rōshi. However, other schools of Buddhism in Japan use the term for any priest regardless of seniority; for example, this title is also used for Jōdo Shinshū ministers in the United States, whether they are ethnic Japanese or not.

Some of the earliest literary references to the \"three teachings\" idea dates back to the 6th century by prominent Chinese scholars of the time. The term may also refer to a non-religious philosophy built on that aggregation.\n\nThe phrase also appears as the \"three teachings harmonious as one\" (). It can also refer to a syncretic sect founded during the Ming Dynasty by Lin Zhaoen. In that sect Sanyi Religion, Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist beliefs were combined based on their usefulness in self-cultivation.\n\nAlternatively, in common understanding, \"three teachings harmonious as one\" simply reflects the long history, mutual influence, and (at times) complementary teachings of the three belief systems, with little relationship to Lin Zhaoen's sect.\n\nConfucianism is a complex school of thought, sometimes also referred to as a religion, revolving around the principles of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. It was developed in the Spring and Autumn Period during the Zhou Dynasty. Main concepts of this philosophy include Ru (humaneness), righteousness, propriety/etiquette, loyalty, and filial piety, along with a strict adherence to social roles. This is illustrated through the five main relationships Confucius interpreted to be the core of society: ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder brother-younger brother, and friend-friend. In these bonds, the latter must pay respect to and serve the former, while the former is bound to care for the latter.\n\nThe following quotation is from the \"Analects\", a compilation of Confucius' sayings and teachings, written after his death by his disciples. \n\"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease.\" \n— Confucius, The Analects of Confucius\n\nThis quotation exemplifies Confucius' idea of the junzi (Chinese: 君子) or gentleman. Originally this expression referred to \"the son of a ruler\", but Confucius redefined this concept to mean behavior (in terms of ethics and values such as loyalty and righteousness) instead of mere social status.\n\nTaoism, or Daoism, is a philosophy centered on the belief that life is normally happy, but should be lived with balance and virtue. Its origin can be traced back to the late 4th century B.C and the main thinkers representative of this teaching are Laozi and Zhuangzi. Key components of Daoism are Dao (the Way) and immortality, along with a stress on balance found throughout nature. There is less emphasis on extremes and instead focuses on the interdependence between things. For example, the yin/yang symbol does not exemplify good or evil. It shows that there are two sides to everything -\"Within the Yang there exists the Yin and vice versa.\" \n\nThe basis of Taoist philosophy is the idea of \"wu wei\", often translated as \"not doing\". But, in practice, it refers to an in-between state of \"not doing\" and \"being, but not acting\". This concept also overlaps with an idea in Confucianism as Confucius similarly believed that a perfect sage could rule without taking action. Two other assumptions in the Taoist system are 1) any extreme action can initiate a counteraction of equal extremity and 2) excessive government can become tyrannical and unjust, even government created with good intentions.\n\nThe following is a quote from the Dao De Jing, one of the main texts in Daoist teachings. \n\"The truth is not always beautiful, nor beautiful words the truth.\" \n― Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching (Dao De Jing)\n\nBuddhism is a religion that is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama. The main principles of this belief system are karma, reincarnation, and impermanence. Buddhists believe that life is full of suffering, but that suffering can be overcome by attaining enlightenment. Nirvana (a state of perfect happiness) can be obtained by breaking away from (material) attachments and purifying the mind. However, different doctrines vary on the practices and paths followed in order to do so. \nMeditation serves as a significant part in practicing Buddhism. This calming and working of the mind helps Buddhists strive to become more peaceful and positive, while developing wisdom through solving everyday problems. The negative mental states that are sought to be overcome are called \"delusions\", while the positive mental states are called \"virtuous minds\".\nAnother concept prominent in the Buddhist belief system is the Eight-Fold Path. The Eight-Fold Path is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths, which is said to be the first of all Buddha’s teachings. It stresses areas in life that can be explored and practice, such as right speech and right intention.\n\nThough the term \"three teachings\" is often focused on how well Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism have been able to coexist in harmony throughout Chinese history, evidence has shown that each practice has dominated, or risen to favor, during certain periods of time. Emperors would choose to follow one specific system and the others were discriminated against, or tolerated at most. An example of this would be the Song Dynasty, in which both Buddhism and Taoism became less popular. Neo-Confucianism (which had re-emerged during the previous Tang Dynasty) was followed as the dominant philosophy.\nA minority also claims that the phrase \"three teachings\" proposes that these mutually exclusive and fundamentally incomparable teachings are equal. This is a contested point of view as others stress that it is not so. Confucianism focuses on societal rules and moral values, whereas Taoism advocates simplicity and living happily while in tune with nature. On the other hand, Buddhism reiterates the ideas of suffering, impermanence of material items, and reincarnation while stressing the idea of reaching salvation beyond.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25030863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25030863", "title": "Threshold host density", "text": "Threshold host density\n\nThreshold host density (N), in the context of wildlife disease ecology, refers to the concentration of a population of a particular organism as it relates to disease. Specifically, the threshold host density (N) of a species refers to the minimum concentration of individuals necessary to sustain a given disease within a population.\n\nThreshold host density (N) only applies to density dependent diseases, where there is an \"aggregation of risk\" to the host in either high host density or low host density patches. When low host density causes an increase in incidence of parasitism or disease, this is known as inverse host density dependence, whereas when incidence of parasitism or disease is elevated in high host density conditions, it is known as direct host density dependence.\n\nHost density independent diseases show no correlation between the concentration of a given host population and the incidence of a particular disease. Some examples of host density independent diseases are sexually transmitted diseases in both humans and other animals. This is due to the constant incidence of interaction observed in sexually transmitted diseases—even if there are only 20 individuals left of a given population, survival of the species requires sexual contact, and continued spread of the disease.\n\nDensity dependent diseases are significantly less likely to cause extinction of a population, as the natural course of disease will bring down the density, and thus the propinquity of individuals in the population. In other words, less individuals—as caused by disease—means lower infection rates and a population equilibrium.\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the direct relationship between disease spread through contact and population density. As the population density increases, so do transmission events between individuals.\n\nThere is a rapid initial increase in disease transmission as the population increases from zero, and then the plateau of transmission throughout most of the graph. As sexual contact is required in nearly all sexually reproducing species, transmission is not very host density dependent. It is only in cases of near-extinction where sexually transmitted diseases show any dependence on host density. It is for this reason that sexually transmitted diseases are more likely than density dependent diseases to cause extinction.\n\nThis graph shows the relationship between population density and the transmission of vector-borne disease. Initially, the number of contacts between individuals and vectors increases as population density increases. Eventually, however, the advantage of host density diminishes as the density becomes too great for the vector to maintain its natural ecological relationship with the host, and transmission decreases.\n\n\n"}

He received his LL.B. from Yale in 1923. He retired from Yale in 1961 to become dean of the University of Miami School of Law. He was a prominent figure in Yale's Legal Realism movement. In his article (with Samuel Clark), \"Legal Theory and Real Property Mortgages\", 37 Yale L. J. 691 (1928), he sought to make the Legal Realist point that doctrinal distinctions between \"lien theory\" and \"title theory\" did not have any actual effect on how courts ruled in litigation about mortgage disputes. His casebook, \"Cases and Materials on the Law of Credit Transactions\", emphasized the contradictions in judicial decision-making and sought to dispel the view that \"what judges said in one case with its setting can be used to [predict] what they will decide in another case\" with a different factual setting.\n\nFrom 22 Oct 1938, Sturges fulfilled the role of Executive Director of the Distilled Spirits Institute and gave evidence to the US Congress Investigation of Concentration of Economic Power (Parts 6-8 Liquor Industry) between 14 and 17 March 1939. As 'czar' of the nation's distilled liquor industry, Sturges drew up a code of practice to reform commercial practices, maintain an open competitive market, to end the system of secret rebates and other corner-cutting dodges, and to balance the field between larger and smaller operations.\n\nAfter he stepped down from the deanship, Sturges taught only three courses, annually in rotation, one semester each year—arbitration, real-property credit transactions, and chattel credit transactions. Using an advanced form of the Socratic method, he sought in these courses to teach students rhetoric and advocacy rather than substantive law—what he termed \"learning to stand up on your hind legs and make noises like a lawyer.\" He was famous at Yale for his technique of calling upon a student to recite what a case held, asking him whether he agreed or disagreed with the court's ruling, and regardless of how the student replied, slowly forcing him by pointing out difficulties in that position, to adopt the contrary view, whereupon Sturges would by the same technique then argue the student back to conceding the validity of his original position. The point was to teach students both how to make noises like a lawyer and not to get led down the primrose path by an adversary.\n\nProfessor Grant Gilmore said of Wesley Sturges:\n\nWhat did Wesley teach us?...He taught us forever to be on our guard against the slippery generality, the received principle, the authoritative proposition. He taught us to trust no one's judgment except our own--and not to be too sure of that. He taught us how to live by our wits. He taught us, in a word, how to be lawyers.\n\nProfessor Ralph S. Brown said of Sturges:\n\nSturges was the most compelling teacher of my time. He was just a master of the Socratic method. You never knew what ball was under that shell. . . .\n"}

{"id": "1278599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1278599", "title": "Yehuda Ashlag", "text": "Yehuda Ashlag\n\nRabbi Yehuda Ashlag (1885–1954) or Yehuda Leib Ha-Levi Ashlag (), also known as the Baal Ha-Sulam (Hebrew: , \"Author of the Ladder\") in reference to his magnum opus, was an orthodox rabbi and kabbalist born in Łódź, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, to a family of scholars connected to the Hasidic courts of Porisov and Belz. Rabbi Ashlag lived in the Holy Land from 1922 until his death in 1954 (except for two years in England). In addition to his \"Sulam\" commentary on the Zohar, his other primary work, \"Talmud Eser Sefirot\" is regarded as the central textbook for students of Kabbalah. Ashlag systematically interpreted the wisdom and promoted its wide dissemination. In line with his directives, many contemporary adherents of Ashlag’s teachings strive to spread Kabbalah to the masses.\n\nAshlag reputedly studied Kabbalah from the age of seven, hiding pages from the book \"Etz Chaim\" (\"The Tree of Life\") of Isaac Luria (also known as the \"Arizal\") in the Talmudic tractate he was meant to be studying. At the age of twelve, he studied the Talmud independently. By nineteen, Ashlag’s knowledge of the Torah was profound enough for the rabbis of Warsaw to confer upon him the title of rabbi. During this period he worked as a judge in the court of the Warsaw rabbis and also gained experience as a teacher for training judges for Jewish courts. Ashlag also studied German while in Warsaw, and read original texts of Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer.\n\nWhile still in Poland, he met an unidentified Warsaw merchant, who revealed himself to Ashlag as a Kabbalist. Ashlag studied with this particular teacher every night for three months, he said, “until my arrogance separated us,” and the teacher disappeared. A few months later Ashlag met the teacher again, and after pleading with him, convinced him to reveal an important kabbalistic secret. The next day, the teacher died.\n\nIn 1921, at the age of 36, Ashlag made the decision to emigrate to the Land of Israel, a journey that took several months. He spent the first few years living anonymously, supporting his family through manual labor by day and writing his commentaries at night. Eventually, he was recognized through his work, and was appointed Rabbi of Givat Shaul, Jerusalem in 1924.\n\nAshlag was friendly with the Kabbalist and Chief Rabbi of the British Mandate of Palestine, Rabbi Abraham Kook, who recognized Ashlag as a great follower of Isaac Luria. Ashlag had high hopes of meeting great Kabbalists in Jerusalem including the Sephardi followers of the great 18th century Yemenite Jewish Kabbalist \"Sar Shalom Sharabi\". However, he was profoundly disappointed by his encounter with them. Their views about Kabbalah ran contrary to Ashlag’s experience with the teaching as a means of profound personal transformation and spiritual illumination, by becoming a vessel for divine light.\n\nIn 1926 Ashlag left for London, and it was there that he wrote his commentary on Isaac Luria's book \"Etz Chaim\" (\"The Tree of Life\"). This work is entitled \"Panim Meirot Umasbirot\". It took him one and a half years to complete this work. It was published in 1927, and in 1928 Ashlag returned to the British Mandate of Palestine.\n\nIn 1932 Ashlag and his family moved to Jaffa. During this period, Ashlag also began one of his main works, \"Talmud Eser Sefirot\", a commentary on all the writings of Isaac Luria. In this undertaking, he developed a comprehensive explanation of the sequence of the creation of all of the upper worlds (\"Olamot Elyonim\"), starting with the source of emanation (\"Ma'atzil\") and finishing with our world (\"Olam HaZeh\"). The work is divided into six volumes, containing sixteen parts and over two thousand pages. Some today consider it as the core of the entire teaching of Kabbalah.\n\nIn the 1930s Ashlag, now in his fifties, gathered around him a group of disciples, including Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, his closest student, and studied Kabbalah every night, often from shortly after midnight until dawn. He also composed many articles and letters at this time that openly promoted the study of Kabbalah on a mass scale. Ashlag went to great lengths to publish Kabbalistic material, in mediums suitable for disseminating the knowledge he had acquired across the entire nation. He began an independent Kabbalistic newsletter publication, “HaUma” (“The Nation”), of which only one issue survived. Its contents present Ashlag's analytical depths of using knowledge he had attained in Kabbalah to illuminate the cause of political and social problems in human egoism; giving reasons why communism was destined to fail, and offering solutions for correcting the property of human egoism through his teaching method of Kabbalah.\nAshlag differs fundamentally from all Kabbalists of the past, who studied and taught Kabbalah in a concealed manner, in that he felt a great need to reveal and clarify the teaching of Kabbalah to the masses. This was because he saw that the evil inclination in people (human egoism) would rise to an altogether new height in this era of humanity, causing an altogether new era of internal suffering felt as a meaningless and confused existence.\n\nIn 1943, Ashlag moved to Tel Aviv, and there began working on his book, \"HaSulam\" (\"The Ladder\"), a collection of commentaries on \"The Zohar\". During this period, he wrote for eighteen hours a day, and due to a lack of money he was not able to afford a sufficient amount of paper and ink to write more precise explanations. He later said that if it had been within his capabilities, he would have written a full commentary on \"The Zohar\" in two-hundred volumes, but he was unable to begin the work only because of a lack of means.\n\nHe completed this work in 1953, and later added three more volumes. Rav Ashlag's closest student Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein later finished the work by adding this three volumes called Tikkunei HaZohar \"Maalot Hasulam\". In honor of the completion of the entire work, his students organized a big feast in Meron, where Ashlag gave the speech that is today printed under the title “Maamar LeSiyum HaZohar” (“An Article for the Completion of the Zohar,” also known as “Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar”). Yehuda Ashlag died on the day of Yom Kippur in 1954. He was buried on cemetery Har HaMenuchot located in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem, Israel.\n\nRabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein a direct descendent of the famous first Admor of Stretin, Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi of Stretin, was a foremost disciple of Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.\n\nRabbi Brandwein was one of the first Jewish settlers within the Old City of Jerusalem after the Six Day War.\n\nRabbi Yehuda Zvi Brandwein ran a religious school in Jerusalem called Yeshiva Kol Yehudah, founded in 1922 by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. For a while he also served as the chief rabbi for the Histadrut - the Israeli labor union, using his position to bring many secular Israelis back to Judaism.\n\nAshlag wrote and published two major works. The first, \"Talmud Eser Sefirot\" is a complete re-editing and commentary to the works of 16th century Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria. This is a comprehensive exposition of the system of the upper worlds, \"Partzufim\" and \"Sefirot\", in the scientific language of Kabbalah which was developed by Luria.\n\nAs a core Kabbalistic text, it is especially unique in its utmost precision to detail to the structural organization and processes occurring in the upper worlds. It is set out as a comprehensive textbook, complete with commentaries, a section in each chapter dedicated to further reflection upon the commentaries, definitions of terms, tables of questions and answers, an introduction clarifying how to study Kabbalah in the correct manner, and also a summarized preface of the entire text.\n\nHis other masterwork was his \"Sulam commentary on The Zohar\", which earned him the name “Baal HaSulam”. This monumental work took him ten years to complete, written between the years 1943 and 1953. It includes a translation of \"The Zohar\" from Aramaic to Hebrew as well as an extensive interpretation.\n\nRabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein was a foremost disciple of Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.\n\nAnother publication is the notebook of Yehuda Ashlag’s son and disciple, Baruch Ashlag. His notebook, entitled \"Shamati\" (\"I Heard\"]), contains over two hundred articles which were copied down from lessons and talks with his father. Baruch Ashlag kept this notebook with him in secret, until he was on his deathbed, in 1991. It was later published in Hebrew and has been translated into many different languages. The articles in \"Shamati\" form a unique kabbalistic work in their emotional depth of capturing the inner processes that a Kabbalist goes through on the path of spiritual attainment.\n\n\nAshlag’s commentary offered a systematic interpretation of the legacy of the Isaac Luria. This was the first since the 18th century when the Baal Shem Tov, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (Ramchal), the Vilna Gaon and \"Sar Shalom Sharabi\" (the Rashash) offered their interpretation of the Luria's teaching. Ashlag’s system focused on the transformation of human consciousness from the \"desire to receive\" to the \"desire to give,\" i.e., from egocentricity to altruism. This path of transformation is described in Lurianic Kabbalah.\n\nAshlag stated that the purpose of studying Kabbalah is equal to the purpose of why human beings were created, and that through its study, a person is capable of revealing the entirety of processes and structures that have taken place in the creation of the universe.\n\n\"Equivalence of form\" with this source means having the same attributes or qualities as it, and Ashlag defines the qualities of this source as being altruistic, namely the desire to give, or in Ashlag's words, the \"will to bestow\" (\"Ratzon LeHashpia\").\n\nThrough intensive study of Kabbalah, a person's desire to give to others is developed in relation to this goal. Ashlag believed that the coming of the Messiah meant that humans would attain this quality which would allow them to give up their selfishness and devote themselves to loving each other for the sake of life's purpose, as stated in the commandment \"love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\n\nAshlag had strong political opinions, believing in a religious version of libertarian communism, based on principles of Kabbalah. Though his anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist ideas show some Marxist influence, he strongly opposed communism instituted by force and believed in \"developing a community based on love between its members and a society founded on economic justice.\" He supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually “annul the brute-force regime completely, for ‘every man did that which was right in his own eyes.’”, because “there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government”.\n\nThe Or HaGanuz community of Northern Israel is based on the principles of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag, and is led by Rabbi Mordechai Sheinberger, a prominent contemporary teacher of Rabbi Ashlag's kabbalistic system.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Hindu Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad gita, ānanda signifies eternal bliss which accompanies the ending of the rebirth cycle. Those who renounce the fruits of their actions and submit themselves completely to the divine will, arrive at the final termination of the cyclical life process (\"saṃsāra\") to enjoy eternal bliss (\"ānanda\") in perfect union with the godhead. The tradition of seeking union with God through passionate commitment is referred to as \"bhakti\", or devotion. \n\nSwami Vivekananda has claimed that the reason different meanings of \"ānanda\" and different ways of achieving it are present in Hindu philosophy is that humans differ from each other, and each chooses the most appropriate path to \"ānanda\" for him or herself.\n\nAccording to Sri Aurobindo, happiness is the natural state of humanity, as he mentions in his book The Life Divine he informs about it as delight of existence. However, mankind develops dualities of pain and pleasure. Aurobindo goes on to say that the concepts of pain and suffering are due to habits developed over time by the mind, which treats success, honour and victory as pleasant things and defeat, failure, misfortune as unpleasant things.\n\nAccording to the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, \"ananda\" is that state of sublime delight when the jiva becomes free from all sins, all doubts, all desires, all actions, all pains, all sufferings and also all physical and mental ordinary pleasures. Having become established in Brahman it becomes jivanmukta (a being free from the cycle of rebirth). The Upanishads repeatedly use the word \"Ānanda\" to denote Brahman, the innermost Self, the Blissful One, who unlike the individual Self has no real attachments.\n\nBased on a reading of the Bhagavad Gita, Dvaita vedanta interprets \"ananda\" as happiness derived via good thoughts and good deeds that depend on the state and on the control of the mind. Through evenness of temper and mind, the state of supreme bliss is reached in all aspects of one’s life.\n\nAccording to the Vishishtadvaita vedanta school which was proposed by Ramanujacharya, true happiness can be only through divine grace, which can be only achieved by surrender of one's ego to the Divine.\n\nAccording to Ramana Maharshi, happiness is within and can be known only through discovering one's true self. He proposes that \"ananda\" can be attained by inner enquiry, using the thought \"Who am I?\"\n\nWithin the various schools of Hindu thought, there are different paths and ways of achieving Happiness. The main four paths are Bhakti yoga, Jnana yoga, Karma Yoga and Raja Yoga.\n\n"}
